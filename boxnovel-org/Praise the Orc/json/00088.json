I won\u2019t forget your help. I will send messengers to Nameragon and Spinoa.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Nadia\u2019s expression was somewhat disturbed as she spoke.\u00a0</span><span>It was due to the dark elf standing with them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is the first time I\u2019m leaving Nuridot. I\u2019m really excited.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor joined Crockta and Tiyo\u2019s party.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>He had awakened the power of a necromancer that his mother had left him. At the same time, his identity as a dark elf was thrown away.\u00a0</span><span>He released everything that had accumulated in the meantime. A person who gave up being a dark elf, that was Anor.</span></p><br/><p><span>There was also the tragedy that occurred at the town hall.\u00a0</span><span>As he left the hall, he took the orcs that infiltrated the town and turned them into his puppets.\u00a0</span><span>However, he deliberately didn\u2019t kill some orc warriors. He left alone through the barrier outside the town.</span></p><br/><p><span>The surviving orcs once again attacked the town hall.\u00a0</span><span>The dark elves had to fight against the orc warriors themselves.</span></p><br/><p><span>Using the advantage of numbers, they were able to overpower the orcs. However, the fact that the orcs were an elite tribe warriors while the dark elves were people unfamiliar with fighting still held true. Multiple lives were given up in exchange for their resistance. Countless casualties had occurred.</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor just shrugged when questioned about this.\u00a0</span><span>Perhaps it was a bonus.</span></p><br/><p><span>Nadia knew that he had been persecuted due to being a dark elf and his dead mother having the bloodline of a necromancer, so she couldn\u2019t blame him. She was also complicit.\u00a0</span><span>Of course, the other dark elves didn\u2019t think so. The object of dislike had turned into hatred. In particular, those who lost family members in the town hall wanted to jump at Anor.</span></p><br/><p><span>Nadia spoke to Anor, \u201cAnor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Well, sh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Take care of yourself.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ba... no, no, yes. Well...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The shock from the hall had been so great that profanity was an automatic reflex.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen we will be going. Stay alive. Bul\u2019tar!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTake care. Don\u2019t discriminate against other species <em>dot</em>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo said their final words. Nadia nodded.\u00a0</span><span>Anor just nodded instead of saying goodbye. Then they turned around.\u00a0</span><span>For the man who had been persecuted for life in Nuridot, this was his first time leaving for the outside world.</span></p><br/><p><span>Nadia prayed to the gods as she watched them walk away.</span></p><br/><p><span>The honorable orc, Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>The cute but macho Tiyo.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Anor, is this the first time you\u2019re leaving Nuridot? Kiki, aren\u2019t you a hillbilly?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis crazy dwarf...ah no...I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Were you going to curse me just then </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m not sure... why do I keep doing this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis bastard! Come here!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>In addition, the dark elf who reflexively cursed, Anor. </span><span>Nadia could feel that these three were the key to the future of the north.\u00a0</span><span>But when she saw Tiyo hitting Anor, she started to become worried about the future of the north.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"God help them.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>And protect our dark elves from the mad chieftain.\u00a0</span><span>Nadia once again prayed.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta, Tiyo, and Anor built up a reputation for helping the dark elves in trouble as they headed towards Nameragon. Now the dark elves in the north started to know their names.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It would be good if Third Dragon was also together with us,\u201d Anor touched his necklace as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span>He had buried Third Dragon at Nuridot Forest. Then he made the necklace out of one of Third Dragon\u2019s teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"By the way, when are we arriving in Nameragon?\u201d Anor asked. </span></p><br/><p><span>He was a dark elf, but he knew nothing about the geography of the north. Crockta checked on the map.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We will arrive at Nameragon once we cross this mountain.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There was a high mountain in front of them. It would take too long to go around. In addition, there was something unique about it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If we try to cross this mountain... we\u2019ll have to go through the Black Forest.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBlack Forest?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. There is no explanation about why it is called the Black Forest.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta checked the map again before putting it away. It was a map of the north that he received from Nadia. It was much more detailed than the previous one.\u00a0</span><span>According to the map, it would take a day or two to reach Nameragon.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The Black Forest?\" suddenly asked Anor.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Why, do you know it</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019ve heard about it. It\u2019s said that the Black Forest is dark...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Is that it?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Anor adjusted his ears. He looked up at the sky like he was recalling a distant memory.\u00a0</span><span>\"It\u2019s said that a hermit lives in the Black Forest.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A hermit?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. He used to appear in the past, but I think he has been hiding lately... I don\u2019t know the details. That is the only thing I remember about the Black Forest.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Hermit of the Black Forest, it was a very romantic name.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWon't it be interesting?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That\u2019s right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grinned. In the world of Elder Lord, a new adventure would begin once one ended. The Black Forest was waiting for them.</span></p><br/><p><span>[It is hard to meet the hermit of the Black Forest.]</span></p><br/><p><span>The system message resurfaced after a long time.\u00a0</span><span>Was there going to be a quest to find the hermit?</span></p><br/><p><span>[He has a mighty power and is friendly to anyone. If you meet him, you will be able to get his help.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[The meeting itself is a reward, so there will be no reward for finding him.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta frowned.</span></p><br/><p><span>[But I prepared a small quest for your hard work in finding the hermit.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[The hermit of the Black Forest isn\u2019t a human, elf, orc or gnome.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[If you meet him and please him, you will be given a new skill.]</span></p><br/><p><span>He didn\u2019t understand but there were more reasons to meet the hermit of the Black Forest.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Heh, another adventure is waiting for me dot. Hey, foul-mouthed person!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019m not a foul-mouthed person!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t lie.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019m really not...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Foul-mouthed person, do you want to make a bet? Who will find the hermit of the Black Forest first </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then Tiyo started running towards the mountain, Anor followed after him. Crockta quickly trailed after them.\u00a0</span><span>They reached the Black Forest in an instant.\u00a0</span><span>And at the very beginning of the forest...</span></p><br/><p><span>They met an ogre.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...Heok, heok.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo was catching his breath from running up the steep mountain. A gigantic mass was sitting in front of them. Tiyo started trembling.\u00a0</span><span>\"Wow, is that guy the hermit?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI-I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The message window said that the hermit of the Black Forest wasn\u2019t a human, elf, gnome, or orc. If so, maybe he was an ogre.\u00a0</span><span>The ogre was doing something. It slowly turned its head.\u00a0</span><span>There was blood around the ogre\u2019s mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGrrr.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The eyes of the ogre became ferocious as it found its targets.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like it </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The ogre got up, with the body of the bear it had been eating was at its feet.\u00a0</span><span>In the real world, bears were dominant predators but in the world of Elder Lord, they were just snacks for ogres.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta pulled out his greatsword. Anor was still reluctant to use the power of a necromancer, so he was forced to step behind.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Anor, please step back. I am going to solve this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs it okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta smiled instead of answering.\u00a0</span><span>Of course, the ogre was a powerful monster.\u00a0</span><span>Organized troops were required to defeat it.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta had met a group of ogres at Quantes and had barely defeated them with the support of the gnomes garrison.</span></p><br/><p><span>But now it was different. Crockta was no longer an ordinary warrior.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Huhu, Crockta\u2019s abilities can\u2019t be ignored.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo folded his arms and settled in to watch Crockta fight.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta prided himself on his skills and lifted the greatsword.</span></p><br/><p><span>The ogre approached Crockta with a distorted face. The ground shook wildly with every step. This was the power of an ogre. However, it wouldn\u2019t be a big battle.\u00a0</span><span>Now his greatsword could be freely manipulated as it headed towards the ogre.</span></p><br/><p><span>Take a look, Black Forest. Hermit of the Black Forest.\u00a0</span><span>His greatsword would kill this ogre, just like its name.\u00a0</span><span>No one could stop him!</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Bul\u2019tarrrr!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta ran forward\u00a0</span><span>The ogre\u2019s fist flew.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta grinned. And...</span></p><br/><p><span>He was hit by the fist.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCough!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta flew through the air towards the spot where he had jumped.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Cheolbudok!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>It was a psychological shock, as well as a physical one. Crockta couldn\u2019t stand up for a while.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo sighed, \"Should I be laughing or worried...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta curled up from the pain caused by those words.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGrrr...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The ogre was approaching them. Tiyo lifted General. Crockta got back up.\u00a0</span><span>He raised his hand to stop Tiyo.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis is my fight.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Are you okay </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I just made a mistake.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta once again raised Ogre Slayer.\u00a0</span><span>This was a fight for his pride. Crockta vowed to end the ogre as he rushed forward.\u00a0</span><span>The ogre grabbed a club and confronted Crockta. The two weapons met. It was a tremendous force.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta pretended to lure the ogre into a power struggle, then turned to destroy the ogre\u2019s balance. Then he stabbed into a gap.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuweeeoooh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>However, the ogre\u2019s kick was also heading towards Crockta\u2019s abdomen. It was a quick reaction rate.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s sword sliced the ogre\u2019s side while the ogre kicked Crockta\u2019s abdomen. Both of them stepped back at the same time.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...Hoo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta raised his greatsword.</span></p><br/><p><span>This ogre was different from the ones he met before. The movements were fast and contained techniques. It was much more efficient than the ogres who only fought ignorantly with strength. It was like an ogre who learned martial arts.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s eyes became cautious.\u00a0</span><span>It was also the same for the ogre. It thought of Crockta as a plain orc, but it realized that this orc was different from the others. The strength and skills exceeded the orcs that it knew.</span></p><br/><p><span>Furthermore, the orc cut its skin. It meant that the orc\u2019s swordsmanship had at least reached the pinnacle level.</span></p><br/><p><span>The two look at each other and laughed.\u00a0</span><span>They had met a rival here.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow interesting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGrrr...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The two collided again.</span></p><br/><p><span>The blade swept past the nose. The club slid over the head. Both of their attacks missed each other by a hair. If Crockta tried to cut the neck, the club would aim for the abdomen. If he tried to stab the leg, the club would aim for his head. The fierce fighting continued.</span></p><br/><p><span>He hadn\u2019t expected to have such a high-level confrontation with an ogre.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grinned. The ogre also smiled.\u00a0</span><span>Then they wielded their weapons towards each other again.</span></p><br/><p><span>Leyteno\u2019s Greatsword Technique passed by the club, the tip of the sword moving like a snake. It was a movement difficult to imagine for a greatsword.\u00a0</span><span>Its target was the heart of the ogre.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The ogre also showed unpredictable movements for its size. It twisted its body and avoided the tip of the sword. It lifted a hand from the club and swung it at Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>An unexpected blow.\u00a0</span><span>At that moment, Crockta moved his greatsword.</span></p><br/><p><span>He grabbed the ogre\u2019s massive arm and pulled it. He used inertia to throw the ogre\u2019s body. The ogre lost its balance and fell due to Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOhhhhhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The giant ogre that was double Crockta\u2019s size.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta threw the huge body down.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kuuong!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Due to the big size, the ogre\u2019s head immediately bumped against the ground. It was also against hard rocks.\u00a0</span><span>Blood spilled from the ogre\u2019s head and it lost consciousness.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta took a deep breath.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHoo...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he raised his right hand.\u00a0</span><span>A posture of victory.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo and Anor clapped.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It was a tremendous battle and that ogre is very good </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It was incredible. Furthermore, you won against an ogre!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta held Ogre Slayer.\u00a0</span><span>Then he looked down at the unconscious ogre.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta placed Ogre Slayer on his back.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Just go.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>For some reason, he didn\u2019t want to kill this ogre.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo nodded in agreement at the manly sensibility.\u00a0</span><span>\"Huhu, he felt it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cFelt what?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Anor was confused. Tiyo slapped Anor\u2019s back and said, \"A man\u2019s sympathy </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor was confused. Tiyo clicked his tongue at Anor\u2019s expression.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou won\u2019t understand...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, Anor was filled with the desire to curse Tiyo.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You, you just wanted to curse, right? Isn\u2019t that right? Isn\u2019t it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...No.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You are an elf with a double personality!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ah, no!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ehehe. Try swearing. Where is it? Try it </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShit...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They left the ogre and headed deeper into the Black Forest.\u00a0</span><span>This time they met a goblin.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblin was sitting on a rock with a zen-like expression. Crockta\u2019s group stopped and the goblin slowly opened his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>His eyes were filled with giddiness.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKieeeek.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblin rose from his spot.\u00a0</span><span>A short bow was held in his hand. He loaded an arrow and aimed it at Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...It is my turn </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo stepped forward, holding General in his hands.\u00a0</span><span>The goblin and gnome\u2019s eyes met.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo cried out,\u00a0</span><span>\"This forest, it is interesting!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo raised General. At that moment, the goblin\u2019s arrow flew towards Tiyo\u2019s head. Tiyo avoided the attack by rolling on the floor. Then he immediately retaliated.\u00a0</span><span>General\u2019s bullets flew towards the goblin.</span></p><br/><p><span>His target was the goblin\u2019s head.\u00a0</span><span>However, the goblin just moved his head and avoided the attack.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblin grinned and said, \u201cIt is still insufficient.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You have no heart in your attack </span><i><span>kyak</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a goblin who knew how to speak the human language like Kyawak who Crockta met in the past.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don't make me laugh!</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo fired General again. But the goblin just used minimal movements to avoid the bullets. Splendid rays of light filled the Black Forest.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A real shooter doesn\u2019t fire like that.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The goblin pulled back his bowstring.\u00a0</span><span>His short bow trembled as it was pulled back to the fullest extent. The goblin\u2019s arrow aimed exactly at Tiyo.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is heart </span><i><span>kyak</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The arrow was shot and a storm appeared.</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0<strong>Next Patreon goal has been reached!!

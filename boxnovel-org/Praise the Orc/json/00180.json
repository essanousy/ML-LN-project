They were seated to have a meal.\u00a0</span><span>The vegetable seller told them to wait and left for a while. Then he soon returned carrying a large pot.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was vegetable stew.\u00a0</span><span>The flavor of the broth was abundant. There was some meat included, but it was mainly made of vegetables.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta and Tiyo originally enjoyed meat, but their spoons moved quickly due to the delicious taste of the vegetables.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...By the way, why is he sitting here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHum hum, you shouldn\u2019t hold grudges.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA man who interferes in business is shameless <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is a thing of the past. Kelkelkel!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man who promoted the Arnold\u2019s Butchery was also with them.</span></p><br/><p><span>The vegetable seller just laughed at their argument and replied,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cVegetables are from the ground, from Mother Nature. A mother doesn\u2019t discriminate against her children.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His warm words caused the gaze in Crockta\u2019s and Tiyo\u2019s eyes to grow colder. The muscular man had actually tried to harass such a good person.\u00a0</span><span>The macho man scratched his head and avoided their gazes.\u00a0</span><span>The vegetable seller didn\u2019t care and gave him plenty of vegetable soup.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAt any rate, I am surprised that Tiyo is Hedor\u2019s son. This is a fated relationship.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhen did you see my father <em>dot</em>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt was a year ago.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt has been a long time <em>dot</em>...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHedor was looking for something.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right <em>dot</em>...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo nodded.\u00a0</span><span>Hedor had an explorer\u2019s temperament and always sought new things. It wasn\u2019t strange that he was pursuing interesting things.\u00a0</span><span>However, from Quantes to the north, the north to the south, and then somewhere else, what was keeping him so busy?</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat was it <em>dot</em>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t know the details, but it seemed to be a relic of the gods.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe gods.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>When talking about the gods, things like the gray god and the world tree popped into Crockta\u2019s mind. They were powerful existences with divine power.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta had first met the gray god in the Temple of the Fallen Gods. It could be inferred that it was possible to meet a god in a place associated with them.\u00a0</span><span>Then was Hedor looking for some ruins to meet the gods?</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe came periodically to buy vegetables. He was good at self-management.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe came periodically <em>dot</em>? It means he stayed here for a while.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat's right. He stayed for a few months.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhere did he go <em>dot</em>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMaybe the temple.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTemple? Katalu has a temple <em>dot</em>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. It is more like a memorial than a temple, but...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The muscular man spoke from the side,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThat\u2019s correct. It is a temple but not a temple.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA temple but not a temple <em>dot</em>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, it\u2019s a memorial place...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The muscular man and the vegetable seller were natives of Katalu, so they both knew the place.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta and Tiyo exchanged glances and nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAre you leaving straight away?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo replied at the same time.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf it is possible, I would like one more bowl.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI will eat before going <em>dot</em>. This is delicious.\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo arrived at the temple the vegetable seller had described.\u00a0</span><span>It was a small building on the outskirts of the city. Although this was their first time seeing it, it felt familiar to Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>The building\u2019s appearance was similar to the Temple of the Fallen God.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta felt that this was somehow associated with the gray god.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy is that guy here <em>dot</em>?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo said.</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor was standing there.\u00a0</span><span>The tanned skin made it obvious that he was the dark elf, Anor.\u00a0</span><span>There was no doubt that he was moving back and forth. He now had the dark energy of a necromancer around his body.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHey, Anor! What are you doing <em>dot</em>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEh?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Anor found them and waved happily.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWhat are you doing here? Didn\u2019t you go to the market?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSomething happened <em>dot</em>. What about you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor had definitely declared that he would rest all day at the inn.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat, did you make a promise to meet a beautiful woman <em>dot</em>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHahaha. No. I just felt something from here.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Anor pointed to the temple. The lights were off, and it was completely dark inside.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cA familiar aura\u2026 I feel something like that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHoh...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo touched his chin.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cIt seems like a very unpleasant place <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They approached the temple and opened the door.\u00a0</span><span>It was dark, but as soon as they entered, the lights came on as if it sensed their movements.\u00a0</span><span>There was a long corridor.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs anyone here?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta called out. His voice echoed down the hallway.\u00a0</span><span>He heard there was someone managing this hallway, so where were they?\u00a0</span><span>Suddenly, they reached the end of the corridor.\u00a0</span><span>There was one more door. Crockta hesitated, but Tiyo opened the door without hesitation.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kkiiik.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The door opened...\u00a0</span><span>And there was a woman sitting down.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo <em>dot.</em>..\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat a surprise.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The woman didn\u2019t move from the noise.\u00a0</span><span>It was only the rear view, but she showed a holy appearance.\u00a0</span><span>The inner murals surrounding her created a strange atmosphere, somewhat like the one in the Temple of the Fallen God.\u00a0</span><span>They made a lot of noise on their way in, but the woman was still in her own world, completely motionless.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s group stood in the doorway and watched her for a while.\u00a0</span><span>After some time, the woman started to slowly rise.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAck...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, the woman stumbled.\u00a0</span><span>It seemed that she had been sitting for a long time.\u00a0</span><span>She frowned and twisted on the ground, groaning. \u00a0</span><span>Crockta withdrew his previous assessment. She wasn\u2019t a sacred being, just a person.</span></p><br/><p><span>The woman finally got up.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cPhew, I thought I was going to die.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then she spoke to Crockta\u2019s party,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWelcome. I\u2019m sorry for the delay. You must\u2019ve been waiting for a long time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta greeted her.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cNo. We didn\u2019t want to interfere in your praying...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh? Praying?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>She asked.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou weren\u2019t praying?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen you were just sitting there...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOh, I was doing yoga and got a cramp...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She clapped and the interior lit up a bit more.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIsn\u2019t it amazing? A friend of mine made it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo was convinced that her friend was Hedor as this was magic engineering.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOh, my?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>She saw Tiyo and suddenly covered her mouth. It was an expression of enlightenment.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cPerhaps...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right <em>dot</em>.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI am Hedor\u2019s son, Tiyo!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUnbelievable\u2026\u201d\u00a0</span><span>She looked down at Tiyo with admiration.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYou look very similar.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDo you know my father <em>dot</em>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOf course. You have the same rude way of talking.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat <em>dot</em>...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHahat, I\u2019m just joking.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta explained on behalf of the shocked Tiyo.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe are looking for Hedor. Do you know anything about him?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe had to leave\u2026 Please follow me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She guided them somewhere. It was a small sitting room.\u00a0</span><span>The woman brought out some tea.\u00a0</span><span>She nodded after they explained their purpose for coming here. The woman did indeed know about Hedor.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe\u2019s a curious person and was investigating a god who is no longer in this world.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe fallen god?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGosh, you already know. That\u2019s right. That is what she is called.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta gulped at the words. Strangely, the gray god was mentioned again here.\u00a0</span><span>Since Crockta\u2019s assimilation reached 100, the gray god no longer talked to him, and he didn\u2019t receive any system messages.\u00a0</span><span>What did the gray god really want, and what was Hedor looking for?</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen is this the Temple of the Fallen God?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta asked. She shook her head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo. The Temple of the Fallen God no longer exists. They are all in ruins.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There was a temple in the north, but she didn\u2019t know about it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAdditionally, this place isn\u2019t strictly a temple.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is a memorial place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cFor what? And you...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Her answer was unexpected.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI am Eliza, a follower of the goddess of mercy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe goddess of mercy...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Eliza smiled.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI came here following the Goddess of Mercy\u2019s will, in order to remember a species that has now disappeared from the continent.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA species that has disappeared from the continent <em>dot</em>?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo was confused. He didn\u2019t seem to know.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA very long time ago, there was a species that followed the fallen god before she fell. They had a strong and mysterious power that was different from other species.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMysterious power?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, I don\u2019t know exactly, but it is said that the other species were afraid because of the unknown power. Then the fallen god suddenly went crazy and was captivated by the strange idea of destroying the world.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Eliza sighed.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThe species kept following her, despite her desire to destroy the world, and all the gods and species united to stop the fallen god. The orcs, humans, dwarves, elves, and gnomes confronted them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is the first time I\u2019ve heard this story <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is a story that the records have erased. Anyway, the power of the other gods combined, and she crashed, becoming a \u2018fallen god.\u2019\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The gray god was the god who had fallen.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta asked,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThat species?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUnfortunately, they suffered the same fate as the fallen god. They all died. Some are said to be alive, but I don\u2019t know if this is true or not.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, Crockta\u2019s waist started itching. Crockta lowered his head and saw that the steel belt at his waist seemed to be shaking strangely.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe goddess of mercy was saddened by the fate of the species that followed the fallen god and made a memorial for them. This is the place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is a sad but interesting story.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBut there is a positive aspect in that all the species joined together. The species will work together when there is a crisis.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta fell into deep thought as he listened to the story.\u00a0</span><span>The fallen god was clearly the gray god. That meant the creation of Elder Lord was an extension of that ambition. She still wanted to destroy the world.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta, who had met her in person, had difficulty thinking about her as such a dangerous being. He hadn\u2019t gotten any bad feelings from her. So, what was her reason for wanting such an ending?</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo asked,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cSo, where did my father go <em>dot</em>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe received information that the trail of the fallen god is in the west...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Tak tak tak!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, the footsteps were heard coming from outside.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI will leave you with those words\u2026 Please excuse me. Come in!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The door opened, and a man looked at Eliza.\u00a0</span><span>He was holding an envelope in his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEliza. There is a letter. It seems to be urgent.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Eliza accepted it. Then the man bowed and left the temple. He seemed to be the mailman.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThis\u2026 Please wait a moment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She checked the outside of the envelope, immediately tore it open, and then checked the contents.\u00a0</span><span>Her eyes gradually widened. She frowned like she couldn\u2019t understand it. Her eyes shook as she read it again a few times.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Eliza looked at Crockta with an intense gaze.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCrockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She bit her lips and spoke again,</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUm\u2026 and Tiyo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat <em>dot</em>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe dark elf as well...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am Anor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, Anor.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Eliza continued,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cHedor told me he was going to \u2018Geherad,\u2019 which is to the north-west of Katalu. You should go quickly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGeherad?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. He said he would stay there for a while, so you should rush in order to not miss him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen it is better to go quickly <em>dot.</em>\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo looked at Crockta and Anor.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe are accompanying you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere is no need to ask.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They nodded at each other.\u00a0</span><span>As they were companions, it was natural for them to accompany Tiyo.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo raised a fist.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cGood <em>dot</em>. Let\u2019s start straight away!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNow?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIndeed <em>dot</em>. Katalu is safe, so we don\u2019t have to wait any longer <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBut I wanted to take a break...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou can do it tomorrow <em>dot</em>! Live today!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo declared. So, Crockta, Tiyo, and Anor headed for Geherad.\u00a0</span><span>After thanking Eliza, they hastily escaped the temple\u2014no, the memorial place for the disappeared species.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Eliza sighed as they left.\u00a0</span><span>Did she do the right thing?</span></p><br/><p><span>She looked at the letter again.\u00a0</span><span>A divine message had come down to the temple.\u00a0</span><span>The contents were hostile towards the orcs and Crockta\u2019s party. There were several things which didn\u2019t seem usual for the goddess of mercy.</span></p><br/><p><span>As a follower of the goddess of mercy, she shouldn\u2019t have let them go. She should've tricked them into going to a dangerous place or drug them...</span></p><br/><p><span>Instead, she sent them to a safe place.\u00a0</span><span>Geherad was a harsh place, but it was also isolated from other species and temples. If the contents of the message were true, Geherad was the best place for them.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a hard choice for her.\u00a0</span><span>However, Crockta was the hero who saved Katalu, and Tiyo...\u00a0</span><span>He was Hedor\u2019s son.</span></p><br/><p><span>Eliza closed her eyes as she thought of Hedor.\u00a0</span><span>He was a gnome who always laughed cheerfully and had helped Eliza, a novice who had been sent to the outside world alone.\u00a0</span><span>His optimistic attitude had left a big impression on her. The facilities inside the temple had also been provided by Hedor.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHah...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Eliza sighed.</span></p><br/><p><span>Her chest felt heavy at the thought of disobeying the goddess.\u00a0</span><span>Hedor\u2019s son, Tiyo, was following him. Tiyo might resent Hedor, but today, Hedor had saved his party.\u00a0</span><span>If it wasn\u2019t for Hedor, she might\u2019ve deceived them.</span></p><br/><p><span>She looked at the letter again.\u00a0</span><span>This was written:</span></p><br/><p><span>[Make the orcs a forgotten species.]</span></p><br/><p><span>It wasn\u2019t like the goddess of mercy.\u00a0</span><span>If a divine message had come down, that meant something was happening.\u00a0</span><span>The kingdom had become an empire, and the goddess of mercy passed on a strange message.\u00a0</span><span>Everything was becoming strange.</span></p><br/><p><span>Eliza prayed for the world.</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><br/><p>I have also updated my\u00a0Patreon\u00a0to reflect my new novels.

Wassup, man. It's been a while. What brings you here?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Rodr\u00edguez welcomed Bob who came after a long time. He opened the barrier protecting the counter and came out.\u00a0</span><span>The two of them shook hands and bumped shoulders.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I need something urgently. Can you get it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOf course. The customer is the king, Bro. Someone who is a friend and customer is an emperor, and you fit both criteria.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cReynolds...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Reynolds?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Rodr\u00edguez raised his eyebrows.\u00a0</span><span>While he was a famous money exchanger, the things he dealt in were a bit special.\u00a0</span><span>Rodr\u00edguez exchanged currency and items between Elder Lord and the real world. Users who struggled in Elder Lord could use their assets in reality and those in need of items would also come to Rodr\u00edguez.</span></p><br/><p><span>Therefore, he was quite familiar with Elder Lord.\u00a0</span><span>Reynolds wasn\u2019t someone\u2019s name, but the name of a city that he had heard often as of late.\u00a0</span><span>It was the gateway city to the south in Elder Lord.</span></p><br/><p><span>Rodr\u00edguez pointed to Bob and said, \u201cHey, Champ. I can guess.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHmm?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Are you looking for a scroll?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOhh, shush. Bro. How\u2019d you know? Are you a mind reader? Psychokinesis? CIA?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Bob\u2019s shoulders trembled.\u00a0</span><span>Rodr\u00edguez chuckled and replied to Bob, \u201cThe correct answer is CIA.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What? Really? Shouldn\u2019t this be a secret? That you\u2019re a secret agent? Have you been tracking me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Noob, not that CIA. I\u2019m talking about Cash Indicates Answer. I see the truth when people spend money and I dig it out. For example, don\u2019t you think about putting on another accent?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Of course, I think that every time I go to the clubs.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The women must be thinking the opposite.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"They are impressed by things like that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t be fooled by the push and pull strategy, Bro.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Rodr\u00edguez opened his phone.\u00a0</span><span>He was connected with the branches in other regions, sharing quotes and transactions.\u00a0</span><span>He touched his phone a few times and the screen changed, displaying an item that had started to experience a recent surge in transactions.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Look, you\u2019re not the only one. Everybody is looking for a scroll.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOhh...my god.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do you see the price? It is no joke. There isn\u2019t much left in the inventory. So, tell me. What's going on? Why is everybody suddenly looking for this scroll? Is it a fad like the 300 BPM these days?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUm...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Bob closed his eyes. Rodr\u00edguez prompted him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hey, Bro. If you let me know, I\u2019ll give you a Reynolds scroll. It will be at the lowest price. It is the same as the FA releasing Cristiano Ronaldo. He was also in his prime. Okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI understand. I understand.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Bob whispered something into Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s ears.\u00a0</span><span>Rodr\u00edguez stroked his chin and looked at Bob\u2019s face seriously before nodding. Then he hit Bob\u2019s back.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHey, my man. Find Jackie in Reynolds Square. Let me ask you something. Are you going on your own?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I'm going with my friends.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Okay. The password is the same, so let me know if you have any problems.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Bob nodded.\u00a0</span><span>He reached out a hand after telling Rodr\u00edguez that the connection was urgent. Rodr\u00edguez grabbed his hand.\u00a0</span><span>The two of them exchanged a macho greeting again.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Thanks, Rodr\u00edguez.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is nothing. I\u2019ll cheer you on, Bob.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019ll see you again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Bob waved and left the store.\u00a0</span><span>Rodr\u00edguez went behind the counter again.</span></p><br/><p><span>He made his living off Elder Lord but he didn\u2019t pay much attention to the game play. To him, Elder Lord was a business. But after seeing Bob, he suddenly wanted to play Elder Lord again.\u00a0</span><span>He turned on the television.</span></p><br/><p><span>The hot topic was being talked about. The Heaven and Earth Clan was fighting one NPC.\u00a0</span><span>It was strange that a confrontation between an NPC and users would be a hot topic, and it was also interesting that people defended the NPC and blamed the users.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Coming and going...there will be no trade with the south for a while.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There wouldn\u2019t be a lot of people coming and going from the south due to the devastation.\u00a0</span><span>The orc in the hot topic resisted to the end and escaped with the help of his allies.\u00a0</span><span>The next battleground was going to be Katalu. AS a merchant, he calculated the impact of the conflict between the two sides and its consequences.</span></p><br/><p><span>No matter how he thought about it, the imperial army would win.\u00a0</span><span>The relevant communities and industry insights all predicted the imperial army\u2019s victory. Some people were already lining up there.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUmm...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He remembered Bob\u2019s face. It was rare that he had such an enthusiastic friend.\u00a0</span><span>In addition, Bob bought the \u2018Haste\u2019 scroll that hadn\u2019t been selling much lately.\u00a0</span><span>It wasn\u2019t just that. Something was moving.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Is it an adventure?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>As Rodr\u00edguez was thinking, the television screen suddenly changed.\u00a0</span><span>The screen was reporting breaking news.\u00a0</span><span>Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s eyes widened as he saw the contents.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was news that the NPC Crockta had appeared alone in front of the imperial army.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>The Undergames chat room was in turmoil.\u00a0</span><span>As the broadcast resumed after the breaking news, people thought that it was just before the capture of Katalu, and the Heaven and Earth Clan would face Crockta again.</span></p><br/><p><span>But the video shown on the screen was quite different from what they imagined.\u00a0</span><span>The imposing sight of the imperial army was still the same. Rommel was the commander. He was showing the dignity of a commander under the flag of the empire.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, the opponent was different.\u00a0</span><span>They weren\u2019t facing an army or a group of people. There was no resistance group prepared for death.</span></p><br/><p><span>Just one orc.\u00a0</span><span>The steel helmet covered his face.\u00a0</span><span>However, he had fearsome tattoos on his body, a steel belt resembling a demon\u2019s face and a giant greatsword.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was clearly Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>They were skeptical at first. Why the hell did he come alone? Perhaps he had come for negotiations. Or maybe Crockta came to beg for his life. In the end, even he surrendered to the overpowering might.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, he came to fight.\u00a0</span><span>He recited the warriors\u2019 laws and lifted his greatsword.</span></p><br/><p><span>The moment he said \u2018come\u2019 to the army.</span></p><br/><p><span>Everyone watching the screen.\u00a0</span><span>They all realized.\u00a0</span><span>He was real.\u00a0</span><span>A real warrior defending his beliefs in life.\u00a0</span><span>He couldn\u2019t be stopped with fear or threats. He wasn\u2019t afraid of even death.\u00a0</span><span>He stood in front of the great army with just his greatsword. There was no clearer message than this.</span></p><br/><p><span>Those supporting the Heaven and Earth Clan and those who suspected Crockta, they could no longer mock him.\u00a0</span><span>It was because of what was occurring right before their eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Dwarf Shoot: It is bul\u2019tar from today on.

Fountains of blood and corpses filled the screen.\u00a0</span><span>He killed several people every time he moved.</span></p><br/><p><span>This was the power of the \u2018Northern Conqueror.\u2019 He was like a blender grinding down the enemies. Due to his brutal actions, a mosaic flashed over parts of the screen.\u00a0</span><span>Rommel was upset. He always commanded battles calmly, so this was the first time seeing his surprised expression.</span></p><br/><p><span>He raised his hands. Arrows flew.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta survived but the soldiers surrounding him were killed by the arrows.</span></p><br/><p><span>Killing one\u2019s own side.\u00a0</span><span>Accusations started flooding in.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Rommel Dog Scum: Killing his own allies \u3149\u3149\u3149 How pathetic.</span></p><br/><p><span>Positive Affirms Positive: When did I start truly seeing this guy \u314b\u314b\u314b My eyes have been broadened.</span></p><br/><p><span>Analyst: This isn\u2019t like Rommel.

He tried to crush Crockta with the knights\u2019 assault, but the soldiers ended up wounded or killed.\u00a0</span><span>Rommel\u2019s command, which didn\u2019t care for the well-being of the infantry, was in contrast with Crockta, who came to protect people.</span></p><br/><p><span>The people cheering for Crockta grew.\u00a0</span><span>However, the difference in numbers they were worried about started to show.\u00a0</span><span>After all these attempts, Rommel separated Crockta from the soldiers and surrounded him with knights.</span></p><br/><p><span>Knights weren\u2019t easy to slaughter like the soldiers. They were elite combatants in full armour, and many were advanced fighters.\u00a0</span><span>Furthermore, there was Adandator who Crockta once dueled with.\u00a0</span><span>At the time, Crockta had managed to win. However, it was much more difficult on a battlefield where he was surrounded.</span></p><br/><p><span>Blades flashed inside the encirclement.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta killed several knights. His skills were brilliant.\u00a0</span><span>But in the end, his wounds gradually increased. The attacks flying from every direction ate away at Crockta\u2019s body.</span></p><br/><p><span>Everyone thought it was over.</span></p><br/><p><span>At this moment, something happened.\u00a0</span><span>A long shadow draped over them.\u00a0</span><span>The camera angle slowly moved.\u00a0</span><span>On the hill, a knight was descending with the sun behind him.\u00a0</span><span>Both Crockta and the knights forgot their battle and looked at him.</span></p><br/><p><span>The chat window once again became busy as his identity was confirmed.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Mountaineer Hunter: Why is this crazy guy here?</span></p><br/><p><span>You are a Legend: \u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b I can only laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span>Come Spring: He really came to kill Crockta \u314b\u314b He is crazy.</span></p><br/><p><span>Toothpaste Cap: They\u2019re currently in the middle of battle, so why did he show up here?</span></p><br/><p><span>Post-it: Did this crazy guy come to join them?</span></p><br/><p><span>Empire Strikes Back: This guy is crazy right?

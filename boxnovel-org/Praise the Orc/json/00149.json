The author didn\u2019t state their identity, as only a few things were mentioned.\u00a0</span><span>However, it contained something shocking that she had never considered at all.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo way,\u201d she murmured.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPerhaps?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>But it made sense.\u00a0</span><span>She read the letter once again before exiting Elder Lord.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta sat in front of a fireplace with VIgo.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI didn\u2019t see Yellow today. Was she dragged by the call of the stars? I truly feel sorry for that friend.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The NPCs understood the concept of disconnection as the users being summoned to the abyss.\u00a0</span><span>In a way, it wasn\u2019t wrong. Going back and forth between Elder Lord and Earth.\u00a0</span><span>This situation often happened so users found it hard to have a close relationship with NPCs. It was hard to trust those who suddenly disappeared ahead of important things.</span></p><br/><p><span>Therefore, users who couldn\u2019t connect for long tended to only socialize with other users. This was because NPCs didn\u2019t trust them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yellow is normally good so this is surprising.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Of course, Yellow was excellent in Elder Lord. She had been living like an NPC for nearly a year.\u00a0</span><span>This allowed her to move up to the position of working for the lord.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I guess she has something to do.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta smiled strangely.</span></p><br/><p><span>She probably ended the connection after reading the letter that Crockta sent her at night.\u00a0</span><span>He wasn\u2019t sure if it would work, but he needed to do what he could.\u00a0</span><span>The kingdom\u2019s path involved the Heaven and Earth Clan. It was already a public fact and there was a precedent where they devastated any areas in the name of the kingdom.</span></p><br/><p><span>In particular, the southeast region with no clear system was brutally destroyed and the ruins broadcasted several times.\u00a0</span><span>The Heaven and Earth Clan didn\u2019t keep faith with NPCs.\u00a0</span><span>As long as they considered Elder Lord a game, Crockta needed to extend this duel agreement not only to NPCs but users as well.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"By the way, what are they doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Vigo turned his head at Crockta\u2019s words.\u00a0</span><span>In the meantime, Grandmaster Galadin and Anor were staring at each other.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ohhh...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor, who was very timid and not good with eye contact, desperately tried to turn his head away with red cheeks.\u00a0</span><span>It looked so funny that Tiyo joined Galadin in staring at Anor.\u00a0</span><span>As the eyes of the two people focused on him, Anor turned his eyes towards his hands.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I got it. Stop! Stop!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Galadin and Tiyo chuckled.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You will be stronger if you don\u2019t avoid the eyes of others.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo approached,\u00a0</span><span>\"In other words, don\u2019t act like this forever </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! Kahahat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAhyu.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Anor seemed like he was about to cry.\u00a0</span><span>\"It is strange when you keep staring.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou are very shy. Don\u2019t avoid other people\u2019s eyes. It is a shame. Hahat!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Galadin was famous for identifying people\u2019s characteristics and leading them to the right path.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta seemed to know the secret after exchanging blows with him.\u00a0</span><span>Galadin had the ability to read inner thoughts, like he was telepathic.\u00a0</span><span>During the spar, he predicted all of Crockta\u2019s moves. There was the feeling that he knew in advance every move Crockta was going to do and could cope with it.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta won, but he wasn\u2019t sure the results would be the same if they really tried to kill each other.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe is a mysterious person.\u201d Crockta stated.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat is correct. A mysterious person. He looks inside people.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>If he could really see into a person\u2019s heart, he would be able to find out their problems.\u00a0</span><span>His teachings were about inner matters, rather than technical ones.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta also received advice from him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What did he say to Brother? If you don\u2019t mind, please let me know. I am curious. Is a warrior like you lacking anything?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUm...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta recalled Galadin\u2019s words.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cJust...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Vigo was right.</span></p><br/><p><span>Galadin wasn\u2019t just a person who strengthened knights.\u00a0</span><span>When wielding a sword, he was an aggressive knight. But after putting it away, he looked at the other person with warm eyes.\u00a0</span><span>He was someone who caused the other person to grow as a human.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He told me not to shoulder everything alone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOh, indeed. Brother has something.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Vigo raised his thumb.\u00a0</span><span>\"Doesn\u2019t he feel like a father when he says that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta laughed. His father passed away but memories from his childhood still remained. He never resented his parents.\u00a0</span><span>In life, how many people had the strength to look straight at themselves?</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That\u2019s right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Now it was Tiyo\u2019s turn to receive advice from Galadin.\u00a0</span><span>However, Tiyo disliked this and refused his advice.\u00a0</span><span>An angry Galadiin wielded his sword. Tiyo ran away.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cStop </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! I understand! I understand </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This guy! Listen to the adults!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am an adult </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If you are an adult, listen to a real adult!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am a gnome! General, General!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGeneral? Shoot it once!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKiyak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo screamed as he ran away from Galadin\u2019s wooden sword.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta and Vigo burst out laughing as they saw it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPhew. Truly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The still embarrassed Anor was fanning himself as he walked towards Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We have to watch you for you to grow. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...Excuse me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Vigo and Crockta stared at Anor, mimicking Galadin and Tiyo from earlier.</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor blushed.\u00a0</span><span>\"No, now...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They diligently gazed at Anor\u2019s face.\u00a0</span><span>Anor was embarrassed and covered his face.\u00a0</span><span>\"Don\u2019t do it! Ah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor\u2019s face turned bright red as he ran somewhere else.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Anor Brother is both handsome and cute. The females will like him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kulkulkul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was enjoyable.\u00a0</span><span>Alaste was a vibrant city filled with laughter.\u00a0</span><span>Whether it was the nature of the people or the richness of the natural environment, they seemed to enjoy each moment.\u00a0</span><span>Of course, it wasn\u2019t just due to material reasons that laughter was gradually disappearing from the prosperous modern age compared to Elder Lord.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cVigo. You were right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What do you mean?\"\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Alaste is a wonderful place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Of course. I don\u2019t lie! Hahahat! Viva Alaste!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKulkulkul!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>In a matter of days, Crockta had explored all over Alaste.\u00a0</span><span>Every time he walked through a city, Crockta felt fear towards him, whether it was because he was an orc or his frightening appearance.\u00a0</span><span>In fact, he wasn\u2019t a real orc but a human being wearing the shell of an orc. However, there were still negative prejudices towards his shell.</span></p><br/><p><span>But Alaste was different.\u00a0</span><span>The children came to play with Crockta while merchants added orc goods.\u00a0</span><span>He felt like a welcomed guest.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBrother. Now you know. Why I kept hanging onto you, despite it being the first time we met.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Vigo placed a hand on Crockta\u2019s shoulder and gazed into the distance.\u00a0</span><span>\"The kingdom and Adandator is trying to destroy such a beautiful place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Once incorporated into the kingdom, this landscape would disappear. The citizens would suffer under heavy taxes and young people would be conscripted for war.\u00a0</span><span>The lands under the kingdom\u2019s reign were already going through this process.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\"I heard that Adandator is a handsome, young man.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. His face is famous.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then I\u2019ll beat him up and make him look worse than me!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta shouted.\u00a0</span><span>It was Crockta\u2019s declaration that he would protect Alaste with his best efforts!</span></p><br/><p><span>But Vigo wasn\u2019t very impressed by the remark.\u00a0</span><span>\"No matter how much you hit him, it will be difficult...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s face stiffened. Vigo hurriedly changed his words.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, no. I believe in Brother!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is okay. I\u2019ll fight in the duel...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are you talking about? Brother\u2019s face is better than his. Really! I\u2019m not lying!\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>The Elder Lord community had recently heated up because of a new topic.\u00a0</span><span>And the one at the heart of the topic was the Heaven and Earth Clan.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Author: Yellow Alaste]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Title: Announcing the negotiations between those who love Alaste and the Heaven and Earth Clan.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Hello. I am a native of Alaste, Yellow who loves Alaste.</span></p><br/><p><span>The human kingdom is expanding its forces in recent years. The Alaste that I love is in crisis but most users don\u2019t know exactly what is happening.\u00a0</span><span>The kingdom and Alaste have decided to settle their fighting in a one-on-one duel through their respective representatives.</span></p><br/><p><span>We can settle this without having to fight against each other.</span></p><br/><p><span>If the kingdom wins, Alaste will be incorporated into the kingdom. If Alaste wins, it will remain independent as a neutral city and the kingdom won\u2019t invade Alaste in the future.</span></p><br/><p><span>In fact, the possibility of us winning is low. Even though we have Grandmaster Galadin, the kingdom has the famous Adandator. However, the users who love Alaste are eager for a miracle to happen.</span></p><br/><p><span>Anyway, the reason I am writing this is to plead with the Heaven and Earth Clan.\u00a0</span><span>There are users who regard NPCs as consumables, mere artificial intelligence and doesn\u2019t feel any remorse. The Heaven and Earth Clan especially has such tendencies.</span></p><br/><p><span>So we are worried that even if Galadin and Alaste wins, the Heaven and Earth Clan will ignore the existing negotiations and hit Alaste.\u00a0</span><span>Users often do this, not just the Heaven and Earth Clan. People will know this.\u00a0</span><span>But we are users who love Alaste, and we hope that the users, including the Heaven and Earth Clan, will accept the result.</span></p><br/><p><span>Therefore, we have asked the Heaven and Earth Clan to sign a memorandum stating that they will comply with the agreement between Alaste and the kingdom.\u00a0</span><span>Heaven and Earth\u2019s clan master Choi Hansung has agreed.</span></p><br/><p><span>This is the actual memorandum.</span></p><br/><p><span>(Screenshot)</span></p><br/><p><span>I am posting this here because I hope that all users who enjoy Elder Lord will be the notaries of this memorandum.</span></p><br/><p><span>We don\u2019t want Elder Lord to be ruined by a reckless war.</span></p><br/><p><span>If there are hundreds of users, there are hundreds of ways to play. I fell in love with Alaste from the first moment I saw it. Alaste is a really beautiful place. I used to always brag about it and I am still proud.</span></p><br/><p><span>If Alaste is defeated, I will probably disappear from this forum. I will also delete my character. There is no reason to play.\u00a0</span><span>If there are people who want to continue seeing it like me, please pray with us.</span></p><br/><p><span>I hope for a miracle.</span></p><br/><p><span>Alaste Lover, Yellow.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Yellow posted on a famous community board.\u00a0</span><span>This article immediately became a hot topic.</span></p><br/><p><span>The first reason was that the greatest knights in Elder Lord, two grandmasters were having a confrontation. Another reason was that the author was Yellow, a user who managed to become a senior official.</span></p><br/><p><span>Yellow was the user whose name became famous with an Elder Lord strategy guide.\u00a0</span><span>Users who wanted to become civil servants in Elder Lord would regard her guide as a textbook. In addition, she introduced users to the calm lifestyle of Alaste and made many users turn to Alaste.</span></p><br/><p><span>Her article became a hot topic and thousands of comments had already been posted.</span></p><br/><p><span>The Heaven and Earth Clan also confirmed her post.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs it okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Hyunchul, \u2018Luin\u2019 in Elder Lord said.\u00a0</span><span>After helping to lure and kill Lenox, he was now an executive in the Heaven and Earth Clan.\u00a0</span><span>In addition, using his friendship with the NPCs and Choi Hansung, Keynes went from being the clan master of Thawing Balhae to the vice clan master of Heaven and Earth.</span></p><br/><p><span>The clan master was \u2018Rommel\u2019 but most of the clan\u2019s actions came from Keynes\u2019 head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There's nothing to worry about.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Rommel smiled and drank his wine.\u00a0</span><span>This was the clan dwelling in the capital, Esperanza. It was a land they had received directly after gaining the favor of the king.\u00a0</span><span>The room they were talking in was luxurious and wasn\u2019t lacking when compared to a noble\u2019s house. All of this was due to the members of Thawing Balhae who joined Heaven and Earth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do you really think Adandator can be beaten?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Indeed...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He is a monster. I\u2019ve talked to Adandator and he is confident that he can beat Galadin.

So don't worry. The woman thinks it will work, but it will end without a problem.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Rommel handed the wine glass to Keynes who was sitting silently. Keynes smiled and received it.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you saying anything?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There is something that bothers me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Keynes\u2019 nerves were sharp after the Maillard branch of the clan collapsed.\u00a0</span><span>All of Maillard\u2019s members mentioned the NPC called Crockta. Everyone knew that the Thawing Balhae had been destroyed by the Righteous Orc.\u00a0</span><span>A coincidence? Or maybe he was chasing after them in the Heaven and Earth Clan.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t worry about it. You are here now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Keynes nodded. Even so, he couldn\u2019t help being worried. Rommel laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Keynes, you are always worrying.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Luin suddenly said, \"Speaking of worrying, what will happen if Adandator is beaten?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUm...well, it can\u2019t be helped.

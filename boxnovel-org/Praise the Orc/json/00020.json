The west held Basque Village, where the shamans trained.\u00a0</span><span>Ian decided to visit Basque Village because he wanted to see the wise shaman Tashaquil.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian moved without any difficulty, killing the occasional monster.\u00a0</span><span>Now none of the monsters around Orcrox Fortress were his opponents.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Status Window]</span></p><br/><p><span>'Person Pursuing the Pinnacle\u2019 Ian, Orc Apprentice Warrior</span></p><br/><p><span>Level: 10 </span></p><br/><p><span>Achievement Points: 610</span></p><br/><p><span>Assimilation: 63%</span></p><br/><p><span>Abilities: </span></p><br/><p><span>Orc's Superhuman Strength (Uncommon)</span></p><br/><p><span>Orc's Vitality (Uncommon)</span></p><br/><p><span>Orc\u2019s Greatsword Technique (Uncommon)</span></p><br/><p><span>Indomitable Will (Special)</span></p><br/><p><span>Mind's Eye (Special)</span></p><br/><p><span>In the meantime, both his level and achievement points increased.\u00a0</span><span>After fighting Derek, Warrior's Fighting Spirit was upgraded to the special ranked skill, Indomitable Will.

The poor goblin is afraid of you.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Mind's Eye showed information about the target. With it, he could grasp the target\u2019s emotions and strength, making the ability very useful.\u00a0</span><span>The goblin was overwhelmed by the atmosphere around Ian and abandoned his weapon.\u00a0</span><span>He then fell facedown in the dirt.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kyaak...! Kyak...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a gesture asking for forgiveness.\u00a0</span><span>Ian hesitated as he lifted his greatsword.\u00a0</span><span>He heard Lenox\u2019s solemn voice.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018A warrior doesn\u2019t attack unarmed people.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>He probably meant a situation like this.\u00a0</span><span>The goblin was begging Ian for mercy. If he struck the neck of the goblin, it would be a one-sided murder, not a battle.\u00a0</span><span>Ian didn\u2019t think that was the path of a warrior.</span></p><br/><p><span>As Ian hesitated, the goblin kept bowing.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kyaak...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblin tried to provoke extreme compassion in the other person.\u00a0</span><span>Its gestures and eyes were pitiful.\u00a0</span><span>In the end, Ian lowered his greatsword.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUm...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kyak kyak!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cRise.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblin bowed deeper.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cRaise your head! Don\u2019t bow down on your knees.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kiek?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If you attack an orc again, then I won\u2019t forgive you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kiek!

He was a species that was always cursed and insulted.\u00a0</span><span>But the orc had told him to be an honorable goblin.\u00a0</span><span>The goblin felt an unknown emotion.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then the goblin rushed after Ian.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Huh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kyak kyak!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblin pulled Ian\u2019s sleeve. Ian cocked his head. It seemed like the goblin was trying to say something.\u00a0</span><span>The goblin pointed to him with his fingertips, then pointed to another place and made a walking motion. It was a gesture to follow him.</span></p><br/><p><span>[The goblin feels favorable towards you.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Mind's Eye\u2019s gave him a positive answer.\u00a0</span><span>Ian nodded and followed the goblin. He didn\u2019t know what was going on, but he thought it would be interesting.</span></p><br/><p><span>He had previously heard from Grom that goblins were really nasty monsters.\u00a0</span><span>They attacked or mocked their opponent, provoking them and eventually leading them towards a large group armed with weapons.\u00a0</span><span>However, this goblin didn\u2019t seem like that.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian walked along with the goblin.\u00a0</span><span>A little further ahead, a small group of approximately 10 goblins appeared.\u00a0</span><span>The goblins were sitting down and chewing on something.\u00a0</span><span>However, they became startled when they saw Ian.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kyaak?\u201d Kyak! Kyak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKeeek?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The small goblins jumped up and grabbed their weapons.\u00a0</span><span>Ian raised the palm of his hands to show he wasn\u2019t an enemy, but they didn\u2019t calm down.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKiek!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblin who led Ian to the goblins yelled at them.\u00a0</span><span>They seemed to talk about something, and then the weapons were put down.\u00a0</span><span>Ian walked into the group of goblins, who looked at him with a mixture of fear and curiosity.</span></p><br/><p><span>Among the crowd was a bearded goblin.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOrc. Kyak! It is nice to meet you kyak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian\u2019s eyes widened. The goblin used the official language.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am the elder of this group, Kyawak.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"My name is Ian.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ian kyak.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kyawak stroked the head of the goblin that led Ian here. It seemed like the whole story had been described.\u00a0</span><span>Kyawak beckoned.</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblins brought something to Ian.\u00a0</span><span>It was a huge chunk of beef.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Thank you for showing mercy to my grandson kyak. This is a sign of our appreciation kyak. The goblins will treat you to a meal kyak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian nodded.\u00a0</span><span>He wouldn\u2019t reject their hearts.\u00a0</span><span>In fact, the meat was well cooked so he started to salivate.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Thank you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian sat down. The moment that he was about to take a bite from the beef,</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblins around Ian were staring at the beef with longing eyes.\u00a0</span><span>Ian stopped moving.\u00a0</span><span>The goblins were holding tree roots and grass, like they were poor. Ian was the only one holding well cooked beef.\u00a0</span><span>Even Kyawak was just holding a big leaf.\u00a0</span><span>They looked like poor people starving due to a lack of food!</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian put down the beef that he was about to bite into.\u00a0</span><span>Then he drew his greatsword.\u00a0</span><span>The goblins were startled by the sudden movement of the blade.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian\u2019s greatsword cut apart the beef, splitting it into exactly 11 pieces. It was the perfect distribution for Ian and the goblins.\u00a0</span><span>Ian gave it to the goblins without saying a word.\u00a0</span><span>The goblins accepted the beef with moist eyes. \u00a0Kyawak seemed especially impressed as he shouted exuberantly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kyaak...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKyak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian raised the beef.\u00a0</span><span>The goblins next to him also raised their meat.\u00a0</span><span>Ian placed the beef in his mouth and ate it all at once.\u00a0</span><span>The goblins also ate the beef with him. 10 goblins and one orc swallowed the beef.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Munch!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The goblins\u2019 eyes filled with tears as they ate the delicious beef. Ian admired how well it was cooked. It was a match for any restaurant\u2019s steak.\u00a0</span><span>However, one piece of beef wasn\u2019t enough for an orc.\u00a0</span><span>The goblins handed out some grass and Ian filled his stomach with the vegetation.</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblins were hungry \u00a0but they didn\u2019t eat that much because their bodies were small. Ian ate all of the grass that they left behind.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Thank you for the meal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo kyak. We should thank you kieek. It is the first time that we\u2019ve had an orc as a guest kyaak.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He shared a conversation with Kyawak.</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblins originally dwelled to the north of Orcrox Fortress, but there was a problem and the goblins recently started to head south.\u00a0</span><span>Not long ago, Grom had been given a goblin subjugation mission.</span></p><br/><p><span>The monsters in the north were rough and there were powerful mutants. Direwolves became bigger and trolls became more oppressive. Ogres also popped up and attacked other monsters indiscriminately.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We were forced to come down here kyaak. Then it overlapped with the orc territory kyaack. So we are moving further south kyak.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblins were forced to go south.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Something scary has obviously appeared in the north kyaak. The orcs should pay attention kieek!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hmm...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The mutant werewolf popped into his head. The wolves had also come down from the north.\u00a0</span><span>Was there really something unusual happening in the north?\u00a0</span><span>The moment that Ian was about to ask Kyawak something...</span></p><br/><p><span>There was a sound.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Swaeeeek.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Ian reflexively lifted his greatsword and covered Kyawak.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Chaeng!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>An arrow hit Ian\u2019s sword and fell down.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kyaak?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblins stared blankly.\u00a0</span><span>Then they raised their weapons in the direction that the arrow flew from. Ian turned his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOh, what is this? It was blocked.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Did you feel guilty?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are you talking about?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They were humans.\u00a0</span><span>Two men and one woman.\u00a0</span><span>The man aimed the arrow again. This time, the bow was aimed towards Ian. As soon as Ian raised his sword, the woman chanted a spell.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Red flames that consume the world, rest on this arrow according to my will. Enchant Fire!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The arrow lit up and the man let go of the bowstring.\u00a0</span><span>The fire arrow flew towards Ian.\u00a0</span><span>Ian reflexively wielded his greatsword.\u00a0</span><span>It hit the arrow but the fire broke out and hit Ian.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUgh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The fire was stuck to his body. Ian gritted his teeth and endured the burning pain. His status window sounded an alarm.\u00a0</span><span>At that moment, Kyawak extended both hands.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kyawah - ak! Kyawah - ak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then an unknown force wrapped around Ian.\u00a0</span><span>The fire disappeared. The pain also went away and strength rose inside his body.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What, a goblin mage? That incantation?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Even dogs and cats are using magic these days.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian raised his gaze.</span></p><br/><p><span>The three humans were having a leisurely conversation in front of the goblins and orcs. White stars shone on their forehead.\u00a0</span><span>They were users.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Wait a minute!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>They stopped as the orc spoke, \"What is it?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am a user.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian took off the Blacksmith Company\u2019s bandana that he was still wearing.\u00a0</span><span>A white star shone on Ian\u2019s forehead. Their eyes widened.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat, an orc user? Orc? Really?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAre you one of those orc users?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That story was true?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>The man lowered his bow and said,\u00a0</span><span>\"Come out from there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Orc, get away from there. Let\u2019s get rid of those beggars.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian turned his head.\u00a0</span><span>The goblins were trembling while holding their weapons.\u00a0</span><span>The tree roots and grass that they had been eating a moment ago were on the floor. Kyawak had a very determined expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Let the goblins go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>They looked at each other.\u00a0</span><span>\"Why? Is it a quest?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I know these goblins.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Their expressions showed that they didn\u2019t understand.\u00a0</span><span>Ian spoke again.\u00a0</span><span>\"They are friends.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Friends?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He raised his greatsword as an answer.\u00a0</span><span>It was a statement that he would attack if they didn\u2019t agree. The goblins watched Ian with impressed eyes.\u00a0</span><span>The users whispered among themselves.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Doesn\u2019t he sound like a role-player?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Well...anyway...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI'd rather...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They came to a conclusion and nodded.\u00a0</span><span>The female magician smiled and said, \u201cOrc! Then if we don\u2019t attack, can you tell us the way?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe way?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. We have a quest but we don\u2019t know the orc territory.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What was it, Basque? Basque Village? We have to go that way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian was also heading there. He nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYah! Thank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The users withdrew.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian looked at Kyawak.\u00a0</span><span>It was earlier than he expected, but it was time to part.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ian kyak, thank you kyak.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Thank you for the nice meal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is nothing kieek. I hope we meet again someday keek. Beware of the north kyaak.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian extended his fist.\u00a0</span><span>Kyawak seemed to know the orc greeting as he bumped it with his small fist. The orc and goblin\u2019s fists hit.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cStay alive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAlive kyak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblins all waved.\u00a0</span><span>Ian parted with the goblins.</span></p><br/><p><span>A user asked, \u201cIt looks like you really are friends with the goblins. When did you meet?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Today.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You are really sociable, to be befriending a goblin in one day. Why did you pick an orc? Just because?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The magician had a lot to say.\u00a0</span><span>The men were an archer and a warrior holding a sword and shield. They looked like moderately high level users.\u00a0</span><span>They originally lived in the city of humans, but they received a quest and came here.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"These big brothers came to help me. In order to acquire a magician skill, I need to get something from an orc shaman.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don't know right now. It\u2019s a power that an orc shaman has and will fuse together to make a new skill. Isn\u2019t it amazing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat's right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If I get this skill, then I will have 10 skills. Huhu. Orc, do you have a lot of skills? Isn\u2019t the orc a hard species to play as?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>As the female magician continued to chatter on, the archer asked from behind, \"Why are you talking so much?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Jeez, what\u2019s wrong with it? This is the first time I\u2019ve seen an orc. Isn\u2019t it also your first time?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That\u2019s correct.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow long have you been an orc? What\u2019s your level?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian answered honestly.\u00a0</span><span>\"Level 10.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"10? You\u2019re still a beginner.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I see, then it isn\u2019t too late. You can still reset.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The tense men relaxed as Ian\u2019s level was revealed.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian looked at the map that he obtained from Orcrox Fortress and guided them.\u00a0</span><span>The closer they got to Basque Village, the more the surroundings started to change.\u00a0</span><span>There were occasional animal skulls hanging from the lush trees and strange altars for magic rituals were everywhere.\u00a0</span><span>Crows cried out over their heads.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is vaguely eerie.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The temperature in the forest was cool. The dense foliage didn\u2019t allow a lot of light to leak through.\u00a0</span><span>The sun soon started sinking. It became even darker. Something seemed to appear beyond the darkness of the dense forest.</span></p><br/><p><span>The female magician stopped talking.\u00a0</span><span>They walked quietly.\u00a0</span><span>After walking a while, a light could be seen.\u00a0</span><span>There was a log house with light coming from the windows. A strange black smoke rose from the chimney.\u00a0</span><span>They looked at each other.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHere...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is dark and the path is hard to see. It would be good to rest here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Let\u2019s try it once.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The house resembled Grant\u2019s log cabin. It was an orc home. Ian took the lead with the three human users following behind him.\u00a0</span><span>Ian knocked on the door.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPlease wait.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A voice was heard from inside.\u00a0</span><span>The door opened and an orc appeared.\u00a0</span><span>He was wearing a necklace made of animal bones and animal skins, looking exactly like the shamans that Ian had seen in Orcrox Fortress.</span></p><br/><p><span>The orc said with a soft expression, \"You are alive, young warrior.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He also greeted the three users behind Ian.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYou are alive, humans.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He opened the door wide. It was as if he knew they were coming.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am the shaman Antuak.

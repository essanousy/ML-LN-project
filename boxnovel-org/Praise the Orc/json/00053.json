Unlike last time, Crockta truly felt admiration. Elves flew in the sky on pegasuses, and a giant spirit walked around with an elf on its shoulder. The buildings were big and beautiful, with the architecture obviously being designed for the purpose of art.</span></p><br/><p><span>This place was the city of elves, Maillard!</span></p><br/><p><span>This city was considered to be the cradle of the elf users. A variety of jobs existed, and the level of the surrounding hunting area wasn\u2019t high, so they could start with ease. It was like heaven compared to Orcrox Fortress.</span></p><br/><p><span>That was the problem.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta shook his head. This was a very well organized place. Here, the elves would run on comfortable roads without knowing any hardships.\u00a0</span><span>If their bodies were comfortable, than their minds would weaken!</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Weak elves...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta muttered with some pride. However, his eyes were attracted to the body of a beautiful elf passing by. He frantically shook his head.\u00a0</span><span>He needed to regain his spirit.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Warriors don\u2019t need women.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Pain was what made a warrior stronger. He shouldn\u2019t lose sight of that just for something temporarily sweet. In order to restore his mindset, he hummed the orc\u2019s song.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWarriors have no need for a woman...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>By the way, something was strange.\u00a0</span><span>Every time he passed by, the residents were staring at Crockta. Orcs weren\u2019t rare in this place. This was a big city, so orcs occasionally passed by.\u00a0</span><span>The question was soon solved by another orc.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta suddenly encountered an orc on the street.\u00a0</span><span>The orc\u2019s eyebrows twitched as he discovered Crockta, promptly approaching him..</span></p><br/><p><span>He was an orc warrior.\u00a0</span><span>Tattoos were engraved on his face and body, and Crockta could feel the strength coming from him.\u00a0</span><span>He extended his fist.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou are alive, Crockta!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>How did the orc know his name?</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"An orc with a black bandana, and the tattoos of honor. Your reputation is spreading all over the continent! An honorable warrior! Bul\u2019tar!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta bumped the orc\u2019s fist.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am the orc Purast! I really admire you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is nice to meet you Purast. I\u2019m not such a great orc.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are you talking about? Rescuing people on the Arnin Plains, and revealing the hypocrisy of the Arnin politicians! You fought for the innocent victims of Chesswood!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He hit his chest.\u00a0</span><span>\"In an era where many warriors have forgotten the laws of years past, you are a warrior worthy of admiration.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell. I don\u2019t deserve such praise.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta nodded.\u00a0</span><span>Then he heard whispers around him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Crockta. That is the famous orc? The orc of justice?\u00a0</span><span>The honorary citizen of Arnin and Chesswood\u2019s hero?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s shoulders went up. He had become stronger and his achievement points had also increased tremendously.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Status Window]</span></p><br/><p><span>'Person Pursuing the Pinnacle\u2019 Crockta, Orc Warrior</span></p><br/><p><span>Level: 39</span></p><br/><p><span>Achievement Points: 76510</span></p><br/><p><span>Assimilation: 80%.</span></p><br/><p><span>Abilities: </span></p><br/><p><span>Orc Warrior\u2019s Destructive Power (Rare)</span></p><br/><p><span>Orc Warrior\u2019s Recovery Power (Rare)</span></p><br/><p><span>Leyteno\u2019s Vigorous Greatsword Technique (Essence)</span></p><br/><p><span>Combative Spirit (Essence)</span></p><br/><p><span>Mind's Eye (Special)</span></p><br/><p><span>Tattoos of Honour (Rare)</span></p><br/><p><span>Crushing Roar (Rare)</span></p><br/><p><span>The highest leveled user in Elder Lord known to date was at level 60. Despite the difficult to grow nature of the game, Crockta was growing at a tremendous rate. More than 400,000 users were admitted to the ranks of the high-level users.</span></p><br/><p><span>Furthermore, he had two Essence ranked skills that were widely known as difficult to obtain. After the bloody battle in Chesswood, Indomitable Fighting Spirit had been upgraded to Combative Spirit. The repeated swinging of the greatsword as he caught the other clan members had also upgraded the previous skill to Leyteno\u2019s Vigorous Greatsword Technique.</span></p><br/><p><span>This didn\u2019t even mention his assimilation rate. In the former [Elder Lord Times] segment, everyone had been shocked when they discovered that Kim Dalkwang\u2019s assimilation rate was 73%. But he had 80%! If it was only looking at assimilation rate, Crockta might be at the peak in Elder Lord.</span></p><br/><p><span>The peak!\u00a0</span><span>What a wonderful word!</span></p><br/><p><span>[Your reputation has spread through the world of Elder Lord.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[The friendliness of any NPCs you meet will increase.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Purast is looking at you with respect.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Purast chuckled and admired, \"I heard that you were humble and intellectual for an orc, and it really is true. Really amazing! You truly aren\u2019t an ordinary orc! Kuhaha!\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>However, Crockta couldn\u2019t accept his words.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta spoke with a firm expression.\u00a0</span><span>\"Orc or not, nobody else can decide such a thing. It is only you who can self-discipline yourself!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Purast, the possibilities of the orcs are infinite!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Purast looked at Crockta with surprise.\u00a0</span><span>That\u2019s right. He was an orc, but he had prejudices against orcs.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was similar to how he saw humans as ambiguous, elves as weak but fast, dwarves as dexterous, and gnomes as just little bastards!\u00a0</span><span>He had used his own yardstick to judge the world, but his eyes were opened now that he met Crockta. He had gained enlightenment. He felt confident, like he could do anything.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta said the following, \"The instructor who taught me said this: Warriors aren\u2019t born, but created.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He is...\u201d Purast replied.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The orc warrior instructor, Lenox.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Purast exclaimed in a low voice, \u201cLenox...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Purast had also heard of his reputation. He had become a warrior through learning under an instructor outside of Orcrox. His instructor had been a disciple of Lenox.\u00a0</span><span>Lenox was the warrior instructor and a true warrior.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLenox! I've heard the news. Those dirty humans...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I will get revenge for him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Revenge!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA warrior pays back each favor or act of vengeance.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIndeed...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Purast grabbed Crockta\u2019s hand.\u00a0</span><span>\"You truly are an honorable orc.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta nodded. He had to admit that he thought that he was a wonderful orc.\u00a0</span><span>Thus, Crockta and Purast talked for a while.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It was an honor to meet you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Purast bumped fists.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Let\u2019s live and see each other again. Bul\u2019tar!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2019tar!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta parted from Purast and continued walking. He felt even prouder. The beautiful elves were staring at him. Crockta puffed up his chest.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Look elves, this is an orc warrior.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cReally scary.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Let\u2019s lower our eyes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The orc of justice is also ugly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019m lucky that it isn\u2019t nighttime right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The elves whispered to each other as they watched Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>Anyway, Crockta was here because of Yiyu.\u00a0</span><span>His little sister, revenge for Yiyu!\u00a0</span><span>If such a diabolical group appeared, it was clear that Yiyu wouldn\u2019t be the only victim. Those people would repeat the same actions. This was because people didn\u2019t change easily.</span></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, Crockta halted.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t change...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Do people really not change?\u00a0</span><span>They didn\u2019t \u2018change\u2019 easily.</span></p><br/><p><span>At one time, he believed that people would never change.\u00a0</span><span>But now he knew.\u00a0</span><span>People changed.\u00a0</span><span>They could change.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A person can be anything,\u201d Crockta muttered.</span></p><br/><p><span>There was a time when he madly wanted change. He thought that it wasn\u2019t possible, so he had felt despair. But he had changed. If a person had the will, they could be who they wanted to be. That was what it meant to be a human being.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You will also change.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta would meet the ones who harassed Yiyu and rehabilitate them. </span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUm...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta stopped in his tracks.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a mirror shop.\u00a0</span><span>Mirrors were expensive things that couldn\u2019t be easily seen in Elder Lord. There were beautiful elf females tidying up their appearance, and then the ridiculous figure of the orc behind them.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked at his reflection in the mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span>An orc wearing a black bandana! He wore leather armor that revealed his thick muscles and carried a huge greatsword on his back. Furthermore, many intricate tattoos were covering his entire body.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta nodded. It was the very nice appearance of a warrior.\u00a0</span><span>However, he wanted to be even greater.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019ve been fighting for a while.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He decided it was time to shop for a change.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am alive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, hello.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The elf clerk was confused by the appearance of the customer.\u00a0</span><span>She operated a clothing store for various species. With the exception of elves and humans, it was a place to sell fashion items for dwarves, orcs, and gnomes.</span></p><br/><p><span>Naturally, the orc this time was also a customer.\u00a0</span><span>However, this was the first time that she had ever seen an orc with tattoos all over his body and a rough appearance, as if he had just come out from the battlefields. She froze as she met his intense gaze.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are you looking for...?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The orc stood in front of a mirror instead of answering.\u00a0</span><span>The orc touched his chin and looked at himself in the mirror for a while. He seemed to nod with satisfaction.\u00a0</span><span>Then he said, \u201cGreat...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGreat...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHeadband.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>In the meantime, the orc Crockta had been using a bandana with the mark of the Blacksmith company. Now it was time to throw it away. He was going to buy a headband to cover the star on his forehead.</span></p><br/><p><span>The elf clerk calmly put out a variety of headbands which were typically used by adventurers to prevent sweat from flowing down their foreheads.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta chose his favorite, a red headband, among the array of headbands.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The point is that it is red. Isn't that right?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh? Yes...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Give me this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThree silver.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was cheap.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta tied the headband at once. There was plenty of room to fit around an orc\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Isn\u2019t it great?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Of course.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The female elf didn\u2019t say that it looked like the headband had turned red from all the blood.\u00a0</span><span>He looked even more evil after taking off the black bandana and donning the red headband.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"How great.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Please throw this away.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The bandana from the Blacksmith Company was thrown in the trash can.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta stepped out of the clothing store, now with a red headband, instead of a black bandana, covering the star on his forehead. The orc\u2019s wild hair seemed to double his wild charm.</span></p><br/><p><span>People glanced at Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta headed to the armor store and bought a set of equipment that was more expensive than his existing leather armor. The base was made of leather, but iron plates padded the important parts, upgrading his defense.</span></p><br/><p><span>He also bought gauntlets and boots to protect his hands and feet, and there was also a belt where he could hang daggers.</span></p><br/><p><span>He looked like a whole new orc.\u00a0</span><span>He had completely thrown off the appearance of a beginner, and now looked like a seasoned orc warrior!</span></p><br/><p><span>Finally, he headed to the blacksmith to check if the greatsword, \u2018Ogre Slayer\u2019, needed any repairs. The dwarf blacksmith\u2019s eyes shone as he received it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was made of the adamantium alloy that was unique to the Golden Anvil Clan. The blacksmith could see it straight away, since only the Golden Anvil Clan could handle adamantium so skillfully.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cAre you a friend of the Golden Anvil Clan?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019m not. My friend is a business partner of the Golden Anvil Clan, so I received this sword.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It was a long time ago that the orcs received weapons from the Golden Anvil Clan. Okay, I\u2019ll do it nicely. Expect it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The dwarf got to work.\u00a0</span><span>After checking the greatsword, Crockta also bought a pair of daggers and two sets of leather armor in case of emergency.</span></p><br/><p><span>He felt reborn as he carried the greatsword on his back.</span></p><br/><p><span>He had run this far. Under Lenox, he had taken the path to become a warrior, and had been involved in various incidents after leaving Orcrox. Now he felt like he had become a true orc.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta straightened his chest and walked.</span></p><br/><p><span>This was why a big city was good. He could see many high quality equipment and goods that he hadn\u2019t seen in the many villages and cities that he had already passed. Crockta finally headed to a general store to buy potions.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>They met again. The Blacksmith Company!\u00a0</span><span>The Blacksmith branch in Maillard.</span></p><br/><p><span>The man called Blacksmith would be a rich man. Branches of the Blacksmith Company were present everywhere he went. Crockta believed in the Blacksmith Company and went inside; however, he instantly turned away.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>No, why was she here?</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta took a deep breath.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Uh, Customer? Come in, come in. Don\u2019t hesitate.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The familiar voice caught Crockta. Crockta didn\u2019t move, but her hand grabbed his arm and started pulling.\u00a0</span><span>\"Orc, do you need potions? Or a knife? What do you need? I sell everything, everything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was Stella.\u00a0</span><span>The intern of the Blacksmith Company whom he sold vegetables with in Anail, Stella!\u00a0</span><span>Moreover, Crockta was convinced that Stella was Yiyu\u2019s friend.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was worried as he slowly turned around.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>But Stella just cocked her head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What is it? Did you want to ask something? Oh, I'm sorry, but I don\u2019t care what species you are.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She didn\u2019t recognize Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian realized why. After going through the warrior\u2019s ritual, he had become bigger and had even gained tattoos. The present Crockta looked completely different from the orc beginner Ian. She didn\u2019t recognize him.</span></p><br/><p><span>How lucky. Crockta spoke in a different tone.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hmm hmm, I came to buy potions...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere are a lot of potions. Come in.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The Blacksmith Company\u2019s branch in Maillard was a big deal. She had ended up being promoted. Her name badge said \u2018Stella, Manager\u2019.\u00a0</span><span>Maybe not all of it was due to him. Crockta inwardly laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>Thus, Crockta tried to buy a pile of potions.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWait.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I want to ask you one thing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Stella told Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta thought his identity had been discovered and flinched.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What do potions mean to you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am an honorable manager, Stella. I will only sell potions to adventurers who understand the value of potions.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Now, tell me!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Stella... No, Yunji.\u00a0</span><span>No.\u00a0</span><span>He couldn\u2019t.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta turned around with saying anything.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Uh, uh, excuse me! Aren\u2019t you buying?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019ll cancel it. I just wanted to try it. Here are the potions!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo! Discount! Discount! I'll give you a discount! Okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta turned back around. Thus, Crockta bought potions at a discounted price from Stella.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Why didn\u2019t it work\u2019...he heard Stella grumble.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019ll ask you one thing,\u201d Crockta said in a serious tone.\u00a0</span><span>\"Do you know any evil people who are picking on the weak in the area?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Stella would\u2019ve heard the rumors. She frowned at Crockta\u2019s question.\u00a0</span><span>\"Perhaps...are you talking about those people?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Those people?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Female users...no, there are those going after females who are cursed by the stars.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Why? Perhaps...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Stella looked at the big greatsword on his back.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I can't let them go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Stella felt admiration.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Wow, orc warrior. How amazing. Then, I will help. My friend was also hurt by them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She seemed to be talking about Yiyu. However, it didn\u2019t seem like she was that close to Yiyu. What was the reason for exchanging greetings at the cafeteria?</span></p><br/><p><span>Speaking of which, he didn\u2019t know that much about Yiyu\u2019s school life. He had a vague idea from the police station incident but didn\u2019t know what she was like outside that..</span></p><br/><p><span>It would be good to find out ore.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOkay.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then we will go when I am off from work!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Thus, Ian and Yunji\u2014Crockta and Stella\u2014accompanied each other for their own purposes.</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule: <strong>Next Patreon goal has been reached!!

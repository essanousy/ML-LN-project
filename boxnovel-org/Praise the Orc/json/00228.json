What are you doing\u00a0</span><em><span>dot</span></em><span>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Huhu, impatient gnome. Wait and see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Why are you so urgent?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am hungry\u00a0</span><em><span>dot</span></em><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo, Anor, and Tashaquil were standing in the middle of a clearing.\u00a0</span><span>A few years had passed since the grey god tried to destroy the world.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo and Anor traveled the continent as they continued the search to find Hedor.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat are you doing now\u00a0</span><em><span>dot</span></em><span>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I met a monster.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>One more person emerged from the bushes. He wiped the blood stains off the pair of swords.\u00a0</span><span>Driden.\u00a0</span><span>He also traveled the continent with Tiyo and Anor.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ogres are slow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta disappeared but his legacy still remained in the world.</span></p><br/><p><span>With the effort of the shamans, the north was fully opened. Under the cooperation of the northern chieftain Surka and Zelkain, the apostle of the world tree, the north began an exchange with the continent.\u00a0</span><span>Now it wasn\u2019t uncommon to see species from the continent in the north or northern orcs on the continent.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBy the way,\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Driden was also in a hurry.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI can\u2019t see a house like Tashaquil said. What happened, Tashaquil?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He glared at Tashaquil.\u00a0</span><span>Tashaquil smiled bitterly at the dark looks from both the gnome and dark elf.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You didn\u2019t do this when there was Crockta...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Crockta is gone\u00a0</span><em><span>dot</span></em><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI only respect results.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anyway, they came to the great forest for one reason.\u00a0</span><span>The shaman Antuak, who reached the heights of a demigod.\u00a0</span><span>It was in order to meet him.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo\u2019s group pursued Hedor and realized that the clue led to Antuak.</span></p><br/><p><span>The only one able to track Antuak was Tashaquil, so they asked him to find his teacher.\u00a0</span><span>That\u2019s why Tashaquil joined Tiyo\u2019s party. Tashaquil\u2019s magic was saying that Antuak was here.\u00a0</span><span>It was clearly this place.\u00a0</span><span>However, neither his teacher or his home was visible.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He is your shaman teacher, what complete nonsense\u00a0</span><em><span>dot</span></em><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAn empty wagon makes the most noise. How disappointing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Isn\u2019t it time to retire\u00a0</span><em><span>dot</span></em><span>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>In Basque Village, the disciples would shut up in Tashaquil just coughed. Now this gnome and dark elf were treating him like this.\u00a0</span><span>It was sad. Tashaquil missed the warrior Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCough! These guys. Wait and see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tashaquil closed his eyes and concentrated.\u00a0</span><span>Antuak was here.\u00a0</span><span>Antuak was someone with a higher understanding in the power of space and time than the gods. It was obvious that he created his own space by overlapping dimensions.\u00a0</span><span>He was here but also somewhere else.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tashaquil used magic. He began to explore the surroundings with magic power.\u00a0</span><span>He was the blue guardian of the sunrise, the pale blue standard bearer who guided the shamans, Tashaquil.\u00a0</span><span>There was nothing that he couldn\u2019t reveal.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tashaquil was determined. HIs magic power started to strip away at the edges of the dimension.\u00a0</span><span>Any other shaman would be crying out with amazing at the sight!</span></p><br/><p><span>Sweat covered his forehead.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat are you doing\u00a0</span><em><span>dot</span></em><span>?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tashaquil opened his eyes at the sudden sound.\u00a0</span><span>\"Why are you just standing there? Come quickly\u00a0</span><em><span>dot</span></em><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A house had appeared in a spot where there was nothing. Antuak opened the door and was welcoming Anor and Driden.\u00a0</span><span>Antuak had revealed himself.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo shook his head,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI can\u2019t believe Crockta called him a great shaman\u00a0</span><em><span>dot</span></em><span>...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He was speechless. Tashaquil couldn\u2019t say anything.\u00a0</span><span>Antuak welcomed his guests and student.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt has been a while, Tashaquil.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is the first time since that day. Teacher.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He was referring to the day when Crockta defeated the grey god and saved the world from destruction.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYour wife...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ah, Aruna?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Antuak smiled.\u00a0</span><span>\"She is resting in the temple of the goddess of mercy. For the time being, she needs to be immersed in the holy water there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAhh, I\u2019m glad.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was thanks to the grey god.\u00a0</span><span>She fell to another dimension and used Elder Lord to return to this world. Thus, her understanding about different dimensions expanded.</span></p><br/><p><span>She might\u2019ve sinned, but she was also a divine person and an important part of this world. She received the sentence of being detained in Olympus, but Antuak, who was recognized as a demigod, met her and asked for advice about Aruna.</span></p><br/><p><span>The grey god told him how to save Aruna and Antuak finally succeeded in rescuing his wife.\u00a0</span><span>The day she opened her eyes, all the flowers in the world forgot about the seasons and bloomed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I would like to say hello to her.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe will go together when it is time. She also wants to see you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tashaquil smiled.\u00a0</span><span>A beautiful bouquet was placed on the bed where she once lay.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen why did Crockta\u2019s friends come to see me?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Antuak asked.</span></p><br/><p><span>At Antuak\u2019s question, Tiyo wiped his mouth and stopped eating the soup that was served.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAntuak! Do you perhaps know Hedor?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hoh...Hedor...you look a lot like him. Are you related to Hedor?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHedor is my father\u00a0</span><em><span>dot</span></em><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Antuak burst out laughing at TIyo\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kulkulkul, yes, Hedor\u2019s son. Indeed.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\"Indeed, the bloodline hasn\u2019t gone anywhere. Hedor is the greatest adventurer I\u2019ve ever known. It isn\u2019t surprising that his son helped save the world. Kulkul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do you know my father\u00a0</span><em><span>dot</span></em><span>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI know.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Antuak looked at him with a strange expression.\u00a0</span><span>\"If you are looking for him, you will need me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhere is my father\u00a0</span><em><span>dot</span></em><span>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"In a world that only I know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>After the day where he separated from Crockta, Tiyo had been upset for a while before moving.\u00a0</span><span>He decided to find his father Hedor.\u00a0</span><span>Anor happily followed him and Driden joined. They had traveled the world, following Hedor\u2019s trail.</span></p><br/><p><span>From Orcrox, the trail led again to the empire in the south. Then from the empire to the north. They wandered around the areas outside the maps. Hedor\u2019s trail was hard to catch.\u00a0</span><span>Eventually, they received a clue that led to Antuak.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I think we finally got it. Tiyo!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor shouted with a completely empty bowl in front of him. Driden nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Your father is a gnome but keeps wandering around everywhere. Really, it is tiring.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Hedor was an adventurer who explored the north before it was opened and wandered all over the world.\u00a0</span><span>Then where the hell was he now?</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Collected ancient relics and...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Collected?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo, Anor and Driden focused on Antuak.\u00a0</span><span>Antuak smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He went beyond this dimension.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The faces of the trio became strange.</span></p><br/><p><span>Now.</span></p><br/><p><span>Dimensional movement.\u00a0</span><span>They followed him to islands not on a map and broke through nameless mountain ranges. They struggled with monsters that they saw for the first time in their lives.\u00a0</span><span>The group overcame many risky situations and barely reached here.\u00a0</span><span>But now it was dimensional movement.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMy wife Aruna failed, but he succeeded. He gathered the ancient relics, opened the wall between dimensions and entered a new world. I don\u2019t know when he will come back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"W-W-Where...another dimension?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That's right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat dimension\u00a0</span><em><span>dot</span></em><span>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The stunned Tiyo shouted. Antuak shrugged.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Well...before he left, he told me...it was...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It was?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is known as \u2018Earth.\u2019 I don\u2019t know it very well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Everyone was frustrated.\u00a0</span><span>The scale was too big.\u00a0</span><span>The adventurer Hedor, what the hell was he doing?</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo hit his head on the table before looking up.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kukukukuk...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He was laughing crazily. Anor and Driden looked at him with fearful eyes.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo\u2019s eyes were bright with madness.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen it can\u2019t be helped\u00a0</span><em><span>dot</span></em><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cD-Don\u2019t tell me...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Wait. Tiyo. Slow down.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGo\u00a0</span><em><span>dot</span></em><span>!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo shouted.\u00a0</span><span>\"We will go there, to another dimension</span><em><span>\u00a0dot</span></em><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor and Driden tried to stop Tiyo.\u00a0</span><span>However, Antuak spoke again.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don\u2019t know it, but I heard the name again while talking to the grey god.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The place called Earth...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Antuak smiled.\u00a0</span><span>\"Crockta is also there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Their friend was there.\u00a0</span><span>Anor, who was blocking Tiyo\u2019s mouth, lowered his hand. Driden let go of Tiyo\u2019s hands.\u00a0</span><span>At that moment, the decision was made.\u00a0</span><span>They would leave for a new dimension.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"But in order to go there, you need to find ancient ruins and collect artifacts. They are in very dangerous places, with many monsters moving around. Hedor almost died many times.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter</span><em><span>\u00a0dot</span></em><span>!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo jumped up.</span></p><br/><p><span>He shouted to Crockta at the moment of parting.\u00a0</span><span>\u2018I will see you again.\u2019\u00a0</span><span>He wasn\u2019t like Crockta, who left without keeping his promise. Manly Tiyo. The man who upheld his promises.\u00a0</span><span>He would find his father and meet Crockta again.\u00a0</span><span>In the dimension called \u2018Earth!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLet\u2019s go</span><em><span>\u00a0dot</span></em><span>! Everyone be prepared!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They joined their hands together.\u00a0</span><span>It was a hot scene.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tashaquil muttered at the sight,\u00a0</span><span>\u2018Too young.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat are you doing, Tashaquillll!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo shouted. Tashaquil jolted with surprise.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"W-What?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Quickly put your hand in! Let\u2019s go</span><em><span>\u00a0dot</span></em><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"No, I only came to help for a bit...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Another dimension\u00a0</span><em><span>dot</span></em><span>! You are coming too! Come on! An adventure\u00a0</span><em><span>dot</span></em><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tashquil raised his hand with a grouchy expression.\u00a0</span><span>Thus, the \u2018dimensional expedition\u2019 team was formed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGo\u00a0</span><em><span>dot</span></em><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I have a debt.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo, I, wait...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They would leave.\u00a0</span><span>For a new world.\u00a0</span><span>To meet Hedor and Crockta!</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKiyoooooh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWho?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo, this face looks familiar. This person?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian cocked his head.\u00a0</span><span>A short man had just passed by.\u00a0</span><span>He was a small man dressed nicely in foreign clothes. It was an appearance that seemed familiar, but Ian wasn\u2019t sure from where.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hrmm, who is he?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Ian wondered before smiling awkwardly at the woman next to him.\u00a0</span><span>It was a face he always looked at, but it was unsettling so close up.\u00a0</span><span>His heart pounded and his face reddened.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOppa, do you know a lot of people?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian didn\u2019t have many close relationships. It was true.\u00a0</span><span>But he felt somewhat dissatisfied when she pointed it out. So he pouted and said,\u00a0</span><span>\"I know a lot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWho? Yiyu?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There is Hayeon and...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ah, he said the wrong thing.\u00a0</span><span>The woman, which was Yeori, stiffened. Ian placed a hand on her shoulder and laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHahaha. It\u2019s cold. It is already autumn. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...Take off your hand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Yeori continued to be stiff in front of his attempts at humor. In the end, Yeori smiled once.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou smiled, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo? Does Hayeon-ssi like these type of old-fashioned jokes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShe\u2019s just a friend.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then I will go and meet my friends. There is the intelligent Mincheol and Gyeonghwan has been contacting me lately...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian\u2019s face stiffened.\u00a0</span><span>But she was unfazed, unlike Ian. Yeori smiled and grabbed Ian\u2019s arm tightly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOppa. Why? Are you jealous?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He couldn\u2019t resist it when she acted like this.\u00a0</span><span>Ian started laughing.</span></p><br/><p><span>She asked, \u201cIs Yiyu doing well?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"She\u2019s the same. Right now, she\u2019s busy preparing for a job interview. Oh, she\u2019s also going to a private school for interview tips. I guess it\u2019s hard to get a job these days.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s tough, even my friends are also struggling. I was lucky to meet a nice boss like you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You\u2019re the best.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The two looked at each other and smiled.\u00a0</span><span>At that moment.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Isn\u2019t this a good picture?]</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian frowned.\u00a0</span><span>It had been a year since the Elder Lord incident. People tried to find out who Crockta was, but he didn\u2019t reveal himself.\u00a0</span><span>Over time, the Elder Lord situation was gradually forgotten. The fact that so many lives almost died also dulled. The world started flowing normally again.\u00a0</span><span>But one thing hadn\u2019t changed.</span></p><br/><p><span>[I\u2019m bored.]</span></p><br/><p><span>The grey god.\u00a0</span><span>He still had a connection with her.\u00a0</span><span>How was she still able to talk to Ian?\u00a0</span><span>According to her words, her efforts to return to her original world had resulted in the boundaries between dimensions loosening.\u00a0</span><span>Anyway, the grey god was very happy about the situation. She was imprisoned in Olympus, so she was bored and had nothing to do except talk to Ian.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian sighed and whispered, \"Don\u2019t talk to me because I am on a date.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNothing. I\u2019m talking to myself. What movie did you want to see?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018The Uncle who Returned.\u2019 The protagonist is called Lee Jungmin. Ah, I am lucky today. Lee Jungmin is really handsome.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The grey god kept talking,</span></p><br/><p><span>[Ian. In fact, I have something to say.]</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I'll buy the tickets. Can you wait?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLet\u2019s go together. Why do you want to go alone?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI need to go to the bathroom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUmm. I understand. The popcorn is caramel flavor. The drink is Cola!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Yeori sat down at a table in front of the cinema kiosk while Ian went to the bathroom.\u00a0</span><span>He entered a toilet stall and spoke to the grey god.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[Don\u2019t be angry.]</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am angry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[Then I won\u2019t speak.]</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There is no time so tell me quickly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The grey god was lonely after being confined. The grey god hesitated before saying.</span></p><br/><p><span>[I understand. I fell into your world... you know I tried a lot to get back right?]</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian's face became serious.\u00a0</span><span>The grey god wouldn\u2019t repeat her story for no reason. It also hurt her. He had a bad feeling.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian asked,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cSo?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[So...the walls between dimensions are much looser than before. It seems like someone has nudged it.]</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What does that mean?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[There is a possibility that a third dimension will be opened. I can't say exactly what, but it might cause problems in your world. It isn\u2019t normal that we can keep talking to each other.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian cocked his head. It was a serious but still unknown story.</span></p><br/><p><span>Thus, Ian decided to forget about it for the moment.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI understand. Don\u2019t talk to me anymore because I am watching a movie.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[Movie? Ah, I want to see it as well. When it is over, you should explain it to me.]</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[Who is the protagonist?]</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Lee Jungmin.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>[Wow. I\u2019m envious.

Beyond that, the roar of a beast was heard.</span></p><br/><p><span>A monster.\u00a0</span><span>It was a monster Ian had never seen before.\u00a0</span><span>It was like a demon climbing up from hell.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOh my god!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCall the police!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>People screamed.\u00a0</span><span>It was an unreal sight.\u00a0</span><span>This wasn\u2019t Elder Lord.

However, its whole body was shedding a black liquid.\u00a0</span><span>Two red eyes, like a giant insect.</span></p><br/><p><span>It looked around.\u00a0</span><span>Then it smiled.\u00a0</span><span>The monster looked like it had found fun prey.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKIiiiiii!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It struck with a screech. Cars flew through the air. It was the overwhelming destructive power. The street was on fire.\u00a0</span><span>Ian turned around. Yeori was trembling and couldn\u2019t move. He grabbed her shoulder and tried to run away with her.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was at that moment,</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Motherrrrrrr!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The scream of a young child rang out.\u00a0</span><span>Ian looked back. \u00a0</span><span>A child was hanging from the monster\u2019s claws. The child cried and called for her mother. The woman who seemed to be her mother was screaming.</span></p><br/><p><span>The monster\u2019s mouth opened.\u00a0</span><span>The child\u2019s head neared it.\u00a0</span><span>It would soon chew and swallow the child.</span></p><br/><p><span>The monster rolled its eyes and grinned. It was a mocking gaze.\u00a0</span><span>Ian\u2019s hair rose as he felt anger.\u00a0</span><span>However, he was Jung Ian. He wasn\u2019t Crockta. He didn\u2019t have the power to crush monsters.

This is Lee Jungmin.</span></p><br/><p><span>I was able to continue writing this thanks to all the readers. If you haven\u2019t read this story, it would be no different from me writing a soliloquy on a notepad. I sincerely thank all the readers.</span></p><br/><p><span>This was my first proper novel so I was worried about how to end it. There were many lacking areas and some regrets, but thanks to your patience, I was able to complete it.</span></p><br/><p><span>In addition, I would like to thank the editors, the team leader and the publishing company who gave me the opportunity and continued to believe in me. \u315c \u315c I gave them a lot of trouble.</span></p><br/><p><span>This was my first monetized work and I hope you stayed to see the end of the brave warrior, Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>I would like to speak a little bit. [Praise the Orc!] is finished, but my life isn\u2019t over yet...\u314b\u314b\u314b</span><span>I hope that you continue to follow Lee Jungmin, the keyboard worker who is still lacking skills.\u315c\u315c\u314b\u314b\u314b</span><span>Then I will be preparing my next work.\u00a0</span><span>I don\u2019t know what it is, but it isn\u2019t a world that continues or shares the world of [Praise the Orc!]. ^^</span><span>I will end the story of Crockta and his friends here.</span><span>\u00a0I\u2019ll be back in the near future.</span></p><br/><p><span>I would like to express my sincere gratitude to everyone who read this.</span></p><br/><p><span>Stay alive until we meet the next time.... Bul\u2019tar...~~~~!</span></p><br/><p><span>Translator\u2019s Note:\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Thank you to all the readers who stuck with this novel. Thank you to my editors Superposhposh and LD who helped out near the end. Praise the Orc was probably one of my favorite novels that I have translated so far. The author said that his next work won\u2019t involve Crockta, but he does leave room for a sequel, so maybe he\u2019ll come back to it later.</span></p><br/><p><span>I haven\u2019t decided my next novel yet. I am currently torn between two choices. I will \u00a0I say this every time, and people never listen, but no suggestions, please. Trust me, I know all the Korean novels that you would know and want to be translated and have probably already considered them or dropped them. (Cue dozens of comments asking me to translate something, with half of them probably not even Korean).</span></p><br/><p><span>Anyway, I will continue translating BEM and will come back soon with the next novel to be translated.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

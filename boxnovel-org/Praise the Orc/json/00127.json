All of them were rugged and rough looking men.\u00a0</span><span>Such men had fallen at Baek Hanho\u2019s gentle hand.</span></p><br/><p><span>She was just an ordinary person who had a house nearby and wanted to become healthy.\u00a0</span><span>She laughed awkwardly when Baek Hanho stood in front of her.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHahaha... Manager-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Have you practiced what I taught you before? Let me see it once. One two!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She closed her eyes.\u00a0</span><span>Then she extended her fist awkwardly.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Hwiik.</span></i><i><span>Hwiik.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>\"One two, one two!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAih!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Double this time!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUhh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Two one two one!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Hwik hwik.</span></i><i><span>Hwik!</span></i><i><span>Hwik hwik hwik.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>She flailed around.\u00a0</span><span>The previous men had fallen down right away.\u00a0</span><span>But for some reason, Baek Hanho was nodding.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Good.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You have been here for three months?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cFour months...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHahaha. That is very good. Exercising is good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She couldn\u2019t help nodding dumbly because she had just witnessed a one-month member collapse from a low kick 1cm under the waist.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"But keep this in mind. Our physical body is a weapon. Martial arts is murder.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If possible, especially if you are a woman, try to resolve the situation without fighting.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Baek Hanho gazed at a distant place and said.\u00a0</span><span>\"It is a knight\u2019s mission to protect ladies but this world...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She forced a smile as Baek Hanho started talking nonsense.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Knights have disappeared in modern times...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Someone should tell him.\u00a0</span><span>But he was already in his own world. There was no one in this gym who could stop him.</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment.\u00a0</span><span>\"What are you doing?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was Ian.\u00a0</span><span>Ian stood behind Baek Hanho. He looked at Baek Hanho with questioning eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHum hum, you came.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy are you speaking strange words all of a sudden?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What type of strange things was I saying?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Play games a bit more moderately.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Who are you to say...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian and Baek Hanho started to walk towards the manager\u2019s office while talking.</span></p><br/><p><span>The female member stared blankly after them.\u00a0</span><span>After being left alone, the female member punched the sandbag and thought about Baek Hanho\u2019s words.\u00a0</span><span>Their bodies were a weapon. Martial arts was murder.\u00a0</span><span>And \u2018ladies.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>She laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"How old-fashioned.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then she quietly stared into the air. Her hands were making strange gestures.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMagic is to save people.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>In Elder Lord, she was a magician.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What have you been doing? Yeori is worried about you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u00a0</span><span>\"Yeori?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes, Yeori.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"When did you talk to Yeori?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A little while ago.\"\u00a0</span><span>As Ian stared at him, Baek Hanho shrugged and shook his head.\u00a0</span><span>\"Oh, she showed interest because I am the one who taught you, but that is it. So don\u2019t glare at me like that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is hard to believe when looking at you. Aren\u2019t you playing as a knight too much in the game?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This kid, insulting your teacher. In the old days, this would be punished.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian laughed.\u00a0</span><span>\"What...if you are capable...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian and Baek Hanho\u2019s eyes clashed again. Sparks were flying from both pairs of eyes.\u00a0</span><span>It felt like they would head back to the ring again, but the two of them shook their heads and leaned back.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I guess I\u2019m too tired...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI did say...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian wanted to take a break for a while after fighting Calmahart. While the capsule allowed him to control his character without moving a muscle, he was still mentally exhausted.\u00a0</span><span>Baek Hanho was also tired from his activities in Elder Lord so he didn\u2019t want to bother with Ian.</span></p><br/><p><span>They just leaned back in their chairs. Baek Hanho sighed and asked.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat species are you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s a secret.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Class?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSecret.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis guy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What about Teacher? Are you a knight?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Will you tell me if I tell you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Phew, I brought up my disciple wrongly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is because of Teacher that your disciple grew up like this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell...your words aren\u2019t wrong.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Baek Hanho laughed as he leaned back in his chair.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cIan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"These days, this guy has been running wild.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Baek Hanho raised a hand and a video appeared on the television screen that occupied a wall of the manager\u2019s office.\u00a0</span><span>Ian flinched.\u00a0</span><span>It was Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>To other people, Crockta looked really hideous.\u00a0</span><span>A heinous face, a fearsome body that was covered in tattoos, a hand that held the ignorantly large greatsword, regardless of fatigue.\u00a0</span><span>Just looking at his appearance, he seemed like a villain.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t like him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cW-Why?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I was trying to catch the enemy called Calmahart, but this guy finished it before I could even start.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Baek Hanho changed the screen.\u00a0</span><span>This time, it was the best video site in the world, Youvids. The main screen of Youvids was filled with Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>After the news of Calmahart\u2019s defeat had spread, the value of Righteous Orc Crockta rose again, meaning videos of Laney and other users who filmed him were constantly rising.</span></p><br/><p><span>The number of views had already reached the peak.\u00a0</span><span>Video\u2019s of Choi Hansung\u2019s war had been pushed to the next level by Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I will catch this guy!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Baek Hanho cried out.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian stilled.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat, are you scared?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...No.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Baek Hanho nodded. \u00a0</span><span>\u201cI know. He is a frightening guy. No matter how strong he is, he is still a monster in the game! He has ridiculous strength and physical abilities.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s battle footage.</span></p><br/><p><span>Chesswood.\u00a0</span><span>Ian\u2019s mind sank into the memories of that time. Innocent people had died. They weren\u2019t NPCs. Those who actually existed were killed by users connected to Elder Lord.\u00a0</span><span>Due to the \u2018cognitive modification\u2019 power of the god, others couldn\u2019t even understand this possibility.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLook. That beast-like movement.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>It was a scene where Crockta pierced through spears and swords, killing them all. He jumped into the middle of enemy territory.\u00a0</span><span>The users started to run away. Crockta chased and stabbed his sword in their backs.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The amazing thing is the speed of development.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>This time, it was a video of the past.\u00a0</span><span>Three players were confronting an orc. It was the user hunters he bumped into at Anail.\u00a0</span><span>They wanted to kill Crockta but he took the lives of the enemies in a flash.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The boldness and determination are amazing. This person knows how to fight properly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a compliment from Baek Hanho but Ian felt strangely anxious.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian asked.\u00a0</span><span>\"So?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I have to catch this guy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...Why?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t like him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian looked at Baek Hanho\u2019s expression.\u00a0</span><span>He was sincere.\u00a0</span><span>That expression, he was going to swing his sword as soon as Crockta returned to the continent.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian calmly said.\u00a0</span><span>\"Hold on. Crockta is strong, righteous and popular. He even has a fan club.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cFan club? I am one too.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Huhuhu, do you want to know?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDon\u2019t lie.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This guy...really. Of course, I won\u2019t tell you. You can just wonder.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Baek Hanho changed the screen again. As he did so, he unwittingly opened the menu of his favorite Youvids videos.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Baek Hanho hurriedly turned it off and looked to see if Ian had seen his favorites menu.\u00a0</span><span>Fortunately, Ian was checking his phone.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are you looking at?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Nothing.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Baek Hanho coughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I have to go now. I need to show my face at the cafe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. Don\u2019t just let other people do the work. Unearned income makes people sick.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>In fact, the gym was mostly run under Baek Hanho\u2019s supervision.\u00a0</span><span>Ian shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Take care.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You too.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian left Baek Hanho\u2019s gym.\u00a0</span><span>Then he headed towards Cafe Reason.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>He didn\u2019t come empty-handed. He stopped by the bakery and bought a few things.</span></p><br/><p><span>After arriving at Cafe Reason, Han Yeori grumbled and gave some to Yoo Sooyeon, who was arranging a few minor things on the counter.\u00a0</span><span>There were customers.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian opened his phone while sipping a latte that he made.\u00a0</span><span>He entered a search term.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018White Knight Andre.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian had briefly seen Baek Hanho\u2019s favorites list.\u00a0</span><span>Baek Hanho\u2019s favorites were filled with videos of a user called White Knight Andre. Immediately after confirming it, he pretended to be doing something else.</span></p><br/><p><span>If he knew his enemy, he could win.\u00a0</span><span>Baek Hanho would surely come to him.\u00a0</span><span>It would be in the world of Elder Lord.</span></p><br/><p><span>The first kill!\u00a0</span><span>He would do it.</span></p><br/><p><span>The name \u2018White Knight Andre\u2019 was well-known.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Uh, Boss-nim knows about Andre?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Han Yeori approached and sat down next to him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou know him?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I know. He is really cool.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...Cool?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian looked at the video playing with questionable eyes and Han Yeori said.\u00a0</span><span>\"I don\u2019t play the game but I\u2019ve seen videos of this person.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then Ian almost spat out his coffee at the close-up appearance of the character.</span></p><br/><p><span>Dazzling blonde hair.\u00a0</span><span>Clear blue eyes. A straight nose, white skin with no wrinkles and soft pink lips. Silver plated armor covered the entire body.\u00a0</span><span>It was the appearance of a medieval young knight.\u00a0</span><span>How much work could be done to customize his appearance to such an extent?</span></p><br/><p><span>Furthermore, he was riding on a beautiful white horse with a flowing mane.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIsn\u2019t he cool?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUm...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Ian nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>In the video, Baek Hanho, no White Knight Andre was speaking.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Diabolical ones who wield a sword against a lady.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He got down from his horse.\u00a0</span><span>He rubbed the forehead of the white horse, as if telling it to wait a moment, before raising his sword towards the enemies in front of him. I</span><span>t was a well-worn longsword.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am Knight Andre, and I will let you know what justice is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he rushed towards the enemies in front of him.\u00a0</span><span>The opponents were bandits equipped with axes and swords. They swung their weapons. They were confused at first by Andre\u2019s splendor but gained confidence due to their belief in their numerical superiority.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, that only lasted for a short moment.\u00a0</span><span>Andre\u2019s sleek swordsmanship stopped their breaths.\u00a0</span><span>There was no gory battle with blood and flesh.\u00a0</span><span>One pierce that gracefully penetrated the enemy\u2019s weak points.\u00a0</span><span>Fluid techniques.</span></p><br/><p><span>All the enemies were destroyed. White Knight Andre turned softly.\u00a0</span><span>The female NPC, who had been threatened by the bandits, stared at him blankly. Andre approached and grabbed her hand.\u00a0</span><span>Then he kissed the back of her hand and winked softly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Lady. I took care of the opponents. Please rest assured.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A sweet smile!\u00a0</span><span>Then the video faded out.</span></p><br/><p><span>Han Yeori poked Ian\u2019s side.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cSo cool. He is a real Prince Charming. Isn't that right? Boss-nim?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>However, Ian knew the reality so he couldn\u2019t nod.\u00a0</span><span>Han Yeori giggled and went back to the counter.\u00a0</span><span>Ian wanted to erase his memories, no he wanted to clean his eyes and forget he ever saw this video.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian read the comments.\u00a0</span><span>At first, there were compliments.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2514 Milky Andre: I'm Andre\u2019s fan! ^^ Continue the video!

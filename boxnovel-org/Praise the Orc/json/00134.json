All abilities have suddenly decreased.]</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I'm sorry.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta said, not looking very apologetic. They were standing in a vacant lot.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I didn\u2019t know you would be that weak.\u201d The orc shrugged, looking like a demon. \"I\u2019m really glad that you are cursed by the stars. Kulkulkulkul!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo had just died.</span></p><br/><p><span>After he died and the connection was terminated, he had stared at the capsule before quickly rushing to re-connect.\u00a0</span><span>During the spar, he had been unable to escape Ogre Slayer flying towards his abdomen and the huge sword had gone through his abdomen.\u00a0</span><span>He had stared with disbelief at the blood before slowly collapsing.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...It seems so,\u201d Kenzo replied, but he hadn\u2019t forgotten Crockta\u2019s expression as he turned into white particles.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Ah, I made a mistake.\u2019 It was such an expression.</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo had never mentioned that he was a being cursed by the stars to Crockta. In other words, Crockta didn\u2019t know that Kenzo would survive his death.\u00a0</span><span>Nevertheless, Crockta had attacked to kill and there was only a faint response to Kenzo\u2019s death.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSo will you continue?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Did he have to continue this training? Had he made a mistake? Were orcs rougher and more heinous than he thought?\u00a0</span><span>Crockta seemed respectful to other people despite his appearance, but he changed in battle.\u00a0</span><span>There were often images of berserk orcs fighting regardless of their own well-being. So, orcs might not care about dying during training. Rather, they might consider it an honor to die like that.</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo\u2019s face turned pale. \"For the next week, don\u2019t kill me...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I can\u2019t control that.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta started swinging his greatsword again as Kenzo retreated one step.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s swordsmanship was impressive and Kenzo couldn\u2019t predict the trajectory of the greatsword. Furthermore, it was impossible to follow along with Crockta\u2019s speed and strength.</span></p><br/><p><span>He wouldn\u2019t have thought it was possible if he hadn\u2019t seen it himself.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAnyway, this is what training is. Kulkulkul. I can swing freely now that I don\u2019t have to worry about you dying.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That's not it...hiik!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo twisted his body and avoided the greatsword. There was a burning mark on his cheek.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was laughing like a demon as he asked, \"Have you slowed down?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOur abilities, for some time after dying...uwah! They are reduced!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see. That is even better.\u201d Crockta attacked again and Kenzo stepped back. \"Don\u2019t rely on your power and speed; fight with your heart.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo tried to swing his claymore to block an attack but he felt the power and avoided it instead.\u00a0</span><span>As he continued to back away, Crockta stopped.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to become stronger?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI want to become stronger. But...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBut?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The level difference seems too high. Those who are cursed can\u2019t come back forever. I might really die. If you could use some control...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>This was an exaggeration. He would keep surviving. Continue.\u00a0</span><span>But it wasn\u2019t completely a lie. He would still live, but the lethargy of death would continue to overlap, his stats would be very low and the after effects could last for months or even years.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the penalty that users were most afraid of.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grinned. \"Isn\u2019t that better?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cY-Yes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do it desperately Kenzo.\u201d Crockta stepped forward. Kenzo retreated. \u201cLook at me clearly in the face of death.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta pointed at himself.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If you want to become stronger, look at me clearly. With your two eyes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s atmosphere changed.\u00a0</span><span>It was like when he was meditating last night.\u00a0</span><span>It felt like the time of the world was flowing differently with him. No, it seemed as though he was adjusting the time of the world.</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo felt himself become slow and stagnant, while the world was accelerating. It was hard to follow the flow of time just facing Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>The sunlight shone on the vacant lot. Sweat flowed down. His eyelids shook. A flash.\u00a0</span><span>His eyelids moved the moment he sensed it. Ogre Slayer was approaching him.\u00a0</span><span>Kenzo freaked out as there was no time to think. His body responded immediately as he wielded his claymore, the two weapons colliding.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kaaaang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>\"Fight me while thinking you will really die,\u201d Crockta declared as their swords struck each other.</span></p><br/><p><span>He smiled and kicked Kenzo, who was rolling across the ground in pain.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do what you said, do it with the idea that death is really the end.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta thought it was the biggest limitation about the users.\u00a0</span><span>They would revive if they died. To them, this world wasn\u2019t real. Therefore, the rate of assimilation was low and such an attitude led to uncertainties about themselves.\u00a0</span><span>It was just like how the boxer had to see the fist that was flying. They had to look straight at this world.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I understand.\u201d Kenzo\u2019s face became determined and his heart had hardened.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat look is good! Again!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta wielded his greatsword. Kenzo took a posture to stand up against Crockta. It wasn\u2019t just for evasion, but to occasionally wield the sword in a counterattack.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Open your mouth! Bul\u2019tarrrr!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta jumped and aimed the greatsword towards Kenzo.\u00a0</span><span>Since Kenzo became serious, Crockta also started to control his power.</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo barely blocked the blow with his claymore. Then he responded by aiming towards Crockta\u2019s abdomen.</span></p><br/><p><span>He rushed in and shouted, \u201cBul\u2019tarrrr!\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo was showing Anor around Quantes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe continent is really incredible...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It isn\u2019t just the continent, but Quantes that is great </span><i><span>dot.</span></i><span> Kahahat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor was already amazed by the bathing facilities in Quantes, and now he couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off the performances on the streets.\u00a0</span><span>It was a place rich in culture, from singers and musicians to gnomes putting on a puppet show.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Good </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>. I'm going to show you a great time at the Opera </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOpera?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Theatre, music, art, literature, it can be called the crystallization of the art </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don\u2019t know what to expect, but I am looking forward to it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It will be a show </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo led Anor to the \u2018Street of Arts\u2019 in Quantes.\u00a0</span><span>There were gnome musicians performing on the street, art stores selling artworks and citizens wandering the area in peculiar clothes, giving the area a quaint atmosphere.\u00a0</span><span>There was a large building in the center. The \u2018Opera Stadium\u2019, this was the best venue that all artists in Quantes dreamed about.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This work is...The Bird That Drinks Tears.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The Bird That Drinks Tears?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo said with an excited expression.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is a classic masterpiece...the story of the bird who is the most beautiful singer among four birds.\u201d (Based on a book by one of the best fantasy authors in Korea. Wiki link.)</span></p><br/><p><span>\"At best, isn\u2019t it just a story? No matter how it is performed, wouldn\u2019t reading the story be better?

The show was about to begin. Then Tiyo made a difficult expression.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUh. I didn\u2019t bring enough money </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then don\u2019t overdo it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHey Anor, did you bring any money </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve been on the continent, so where will I get money? Let\u2019s just go next time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShut up </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! I want to see this today! With my own eyes!\u201d Tiyo shouted. \u201cI! Want to see </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You don\u2019t have money, so what will you see?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShut up, you hillbilly </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! You\u2019ve never seen the opera...! Whoops.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hillbilly? You little fu...oof!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"C-Calm down </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The ticket employee watched them and spoke up. \u201cGuests. You have the money but you aren\u2019t carrying it on you, is that correct?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The employee was a gnome. Tiyo nodded at his interruption.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Indeed</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>. I am Tiyo. Do you know me? If you don\u2019t know me in Quantes then you are a spy</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I just recently came to this city...hahahat. By the way, perhaps I can help you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Help?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201dHe pointed to the side. \"If you go to that alley...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf I go?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere are some friends who will give money to customers like you. You clearly have the money but am in a temporary liquidity crisis. Isn\u2019t this a very unfair situation?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDefinitely</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then you can borrow the money right now and pay it back later.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ohh, I see. Wait for me </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! Let's go Anor!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hahat. I\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo turned around. Anor caught up to him. \"Wait a minute. This is completely...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCompletely?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A loan...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI have money </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! Tomorrow I will come back and pay it off straight away</span><i><span> dot!</span></i><span>\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Still, it is a little questionable...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Follow me </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo insisted so they entered the alley behind the Opera Stadium. There were one gnome and two humans smoking. As soon as Tiyo and Anor appeared, the smokers greeted them with a smile.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHello!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hello! Did you receive an introduction?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right </span><i><span>dot.</span></i><span>\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We are the \u2018Run on Money\u2019 business that works using a credit system. Hahaha. Trust and faith is our slogan. How much do you need?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor was reluctant when he heard the word \u2018credit\u2019 emerge from the mouth of smokers in an alley, but Tiyo didn\u2019t care.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Just enough to see the opera </span><i><span>dot.</span></i><span>\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHaha. That much is nothing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They held out a contract.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo examined it and saw that there was nothing special. There was no additional money if it was paid back quickly, but it was the typical vicious system where the interest rate rose sharply as repayment was delayed.</span></p><br/><p><span>Of course, Tiyo didn\u2019t care since he would pay it back tomorrow.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is plain. All moneylenders are the same </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>. I\u2019ll sign the contract.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Huhuhu. You are bold. I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The agreement was rapidly made.\u00a0</span><span>As Tiyo filled out his address, a man ran somewhere and came back. Tiyo\u2019s address had been confirmed. They nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor whispered. \"Isn\u2019t it suspicious that they checked your house?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There is no one in Quantes who doesn\u2019t know my house </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>So they borrowed money.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you for your consideration! \u00a0I love you!\u201d The men bowed their heads and shouted loudly. Tiyo laughed with satisfaction.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"They really love their work and the customers </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>. Kahahat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\"No, wow. That, wow...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat is enough</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Perfect, a new world, a masterpiece of God, ahh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor had completely fallen in love after watching the opera.\u00a0</span><span>The magnificent orchestra, the beautiful songs, the story filled with conflicts and emotions and the gorgeous voice of the singers expressing it.\u00a0</span><span>It was something he could never imagine in the world.\u00a0</span><span>At the end of every scene, the gnome audience dressed in fine clothing would clap. It felt like the world of the aristocracy.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLet\u2019s watch it again tomorrow! Crockta as well!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Expensive </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Didn\u2019t you easily borrow money?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The opera isn\u2019t something to be enjoyed on a daily basis </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kulkulkul, I have money so let\u2019s go next time,\u201d Crockta said.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta had quite a lot of money. Anor jumped with delight. Kenzo, who was listening to the conversation, felt like he was dying.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kenzo, you are shaky.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Am I heavy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A little...that...a short break...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs it hard? Nobody cares! The enemy on the battlefield won\u2019t care if you are tired!

Fix your mindset!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Understood!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPush!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA...Aaaaah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo bent his arms and slowly raised himself. His arms trembled.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWonderful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Users who thought of Elder Lord as a game didn\u2019t want to endure pain. It was just like the traitor Grom, who easily gave up being an orc for the pleasurable path.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta thought it was the most important difference between him and ordinary users.\u00a0</span><span>Elder Lord was like another life to him. For the sake of the sweet fruit, one had to experience the bitterness.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was going to fix Kenzo\u2019s mindset.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBy the way...that...\u201dKenzo opened his mouth</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUm, what?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Tiyo...uhh...did he borrow money...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta glanced at Tiyo. Tiyo and Anor were already leaving for somewhere else. \u201cI guess he did. Why?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat...no...\u201dKenzo frowned. \"Like me...among those who have been cursed...there are those who abuse such knowledge...I\u2019m not worried about Tiyo or Crockta, but the other people...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>With the message about the opening of the north and the disappearance of the behemoth, the Forest of Creatures was popular among the high-level users as a new hunting ground.

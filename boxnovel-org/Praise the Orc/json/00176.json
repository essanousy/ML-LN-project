He stretched his body and took in the fresh air. The sunshine was also pleasant.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou have to tilt your upper body. You shouldn\u2019t bow. Don\u2019t touch the board.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>On one side of the beach, a surf class was in session. Brightly dressed men and women were repeatedly lying down and standing up on the surfboard.\u00a0</span><span>It seemed moderately amusing.</span></p><br/><p><span>Surfing... Ian should learn it once.\u00a0</span><span>He had never learned any sports apart from martial arts.\u00a0</span><span>Turning his gaze away, Ian saw surfers splashing in the water. Most of them weren\u2019t able to stand properly, but they didn\u2019t get tired, and some managed to slip nicely towards the beach.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t like the rashguards.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian turned his head as he unexpectedly heard a voice.\u00a0</span><span>A man was standing there.\u00a0</span><span>He wore glasses, and his hair was strangely gray. However, he didn\u2019t seem old. In fact, he was in his mid-30s.</span></p><br/><p><span>As he stared into the sun, the man spoke with furrowed brows,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cIt is annoying. People should go into the sea with bare skin. That is real. But the clothing companies make all these things, and they cover up their body unnecessarily. Youth is just a fleeting moment. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man looked at Ian.\u00a0</span><span>It was the first time they\u2019d met.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian started laughing.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThat's right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>This might be the attraction of traveling. He had accidentally met an interesting person.</span></p><br/><p><span>The man nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cTake your clothes off. The sun should see you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then the person in question took off his coat, revealing a body without any obvious fat. He was wearing aloha shorts.\u00a0</span><span>He walked forward with clear eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDo you know how to surf?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI don't know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIndeed, you look like you don\u2019t know how.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian\u2019s eyebrows twitched.\u00a0</span><span>He looked like he didn\u2019t know how? What did that mean?\u00a0</span><span>Ian had never failed at any exercise.\u00a0</span><span>Even when he played with a ball during his childhood, his natural athleticism meant he could easily get the ball past his peers.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was like Cristiano Ronaldo with a soccer ball, Stephen Curry with a basketball, and Roger Federer with a tennis ball. They were different.\u00a0</span><span>Although it was true that Ian didn\u2019t know anything about surfing, it was unacceptable to be seen as a desk-bound person.</span></p><br/><p><span>The man didn\u2019t sense Ian\u2019s anger as he spoke casually,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThen do you want to learn from me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian made a questioning sound and laughed.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYou can surf?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDidn\u2019t I say it? This friend, you should learn how to look at people.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The man draped his jacket around his neck.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cFollow me. I'll teach you one on one. This opportunity isn\u2019t common.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian was interested... in surfing, as well as this person.\u00a0</span><span>The man left the white sand with Ian and headed to the surf store across the road.\u00a0</span><span>There was a man with a suntanned body and a reggae hairstyle sitting on a rocking chair. He raised his sunglasses to his head and waved.\u00a0</span><span>The eyes behind the sunglasses were unexpectedly innocent.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHey, Hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou look good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHah, I was active until dawn...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m teaching him how to surf, so please give me a few things.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI understand. Jinchul! Get me one set of equipment! One set!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>An answer called out from inside.\u00a0</span><span>Then a charming young man appeared. He greeted Ian with blurry eyes as if he had also been awake until dawn.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, hello. It must be your first time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDo you want separate clothing or rashguards? If not, there is this suit. Your height is similar to me, so the size should be...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian received a full body suit which appeared to be used for scuba diving.\u00a0</span><span>Then when Ian tried to pay for the rental, he was rejected.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis is fine. Hyung-nim\u2019s guests always receive it for free.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian looked at the man outside the store and the store owner. The man outside was looking at the sea with his hands behind his back.</span></p><br/><p><span>He asked, \u201cWhat is that person like?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHyung-nim? I have no idea.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The young man laughed.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cHe is just close to the boss. Shouldn\u2019t you know?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe met for the first time today.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cReally? How strange. Well, it is like this. You can change inside.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian put on the equipment, received a big surfboard, and exited the store.\u00a0</span><span>Ian\u2019s board was thick and felt like a sponge, while the man\u2019s was nice and waxy.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis surfing equipment sucks.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt isn\u2019t good?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat isn\u2019t the main part. Surfing is. It\u2019s cool.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man said before looking at Ian.\u00a0</span><span>Ian jumped with surprise.\u00a0</span><span>The man now had blue makeup on his face which drew across his cheekbones and nose. It was like seeing the battle makeup barbarians wore in movies.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat is it? Do you want some?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The man handed the tube to Ian. It was sunscreen. Unlike other clear sunscreens, this one had a vivid color.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cJust put it on your nose. It is expensive, so I am saving it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Surfers seemed to pursue their own beauty, so Ian tried it as well.\u00a0</span><span>Thus, they headed towards the sandy white beach.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe can only surf in this area, so be careful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A separate surfing area was designated on the beach.\u00a0</span><span>They headed there. In addition to them, there were other people receiving surfing lessons.\u00a0</span><span>Most of the people on the surfboards weren\u2019t able to ride the waves properly and hung on like seaweed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am harsh, so you should be prepared.\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Unlike his harsh words, the man was a really shabby teacher.\u00a0</span><span>He just said that Ian had to move his arms on the board and get up. Then he demonstrated once or twice before immediately pushing Ian into the sea.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian couldn\u2019t even practice and had to try it out on the waves.\u00a0</span><span>Of course, that was enough.\u00a0</span><span>Ian did well with his natural athleticism.\u00a0</span><span>He waited for the waves before gently getting up at the right time. Then he balanced himself.</span></p><br/><p><span>lan was satisfied. He was like Ronaldo with a soccer ball, Curry with a basketball, and Federer with a tennis ball. Now, he took on the board... like Phelps with swimming.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell done.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man spoke. Ian replied,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYou are really good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man was skillfully riding the waves. His hair barely got wet, unlike most of the people who couldn\u2019t ride or balance.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKyaaak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>During a moment of waiting, a woman slipped on her surfboard and slid towards Ian.\u00a0</span><span>Her board hit Ian\u2019s back...</span></p><br/><p><span>And he was pushed by it.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian and the woman tangled together, and the two of them fell below the surface of the water.\u00a0</span><span>They struggled for a moment before reaching the surface. The woman with wet hair apologized to Ian,</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWah! I'm sorry. Are you okay? I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian touched his back. It was fortunate that the woman\u2019s board was for beginners. So, this was why they used a sponge-like material.\u00a0</span><span>If it were the board, which the man teaching Ian had, that hit him, his flesh would\u2019ve been torn.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian smiled as he touched his back.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Please be careful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The woman was speechless at Ian\u2019s gentle reaction. Then she grabbed Ian\u2019s arm as he moved away.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay? That would\u2019ve hurt. What can I do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI'm really sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian shrugged, saying that it was okay. Then the woman grabbed her board and said,</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPlease tell me if you get any problems later on.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI will.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf you need a number...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo. It\u2019s really fine. Have fun surfing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, yes. You too.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The woman bowed and pushed her board towards the other side of the beach.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou didn\u2019t notice.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian flinched. The man had approached.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou surprised me,\u201d Ian said.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo. You noticed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLook.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The man shouted,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cHey, you over there! Come here! What are you doing just hitting someone?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The woman turned around in surprise at his shout.\u00a0</span><span>She looked at Ian and then at the man. The man beckoned and she returned.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGirl, you were wrong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t hit people with your board. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat's right. I\u2019m sorry...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou are a very dangerous girl.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSo, give me your phone number.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI need a phone number to contact you if there are any problems later.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, yes. Yes. Then my number...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She gave her number. Then he spoke to Ian,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cTell me your number as well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDo you really not know? Quickly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGive your number to the other person so they will know it is you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span>Ian gave his number. The man repeated it a few times for the woman to remember.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGirl, you do remember it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. I remember.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat's great. Did you come here for a few days to play? Is it a vacation?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, I leave the day after tomorrow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis boy as well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man winked. The woman laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be going. Have fun.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry. Have fun.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The woman smiled and pushed away on her board. The woman\u2019s group were watching her anxiously, and she waved.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian laughed and asked,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis is youth. Eat a lot, pray a lot, and love a lot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBut my situation...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a girlfriend?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen it\u2019s okay.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He tapped Ian\u2019s shoulders.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cLet\u2019s get out. I did a lot. I\u2019m thirsty. I\u2019ll buy you a beer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man spoke informally to Ian, but Ian didn\u2019t feel any anger towards this unknown man.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian smiled and followed him.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>They put their equipment away and found a homemade beer store not far from the beach.\u00a0</span><span>There were surfboards and equipment displayed inside the beer store. Surfing was famous at this beach, so it had a lot of influence.</span></p><br/><p><span>The man ordered beer and fries for himself.</span></p><br/><p><span>The screen in the store was showing Elder Lord.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere was an uproar.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man leaned back in his chair and pointed to the screen.\u00a0</span><span>The headline was \u2018Shocking Heaven and Earth Clan.\u2019 It was a coverage about the Heaven and Earth Clan\u2019s crime.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is a scary world. Drugs to put people into a game world.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. Their actions have eventually come back to them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian told the Rehabilitation Brothers the information he received from Rommel.\u00a0</span><span>Then Edgar\u2019s former lover, Robina, reported it to the police, and the prosecution started working with the Rehabilitation Brothers.</span></p><br/><p><span>The \u2018sleeping room\u2019 was formerly a workshop. There, they were able to find countless people who had disappeared, and Edgar was also rescued.\u00a0</span><span>They had started voluntarily for money. However, they testified that they hadn\u2019t been able to quit even if they wanted to as they were subjected to intimidation.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Keynes\u2019 Choi Sunggil, who planned all of this, and his right-hand man, \u2018Luin\u2019 Kim Hyunchul, were arrested.\u00a0</span><span>Public opinion turned against them.\u00a0</span><span>The Heaven and Earth Clan turned from South Korea\u2019s pride to their disgrace.\u00a0</span><span>The overseas community was also shocked at this situation, and it was a rude awakening for some people.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat happened to Rommel?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t think it will be hard to check if he participated or not.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe was the commander? Right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s correct. The War Maestro.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow was it? Is he like the rumors say?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe was definitely great...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian stopped talking.\u00a0</span><span>He looked at the man.\u00a0</span><span>The man smiled at him quietly. He looked to be in his mid-30s, and the glasses gave him an intelligent air.\u00a0</span><span>The man\u2019s black eyes seemed to pierce through Ian.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man chuckled.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian leaned back in his chair. His mind felt like a mess as he opened his mouth,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYou...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt has arrived. Please enjoy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, the employee served the beer, and the conversation between Ian and the man was suddenly halted.\u00a0</span><span>The employee put a beer down in front of both of them. There were cold water droplets on the surface of the bottle, and Ian touched it with his fingers.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then the employee went away.\u00a0</span><span>Ian sipped the beer. It was cool, and he felt his mind calm down.</span></p><br/><p><span>The man also drank his beer. Then he asked Ian,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cHow was Rommel, Crockta?\u201d</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><br/><p>I have also updated my\u00a0Patreon\u00a0to reflect my new novels.

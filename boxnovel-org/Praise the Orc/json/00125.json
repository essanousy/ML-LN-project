It was a one-on-one duel in front of all the warriors of the Great Clan.\u00a0</span><span>It was the most sacred ritual of the orcs in the Great Clan.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You are not qualified.\"\u00a0</span><span>Calmahart looked down at him and said.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta shook his head.\u00a0</span><span>\"I am an orc like you. What else is necessary?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was like he said, there was only one thing necessary to become the great chieftain: be an orc.\u00a0</span><span>Anyone with the birthright of an orc could become the great chieftain.</span></p><br/><p><span>Surka and Caburak stepped back.\u00a0</span><span>In the midst of the numerous orcs, Calmahart and Crockta stood there staring at each other.</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart laughed, \"Kuhuhu, kuhuhuhu...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He bowed his head and his chuckles became loud laughter, \"Kuhahahahahat! A disgusting last-ditch effort! Crockta!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His eyes flashed and he shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The orcs are under my control! Don't you know what that means?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You aren\u2019t controlling anyone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLook! And despair!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Calmahart raised a hand.\u00a0</span><span>\"Orcs of the Great Clan. I am the great chieftain, Calmahart. Your ruler!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A red aura emerged from his body, scattering about and surrounded the orcs.\u00a0</span><span>The madness in the orcs\u2019 eyes thickened further. The orcs trembled.\u00a0</span><span>The orcs shook their heads as they became thirsty.\u00a0</span><span>The energy of the tribulation.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKill the trash from the continent.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart\u2019s eyes shone wickedly.\u00a0</span><span>His dominant voice rang out, \"Slay him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The orcs began to step forward. Calmahart\u2019s red power was encouraging them. Some were pushed to the brink of insanity and raised their weapons.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked at them one by one.</span></p><br/><p><span>Will, or beliefs.\u00a0</span><span>There was no such thing.\u00a0</span><span>They were just pulled by the madness that dominated them as they headed towards Crockta. The cold light of many weapons turned towards Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart had won.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta raised his greatsword.\u00a0</span><span>Even so, he wasn\u2019t going to give up without a last hurrah.\u00a0</span><span>The moment that Crockta was about to wield his weapon towards them,</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Clang.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>There was the sound of a weapon dropping onto the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>It was an orc standing in the front.\u00a0</span><span>He wasn\u2019t a warrior or a commander. He was one of the many orc soldiers who would die nameless on the battlefield. A small part of a huge army.\u00a0</span><span>He dropped his weapon.\u00a0</span><span>As he held back the madness, he struck his chest with his fist.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he declared, \"A duel is sacred.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He didn\u2019t advance any further. Rather, he stepped back.\u00a0</span><span>It was the beginning.\u00a0</span><span>The orcs standing beside him also dropped their weapons. They hit their chests.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNobody can interfere with the duel of the great chieftain.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Weapons dropped in turn.\u00a0</span><span>The orcs continued to retreat as the red energy around their bodies was reduced to a faint haze.\u00a0</span><span>The orcs struck their chests.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo one can intervene.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The great chieftain can\u2019t refuse a duel.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe winner will become the great chieftain!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Now Calmahart and Crockta were the only ones holding a weapon.\u00a0</span><span>It was a Colosseum created by the orcs.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked around at the orcs.</span></p><br/><p><span>Will, or beliefs.\u00a0</span><span>He could see it in their eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta smiled. Suddenly, he met Surka\u2019s eyes. Surka beat his chest and nodded. Crockta also hit his chest in accordance with the northern ways.\u00a0</span><span>Then he looked at Calmahart.\u00a0</span><span>The distorted face looked like a demon.</span></p><br/><p><span>He was furious at the rejection of his command.\u00a0</span><span>He lifted his double edged axe.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta raised his greatsword in response. The blade was stained with blood. Considering the number of lives that had fallen under Ogre Slayer today, it was hard not to be crushed by the weight of the sword.</span></p><br/><p><span>Even so, he had to grab the handle.\u00a0</span><span>Its weight.\u00a0</span><span>He would only be liberated of it with Calmahart\u2019s life.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t think you can win if it is a one-on-one duel.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The sunset on the horizon cast a red tint.\u00a0</span><span>Long shadows covered the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou talk too much, Calmahart.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart slowly began to turn sideways. Crockta responded to the way the body moved. They circled each other and stared at the opponent.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I will kill you today and trample on all your precious things. The continent will be burned to ashes and your Orcrox friends will become slaves at my feet. I\u2019ll make a cup from your skull and watch all of it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart taunted him.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta didn't answer.\u00a0</span><span>He focused his mind.\u00a0</span><span>The world slowed.\u00a0</span><span>He saw the moving Calmahart.</span></p><br/><p><span>One step.</span></p><br/><p><span>One step.</span></p><br/><p><span>One.</span></p><br/><p><span>Step.</span></p><br/><p><span>Step.</span></p><br/><p><span>One.</span></p><br/><p><span>A quarter.</span></p><br/><p><span>Back to one.</span></p><br/><p><span>The world was extremely slow.\u00a0</span><span>A moment of infinite suspension.\u00a0</span><span>The rough breathing of the orcs surrounding them, the expulsion of the waste through the lungs, the eyes watching the duel, the rough texture of the ground. He felt everything.</span></p><br/><p><span>He could feel the strands of twilight shining out from the horizon.\u00a0</span><span>He could see for certain how powerful Calmahart was. His presence was huge. Even if he combined the energy that he felt from the horizon on all sides, it couldn\u2019t be compared to the aura of Calmahart standing in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span>Meanwhile, something raised its head in his heart. It built an antenna in his body.</span></p><br/><p><span>Fear.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta started laughing.</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart had an awesome presence.\u00a0</span><span>Calmahart, who accepted the power of the tribulation, might\u2019ve been the most powerful enemy he had ever met.</span></p><br/><p><span>So Crockta moved first.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kwaang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>He took the lead. The earth shook.\u00a0</span><span>It was just like the way he trampled on the bud of fear.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta wielded his greatsword.\u00a0</span><span>The double edged axe and Ogre Slayer encountered each other. Sparks flew as the weapons bounced off.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was an acrobatic like fight.\u00a0</span><span>They avoided any damage from attacks in their gaps. The weapons clashed, causing sparks to rise in the air and fill the eyes of the spectators.</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart with the monster like body and Crockta with his sturdy orc body. It was a fight between those who didn\u2019t look quick, but their movements were at a speed that the eyes couldn\u2019t follow. Flashes of light filled the area.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kwaaaaang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Both weapons collided and caused an explosion like there was gunpowder present.\u00a0</span><span>The first one hit by an attack that couldn\u2019t be avoided was Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>The flesh was cut and blood burst out. Calmahart smiled. It was only a light graze, but it was enough to split the skin and caused bleeding. It was an incredible force.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta ignored the blood and gripped Ogre Slayer tighter.\u00a0</span><span>The two exchanged blows again.\u00a0</span><span>This time, it was Calmahart who received damage. There was a slash on his thigh. However, it healed at a visible speed. The bleeding stopped.</span></p><br/><p><span>Truly a monster.</span></p><br/><p><span>Their movements gradually became rough. Now the testing period was over. It was the time to put their flesh and blood on the line to kill the other. At the same time, both of their blood were scattered about. The two of them roared and collided.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>His ears were ringing.\u00a0</span><span>He couldn\u2019t hear any sounds.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta raised his head. The axe heading towards him shone red. Crockta could see the glow of the sunset on it.\u00a0</span><span>The sun hadn\u2019t fallen yet.</span></p><br/><p><span>He twisted his body.\u00a0</span><span>The axe passed by the side of his neck. Blood flowed. He raised his legs and got into a stable posture. He raised his greatsword and stared at the enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span>His vision was blurry.\u00a0</span><span>His swollen eyes weren\u2019t working properly. He raised his hands and rubbed them. Two or three blurred images gathered into one.\u00a0</span><span>Calmahart was swinging an axe towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span>He rolled across the ground. His wounds filled with dirt and caused him pain. Crockta endured the pain and got up.\u00a0</span><span>It was actually fortunate. His mind cleared from the pain.</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart was looking down at him with an arrogant expression.\u00a0</span><span>\"How boring.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta gulped. Blood spread.</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart was strong.\u00a0</span><span>The blows severely broke his body. The difference in physical strength was clear. Crockta gritted his teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span>His mind entered the realm of the Pinnacle again.\u00a0</span><span>In the slowed world, Crockta brandished his sword towards Calmahart. Calmahart laughed. In a world where everything converged to a stop, Calmahart moved quickly. Before Crockta\u2019s attack could hit, he kicked Crockta\u2019s legs.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grabbed his abdomen and fell over.</span></p><br/><p><span>The sky appeared.\u00a0</span><span>It was an expanse of blue and red.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta thought about it.\u00a0</span><span>Why did he have to endure the pain here?\u00a0</span><span>Elder Lord, another world that existed somewhere.\u00a0</span><span>But this wasn\u2019t his world. His world was Earth, the land of South Korea where his little sister and cafe were.</span></p><br/><p><span>He got up.</span></p><br/><p><span>The orcs were still watching him.\u00a0</span><span>The sacred duel ended when one of them died or surrendered.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta still hadn\u2019t yielded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You can't beat me.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>He looked at Calmahart. It was a fearsome face. The scar Crockta created made him seem even more heinous.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta smiled instead of answering.</span></p><br/><p><span>Familiar faces were seen behind Calmahart.\u00a0</span><span>All of Spinoa was watching this duel. There was Tiyo, Anor, the faces of those Crockta met in the Luklan Mountains, and those he fought with in the north.</span></p><br/><p><span>Everyone was looking at him.\u00a0</span><span>They believed in him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018I believe in you.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Raven. Your mission.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018As expected from Oppa.'</span></p><br/><p><span>He always had to shoulder this burden.\u00a0</span><span>But he never resented it.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta smiled. He fought because he had to. So he did it. That was all.\u00a0</span><span>One reason covered all his actions.\u00a0</span><span>He could stop this.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A warrior doesn\u2019t yield.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was just a joke when he selected an orc. But then he met the warriors of Orcrox and became a warrior. They were characters in a game, but great spirits that existed here in the world of Elder Lord.</span></p><br/><p><span>He wouldn\u2019t know if he hadn\u2019t met them. Since he had met them, he would do what he needed to do.</span></p><br/><p><span>A warrior.</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart was running. His double edged axe split the air, the space around it collapsing and the explosive momentum bursting out towards Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>A distance that couldn\u2019t be avoided.\u00a0</span><span>A speed that couldn\u2019t be avoided.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta gritted his teeth.\u00a0</span><span>In the world of the Pinnacle, Crockta\u2019s will unfolded.\u00a0</span><span>He followed the flow of the causes and effects in the world. Just as the stone thrown into the sky would come falling down, the axe swinging towards him would break Crockta\u2019s body.</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart\u2019s speed was faster than Crockta\u2019s and his strength wasn\u2019t something Crockta could endure.</span></p><br/><p><span>The whole world was moving forward towards his death.\u00a0</span><span>The end that was nearing, the destiny that nobody could avoid.</span></p><br/><p><span>He saw it.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta raised his greatsword.\u00a0</span><span>The movement was too weak compared to Calmahart\u2019s axe.\u00a0</span><span>Then...</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The axe passed by Crockta\u2019s neck.\u00a0</span><span>It was a strange ending that couldn\u2019t be created by any cause and effect existing in the world.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta survived when he should\u2019ve been killed.</span></p><br/><p><span>The distortion of causality didn\u2019t stop here.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s greatsword shook.\u00a0</span><span>The great chieftain dodged.\u00a0</span><span>A clean evasion.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s greatsword should have definitely cut through the air.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then...</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCough...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, Crockta\u2019s greatsword pierced Calmahart\u2019s neck.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart couldn\u2019t believe his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>A miracle.\u00a0</span><span>He went beyond causality and wielded the world.\u00a0</span><span>It wasn\u2019t the flow of history, but those who made the history.</span></p><br/><p><span>[All Pinnacle ranked skills have been upgraded to the Hero rank.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta moved Ogre Slayer.\u00a0</span><span>Calmahart\u2019s head flew through the air.\u00a0</span><span>It was the end of the great chieftain Calmahart, who terrorized the north.</span></p><br/><p><span>A red aura emerged from his severed neck. It shattered into pieces.\u00a0</span><span>The fragmented red power scattered like petals and disappeared.\u00a0</span><span>It was the end of the tribulation.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAhhh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Everyone saw it clearly.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta killed the great chieftain.</span></p><br/><p><span>The area became quiet.</span></p><br/><p><span>Surka broke the silence. He hit his chest once and kneeled.\u00a0</span><span>This caused a wave as the orcs started kneeling in turn.\u00a0</span><span>All the orcs of the Great Clan who invaded Spinoa were now saluting Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>None of them could open their mouths.\u00a0</span><span>It was silent in the north.</span></p><br/><p><span>The Great Northern War that began with Calmahart\u2019s call.\u00a0</span><span>It was stopped by Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>Now.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Everybody get up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He was the great chieftain.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do you want to go orc hunting?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy hunt orcs all of a sudden?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA quest was opened.

But she couldn\u2019t adapt. She didn\u2019t want to put the images of dying people on the screen. So she quit.</span></p><br/><p><span>She recalled the orc Crockta who had disappeared.\u00a0</span><span>His behavior had impressed Laney. Her chest became hot just thinking about it. It wasn\u2019t a cruel war.\u00a0</span><span>However, he disappeared from Elder Lord after he left for the north.\u00a0</span><span>Considering the nature of the game that didn\u2019t care about the convenience to users, maybe Crockta wouldn\u2019t appear before them again.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPhew...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Right now, she should be preparing for that crazy chieftain.

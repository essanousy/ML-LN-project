Anor was looking around with an awed expression, amazed at the hot water that appeared like magic.\u00a0</span><span>When faced with the level of civilization in Quantes, he didn\u2019t stop asking questions like a curious little boy.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I guess Tiyo\u2019s still playing around.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It\u2019s been a while so he will be unburdening his heart.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo had yet to return.\u00a0</span><span>The members of the Quantes Gnomes Garrison welcomed his return and held a big celebration. Obviously, his stories about their adventures in the north would be greatly exaggerated.</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo\u2019s voice was suddenly heard from where his body was buried in the bathtub.\u00a0</span><span>\"It is lacking compared to natural hot springs, but this type of bath is still good. Having such a facility in an inn, Quantes is great.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I guess you like hot springs.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Of course. Where I used to live, there was a famous hot spring and the hot sulfur water was like paradise itself. There are many good elements for the body.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Considering the place where he used to live, the white star on his forehead, and the name Kenzo, Crockta guessed that he was Japanese.\u00a0</span><span>He looked at Crockta and said, \"But when is training...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don\u2019t want to sweat again after bathing, so we will start tomorrow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta decided after seeing Kenzo\u2019s swordsmanship.\u00a0</span><span>The two wouldn\u2019t have a great teacher and student relationship, but rather one where he would advise Kenzo on his skills while they stayed in Quantes.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta was pleased by Kenzo\u2019s decision.\u00a0</span><span>If this was any game, he could become stronger just by hunting. But Elder Lord was different.\u00a0</span><span>Many users appreciated the importance of meeting a good teacher because enlightenment and competence could make a big difference.\u00a0</span><span>Kenzo felt the desire not to miss out on this opportunity.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We have been in here for a while. Get up soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta raised his body.\u00a0</span><span>The sound of someone humming was getting closer and Crockta wanted to leave the bath before it became noisy.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOhh! Everybody is here! Kahahat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo drunkenly staggered into the bathroom.\u00a0</span><span>The guests not from Crockta\u2019s group glared at the appearance of a drunkard.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ah, I made a noise. I\u2019m sorry </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>. Kyahahaha!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo twisted and fell down. Then he raised his head and smiled again.\u00a0</span><span>He wasn\u2019t himself right now.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta exchanged glances with Anor. Someone had to take care of the drunkard. If they left him alone, he might die from placing his head under the water all night.</span></p><br/><p><span>The two reached out at the same time.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018\"Yap!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Rock paper scissors!\u00a0</span><span>Crockta won. Anor sighed and trudged over to handle Tiyo while Crockta looked at him and laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Just like a nanny.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor grabbed Tiyo. Anor was in the process of raising Tiyo up when the drunken gnome \u00a0suddenly jumped and plunged into the big bathtub. Water splashed everywhere.\u00a0</span><span>Anor grabbed his head and forced Tiyo to apologize to the guests around them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. This friend has no wisdom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSorry </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>, uhihi.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"No, what is with this attitude? Bow your head!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There were no problems because it was Anor.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crock and Kenzo walked out of the public bath together.\u00a0</span><span>Attention was focused on the fierce orc warrior Crockta and the slightly lacking, but still well-disciplined human warrior Kenzo.\u00a0</span><span>They stood tall and put on their clothes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do you want to drink beer?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOkay.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>After the bath, they headed up to the pub on the first floor of the inn.\u00a0</span><span>Several gnomes were gathered and drinking alcohol.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta and Kenzo sat down and ordered beer. The gnome employee brought them cold beer and dry snacks.\u00a0</span><span>It was a special order made to fit the size of an orc and human.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta opened his mouth, making Kenzo stop as he was about to take a sip.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ah, yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Why do you want to become stronger?\"\u00a0</span><span>Crockta asked with a deep expression in his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was an important question.\u00a0</span><span>He wanted to teach someone but he didn\u2019t want to do something wrong. That\u2019s why he recalled the best teacher that he knew.\u00a0</span><span>Baek Hanho\u2019s face surfaced but was quickly replaced by the great warrior Lenox.\u00a0</span><span>Harsh, severe, yet passionate. Because he was there, Crockta could become who he was now.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta became Lenox and looked at Kenzo.\u00a0</span><span>Deep eyes that seemed like they could penetrate straight through him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo gulped.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>There was common knowledge that every user in Elder Lord knew.\u00a0</span><span>NPCs considered this world to be real and everyone had their own philosophy.\u00a0</span><span>Users needed to breathe and consider this a real world; their mindset was expressed as the assimilation rate.\u00a0</span><span>If he answered with the flimsy mindset of a user, he might not be able to learn from this orc.</span></p><br/><p><span>He closed his eyes and concentrated. He asked himself: 'Why do I want to become stronger?'</span></p><br/><p><span>His previous memories passed by.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>He was a common otaku.\u00a0</span><span>He wasn\u2019t a hikikomori who always stayed in his room, but a friendly sales office worker caught up in the turmoil of society.\u00a0</span><span>He just had a secret hobby of anime appreciation and figurines collection.\u00a0</span><span>And the character he loved the most was\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span>Sword demon Matsui!</span></p><br/><p><span>He was a character who had a bad personality, smoked cigarettes, and always had a dull expression on his face. His hobbies were Pachinko and Mahjong, and was a man who always drunkenly wandered the streets with matted hair.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, at night, he became the city\u2019s dark knight who wielded his magical claymore against the monsters who killed his former lover.\u00a0</span><span>He was always cynical and committed criminal acts casually, but at crucial moments, he became the anti-hero who helped the weak.</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo went to a dojo that taught swordsmanship because of him. However, he couldn\u2019t wield the sword like Matsui in reality. He plunged into the world of Elder Lord to be like Matsui.\u00a0</span><span>But he lacked the abilities to be a hero. The same was trying for gaining higher levels. The wall of the NPCs and creatures was high.</span></p><br/><p><span>In Elder Lord, he was just an ordinary warrior with a sword.</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo opened his mouth, \"Become stronger...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His current assimilation rate was over 60%. It was the highest it had ever been.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I want to help people who have fallen into despair.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the reason why he admired and wanted to be like Matsui.\u00a0</span><span>At one time, he had severe fright of human relationships. He was bullied on a daily basis at school. At that time, it was a friend who saved him.</span></p><br/><p><span>A friend who learned karate. He knocked out the people tormenting Kenzo. Kenzo expressed his gratitude, but the friend just asked for a banana milk and handed him a book.\u00a0</span><span>It was Miyamoto Musashi\u2019s The Book of Five Rings.\u00a0</span><span>Then he disappeared with the words to not be pathetic. It was more shocking because he was a person who normally didn\u2019t speak a lot.</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo read The Book of Five Rings all night. Then he started changing from that day.\u00a0</span><span>He tried to fix his passive attitude and to get along with the people in his surroundings. Therefore, he could take his place in society.</span></p><br/><p><span>A single person\u2019s hand was enough to save him.\u00a0</span><span>If one person hadn\u2019t showed up, he would\u2019ve continued to just sink.\u00a0</span><span>He wanted to be that one person to reach out his hand to people in despair.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta nodded. Kenzo\u2019s serious heart was conveyed.</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo replied firmly again, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"People who have fallen into despair...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta contemplated his words before faintly smiling.\u00a0</span><span>He beckoned, \"Drink.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta drank his beer in one gulp.\u00a0</span><span>Kenzo supported his neck and did the same.\u00a0</span><span>The large glass filled with beer was gone in a flash. Both of them downed the beer in one shot.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuoooh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUgh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a universal sound after drinking. The two of them shook as they felt the aftermath of the beer.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then go to sleep early. My approach is tough so tomorrow will be a hard day.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They were set to stay a week in Quantes.\u00a0</span><span>It was enough time for Tiyo to meet his family and friends, as well as prepare for the trip. Of course, Anor also needed to see the city.\u00a0</span><span>Meanwhile, Crockta would preach his enlightenment to this man.</span></p><br/><p><span>The two of them headed up to their room.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo couldn\u2019t sleep because his heart was pounding.</span></p><br/><p><span>He needed to focus properly during this week with the orc. He had already taken some time off at his company.\u00a0</span><span>It was a strong desire to learn everything from this NPC, an orc who could instantly slay an ogre. Maybe he could obtain a hidden class or skill from this.</span></p><br/><p><span>He moved his gaze.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta wasn\u2019t sleeping yet.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He was sitting on the bed with his eyes closed. The faint moonlight leaking through the window showing his serenity.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, he felt the same energy as when the ogre was slain.\u00a0</span><span>A hazy atmosphere appeared around Crockta\u2019s body. It was like he was separated from the world.\u00a0</span><span>His flesh became distant and he seemed to disappear from Kenzo\u2019s perspective.\u00a0</span><span>There was an invisible aura moving through the air. It was calm and silent, but Kenzo\u2019s muscles shook like he was on the battlefield.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a strange phenomenon.\u00a0</span><span>Kenzo kept lying down as he forgot the time. Some time passed.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta opened his mouth.\u00a0</span><span>\"When you reach this level, you can practice without even breaking a sweat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>He was aware of the fact that Kenzo was watching.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Keep in mind that in this world, the will of an individual can make a big difference.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was something Crockta had learned directly.</span></p><br/><p><span>In reality, no matter how much he trained his will, he couldn\u2019t jump a few meters or break a rock. Even if he practiced for a lifetime, he might be able to kill a wild animal with his bare hands. Limits existed.</span></p><br/><p><span>But this was the world of Elder Lord. A person could grow infinitely if they trained and had a strong will.\u00a0</span><span>A place where the possibilities of individuals were expanded beyond infinity, that was Elder Lord.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta realized this from Hoyt, then he reached a higher ground due to Gushantimur.</span></p><br/><p><span>Now it was possible to simulate a fight with a virtual enemy by raising his will and imagining it.\u00a0</span><span>The realm of a Hero beyond the Pinnacle.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta knew this very well, so he planned to help Kenzo experience the realm of the Pinnacle in this week.</span></p><br/><p><span>Seeing was believing.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSleep. Tomorrow, you will regret not sleeping earlier.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo hurriedly closed his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>Maybe he would experience something life-changing tomorrow.\u00a0</span><span>Elder Lord was a symbol of this era. Even if he wasn\u2019t a ranker, there were many users who earned a big profit through Elder Lord. It usually depended on how strong a person was and their level.</span></p><br/><p><span>Through this opportunity, he could hopefully become a professional user who earned a living through Elder Lord.\u00a0</span><span>It was the dream of all Elder Lord users.</span></p><br/><p><span>He couldn\u2019t wait for tomorrow\u2019s training.\u00a0</span><span>He didn\u2019t worry much.\u00a0</span><span>No matter how harsh the training was, it wouldn\u2019t kill him.</span></p><br/><p><span>But...</span></p><br/><p><span>It actually happened.</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><br/><p>I have also updated my\u00a0Patreon\u00a0to reflect my new novels.

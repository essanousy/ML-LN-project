Ian and the three human users sat at the table as Antuak served them warm potato soup.\u00a0</span><span>The users hesitated at first, but started enthusiastically eating after trying the first spoonful.\u00a0</span><span>They ate the soup in silence for a while.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUmm...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>No one was able to open their mouths.\u00a0</span><span>Antuak just smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs there something that you want to ask?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Well...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian and the three human users looked at each other.\u00a0</span><span>At length, the female magician opened her mouth.\u00a0</span><span>It was the question that no one could utter.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Over there... is she sick?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Her eyes were looking behind Antuak.</span></p><br/><p><span>A female orc was lying on the bed.\u00a0</span><span>She was staring into the air with a blanket covering her neck. Even though she blinked occasionally, all she did was lie down and stare blankly into the air. She didn\u2019t respond at all when they had entered.\u00a0</span><span>Her eyes were grey as if the colours had faded away.</span></p><br/><p><span>Antuak muttered with a wry smile.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2019tar...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Bul\u2019tar.\u00a0</span><span>Ian\u2019s eyes widened. It was the orc\u2019s motto, but it gave off a different feeling from usual. It felt old. It was closer to the original pronunciation. Ian repeated it to himself. Bul\u2019tar.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"She is my wife, Aruna.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Heol. You are married. So why is she bedridden?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The conversation between the orc and the magician created a strange gap, like an old historical man talking to a young contemporary student.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"She has been possessed by a different dimension.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Aruna was a shaman like me. She was interested in other worlds. I warned her about the danger, but I couldn\u2019t stop her curiosity. Eventually, she completed the magic to look at other dimensions and cast it. It is something that our spirits can\u2019t afford to see. In the end, she lost consciousness in that other dimension.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a story that was hard to believe. Everyone nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Now she is forever contemplating that world, forgetting who she is. It is an incomprehensible world where the laws that we know don\u2019t exist. I can only wait for her to come back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Antuak rose and stood by Aruna.\u00a0</span><span>His rugged hand touched Aruna\u2019s cheek. She was still looking somewhere else.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It has been only me and Aruna in this house for a long time, so I am glad that guests like you have come.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Antuak turned around and smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. Travellers, why did you come to this place?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The users looked at each other.\u00a0</span><span>Ian replied instead,</span></p><br/><p><span>\"They are heading for Basque Village to get some help from the orc shamans.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is a great thing that humans need help from us orcs.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Antak looked at the staff that he had leaned against the wall. A surge of unknown power was coming from it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Us orcs were originally close to humans, until the past wars separated everything. \u00a0I also had numerous human friends. Yes, humans. What help do you need?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The users exchanged glances. The magician replied,</span></p><br/><p><span>\"In fact, I don't know yet. I just know that I will find out once I arrive in Basque Village.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Is that so? Too bad. I hope that it works out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Antuak gave more soup to the archer who had finished his bowl.\u00a0</span><span>The archer bowed his head and drank the soup again.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then what brings you here, young warrior?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Antuak looked at Ian.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m not a warrior yet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You are the only one who can determine that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am going to meet Tashaquil.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hoh, Tashaquil. Why?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I want to ask what a true warrior is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You are searching for the path of a warrior.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Antuak nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\"I hope you find the answer. Bul\u2019tar.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you. Bul\u2019tar.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The magician, who was watching the conversation between the two orcs, got up.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019ve never been to an orc house before, so can I see it, Orc Shaman?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOf course. There isn\u2019t much to see, though.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>All three users got up.</span></p><br/><p><span>Antuak\u2019s house was wider than it looked from the outside. There were tools for magic, as well as the animal skulls that decorated the forest outside. The burning candles revealed the weird magical tools.\u00a0</span><span>The female magician asked Antuak a variety of questions. Antuak was kind enough to explain. The archer and human warrior followed behind Antuak.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian was left alone with Aruna.\u00a0</span><span>She was still staring at an unknown place. Somehow, he felt sorry.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Please wake up. Your husband is waiting for you,\u201d Ian quietly whispered.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was at that moment.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Huh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A long shadow quickly passed over the wall.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHeeok...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There was also a small moan.\u00a0</span><span>Ian hurriedly turned around.</span></p><br/><p><span>Antuak was sitting down.\u00a0</span><span>The edge of a blade protruded from his chest.\u00a0</span><span>The users were standing behind him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat is this...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian immediately lifted his greatsword. The archer aimed at him. Ian hesitated.\u00a0</span><span>The female magician said in a youthful voice.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOrc, thanks a lot! This was easily resolved because of you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What\u2019s the big deal? I came to the orcs to get a skill.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You said you were seeking help from Basque Village...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAhyo~\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She murmured as fire appeared around her hands.\u00a0</span><span>\"What help? The Orcs are helping me. If I obtain the heart of a shaman, then I can receive a skill. So don\u2019t blame me too much, yes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She giggled. The men also started laughing.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Well, his wife is sick, so I guess I\u2019ll send her along with him. Is that okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Keeok...Aruna...she...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If she is left alone, then she would just die of starvation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The archer kicked the sword stuck in Antuak\u2019s back.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCough!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A monster pretending to be something else, how funny.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"His wife Aruna... Another dimension... Puhahat. I thought I was watching a historical drama.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They spat on Antuak\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian\u2019s fists shook.\u00a0</span><span>It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this.</span></p><br/><p><span>Antuak was just an orc who loved his wife.\u00a0</span><span>An orc who was friendly to the guests and made good soup, Antuak.\u00a0</span><span>An orc who knew how to pronounce Bul\u2019tar in the traditional war, that was Antuak.\u00a0</span><span>It was a short meeting, but Ian already knew three things about Antuak. He still had some secrets of the world, and some philosophies that Ian wasn\u2019t familiar with.</span></p><br/><p><span>All of that was now collapsing, due to that sword.\u00a0</span><span>It was an insulting sight.</span></p><br/><p><span>The users mocked, \u201cAre you mad? Play this game more moderately. It\u2019s like you are a real orc, instead of role-playing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou could\u2019ve been a human or elf. Why did you choose an orc?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian rushed forward angrily.\u00a0</span><span>The arrow flew towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUgh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The archer\u2019s arrow was fast, and pierced Ian\u2019s thigh. Ian failed to win against the force and fell.\u00a0</span><span>Then the man kicked Ian in the face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCough!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cResisting is in vain. I don\u2019t want to kill you, but it can\u2019t be helped. I\u2019ll just kill you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEven a user?\u201d The female magician asked.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat is an orc user? They are just mobs.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Big Brother, is it okay to kill a user? Isn\u2019t there a PK penalty?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Elder Lord doesn\u2019t have anything like that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Is that so? Good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The woman giggled.\u00a0</span><span>Ian tried to stand up only to be kicked again.\u00a0</span><span>The woman chanted a spell. Something invisible restrained Ian. His strength fell. He couldn\u2019t move a single muscle. All he could do was collapse.</span></p><br/><p><span>He would manage somehow if it was a hand-to-hand fight, but he couldn\u2019t resist magic.\u00a0</span><span>Ian was still too weak.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKeheeo... Aru...na...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Antuak\u2019s body was completely breaking down. The male archer and female magician searched until they found his heart.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then the warrior approached Aruna. He stared at her as she gazed towards a distant place and stabbed a dagger in her chest. Aruna kept staring at the distant place as blood poured from her mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian pushed strength to his entire body.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...Kuaaah...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He gritted his teeth and twisted.\u00a0</span><span>However, his body wouldn\u2019t budge. The arrow stuck in his thigh pressed painfully against him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t fight. It\u2019s over.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The male archer smiled and pulled back his bowstring. \u00a0</span><span>The arrowhead pointed towards Ian\u2019s head.\u00a0</span><span>Ian gave a last hurrah.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuaaaaahhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His body moved slightly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuaaaaaaaack!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He stretched out his hand with all his strength. His body moved. Just a little, just a little more.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What, does he have high magic resistance?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"An orc? Finish it quickly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The archer let go of the bowstring.\u00a0</span><span>The arrow pierced Ian\u2019s skull.\u00a0</span><span>His eyes dimmed as everything in front of him became blurry.\u00a0</span><span>Darker than black.\u00a0</span><span>He felt like he would sink forever.</span></p><br/><p><span>Death.</span></p><br/><p><span>......</span></p><br/><p><span>......</span></p><br/><p><span>......</span></p><br/><p><span>The darkness blurred.</span></p><br/><p><span>He opened his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>An orc stood in front of him.\u00a0</span><span>The orc was standing at the door of a house.</span></p><br/><p><span>The orc looked towards Ian and said, \"You are alive, young warrior.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian was standing\u2026 He was standing in front of Antuak\u2019s house. He could see the familiar scenery inside the house due to the slightly open door. A stove, the table, and Aruna.\u00a0</span><span>Ian couldn\u2019t understand.</span></p><br/><p><span>The orc, Antuak, was smiling in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Why are you just standing there?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Voices were heard from behind him.\u00a0</span><span>\"Orc, why are you staring blankly?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian turned his head.\u00a0</span><span>The three human users were waiting behind Ian. The female magician\u2019s eyes were as round as a ball.</span></p><br/><p><span>Antuak asked, \u201cYoung warrior, what did you see?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"See, what is he talking about?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian couldn\u2019t say anything as he looked between Antuak and the users.\u00a0</span><span>Antuak had definitely fed them soup inside his house, and then the users had certainly murdered Antuak, his wife, and Ian.</span></p><br/><p><span>This...</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian looked at Antuak.\u00a0</span><span>He was smiling as if he knew what Ian was thinking.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat will you do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian finally realized it.\u00a0</span><span>It was the truth revealed by the shaman Antuak.</span></p><br/><p><span>The three users had used Ian to approach the shaman and to kill him for the shaman\u2019s heart.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian opened his mouth, \u201cMagician.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The thing that you have to acquire...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Is it a shaman\u2019s heart?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUh...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They were stunned. The quick-witted warrior picked up a knife while the archer grabbed an arrow.\u00a0</span><span>However, Ian\u2019s greatsword was already swinging towards his goal.\u00a0</span><span>The magician\u2019s head flew into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cW-W-What?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Fuck!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They stepped back as Ian moved forward, swinging his greatsword. The warrior blocked with his shield. Ian used a downward blow.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUgh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The warrior held up the shield, but collapsed as he was unable to overcome the shock.\u00a0</span><span>An arrow flew towards Ian. He leaned back to evade it.\u00a0</span><span>He stepped on the enemy\u2019s shield and jumped, the face of the archer approaching his blade. Ian\u2019s greatsword sliced through his head vertically.</span></p><br/><p><span>His upper body was split apart from top to bottom. The archer fell down like a doll split from the middle.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCrazy!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The warrior abandoned his weapons and shield and fled.\u00a0</span><span>Ian threw his greatsword, which flew through the air and stabbed the warrior in the back.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuheeok!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The warrior fell forward.\u00a0</span><span>Ian walked over and pulled out his greatsword, his body twitching before falling still.\u00a0</span><span>Ian lifted his bloody greatsword.</span></p><br/><p><span>The man\u2019s body turned to white particles and collapsed. The other bodies of the users scattered as well.\u00a0</span><span>After the death process, only their equipment remained on the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span>Antuak just watched all of this.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian stood in front of Antuak.\u00a0</span><span>Antuak said with a soft smile, \u201cI am the shaman Antuak.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He opened the door wide. It was as if he knew they were coming.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGuests are always welcome.\u201d</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule: \u00a0Next Patreon goal reached!!

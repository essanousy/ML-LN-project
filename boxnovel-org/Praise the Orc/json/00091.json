Again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s face was dripping with sweat. He was too tired to move. Every joint in his body was screaming.\u00a0</span><span>His neck was stiff from tension after being lightly cut by Gushantimur\u2019s sword.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Didn\u2019t you say you would change your weapon into \u2018Dragon Slayer\u2019? Did you give up already?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNot yet!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta focused his mind. Ogre Slayer rose up and entered the realm of Pinnacle.\u00a0</span><span>He became one with the world. Time became slower. He woke up the laws of the world with his sword. He swung his greatsword with the desire to cut the enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur\u2019s sword swung towards him. In this slow world, their hearts collided with each other. All types of sword roots existed in this world and they ran among them. The last thing left in the end was to unfold their swords.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>As a natural consequence after the fighting ended, Crockta\u2019s sword flew in the air while Gushantimur\u2019s sword was pointed at Crockta\u2019s chest.\u00a0</span><span>An overwhelming defeat with no excuses!</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c1981,\u201d said Gushantimur.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta had died nearly 2,000 times today.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta took deep breaths. He recovered from his defeat. Looking back, he didn\u2019t know how he should\u2019ve responded.\u00a0</span><span>So instead of thinking, he raised the greatsword.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAgain.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The other practitioners watched Crockta\u2019s limitless spirit with admiration. In particular, the ogre who first competed with Crockta admired Crockta\u2019s fighting spirit as he raised his fist.</span></p><br/><p><span>There was no change in Gushantimur\u2019s expression. He just silently raised his sword.\u00a0</span><span>There wasn\u2019t a single drop of sweat on his body. He was a dragon but also an amazing swordsman. Crockta couldn\u2019t imagine how strong Gushantimur would be if he was turned into a god.</span></p><br/><p><span>It provoked a desire to win rather than awe.</span></p><br/><p><span>In the world of Elder Lord, he was able to endlessly renew his limits. He was an orc knocking down an ogre with a sword. It was the same for Shakan hunting the behemoth. He knocked down a strong monster with a bow.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta was convinced that he could defeat Gushantimur.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"1982.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuock...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He spent time and effort.\u00a0</span><span>Yet it was insufficient.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAgain.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta raised his limp legs.</span></p><br/><p><span>He knew the importance of repetition in training. It might be sufficient to kill the enemy with one hit, but that one strike required thousands of sunrises and sunsets. The one who wielded the sword one thousand times would win over someone who only wielded it once.</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur said, \u201cIt is up to here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Not yet.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You will.\u201d\u00a0Gushantimur</span><span>\u00a0put the sword away.\u00a0</span><span>\"I can\u2019t fight anymore.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou look fine.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Gushantimur said with a cold look, \"The most important thing in training is rest and diet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His advice was like the remark of a gym trainer; but it was reasonable, so Crockta nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>In no time, the sun was going down. The sunset at the horizon burned the sky.\u00a0</span><span>It was a beautiful twilight.</span></p><br/><p><span>The other practitioners also returned to the castle. In the distance, Tiyo and the goblin were hitting each other.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta arrived at the banquet room with Gushantimur.\u00a0</span><span>There was a long dining table with seats set up. Gushantimur sat down with Crockta, Tiyo, and Anor seated close to him.\u00a0</span><span>The chandelier in the banquet room scattered light like a waterfall. The fragmented light scattered over the food in the banquet hall, making them look more appetizing.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Good food </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is the work of my lizardman friend, a gourmet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo wrapped a napkin around his neck and imitated the manners of a gentleman. He ate a piece of meat and closed his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWow. What dish is this? The flavor is deep and so good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is gnome meat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo spat the meat out and glared at Gushantimur\u2019s face.\u00a0</span><span>Gushantimur placed the meat in his mouth without changing his expression.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA joke. It is beef.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This bastard... saying such awful things with a serious face...!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo paused for a moment.\u00a0</span><span>He rolled his eyes before suddenly laughing, \u201cHahahat! I see! Nice joke </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! Hahahat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo suddenly changed his stance.\u00a0</span><span>\"It\u2019s a joke, but it isn\u2019t bad for this big Tiyo. Hahahat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta realized that Tiyo was acting as someone with a big vessel. Tiyo spread his mouth wide open, poured the dish in, and swallowed it in one gulp.\u00a0</span><span>Gushantimur said, \"You have a really large vessel.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHahat! That\u2019s right! You don\u2019t need to be surprised </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! I am a gnome with a big vessel!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo shook his shoulders.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta was thrilled.\u00a0</span><span>He once again gained enlightenment.\u00a0</span><span>The man who seemed cold could easily praise his opponent.</span></p><br/><p><span>Truly, life was unpredictable. It wasn\u2019t what he expected and he had a whole new perspective.\u00a0</span><span>All of these things were cutting him into a tough man.\u00a0</span><span>It wasn\u2019t just Tiyo or Gushantimur. In the history of their lives, they were shaped by these things.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>That\u2019s right.</span></p><br/><p><span>Everything in the world went back to causation.\u00a0</span><span>In the world, there was no effect without a cause.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta suddenly looked at his fork. The chandelier light was reflecting over the sharp edges. The light dropping from the chandelier. That light came from a lamp that illuminated the inside.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta wielded his fork.</span></p><br/><p><span>The world slowed.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta used the Pinnacle to pursue the piece of steak on Gushantimur\u2019s plate.\u00a0</span><span>Before, he used the power of Pinnacle by calculating the \u2018result\u2019.\u00a0</span><span>But now he started to calculate the \u2018process\u2019 for defeating the enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was through inner reason, strong will and imagination!</span></p><br/><p><span>The fork contained his enlightenment.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur also defended with his fork.</span></p><br/><p><span>The two forks crossed each other\u2019s plates. In this environment, Crockta went through many possibilities in his imagination, from taking away Gushantimur\u2019s steak, having his own stolen, sometimes making a mistake or maybe breaking each other\u2019s forks.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he placed his willpower into it.\u00a0</span><span>He twisted causation.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018The Pinnacle state is to become one with the world.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta recalled Gushantimur\u2019s words, \u2018But beyond that, there is an area where you can wield the world.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>The world convulsed.\u00a0</span><span>Suddenly, the steak was hanging from Crockta\u2019s fork. Gushantimur\u2019s fork stopped in the air.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta had robbed him of his steak.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, Crockta obtained a clue to reach Hero rank.\u00a0</span><span>Beginning from small things to change the world, just like a butterfly\u2019s wings. This was the Hero territory.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKulkulkul!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Now he wanted to swing his sword.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta laughed in a pleased way.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cGushantimur!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUm.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Gushantimur had a stern expression.\u00a0</span><span>\"If it is so delicious, you could\u2019ve just asked for more.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"\u00a0</span><span>Crockta denied it.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThere is a misunderstanding...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo clicked his tongue.\u00a0</span><span>\"No matter how hungry you are, it isn\u2019t polite to covet another person\u2019s food Crockta!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cT-That isn\u2019t it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>But all the eyes around him were cold.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Orc friend, </span><i><span>kyak</span></i><span>! You have learned the wrong manners </span><i><span>kyaak</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Even the goblin pointed out his manners. The ogre had a disappointed expression on its face. Public opinion was already against him.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta tried to protest but closed his mouth when he heard Anor\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Please eat your own.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He gave up arguing. Crockta looked down at his plate.\u00a0</span><span>The flavor was delicious.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta dropped his head and put the meat in his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2019tar...\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is nice here,\u201d Anor suddenly said.</span></p><br/><p><span>They were staying in the same room. After leaving Nuridot, Gushantimur\u2019s castle was strange for them who had been camping outside.\u00a0</span><span>He had just finished bathing and changing clothes, so Anor felt like a beautiful elf again as he saw his shiny skin. Light shone on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo had also washed and changed into pajamas given by the castle, causing him to look like the child of a noble family.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta showed his tough face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I wish I could stay here...\u201d muttered Anor.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>But he knew that he couldn\u2019t.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of time to waste </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>,\u201d replied Tiyo.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>After stopping by the Temple of the Fallen God in Nameragon, they had to seek the cooperation of the dark elves to deal with the Great Clan.\u00a0</span><span>They were enjoying a little peace right now, but a horrible war in the north was waiting for them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Crockta, when will we leave this place?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta closed his eyes and thought about a reply to Tiyo\u2019s question.\u00a0</span><span>Staying here and training would be a great help. However, they couldn\u2019t stay forever. It was a reasonable time scale.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"In up to a week.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA week...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That is enough to achieve some progress.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I will be sorry to leave.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo said. It seemed like he already had an attachment to the goblin archer, Kiao.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We can come back again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAgain...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta smiled and said, \"After defeating the Great Clan and bringing peace to the north, we can come back here and spend a long break.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hoh... good </span><i><span>dot.</span></i><span>\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to it.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Anor laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo declared, \"At that time, I will become really strong and will break the nose of Kiao </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kulkul, you can\u2019t break it in a week?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I hate to admit it, but he is a great guy </span><i><span>dot.</span></i><span> Breaking his nose will be a hard feat to accomplish in just a week.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta agreed. Apart from Gushantimur, the other creatures were pursuing their own goals.\u00a0</span><span>There were countless hot-blooded people here in the Black Forest.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It will be hard even if we are here for a month.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He witnessed a new world, but he was still far from winning against Gushantimur.\u00a0</span><span>But one day, he would cross that insurmountable wall.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Everybody, have strength.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor got into bed in a calm manner. He seemed to have no thoughts in his head. He stretched out on the soft quilt.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Tomorrow we need to train properly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I'm going to turn off the lights.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGood night. Hihit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Thus, their first day in the Black Forest ended.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Time passed.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta could now last much longer than before. Gushantimur stopped counting his deaths.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta swung the greatsword and pressured Gushantimur.</span></p><br/><p><span>Now he was able to switch the Pinnacle state on and off in an instant. However, Gushantimur was really tough. After truly knowing the Pinnacle state, Crockta realized what an exceptional swordsman he was.</span></p><br/><p><span>But even Gushantimur hadn\u2019t reached the true Hero state.\u00a0</span><span>How much stronger was the power of the Hero state?</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Crockta, your goal is to kill the chieftain.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The more he knew, the more he became determined that the chieftain should be removed.\u00a0</span><span>He was a danger not just to the north, but the southern continent as well.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Would even you have a hard time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta stopped his sword.\u00a0</span><span>He hadn\u2019t expected the great chieftain to be so strong.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He is stronger than Gushantimur?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat can\u2019t be.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Gushantimur took a deep breath.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cBut there are various ways of becoming stronger. Your path isn\u2019t the only way to increase in power.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are you talking about?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou will soon find out.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Gushantimur wielded his blade. It hit the greatsword. There was a metallic echo.\u00a0</span><span>\"Now focus on me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kulkul, understood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Gushantimur competed. Crockta gradually started to seem like an opponent. There were parts where Gushantimur weakened, but it was true that Crockta had greatly developed.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the same for Tiyo.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ayaaat! General\u2019s evolution!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo closed his eyes and focused on General.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Clink, clink!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>General\u2019s appearance slowly changed.\u00a0</span><span>The muzzle opened and the barrel expanded. General\u2019s new look was completed.</span></p><br/><p><span>General Vulcan! (Probably something similar to this.)</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I failed to make a cannon, but this is also cool.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo aimed Vulcan at Kiao who still looked displeased.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t think about such tricks </span><i><span>kyak</span></i><span>! You have to pursue the strongest heart </span><i><span>kyak</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Noisy </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>, if one doesn\u2019t push you then I will use two. If two doesn\u2019t work then I will use four then eight!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Stubborn gnome </span><i><span>kyak</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Stiff goblin!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The two glared at each other.\u00a0</span><span>Kiao shook his head and pulled out an arrow.\u00a0</span><span>A goblin who pursued becoming the strongest!\u00a0</span><span>A fearsome momentum came from him. It was like a dragon\u2019s mouth appeared behind him.\u00a0</span><span>The force of a storm was condensed in Kiao\u2019s arrow and aimed at Tiyo.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo didn\u2019t stay still either. He aimed Vulcan at Kiao. Vulcan rotated and numerous magic bullets emerged.</span></p><br/><p><span>The arrow left the bow.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"</span><i><span>Kyu</span></i><span>! </span><i><span>Kya kekiyo kuweek</span></i><span>!\u201d shouted Kiao in the goblin language.</span></p><br/><p><span>At the same time, a tremendous, fearsome storm appeared and descended that completely covered Tiyo.\u00a0</span><span>Facing this, Tiyo was just like a candle in front of the wind.\u00a0</span><span>The storm overcame him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The practitioners watching the two couldn\u2019t help gulping.

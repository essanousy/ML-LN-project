This is based on three reasons.</span></p><br/><p><span>Not long ago, something strange occurred during the battle where Crockta was in danger.</span></p><br/><p><span>Elder Lord\u2019s time zone is different from reality, making it hard when broadcasting. In other words, the videos shown are on fast forward. Undergames cut out any unnecessary parts in order to make it in real-time as much as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span>The reason why Undergames\u2019 broadcast is much faster than the private broadcast of BJ Heaven and Earth is due to editing.</span></p><br/><p><span>I don\u2019t know about the people who only watched Undergames\u2019 broadcast, but in the BJ Heaven and Earth\u2019s video, a member of the clan reached out towards Crockta\u2019s forehead in the middle of the danger zone.</span></p><br/><p><span>I asked the clan executives whom I personally know about what that member was doing.</span></p><br/><p><span>At the time, the clan member saw something white between the torn parts of the headband. He didn\u2019t see it properly and failed to confirm it before dying.</span></p><br/><p><span>In retrospect, have we ever seen Crockta\u2019s forehead? He first appeared in Laney\u2019s video wearing a black bandana, and later on he wore the headband.</span></p><br/><p><span>NPCs can wear headbands, but it is a little suspicious.</span></p><br/><p><span>Additionally, everyone saw Crockta killing the \u2018He\u2019s an Orc, yet still Praiseworthy\u2019 member before the Concrete method could be used. NPCs know about this method, but it is strange that he would throw his body to save the person.</span></p><br/><p><span>It is understandable if Crockta is a user. If people think Crockta is a NPC, he doesn\u2019t have to worry about the Concrete method, and if he dies, he can survive. So, his actions are natural if he has multiple lives.</span></p><br/><p><span>Even when Crockta was fighting the Thawing Balhae Clan, he used the Concrete method against them. At that time, I thought of him as just a scary NPC, but it is natural behaviour if Crockta is a user.</span></p><br/><p><span>First, let\u2019s assume that Crockta really is a user.\u00a0</span><span>His level must be very high. His achievements score wouldn\u2019t be a joke. He must be a ranker.\u00a0</span><span>When looking at the rankings, Choi Hansung is No.1 in Elder Lord.</span></p><br/><p><span>The who is No.2?</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Mystery,\u2019 a private ranker who doesn\u2019t disclose any information. I think that Crockta is \u2018Mystery.\u2019\u00a0</span><span>It is common sense that being a ranker can turn you into a star, so why would the second ranked person remain private?</span></p><br/><p><span>Mystery is now level 142. It is much higher than Choi Hansung\u2019s level. Nobody knows who the level 142 monster is, but this is explained if Crockta is Mystery. In other words...</span></p><br/><p></p><ol><br/><p></p><li><span> Crockta's forehead.</span></li><br/><p></p><li><span> Concrete method.</span></li><br/><p></p><li><span> The mystery of the identity of the second ranked user in Elder Lord.</span></li><br/><p></p></ol><br/><p><span>I think that Crockta is a user for these three reasons.\u00a0</span><span>Of course, this evidence isn\u2019t sufficient. In fact, Crockta\u2019s actions don\u2019t make sense if he is a user. I never would\u2019ve believed it if his headband hadn\u2019t been torn this time.</span></p><br/><p><span>He will soon go against the Heaven and Earth Clan, and I hope it is properly revealed then.]</span></p><br/><p><span>This post attracted people\u2019s attention.</span></p><br/><p><span>The comments became a war between those who thought it made sense and those who didn\u2019t.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Conspiracies Out: Now, there are even conspiracy theories for a game.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2514 Nod Nod Bang: There is no physical evidence, and everything is circumstantial.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2514 Post-it: The pieces moderately fit together \u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b The lady selling bread in Maillard always wears a bandana, is she a user too? \u314b\u314b\u314b A user hiding her forehead \u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2514 China Road: I am curious about Mystery\u2019s identity.

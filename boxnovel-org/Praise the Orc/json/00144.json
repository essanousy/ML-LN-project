You are so popular in Maillard... of course, I am very popular in Quantes </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta was an icon for the users, so the accompanying Anor and Tiyo were treated very well.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I miss the caruks.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"When the time comes, we will see them again </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was possible to move faster by taking horses instead of caruks.\u00a0</span><span>The caruks were left to the Rehabilitation Brothers. The caruks, who had great advantages in the desert area, weren\u2019t useful in the continent. In the Rehabilitation Brothers, they were taken care of as \u2018Crockta\u2019s mount.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is the first time I am going to the south </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow come?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is the land of humans.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There are many humans in the south.\u00a0</span><span>The northwest of the continent was a harsh place where orcs and creatures lived, while the northeast was the land of the elves, dark elves and gnomes. The south of the continent was where humans lived together.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the most populated, fiercest and disruptive land, the south.\u00a0</span><span>In particular, the center of the continent contained many species due to its geographic location, meaning there were occasional fights among species.</span></p><br/><p><span>They had to pass through it to arrive in the south.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo wanted to meet his father Hedor while Crockta was trying to completely eliminate the remnants of the Thawing Balhae Clan, who had joined the Heaven and Earth Clan.</span></p><br/><p><span>And Anor had no thoughts.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWhat does the food in the south taste like? Won\u2019t there be an abundance of hot and fat foods? Many fruits as well. Hahaha.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He chuckled from aboard his horse.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cLook. There are many new creatures on the continent!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor stretched out his hand and bones started to rise.\u00a0</span><span>It was a strange bipedal creature.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Lay it down again</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Why? The bones are fresh as it just died.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is unsightly </span><i><span>dot.</span></i><span>\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis is discrimination. Tiyo will be like this when you die.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo fired General at the bones.\u00a0</span><span>The bones were smashed to pieces.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh! My bones!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe dead have no words.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cToo much...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta smiled as he watched them, but he soon fixed his expression.\u00a0</span><span>He started to feel something from the forest they were riding through. There were presences moving here and there simultaneously.\u00a0</span><span>The movements were too sudden for them to be people passing by.</span></p><br/><p><span>As they rode along the path, the video of White Knight Andre, no Baek Hanho popped into his head.\u00a0</span><span>He annihilated all the bandits and declared war against Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>That\u2019s right.\u00a0</span><span>Bandits!</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is started once again. Kulkul.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta laughed as he turned to Tiyo and Anor.\u00a0</span><span>\"Shall we take a break?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That's right. IT has been a while. I want to rest. Isn\u2019t it hard?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Anor replied while patting his horse\u2019s mane.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo smiled at Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI don\u2019t think I should sweat before resting </span><i><span>do</span></i><span>t.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If you sweat from this then you are weak.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI won\u2019t sweat </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, Tiyo twisted his body and fired General.\u00a0</span><span>A bandit hiding behind a tree was hit by General and flew in the air. He bumped into another tree and fell to the ground with a groan.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Bandits can only make me sweat a little around my eyes</span><i><span> do</span></i><span>t!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo had already noticed the approach of the bandits.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Cover everything!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At Tiyo\u2019s attack, the bandits jumped out and rushed towards them.\u00a0</span><span>Anor, who had no idea what was going on, screamed and hid behind Crockta and Tiyo.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"They are gnats</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta got off his horse while Tiyo showed brilliant marksmanship while holding the reins of his horse.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Iyat! Iyat! Kiyooh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Chong!</span></i><i><span>Chong!</span></i><i><span>Chong!</span></i><span> Tiyo\u2019s magic bullets accurately knocked down the bandits approaching.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta also wielded his greatsword.\u00a0</span><span>However, he hesitated and didn\u2019t attack anymore.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The enemies\u2019 weapons were terrible.\u00a0</span><span>Some of them were stepping awkwardly while holding farm equipment. Some held swords or spears, but their eyes were terrified.</span></p><br/><p><span>The man in the front exclaimed.\u00a0</span><span>\"I-I-If you leave what you have, w-we won\u2019t kill you!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a pathetic voice.\u00a0</span><span>He realized they weren\u2019t a match after seeing their companions knocked down because of Tiyo, but he spoke the threat because there was no room to back off.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I only have this.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta pointed his greatsword.</span></p><br/><p><span>There was no need to fight. Tiyo also stopped firing General.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>? Sorry I hit you </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThese bandits have no killing intent. They are bandits but...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>As the clouds moved, bright sunshine fell in the forest.\u00a0</span><span>The shadows of the forest were removed, revealing Crockta\u2019s form.</span></p><br/><p><span>The bandits were stunned. \u00a0</span><span>A huge size and rugged face. The fearsome greatsword.\u00a0</span><span>The opponent was much more vicious than they imagined.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta looked at them without saying anything. The bandits stepped back at his gaze.\u00a0</span><span>The tattoos covering the body and the terrible belt at his waist made him seem like a demon.</span></p><br/><p><span>The person in the lead bowed first.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cW-We\u2019re really sorry!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The other bandits identified the situation and also bowed while begging for mercy.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe\u2019re sorry!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSpare us!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is hard to eat and live!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Bowing to the overwhelming enemy!\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo hit Crockta\u2019s waist.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cSmile a bit </span><i><span>dot.</span></i><span>\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo had a point. He didn\u2019t look so scary when smiling. A nasty person wouldn\u2019t smile.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta smiled at them and said.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cStand up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The reaction was explosive.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHiik! We\u2019re sorry! Spare us!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"My wife and children are waiting for me!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSir Orc! Mercy!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta glanced at Tiyo. He shrugged and immediately changed his words.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You should\u2019ve left it as before. Look the way you want </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor came forward and helped them up.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cPhew. Stand up. This person looks like a serial killer but he isn\u2019t bad. Stand up. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He was wearing a dark robe, but as soon as the dark elf Anor appeared, they started to recover.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Pff. Anyway, life is unfair </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>. Pffft.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo giggled. </span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta muttered,\u00a0</span><span>\u201c...Kid.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cW-What did you say </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?! Say it to me!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t lie </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! You called me a kid </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You heard wrong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEek!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo jumped and clung to Crockta. He tried to place Crockta in a headlock, but he just looked like a child hanging on.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat are you doing now? These kids.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Anor muttered as he stared at them.\u00a0</span><span>\"Is this the right time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cT-Then?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Listen to these people\u2019s stories! Go and talk to them!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUm...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There weren\u2019t many bandits in this area, which was the north of the continent. It was so peaceful that people hardly ever turned to the criminal path.\u00a0</span><span>But this happened as soon as they headed south.\u00a0</span><span>The south might be different from the continent that they had experienced.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I'll do that.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta completely recognized Elder Lord as a real world.\u00a0</span><span>In the world of Elder Lord, he had power.\u00a0</span><span>In other words, a Hero.\u00a0</span><span>With great power comes great responsibility, so he wanted to help people who were in need.\u00a0</span><span>He should find out their circumstances.</span></p><br/><p><span>The bandits\u2019 eyes widened.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>They were residents of a small village in the forest.\u00a0</span><span>They didn\u2019t have much, but it was still a life of freedom. Then one day, an existence appeared that took all of that away from them.</span></p><br/><p><span>Knights.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"They told us to follow the Emperor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEmperor?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>One bandit said. He was their leader called Hans.\u00a0</span><span>\"As you know, there is no emperor on the continent. It is an unwritten rule. The advent of an emperor had always led to the persecution of other species.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"But someone is calling himself an emperor?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. The knights are gathering villagers and farmers like us under the emperor\u2019s name. They speak nice words but we will be serfs. It is no different from slavery. So we refused.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Once they refused, the knights turned like they had been waiting and devastated the village. Anyone who rebelled was killed.\u00a0</span><span>In the end, they had nothing left and become bandits attacking adventurers and merchants in order to survive.\u00a0</span><span>However, their combat power was weak so they were often defeated.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is our fault but our children are starving...sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s group reached their home.\u00a0</span><span>The elderly, women, and children poked their heads out from tents in the forest.\u00a0</span><span>They looked frightened at the sudden appearance of a heinous orc.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUmm...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>All of them were starving and their ribs poked out from underneath their skin. In particular, the children's conditions were serious.</span></p><br/><p><span>Hans sighed, </span><span>\"We are eating fruit in the forest and hunting, but...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo clicked his tongue.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are these knights doing </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>? The emperor of where?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The king of Esperanza.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe king had a change of heart...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>In the case of orcs, each city was operated independently. The elves were similar to orcs, but they were weakly connected by the world tree. Gnomes regularly voted for their representative.</span></p><br/><p><span>In the case of humans, there were royalty and nobles. However, the king\u2019s power wasn\u2019t strong and he was mainly regarded as a symbolic entity representing the nobles. Something seemed to have changed.</span></p><br/><p><span>The advent of an emperor would shake the entire continent.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is unknown if the other species know about this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If he does this, they will probably find out </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>. But this is serious </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor\u2019s ears pricked,\u00a0</span><span>\"The emperor...is he like the orc\u2019s great chieftain?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen do we have to worry? Don\u2019t we have the great chieftain here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh! That\u2019s right </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! The great chieftain...oof!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo and Anor tried to tease Crockta again.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta quickly blocked their mouths and said, \"Anyway, this is a pitiful situation...I want to help.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"How </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This much...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked at the residents. There weren\u2019t many of them because they were originally a village.\u00a0</span><span>The Rehabilitation Brothers could afford this number.\u00a0</span><span>Besides, the Rehabilitation Brothers were formed for the purpose of helping others. They would also listen if Crockta asked them to do it.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta told them, \"Go to Maillard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh? Maillard?\u201d Hans questioned.\u00a0</span><span>He became even more polite after hearing the name Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere are people in Maillard who will help you out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do you mean us?\u201d Who...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMy friends are known as the Rehabilitation Brothers.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Rehabilitation Brothers?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Hans was dubious.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cBut Maillard isn\u2019t close. It won\u2019t be easy to reach there...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They had to worry about the daily meals. Crockta shook his head as if telling them not to worry.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHere.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta pulled out some gold coins.\u00a0</span><span>He had become a top ranked player while playing the game and could afford at least this much.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This...!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Han\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0</span><span>For ordinary people, gold coins were worth a huge amount of money. Crockta pulled out several, not just one, and placed them in Hans\u2019 hands.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Why is this...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He didn\u2019t put away the gold coins on his palm as he stared blankly at Crockta. \u00a0Crockta scratched his nose and shrugged.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA warrior shouldn\u2019t turn a blind eye to those in distress.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Just take it. The gold coins are just shining stones to me. I can spare a few stones if it saves you from starving!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Hans was thrilled.\u00a0</span><span>\"Ahh...please forgive me for taking this. Crockta!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t do that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I wouldn\u2019t be willing if it wasn\u2019t for the children! Thank you!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta raised him up.\u00a0</span><span>As the two were talking, the villagers started to falter.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo was the first one to notice.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo suddenly felt horseshoes approaching. The village residents were terrified when they looked to one side.\u00a0</span><span>He followed their gaze to see a group of humans.\u00a0</span><span>The humans were mounted and in full-body armor. They held lances and swords.</span></p><br/><p><span>Knights.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Now, are you willing to follow the emperor?\u201d</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><br/><p>I have also updated my\u00a0Patreon\u00a0to reflect my new novels.

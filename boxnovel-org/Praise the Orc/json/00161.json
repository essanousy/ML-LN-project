Crockta was able to see that Adandator\u2019s swordsmanship was the result of patience and hard work.\u00a0</span><span>All the movements were repeated and his swords worn out. It was an extreme obsession.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta was reminded of Hoyt when he saw Adandator. He had some resemblance to Hoyt, who repeated the movements hundreds of thousands of times.\u00a0</span><span>If there were more knights like Adandator, this fight would be dangerous.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2019tar!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A blow to the air. There was a shallow scratch on the tree.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta wielded his sword like crazy. Every time he wielded it, the blade tore at the tree. But despite his violent movements, the trees only received a few minor injuries.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was extreme control.\u00a0</span><span>He only touched the tree with the tip of his sword before releasing it.</span></p><br/><p><span>He dropped the sword.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta took a deep breath.\u00a0</span><span>He looked up at the sky.\u00a0</span><span>In the thick forest that covered the sky, a few crows looked down at him and cried out.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A crow is auspicious, but it is also a disaster.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>In South Korea, the crying of a crow was a bad omen, but it was auspicious in the west.\u00a0</span><span>If so, what about the guest who had just come?</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta turned around.\u00a0</span><span>It was a guest he hadn\u2019t expected. Crockta raised his hand towards the person riding towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt has been a while.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A man holding a sword.\u00a0</span><span>Adandator.\u00a0</span><span>He wasn\u2019t dressed as a knight.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHave you been well? Orc.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am Crockta. Human.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta laughed.\u00a0</span><span>Although he won, Adandator was certainly powerful. They knew each other\u2019s level, so there was an unknown bond between them.\u00a0</span><span>There was respect, despite the fact that they might kill each other.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy did you come? I thought you just followed the Emperor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The emperor doesn\u2019t have anything to do with me.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Adandator dragged the baggage he was carrying on his back.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI came because I have a request.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A request?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. A request.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He approached Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>\"Tell me about your sword.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked at Adandator.\u00a0</span><span>It was an intense gaze. Adandator came here because of the light that appeared when he was defeated.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta formed a fist.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKeok!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator flew a short distance before hitting a tree and falling to the ground.\u00a0</span><span>He was stunned by the impact.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta approached.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuk...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don't believe those who break their oaths.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta placed his foot on Adandator\u2019s body. Then he used his strength.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCough...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Get lost.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta spat out.</span></p><br/><p><span>Their duel was definitely a fight for Alaste\u2019s freedom. Crockta won.\u00a0</span><span>However, Alaste was devastated.\u00a0</span><span>Then Crockta decided to destroy the empire.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta gradually increased his weight. Adandator was unable to withstand it and started trembling.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, he looked up at Crockta and smiled.\u00a0</span><span>\"I guess, cough, you are angry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOf course.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I will let you know. All the nobles opposed the invasion of Alaste.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cSo?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I did as well.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then why didn\u2019t you stop it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The emperor arbitrarily sent his troops. Those who were cursed by the stars.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then I came to realize. The empire is galloping. It is a horse that can no longer be stopped. I can\u2019t stop the emperor\u2019s decisions.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta removed his foot from Adandator. He barely managed to get up.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cCough, the empire and the emperor have nothing to do with why I\u2019m here. I want to know about your sword.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta turned around.\u00a0</span><span>\"I don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I will give you information.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Adandator shouted.\u00a0</span><span>\"I\u2019ll tell you about the empire. It is necessary if you want to fight the emperor.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta turned to him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Are you interested now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy are you going so far?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDidn't I already say it? I want to know about your sword.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That\u2019s it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That's it.\"\u00a0</span><span>Adandator took out a sword.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThat is all. Since you and I fought, I can barely hold my sword. When I raise the sword, you appear and block me. I\u2019m going crazy. Give me the answer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat is your reason.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What other reason is needed? I am sincere right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>He was a stupid guy.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was sometimes curious about the person called the empire\u2019s best talent. He wanted to know how Adandator became so strong.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta realized something. Adandator wasn\u2019t that mysterious or great.</span></p><br/><p><span>He was just obsessed.\u00a0</span><span>If he didn\u2019t get what he wanted, he wouldn\u2019t be able to breathe until he got it.\u00a0</span><span>And this guy only wanted the sword.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Are there any knights in the empire as strong as you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo. Earl Bendeker is retired. The rest aren\u2019t at my standard. Some knight leaders have reached the Pinnacle but not beyond that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta raised his greatsword.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What does the emperor want? A species war?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don\u2019t know. There isn\u2019t enough interview.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The bushes would constrain his movements.\u00a0</span><span>It was an unfavorable battlefield for Crockta since he used a greatsword. However, he didn\u2019t care. Those who failed to kill the opponent were dead warriors.\u00a0</span><span>They wouldn\u2019t always fight in an open environment that was favorable to them.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta swung his greatsword first. Adandator promptly responded. The two blades hit each other.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What is the Heaven and Earth Clan\u2019s position in the empire?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThose who were cursed by the stars.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Their swords collided.\u00a0</span><span>Gradually, their attacks reached the area of the Pinnacle. In the tranquil forest, the two of them moved quickly.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s sword smashed the forest while aiming at Adandator\u2019s body. Adandator desperately defended.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Are you going to just defend?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator was unable to attack.\u00a0</span><span>It was the same as when he was handling a sword alone. Crockta kept blocking him.\u00a0</span><span>He couldn\u2019t attack.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"...They came up under the sponsorship of Duke Christian and now they are by the emperor\u2019s side. Rommel is excellent at commanding in battle. I have to admit it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"How so?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He turns fools into trained soldiers.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I have never seen such a commander. While he did go through a few wars in the past, his abilities are still amazing nonetheless.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta nodded.\u00a0</span><span>It was thanks to the War Maestro class.\u00a0</span><span>As far as he knew from the broadcasts and media, Choi Hansung had the skills to strengthen the soldiers, control them and eliminate any fear of war.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This time, the emperor even gave him a troop of knights. Be careful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Well-trained knights would bring tremendous synergy to Rommel.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta once again pushed Adandator back.\u00a0</span><span>Adandator was perplexed.\u00a0</span><span>He thought he would be okay if he met Crockta in person and swung the sword. However, it wasn\u2019t the case. He could only act passively.\u00a0</span><span>He didn\u2019t dare swing his sword at Crockta, as it felt like he was facing a dead end wall.</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator laughed.\u00a0</span><span>\u201c...Have you become stronger?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA little.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>After beating Adandator, Crockta had more experience with the Hero realm.\u00a0</span><span>His overall abilities had increased since then, so he was able to deal with Adandator much easier.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator grit his teeth.\u00a0</span><span>It would be the same in the future.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShow me.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Adandator raised his sword and declared, \"Crockta, I can wield my sword after facing you. Even now I can\u2019t swing my sword. That light, what on earth is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta puffed up his chest and shamelessly stated, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It just happened. I can\u2019t do it again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>That\u2019s right.\u00a0</span><span>Since then, Crockta couldn\u2019t use that power again. It was a realm that he only glimpsed for a moment.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What?\"\u00a0</span><span>Adandator was dumbfounded.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cReally?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cReally.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator\u2019s face distorted.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Only...I was defeated by a technique you accidentally used?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Defeated.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His first official defeat in front of everyone.\u00a0</span><span>He had lost when it was a significant battle for the empire.\u00a0</span><span>However, it was just a coincidence.\u00a0</span><span>It wasn\u2019t Crockta\u2019s real ability.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuhuhu...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Adandator laughed and raised his sword before suddenly rushing forward.\u00a0</span><span>\"This fucking orc bastard!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Opportunist bastard, you reveal your true nature.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta raised his sword and declared, \"I tested you once in order to understand you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I can actually use it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator stopped his sword.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cR-Really?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator coughed, \"I reacted too early. I will apologize. It was only once...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, Crockta\u2019s fist hit his abdomen.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCough!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Trying to cheat again? You are naive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Y-You jerk...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I was lying. \u00a0But even without it, you are below me, Adandator.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBastard!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator threw down his sword and ran at Crockta, who also abandoned his weapon.\u00a0</span><span>Adandator threw his body at Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>The two opponents dumped their swords and continued to struggle for awhile. Their fists hit each other\u2019s faces.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was an unsightly dog fight between the empire\u2019s strongest knight and the orc warrior who defeated him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Wait a minute, wait a minute!\"\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was on top of him and Adandator shook his head.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta paused his fist and looked down.\u00a0</span><span>Adandator was holding both hands together.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI lost.\u201d</span><span>\u201d.......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t hit my face. I surrender.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grinned.\u00a0</span><span>\"It is good that you can admit it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He got up.\u00a0</span><span>At that moment, Adandator grabbed some dirt on the ground and threw it into Crockta\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou were tricked!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta rubbed his eyes as Adandator threw his battered body forward.\u00a0</span><span>It was a big size difference, but Adandator was able to build up a lot of strength over the past few years.\u00a0</span><span>His fists relentlessly hit Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Cough! C-Coward...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt isn\u2019t like that!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>These types of techniques were also required in knight training. Adandator was good in boxing techniques.\u00a0</span><span>He threw out a jab and once Crockta protected his face, he hit Crockta\u2019s forehead with a wind hook fist.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Papak!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s body shook.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is the end...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The moment he was going to kick Crockta\u2019s chin...</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta disappeared.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His body had bent down.\u00a0</span><span>Then Crockta picked up Adandator\u2019s body.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Wait a minute, wait a minute, that is cheating...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Were there any rules in this fight?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is supposed to be bare fists. I will die. That is a rock.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s body shook.\u00a0</span><span>He was laughing.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuhuhuhu...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta told him.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThen die.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He leaned forward.\u00a0</span><span>Adandator screamed as he headed towards the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKyaaaack!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His head was about to hit the ground.\u00a0</span><span>Just before his skull collapsed, his body stopped moving.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta had stopped just before Adandator would be killed. Crockta lifted him again and placed him safely on the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator was speechless.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHey, is it that scary? Did you pee?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHey?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta called out to him.</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator.\u00a0</span><span>He was teary-eyed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou...bastard orc...!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Adandator swung his fist. Of course, the target was Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>\"That isn\u2019t true, you bastard...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Are you a crybaby? Haha.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI will kill you!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes yes, a crybaby.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou son of a bitch!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Adandator grabbed his sword on the ground and swung it at Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>\"Ahhhhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He reached the realm of Hero in an instant and attacked Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta also used the Hero realm to deal with the attack.\u00a0</span><span>The tentacles of causality tangled together. But in the end, Adandator was pushed back.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was more experienced with the Hero realm and Adandator, who had fallen into a slump, was unable to narrow that gap.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked down at him and said,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cHey.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis bastard...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow is it? Can you now wield the sword against me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator\u2019s eyes widened.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grinned.\u00a0</span><span>\"That light, you will know what it is if you keep training.

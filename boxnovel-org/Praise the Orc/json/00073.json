The chief looked around with ferocious eyes. The tribe members avoided his gaze.\u00a0</span><span>He lifted the big axe that was leaning against the tribe chief\u2019s chair.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am Kapur, the Kapur Tribe\u2019s chief! This is your final warning. Kneel down!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He screamed with red eyes towards Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>It felt like he was going to run out right now.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Inexperienced warriors reveal their emotions on their faces.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>The words that Hoyt told him in the past popped into his head. It was as he said. Now that the chief had been insulted in front of his tribe members, he needed to show off his power and regain his authority. It was as good as displaying his weaknesses.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a waste to even call him an inexperienced warrior.\u00a0</span><span>He was no different from the monsters that the orcs handled. Crockta felt ashamed as an orc.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta spoke again, \"I refuse, Kapur.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The moment that Kapur was about to run out with his axe.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta roared.\u00a0</span><span>It was the skill, Army Crushing Roar.\u00a0</span><span>The battle shout that emanated physical force tore through the sky of the north.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2019tarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The atmosphere shook while the Kapur orcs were pushed back.\u00a0</span><span>In the front, the Kapur chief blocked his ears and took a few steps back. He dropped the axe.\u00a0</span><span>Once Crockta\u2019s shouting stopped, a dead silence fell over the tribe.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...Gulp.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Someone gulped loudly.\u00a0</span><span>Kapur regained his spirit and hurriedly raised his axe again. Then he tried to imitate Crockta\u2019s shouting. But he couldn\u2019t speak and just gasped for breath.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKapur, I have no intention of fighting you,\u201d Crockta said.</span></p><br/><p><span>Kapur\u2019s face distorted.\u00a0</span><span>\"That isn\u2019t up to you to decide! Die!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He charged with his axe. The other orc was much larger so a shadow covered Crockta for a moment.\u00a0</span><span>However, Crockta remained still. </span><span>He was grasping the movements of the opponent.</span></p><br/><p><span>He had experienced a great number of fights in Elder Lord. The enemies he met weren\u2019t any weaker than orcs. Even if he just remembered the behemoth, how many times had he almost died under its terrible feet? Then he had fought with the great hunter Shakan.</span></p><br/><p><span>An axe swung randomly wouldn\u2019t be able to harm him.\u00a0</span><span>The axe descended in a straight path. Crockta stepped back. Kapur used the recoil to swing the axe from the other side.\u00a0</span><span>At that moment, Crockta swung his greatsword.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kakang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The axe didn\u2019t break but Kapur\u2019s hand bounced back from the reaction. He stiffened from the pain.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta jumped up and kicked his face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKeuak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kapur collapsed. He rolled on the ground before getting to his feet.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he looked around again with ferocious eyes.\u00a0</span><span>The tribesmen watching the fight avoided his gaze again. Crockta\u2019s eyes sunk. He was able to see how the orc called Kapur usually acted.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Respect could never be gained through force.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta advanced. Kapur fell back until his heel touched the chief\u2019s chair.\u00a0</span><span>There was no room to back down. Kapur rushed again. He was still the chief of an orc tribe. He jumped towards Crockta with a fearsome momentum.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Aaaack!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He swung the axe down vertically. Crockta turned around and avoided the attack. Ogre Slayer gained some rotating power.\u00a0</span><span>Kapur was unable to escape and receive the greatsword with his body.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kaaack!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He was cut from under to armpits to his hips. Blood poured out. Kapur lowered the axe and grabbed his wound. </span><span>He leaned over and gasped, \u201cT-This guy...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He swallowed back the pain and moved the axe to the hand of his good side, but slipped on all of the blood. Kapur fell and started stuttering.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cT-This...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta held his knee to Kapur\u2019s temple.\u00a0</span><span>Kapur started screaming from shock.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta looked around. The Kapur tribesmen were watching with fearful eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Unbelievable...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The bodies of the warriors waiting behind the chief flinched. They were conflicted about whether to run out or not. Crockta turned his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOnce again, I have no intention of fighting you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The stunned Kapur\u2019s body started twitching. It seemed like he was about to recover his spirit.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta kicked his head. </span><span>Relentless kicking!\u00a0</span><span>Kapur\u2019s tusk was broken and he was stunned again.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked down at the fallen Kapur. Then he gazed at the Kapur warriors avoided his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYour words and deeds don\u2019t match </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>\u2026\u201d Tiyo said. </span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta shrugged.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta pointed to the Kapur warriors who originally brought them here. They were looking at each other with amazement. </span><span>\"Aren\u2019t you the ones who called us here as guests?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cT-That...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I just wanted to rest and talk here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They became embarrassed at Crockta\u2019s words. They hadn\u2019t realized that he could overcome this tribe\u2019s chief.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cT-Then...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo shouted at them, \u201cI\u2019m hungry </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then another Kapur warrior came out. It seemed like he was the leader when there was no chief.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI understand. Shelter and food. Follow me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Thus, Crockta and Tiyo became guests of the Kapur tribe after defeating their chief.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>The Kapur Tribe had finally welcomed guests after a long time. Crockta didn\u2019t know if they were welcoming or terrified, but he accepted it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs Kapur okay?\u201d Crockta asked. </span></p><br/><p><span>Rakuta, the warrior treating Crockta, replied, \u201cHe is recovering.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>The warrior was calm, unlike the other orcs he met in the north. He served Crockta directly. It seemed like he wanted to hear about the south from Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta swallowed the meat. It was a little tough but it had the flavor of the south. It was the first time he tasted meat like this.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You want to go to the Temple of the Fallen God?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don't know why you would want to go to those ruins but it won\u2019t be easy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta stared at him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That is the realm of humans and dark elves. You will be attacked.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The relationship between species was bad on the continent where he lived, but they didn\u2019t attack other species out of the blue.\u00a0</span><span>But the north was different. According to Rakuta, the different species clashed and fought with each other. There were even cases where the same species were divided in two.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Can you explain about the North?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe North...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta felt his head hurt at the description.</span></p><br/><p><span>This was the outskirts of the northern wilderness. If he went a little further up, the real orc area would appear.</span></p><br/><p><span>Several tribes were gathered around the Great Clan\u2019s chieftain. The tribes led by the clan chief were militant, going around butchering, plundering and slaughtering. They were always hoping for war and provoking other species in the north.</span></p><br/><p><span>The slavery that was forbidden on the continent was active here. The north was more narrow than the rest of the continent, but there were many conflicts with various species.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I get it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then Tiyo\u2019s voice could be heard from outside the tent.\u00a0</span><span>\"So I just lifted my gun and fired </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! Then the big monster started talking</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>! I\u2019m surprisedddd~ \u00a0My \u2018General\u2019 fired relentlessly at his eyes and pabababat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAmazing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Due to being a small gnome and carrying a magic rifle from the continent, Tiyo attracted the attention of young orcs. Tiyo was telling them a story.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo poked his head through the entrance of the tent.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCrockta! Come out and tell the story! This is why I am a wonderful gnome!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, one orc went past Tiyo and entered the tent. \u00a0</span><span>He nervously said to Rakuta, \u201cRakuta, there is trouble.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he looked at Crockta. He was afraid of Crockta, who had knocked down their chief.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat's going on?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"All of a sudden, a messenger has come from the great clan chief. Today...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Rakuta frowned.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. Rakuta explained.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Like I said, there is a great clan chief. Originally he wasn\u2019t involved in this area, but the Kapur chief wanted to become a sub-tribe under his control. We recently sent a tribute and the clan chief said there would be an answer soon...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He thought about something.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Please stay here. Your friend as well. You should absolutely not leave this place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he left the tent. \u00a0</span><span>Tiyo entered the tent, lamenting, \"Ah, I was interrupted at the important part</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta smiled and placed more meat in his mouth.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Hammerchwi looked around the Kapur tribe on a caruk.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a desolate land.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Sending me to this place...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He was an old orc warrior.\u00a0</span><span>He was a warrior who took down dark elves in his youth, but now his body wasn\u2019t the same. However, his hammer missed the battlefield. He still had enough strength to trample his enemies.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018It can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The new clan chieftain \u00a0didn\u2019t like him. It couldn\u2019t be helped. Young people always found the advice of the elderly uncomfortable. Especially someone holding power at a young age. So he kept sending Hammerchwi to different places.</span></p><br/><p><span>He met with various tribe chiefs who wanted to go under the great clan chief, and now he came to this small tribe that was near the wall of darkness.\u00a0</span><span>But the atmosphere was weird.\u00a0</span><span>The tribe was strangely messy. There were blood stains in the central lot where people would gather. Hammerchwi got down from his caruk.</span></p><br/><p><span>He discovered something on the ground.\u00a0</span><span>An orc\u2019s broken tusk.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHrmm...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His eyes narrowed.\u00a0</span><span>Then he asked one of the Kapur tribesmen serving him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ah, nothing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>However, there were signs of panic. Hammerchwi smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhere is the chief?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe should be coming soon.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>A large tribe warrior standing behind Hammerchwi opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t make Hammerchwi wait for any longer,\u201d someone said in a desolate voice. The Kapur orcs froze.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ten great tribe warriors were escorting Hammerchwi. They had steel weapons and high-quality armor that couldn\u2019t be seen in the wilderness around here. They weren\u2019t like the small tribe who couldn\u2019t make weapons and had to rob other species.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There is no need to threaten them. I have a lot of time,\u201d Hammerchwi scolded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I understand.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The warrior bowed his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then Kapur hurriedly came out of his tent. He was a big orc that could match the size of the great clan chief. He was big even in comparison to the clan warriors.\u00a0</span><span>However, his movements were strange.</span></p><br/><p><span>Hammerchwi narrowed his eyes. There were cloths wrapped around the orc\u2019s body. They were soaked with blood. The swollen face wasn\u2019t the end of it, though.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The tusks protruding from his mouth were broken.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow interesting,\u201d Hammerchwi laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>Kapur approached and bowed his head.\u00a0</span><span>\"You came a long way. I am Kapur.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a totally different attitude from how he treated his tribesmen. Hammerchwi confirmed the bloodstains on Kapur\u2019s side.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNothing! Nothing happened.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Hammerchwi bent his knees and looked at the face of Kapur who was still bowing.\u00a0</span><span>He flinched.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTell me what happened.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Nothing happened...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAre you lying to me right now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kapur rolled his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>Then he said, \u201cActually, something did happen.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDescribe it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"An orc suddenly came and threatened us. I fought him but he was holding a weird weapon and I couldn\u2019t resist. He said he wanted to kill me and become the chief of this place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Hammerchwi touched his chin.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cHrmm...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He didn\u2019t even care that the great clan chieftain is behind me. Please defeat him!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Hammerchwi nodded. He didn\u2019t know the exact matter but there were two certain facts.</span></p><br/><p><span>One. This chief lost to someone.\u00a0</span><span>Two. The orc was stronger than the chief.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Interesting.\"\u00a0</span><span>Hammerchwi stood up. It had been a tedious task but suddenly something different had happened. Hammerchwi said as he looked around the Kapur tribe.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cSo where is this orc?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He glared fiercely at the Kapur tribe members. They pointed to a tent.\u00a0</span><span>Kapur spoke in an earnest tone to Hammerchwi.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThat tent over there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Hammerchwi nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I will see him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He walked towards the tent. The inside of the tent wasn\u2019t visible because the entrance was closed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBe careful! He is big, has a terrible belt and tattoos all over his body!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A person who could knock out the over sized Kapur chief wasn\u2019t normal.</span></p><br/><p><span>Hammerchwi\u2019s mouth rose. Would this fearsome orc entertain him? Excitement at the battle in front of him filled his whole body. The orcs in the outskirts weren\u2019t properly trained but there were still those who showed a rough wildness. This guy was probably one of them.</span></p><br/><p><span>He led the other clan warriors into the tent.\u00a0</span><span>Then Hammerchwi finally saw the opponent.</span></p><br/><p><span>There.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWho are you?\u201d A cute little gnome cried out.</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0<strong>Next Patreon goal has been reached!!

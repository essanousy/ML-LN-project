A monster named after a legendary dragon. An alias for the first dragon-class monster to appear.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought it was dead but now Azi Dahaka is raising its body.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ian heard the news and bowed his head, touching his chin. He had a headache thinking about the humanoid monster that appeared next to Parthenon\u2019s body and now Azi Dahaka was resurrected. The worry that he always had in the back of the mind was revived and his head was disturbed. It was one question.</p><br/><p>\u2018Can humanity prevail in this war?\u2019</p><br/><p>It was this.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know the power of all the monsters. He didn\u2019t know where they came from or how many there were. Scientists came up with all sorts of ideas about these monsters. They were bio-weapons made from genetic engineering, a species from another world aiming for this planet, monsters made by the Nazis, world government conspiracy theories, a punishment from God, etc. As the debate worsened, one fact became clear.</p><br/><p>Humans still didn\u2019t know anything about the enemy.</p><br/><p>There were 10 dragon-grade monsters who appeared. All but Azi Dahaka died from the hands of Ian. Humanity\u2019s countermeasure was still only Ian. He wasn\u2019t immortal. The hunters who awakened due to the days of Elder Road were continuing to grow, but they weren\u2019t at the level to deal with dragon-grade monsters.</p><br/><p>Would this war end? What kind of result waited at the end? This worry had continued to grow since his awakening.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a long silence, Ian replied. He decided not to think too deeply. He couldn\u2019t afford to feel fear now. No matter what the future held, he had to do his best in the current.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is Azi Dahaka? Sydney?\u201d</p><br/><p>\"It has left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\"Really? What about the National Guard?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no damage. The National Guard knew they couldn\u2019t cope so they all retreated. Azi Dahaka left Sydney and went to the desert. It is currently at Ayers Rock.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAyers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Also known as Uluru, a rock that was called the belly button of the world. A picture of a huge dragon was sent to Ian. Azi Dahaka was sitting on the largest rock known to humanity. Ian stared at Azi Dahaka in the photo.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe support?\u201d</p><br/><p>\"The Australian government has promised to devote all its best. But based on Sydney, they can\u2019t do much. In fact, there is no support.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ian always fought alone. The word \u2018support\u2019 didn\u2019t match him. In return, he received a huge reward. But this wasn\u2019t important to him. There was nothing he needed.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ll ask for support.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Why...?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ian\u2019s agent, Leonardo looked at him with a questioning expression. It was rare for Ian to ask for something first.</p><br/><p>\"Contact the US and ask them to prepare a nuclear bomb.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIan...\u201d</p><br/><p>\"It is good that it is already a desert.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><br/><p>\"I just don\u2019t feel good. Don\u2019t worry. There won\u2019t be any problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>\"I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave as soon as possible. Thank you, Leonardo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. It's my pleasure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leonardo winked. Then he turned off the video call.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ian leaned back. He eliminated Egypt\u2019s \u2018Ramul\u2019 and Libya\u2019s \u2018Parthenon.\u2019 Now it was Azi Dahaka. It was unprecedented to deal with so many dragon-class monsters in a row like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you be okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>His secretary asked. He continued to use his healing ability on Ian. Ian laughed.</p><br/><p>\"If I\u2019m not okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be tired...\u201d</p><br/><p>\"If I stop, people will die.\u201d</p><br/><p>His secretary fell silent. The man who gave off a good impression was actually carrying the fate of the world.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m okay so let\u2019s depart immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ian spread open his hands and relaxed. The next destination was Australia.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t reach him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally dot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\"He must be busy. Neither the secretary or agent accepted my call. Did something happen?</p><br/><p>\"Leave it dot. Crockta has his own business dot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tiyo\u2019s party already paid no attention to Crockta\u2019s whereabouts. They were having a happy time at Choi Hansung\u2019s home.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis... what is this dish? It is the first time I\u2019ve tasted such delicious food!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is called chicken.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTashaquil. Try the soy sauce one here. It isn\u2019t a joke!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh! Today is the first time I thought it was good to join your adventure.\"</p><br/><p>\"Me too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat dot? Didn\u2019t you like it before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tiyo\u2019s party wasn\u2019t able to eat proper food due to the hardships in the past. Choi Hansung ordered various delivery foods for them and gave them a big meal. They fell for the taste of this food. Chicken, pizza, Chinese cuisine, fish, meat and various midnight snacks were delivered to create a lavish feast.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuman. What is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is pizza.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPizza... I like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The double wielding swordsman, Driden was holding a pizza in both hands.</p><br/><p>\"What are you eating now dot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\"Oh, it is ramen. It is delicious but it isn\u2019t good for the body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious. Can I taste it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Choi Hansung handed over his ramen. Tiyo looked at it carefully and gulped down the soup. Then his eyes widened.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis...!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tiyo\u2019s reaction attracted everyone\u2019s attention. Tiyo shouted, \u201cThis isn\u2019t the demon\u2019s food dot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon? Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis! It is like that fellow Abaddon dot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHrmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group rushed like zombies at his words. Choi Hansung had to boil a few more packets of ramen for them. Then he heard the story about the spicy food that was similar to ramen in Elder Lord. They couldn\u2019t eat it due to wandering around here and there.</p><br/><p>\"The taste of home... I have no regrets if I die.\u201d</p><br/><p>The taste of their home was ramen.</p><br/><p>\"I'm going to burst.\u201d</p><br/><p>\"This amount if enough to make the middle full. Kulkul.\u201d</p><br/><p>As orcs could eat a lot of food, Tashaquil patted his belly and lay on the sofa. Anor lay his head on Tashaquil\u2019s belly.</p><br/><p>\"By the way, Crockta is busy...\u201d</p><br/><p>Tiyo looked at Choi Hansung.</p><br/><p>\"We can\u2019t go meet him dot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where he is and it is probably far away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\"Far away dot?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tiyo laughed at his words.</p><br/><p>\"Rommel says he is far away dot.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at his party members. Everyone laughed.</p><br/><p>\"We have already crossed seas and continents. It is funny to say that he is far away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\"How far is it? We crossed dimensions. At best, isn\u2019t he on the same planet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\"For us, this greenhouse-like planet is ridiculous dot. Kuahahahat!\u201d</p><br/><p>They giggled like it was absurd. Choi Hansung was upset. These guys from Elder Road dared ignore his blue planet?</p><br/><p>This planet had beautiful four seasons and produced superstars like Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods. Pacquiao dominated the eight-class weight category and Eminem broke the record for \u00a0album sales. Wasn\u2019t English the most used language in the world?</p><br/><p>Do you know Mariana Trench? Do you know Mount Everest?</p><br/><p>Choi Hansung roughly manipulated the remote control. Tashaquil, who was staring at a girl group with his mouth gaping open, glared at Choi Hansung.</p><br/><p>\"I was watching that.\u201d</p><br/><p>His complexion darkened. The giant full HD screen he bought with the money of a hunter was now showing something more beautiful than a girl group. It was a lonely planet rotating in a vast universe. It was just a pale blue dot compared to the scale of the universe, but it was the sea of life.</p><br/><p>All of us. The blue planet Earth. The majestic scenery looked down at them. All the known history and civilization was on this blue sphere. Choi Hansung was thrilled and whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat... is where we are.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tiyo replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat bullshit is this dot?\u201d</p><br/><p>The rest protested.</p><br/><p>\"A bead dot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a pretty but eerie image. The background is poor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019d like to look at what was on before...\u201d</p><br/><p>\"...\"</p><br/><p>Choi Hansung tried hard to explain but it didn\u2019t reach them. The frustrated Choi Hansung was eventually forced to show them a map of the world. Now they nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh, a map dot. It is unbelievably detailed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are here. It is called South Korea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tiyo said, \u201cEh? It is very small dot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! What are you saying? We have Park Jisung and Kim Yuna, as well as the most scientific writing system in the world...\"</p><br/><p>\"Then where is Crockta dot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\"Do you know... maybe he is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Choi Hansung pointed to the area labelled Egypt. They couldn\u2019t see how far it was because they didn\u2019t have a sense of Earth\u2019s size.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will take one day on a plane.\u201d</p><br/><p>\"Such a small planet dot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p><br/><p>Choi Hansung explain that Earth was actually a very big and cool planet. But thanks to the cutting edge technology of an airplane, they were able to move in a short amount of time. There was a lot of suffering behind its history and could be traced back to the achievements of the Wright brothers.</p><br/><p>However, Tiyo\u2019s party stopped listening from the middle.</p><br/><p>\"Sigh... he really speaks a lot dot...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut his mouth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m pretending to listen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKulkulkul.\u201d</p><br/><p>The attempt to tell them about the greatness of Earth\u2019s civilization failed. Choi Hansung felt desperate. At that moment, his phone rang.</p><br/><p>\"Hello?\"</p><br/><p>Choi Hansung looked towards Tiyo\u2019s party and raised an index finger to his lips.</p><br/><p>\"Really?\"</p><br/><p>Choi Hansung was also a world famous hunter. No, he was the best except for Ian. He was Rommel. Before Crockta\u2019s appearance in Elder Road, he was the leader of the supreme Heaven and Earth clan. His information network was different. Choi Hansung\u2019s face became serious. The information was shocking.</p><br/><p>\u201cIts body revived again?\u201d</p><br/><p>He asked the Korean government for information on Ian\u2019s location and they informed him of an unexpected fact. Ian had defeated Ramul in Egypt, Parthenon in Libya and recaptured the city. But then Azi Dahaka started to move again. Ian headed straight there. He would dealing with dragon-class monsters in succession. Choi Hansung frowned.</p><br/><p>\"No, that doesn\u2019t mean he will immediately... no, hah. Yes. I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Choi Hansung shook his head.</p><br/><p>They said Ian was going on his own. The bottom line was that there was no solution unless Ian went. Choi Hansung felt his own helplessness every time a dragon-class monster appeared. If it weren\u2019t for Ian, the human race would already be destroyed.</p><br/><p>Humanity as a whole owed him a debt.</p><br/><p>\"Can\u2019t it be killed by a nuclear weapon? What is the crisis over there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Choi Hansung asked.</p><br/><p>\"Where is Azi Dahaka? Yes, I will go. I\u2019m not crazy. I\u2019m going. I will go directly. What if Ian has a problem? This is three dragon-class monsters in a row!\u201d</p><br/><p>Choi Hansung shouted.</p><br/><p>\"In any case, it is all over if something happens to Ian. South Korea will be fine even without me. But it is over if we don\u2019t have him. If there is a problem, contact the White Knight. That uncle is free. Me? I am originally a rude bastard. No, what is with my tone? Aren\u2019t you twisting it? Shit! It is always me! Are you going to die without me? Why is South Korea relying on me alone? How long have I been doing this? Aish, really!\u201d</p><br/><p>The government official shouted but Choi Hansung just hung up.</p><br/><p>He was a man of action.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumans are so stifling. Tsk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Choi Hansung shook his head. Tiyo looked at him and clapped.</p><br/><p>\"I have found out where Crockta is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard it. You are a bigger man than I thought dot! Let\u2019s go dot! Starting now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go quickly. I don\u2019t have a good feeling. We have to go and help. Ian will be having a hard time right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\"Huhu, we are finally dealing with some monsters. Interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\"How are we going? Are we taking the car?\u201d</p><br/><p>\"Don't worry. The airplane...\u201d</p><br/><p>Choi Hansung paused.</p><br/><p>\"Buy planet tickets... then...\u201d</p><br/><p>Come to think of it, they didn\u2019t have passports. Their identities were also unclear. How could he fly with them to Australia?</p><br/><p>\"Ah...\u201d</p><br/><p>Choi Hansung grabbed his head and muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat...\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought for a moment before sighing.</p><br/><p>\"Shi...\u201d</p><br/><p>Choi Hansung alternated looking between his phone and his shaking hands, before eventually opening his phone. He moved his hands and touched the call button. Before long, he started acting politely.</p><br/><p>\"Ah, I\u2019m sorry. I had to take a minute... yes... it is because I am sometimes stressed from work... hahaha...I\u2019m sorry. Not that different... I have a favor to ask... ah, yes... I\u2019m sorry... I\u2019m glad....\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

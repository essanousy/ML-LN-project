What about you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMy job has ended.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLet us begin as soon as possible. Time is running out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cRight.\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Katalu had changed during Crockta\u2019s absence.\u00a0</span><span>The preparations for war had disappeared, and it seemed to revive into a lively city.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta walked through the bustling market with Tiyo, then he found a store and slowed down.\u00a0</span><span>It was a vegetable store.\u00a0</span><span>Old memories suddenly popped into his head.\u00a0</span><span>At one time, he had sold vegetables. He had helped Stella sell vegetables in Anail.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat man, he is fairly good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe can sell a fireplace to people in the desert <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The vegetable seller was brilliant at dealing with customers. He stopped the guests, formed an affinity with them, and sold them a handful of vegetables.\u00a0</span><span>As Crockta and Tiyo were admiring his skills, there was a sudden commotion.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t eat vegetables.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>A man stood in front of the vegetable store, playing with the vegetables while laughing.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWe aren\u2019t herbivores. Do you think eating vegetables can make you strong?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man raised his arms and showed off his biceps. The muscles of his right arm bulged out.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou can become strong like me by eating meat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The demonstration of his body stopped the crowd. The burly man shrugged and laughed at the vegetable seller.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cLook, Mister Vegetable Seller, are you going to collapse right now? You are as skinny as a dried anchovy. Eating vegetables have weakened you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMeat is good, but you need to eat a balanced meal for nutrition...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBalanced, balanced! I am tired of hearing this! I grew up hearing that I would be taller if I eat bean sprouts and stronger if I eat spinach! But then I was incredibly weak! Everything is a lie!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>As he screamed, a few customers turned away from the vegetable store. The vegetable seller\u2019s expression turned grouchy.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou should talk about this somewhere else...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEat meat! Chicken breast! Pork sirloin! Pork tenderloin! Pork forelock! Beef if you are rich! That is how our muscles develop!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He took off his top and posed again.\u00a0</span><span>The man had good muscles.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2026 Amazing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOh my, oh my, look.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The men in the market were amazed by the muscles, while the women covered their eyes and peeked through their fingers.</span></p><br/><p><span>The man smiled and shouted,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cIf you want to be like me, come to Arnold\u2019s Butchery!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was an explicit publicity stunt!\u00a0</span><span>Crockta realized something. This person was almost certainly employed by Arnold\u2019s Butchery.\u00a0</span><span>The man deceived people with his good muscles. Why else would he discuss here while showing off his chest, triceps, and biceps!</span></p><br/><p><span>The customers at the vegetable store turned away one by one. Then they asked the man,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWhere is Arnold\u2019s Butchery?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHahat! Arnold\u2019s butcher store can be found on the right side if you turn left at that corner! There is a discount for the pork tenderloin today!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The atmosphere was already in his favor. People decided that today\u2019s dinner menu was going to be meat.\u00a0</span><span>The vegetable seller\u2019s head drooped down.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is sophistry\u2026 Without vegetables\u2026 people can\u2019t live...!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>However, his voice didn\u2019t reach the people.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked at him and closed his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>Obviously, meat and proteins were important.\u00a0</span><span>However, the value of vegetables couldn\u2019t be discounted.\u00a0</span><span>Proteins were important, but the vitamins, antioxidants, and anti-cancer compounds as well as various minerals and phytochemicals were essential for the body\u2019s health.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta opened his eyes and stepped forward.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The people were surprised at the sudden emergence of an orc warrior. The muscular man posing flinched as well.\u00a0</span><span>Who didn\u2019t know of Crockta, the true hero who saved Katalu?!</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked at the muscular man with sunken eyes. The man winced and hopelessly maintained his pose.\u00a0</span><span>The muscular man looked like a dwarf once Crockta stood next to him.</span></p><br/><p><span>He awkwardly smiled at Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cHahaha, it is Crockta. Your body is also good. Crockta eats a lot of meat right? Hahat! Take a look at these muscles! You must eat three chicken breasts every meal! Kelkelkel! Crockta as well!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta didn't answer.\u00a0</span><span>A person\u2019s beliefs weren\u2019t shown through words but actions.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta spoke to the vegetable seller,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cHey.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The vegetable seller stuttered with confusion,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cY-Yes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe spinach, how much is it?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta grinned.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI would like to buy some.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Spinach...!\u00a0</span><span>It was rated as one of the top 10 superfoods in the world. He might have a rough green body, but he was devoted to eating spinach since it had various beneficial properties.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta declared that he would buy it all.\u00a0</span><span>The marketplace became noisy.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then Crockta said,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cHey, inflatable muscles.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man\u2019s face turned blue. \u2018Inflatable muscles\u2019 was an unbearable insult to him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLook.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta gave strength to his arm...</span></p><br/><p><span>And it swelled greatly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis is the ultimate compression muscle.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Cries of admiration emerged from the crowd.\u00a0</span><span>If the compressed muscles were so big, what were the decompressed muscles like?\u00a0</span><span>The man wanted to protest that Crockta\u2019s muscles were inflated, but the atmosphere was also on Crockta\u2019s side.</span></p><br/><p><span>No, Crockta\u2019s compressed muscles were bigger than the man\u2019s.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta stated,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cMeat is definitely important. However, you aren\u2019t a real muscle man if you don\u2019t know the value of vegetables.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cT-That...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTell me, what did you eat this morning?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man didn\u2019t answer. Crockta demanded harshly,</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTell me!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYour body doesn't lie! What did you eat this morning?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man gulped at Crockta\u2019s push.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta stared at him. Confronted with the gazes of Crockta and the crowd staring at him, the silent man was forced to open his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>He gritted his teeth and replied,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cOf course, it is chicken breast...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAnd?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked down at him and asked,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWhat else did you eat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man lowered his head. Then he spoke in a small voice,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cBoiled sweet potato...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The people were shocked, but Crockta didn\u2019t stop there.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAnd?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuock...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat else did you eat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCabbage salad with tomatoes and blackberries...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Sweet potatoes, cabbages, tomatoes, and blackberries!\u00a0</span><span>He didn\u2019t hate vegetables!</span></p><br/><p><span>As a man who loved physical beauty, he knew the importance of a balanced diet.\u00a0</span><span>He used his body to be hired by Arnold\u2019s Butchery, deceiving people for publicity and preaching false beliefs. However, before Crockta\u2019s questioning and doubts, he had to tell the truth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat's right. Say it again. Do vegetables not matter?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cVegetables...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta urged him on,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cAren\u2019t they really important?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man decided to admit defeat. He couldn\u2019t fool himself any longer.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThey are important...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He finally revealed his heart.\u00a0</span><span>Vegetables...\u00a0</span><span>They were important.</span></p><br/><p><span>The man\u2019s head drooped down.\u00a0</span><span>It was a declaration of defeat.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Clap.</span></i><i><span>Clap.</span></i><i><span>Clap.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The people watching the spectacle started to clap and chant Crockta's name.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta had preserved the honor of vegetables.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuock...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man looked down with shame.\u00a0</span><span>He was embarrassed about deceiving himself for money. Since this happened, he wouldn\u2019t be paid by Arnold anymore.\u00a0</span><span>The man had become someone who didn\u2019t have money nor honor.\u00a0</span><span>He fell into shame.</span></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, a thick hand grabbed his shoulder. It was Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta spoke with a merciful face,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cHey.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt was a joke. You have very nice muscles.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man looked at Crockta with quivering eyes. Crockta\u2019s expression was warm as he genuinely admired the man\u2019s body.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI previously called you inflatable muscles...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI said I didn\u2019t need vegetables.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta showed off his tough biceps and said,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cNext time, let\u2019s lift weights together.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man received Crockta\u2019s recognition...!\u00a0</span><span>Crockta recognized the time and effort he\u2019d put into building his muscles. The man was filled with great emotions, and he touched his nose, shrugging in a show of bravado.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMy training is harsh. It is hell training.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cRight. That is natural.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou must\u2019ve overcome hard times.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man was overwhelmed.\u00a0</span><span>They weren\u2019t just comforting words because Crockta truly understood.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta reached out his hand, and the man responded. The two men embraced.\u00a0</span><span>The two muscular men forgave each other\u2019s mistakes.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then people flocked to the vegetable store.\u00a0</span><span>The vegetable store was recognized by Crockta!</span></p><br/><p><span>Having a healthy body which could live a long time was people\u2019s dream. The people who saw such a future bought the vegetables from this store.\u00a0</span><span>Like this, the vegetable store became well-known because of Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>The muscle man restored his courage and spoke to Tiyo, who was standing quietly beside Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTiyo as well. You should buy some vegetables. How can you accompany Crockta with a body like that? Kelkelkel!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKulkulkul, kulkulkul!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta laughed together with the man.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo frowned.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat did you say <em>dot</em>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou should gain some muscles. Kelkelkel!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Kulkulkulkul!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKelkelkelkel!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The two muscular men laughed at Tiyo, while Tiyo\u2019s eyebrows twitched. His gnome\u2019s pride couldn\u2019t allow this.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo jumped forward.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAchu!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He spun like a spinning top and kicked.\u00a0</span><span>They were lightning fast strikes aimed at Crockta\u2019s and the man\u2019s jaws.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta barely escaped, but the man failed and was hit in the jaw.\u00a0</span><span>It was only a light hit, but the man swayed and sat down.\u00a0</span><span>The man couldn\u2019t easily recover from the damage and sat for a while.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUhhh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLook, inflatable muscles dot! This is the truly ultimate compression muscle dot!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo took off his top...</span></p><br/><p><span>And his upper body was revealed.\u00a0</span><span>His body contained tight muscles, with no signs of fat anywhere. It was reminiscent of Bruce Lee.\u00a0</span><span>While wearing clothes, he looked like a child, but once they were thrown off, dense and compact muscles were revealed.\u00a0</span><span>It was a perfect and slim figure that wasn\u2019t lacking in anything.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBeautiful...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>People admired him.\u00a0</span><span>The vegetable seller also clapped.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWatching Tiyo, I am reminded of a gnome that I knew before.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat <em>dot</em>? There was another wonderful gnome <em>dot</em>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat's right. The gnome loved eating spinach when he stayed in Katalu. His body was as dazzling as Tiyo\u2019s.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The vegetable seller\u2019s gaze became distant.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cHis name was Hedor! A cool gnome.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...Hedor!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo\u2019s eyes widened.</span></p><br/><p><span>Hedor.\u00a0</span><span>It was Tiyo\u2019s father, whom they were looking for.\u00a0</span><span>They got a clue about Hedor at the vegetable store.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s popularity meant there were fans and followers tracking his every move.\u00a0</span><span>The movements were often ordinary, but Crockta didn\u2019t avoid or tell them off.\u00a0</span><span>This was the reason why...</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou came because you want a nice body...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Baek Hanho was troubled as the number of people joining his gym increased.\u00a0</span><span>More members was a good thing.\u00a0</span><span>However, most of them said strange things during the first consultation.</span></p><br/><p><span>Baek Hanho looked at the form submitted by the applicants and sighed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, I would like the same ultimate muscles as Tiyo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere is someone who wants muscles like Crockta?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. I want to become stronger like Crockta!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The three men sitting side by side looked at Baek Hanho with firm eyes.\u00a0</span><span>The remaining silent person suddenly said,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI want to be like the butcher shop meat man. I don\u2019t have unrealistic goals like them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man who interfered with the vegetable seller\u2019s business was known on the Internet as the butcher shop meat man.\u00a0</span><span>His meat praising character was surprisingly popular, and there were those who started exercising with the goal of being like him.</span></p><br/><p><span>The new muscular craze...</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s popularity led to trends in reality.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Baek Hanho hit his forehead with his pen. He thought for a moment before opening his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHrmm... What about a body like Andre\u2019s?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAndre?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They shook their heads in unison.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAish. What is Andre?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe is too strange.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCrockta is the trend. Andre, yuck.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Baek Hanho nodded. \u00a0</span><span>\u201cRight. Today, let\u2019s start straight away. Change your clothes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh? We were going to start tomorrow...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI have an appointment...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShut up. He who lives for tomorrow won\u2019t be able to defeat his enemies today! Take it off right now!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Baek Hanho\u2019s eyes blazed passionately.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI\u2019ll make those bodies... through hell training.\u201d</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><br/><p>I have also updated my\u00a0Patreon\u00a0to reflect my new novels.

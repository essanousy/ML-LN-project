Rommel, Keynes and the \u2018traitor\u2019 Grom, no Luin.\u00a0</span><span>They were together. They were devastated by how the fight had gone beyond predictions and lost their concentration in battle.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Brother.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta said to Maguchwi. He grinned and nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Maguchwi.\u00a0</span><span>The strongest warrior and shaman among the orc users.\u00a0</span><span>They headed for the Heaven and Earth Clan together.\u00a0</span><span>An aura emerged from Maguchwi\u2019s staff and their appearances became blurred. They approached the boundary around Rommel carefully.</span></p><br/><p><span>Now it was time to end this unfortunate relationship.\u00a0</span><span>A sufficient distance was secured. The Heaven and Earth members were escorting Rommel and Keynes, but they were just like sheep in Crockta\u2019s eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Be careful.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Maguchwi\u2019s magic flowed towards Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>It was the first time in ages that he felt the magic of an orc shaman.\u00a0</span><span>His whole body was filled with vitality as energy boiled up. It felt like he could kill anyone in front of him.\u00a0</span><span>His tattoos burned as Crockta pushed towards the enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span>Lenox\u2019s revenge.</span></p><br/><p><span>This fighting spirit was carried on in Ogre Slayer.\u00a0</span><span>He plunged towards them and yelled.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2019tarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They were shocked at Crockta\u2019s sudden appearance. However, his sword was faster than them. Crockta\u2019s greatsword tore at them.\u00a0</span><span>White particles scattered like snow.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kwajijik!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Lightning rippled on Ogre Slayer\u2019s blade. It was Maguchwi\u2019s magic.\u00a0</span><span>The enemy resisted, but those who blocked his sword were shocked by lightning and weren\u2019t able to last long. They turned into white particles.</span></p><br/><p><span>Rommel and Keynes turned to try and flee.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta didn\u2019t miss them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Where are you going?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He ran like crazy and reached out his hand. He managed to grab a horse.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUgh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His shoulders felt like they would pop from the force of the horse running. But he used all his strength and pulled the horse to a stop.\u00a0</span><span>The horse jumped because it was terrified of Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cRomeeeeeeeel\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta shouted and stabbed his sword into the horse\u2019s side.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHihihing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The horse fell down.\u00a0</span><span>Rommel, who was riding the horse, rolled around on the ground.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta crossed the horse and approached Rommel.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cStop!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Protect Rommel!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The Heaven and Earth members rushed towards Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta grabbed Rommel\u2019s neck while wielded his greatsword at the same time. The clan members were blown away in a burst of blood.\u00a0</span><span>The rest of them didn\u2019t dare attack.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI finally caught you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018War Maestro\u2019 Rommel was in his hands.\u00a0</span><span>Rommel was looking at him with calm eyes, despite being caught.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"How do you feel?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Rommel chuckled slightly,\u00a0</span><span>\"You\u2019re ugly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis bastard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta laughed.\u00a0</span><span>Then he punched Rommel\u2019s face.\u00a0</span><span>Rommel\u2019s face was destroyed. His teeth fell out and his nose was broken. He fell forward and couldn\u2019t breathe properly.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then Crockta threw him towards Maguchwi.\u00a0</span><span>Maguchwi wielded his staff. Magic power emerged and began to capture Rommel\u2019s body.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a temporary Concrete method using magic.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta nodded and started to chase Keynes and Luin.\u00a0</span><span>They abandoned Rommel and were leaving the battlefield with the Heaven and Earth members.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta ran like crazy. His thighs swelled as he accelerated.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The ground shook and dust rose up as he ran.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKeynessssssssssss\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s mad rush caused the terrified horses to run faster.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the orcs\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta kicked off the ground and jumped forward. He entered the Pinnacle and accelerated his body to the extreme.\u00a0</span><span>He could see the shocked Keynes looking at him. He gradually grew closer.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta stretched out and grabbed his body.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCrazy!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta fell from the sky and captured Keynes.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta tilted his body and they tangled together. Then they rolled across the ground. The horse\u2019s hooves trampled on both of them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCough...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Keynes coughed up blood. His body wasn\u2019t in a normal state due to being trampled on by the horse.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ku...heok?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The moment he opened his eyes, he saw the grim face of an orc staring at him.\u00a0</span><span>His whole body was bloody but he was watching Keynes with burning eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>He smiled,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cDo you remember Lenox?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grabbed Keynes\u2019 neck and lifted him.\u00a0</span><span>As soon as Keynes was caught, the Heaven and Earth Clan stopped from confusion.\u00a0</span><span>Both of their leaders had been captured.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You guys...oof!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Keynes tried to speak but Crockta blocked his mouth.\u00a0</span><span>Then he hit Keynes\u2019 stomach with his fist. Keynes was stunned and became silent.</span></p><br/><p><span>Now it was Luin\u2019s turn.\u00a0</span><span>Luin was shaking among the Heaven and Earth members. The appearance of Grom was superimposed over him.\u00a0</span><span>He tried to become a warrior under Lenox and the orc warriors. He was terrified and timid, but believed he could become a great warrior.\u00a0</span><span>But he betrayed them.\u00a0</span><span>The great warriors died.</span></p><br/><p><span>He had to pay the price.\u00a0</span><span>Luin knew it the moment Crockta called out his name.</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kuaaaaaaang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>A huge impact hit Crockta\u2019s body.</span></p><br/><p><span>The sky and the ground were reversed. Crockta tried to calculate the situation but his head was in shock as he struck the ground. The earth and sky rotated a few times. His body rolled across the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCough...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He tried to get up but his body wouldn\u2019t move. Maguchwi was running.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta raised his eyes. Through his blurred vision, he could see the Heaven and Earth members carrying Keynes away.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThose bastards...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Relax, Brother. It is dangerous!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Maguchwi used healing magic. But it wasn\u2019t enough to recover from the shock.\u00a0</span><span>It was a huge shock.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta gritted his teeth. However, he couldn\u2019t move his body. It felt like his whole body was broken.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cReinforcements came. There seems to be a great magician.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>As Maguchwi said, the flag of the imperial army was visible on the horizon.\u00a0</span><span>They had already rescued Keynes\u2019 group, and turned away like they had no intention of intervening in the remaining battle.</span></p><br/><p><span>The empire\u2019s reinforcements went away.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta barely managed to raise his body.\u00a0</span><span>The battle was their victory.

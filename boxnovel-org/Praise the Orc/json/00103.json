At first glance, both his wisdom and magic power were at an amazing level. The tough remarks about the Great Clan made Crockta realize that Jamero was a man who didn\u2019t avoid fights.</span></p><br/><p><span>A scene where they would fight together was drawn. A huge battlefield where he received the support of a magician\u2019s firepower.\u00a0</span><span>It would be huge.</span></p><br/><p><span>In the past, Crockta hadn\u2019t wanted to start Elder Lord. But now he had to go on for himself. If he didn\u2019t fight then he would lose his principles.\u00a0</span><span>Nevertheless, the world was still unknown.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEh eh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor, who was riding the caruk behind Tiyo, suddenly turned his head. Tiyo asked what was wrong, but Anor just laughed and said it was nothing.\u00a0</span><span>But he had a strange expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta realized the reason why and nodded.\u00a0</span><span>After learning Introduction to Magic, Crockta could see more of the world than he could before.\u00a0</span><span>If his skill Heart and Soul Penetration gave him information for fighting, Introduction to Magic made him more sensitive to the flow of the world.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Sasasasasaaaah....\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>A faint aura of death was rising from the rocks under them. It was from those who already died.\u00a0</span><span>The black flow was scattered here and there.\u00a0</span><span>Someone famous might be buried there. It was unknown, but the rush of aura couldn\u2019t be stopped.\u00a0</span><span>Time would dilute it.</span></p><br/><p><span>As Anor was a born necromancer, he would be able to see more than Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta realized that Anor\u2019s face occasionally turned dark because he was seeing something like this.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAnor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta threw something.\u00a0</span><span>Anor\u2019s hand stretched out and he caught it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh. Thank you very much.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was some jerky that they had received from Jamero.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What, why aren\u2019t you giving me any </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>? I am the one steering the caruk while that guy is just riding comfortably!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta pretended not to know anything and chewed on the last piece of jerky.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAiiish!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo kicked the caruk, causing it to run faster.\u00a0</span><span>Anor was surprised and nearly dropped his jerky.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShit...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat? Try swearing</span><i><span> dot!</span></i><span>\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hu...I will endure it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Pretending to be an adult...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo made the caruk run faster. They gradually moved away from Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta chewed on the jerky and stroked the head of the caruk carrying him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCan you go?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The caruk seemed to nod and started running.\u00a0</span><span>They ran through the northern plains.\u00a0</span><span>The landscape passed.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo and Anor playfully arguing could be heard from far away.\u00a0</span><span>The sound of the wind touched his ears. He could hear the wings of the birds flying in the sky and the cries of insects on the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span>After becoming a warrior, the landscape of the world that Crockta saw had changed.\u00a0</span><span>Once he received Introduction to Magic, he also saw something different.\u00a0</span><span>If he wanted to change the world, he had to change himself.</span></p><br/><p><span>A smile flashed on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Status Window]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018One who wants to become a hero\u2019 Crockta, Orc Warrior.</span></p><br/><p><span>Level: 71</span></p><br/><p><span>Achievement Points: 642500</span></p><br/><p><span>Assimilation: 88%</span></p><br/><p><span>Abilities: </span></p><br/><p><span>Peerless Mountain Seizing Strength (Pinnacle)</span></p><br/><p><span>Regeneration Authority (Pinnacle)</span></p><br/><p><span>Leyteno\u2019s Heart Swordsmanship (Pinnacle)</span></p><br/><p><span>Extreme Fighting Spirit (Pinnacle)</span></p><br/><p><span>Heart and Soul Penetration (Pinnacle)</span></p><br/><p><span>Tattoos of War, Honor, and Fighting Spirit (Pinnacle)</span></p><br/><p><span>Army Crushing Roar of Madness (Pinnacle)</span></p><br/><p><span>Creatures Butcher (Essence)</span></p><br/><p><span>Gray God's Eyes (Outside the Ratings)</span></p><br/><p><span>Introduction to Magic (Common)]</span></p><br/><p><span>Among the list of spectacular skills that were Essence and Pinnacle ranked, one Common rank stood out alone like a sore thumb.\u00a0</span><span>But Crockta could feel that the Common ranked Introduction to Magic was affecting the rest of his abilities.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta knew that Elder Lord wasn\u2019t a game, but a real world.\u00a0</span><span>He was assisted by the gray woman through the system, but eventually, everything Crockta obtained was his own strength.\u00a0</span><span>Everything was connected to a small element.\u00a0</span><span>He wanted to learn more.</span></p><br/><p><span>[You have discovered the knack of steering the caruk. The righteous warrior Crockta has learned Riding Technique (Common).

Spinoa\u2019s landscape that was centered around the world tree looked like a toy. The leaves of the world tree cast shade on the whole city.\u00a0</span><span>Even the high walls of Spinoa seemed small compared to one of the branches of the world tree.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat is the world tree...\u201d Tiyo muttered.</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor was thrilled. He felt something else because he was an elf, so his cheeks turned red and his shoulders shook.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was also overwhelmed since he saw this scene for the first time.\u00a0</span><span>Just looking at it caused something to rise in this chest. The flow of the atmosphere around the world tree touched his skin.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLook</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo pointed to something on the walls.\u00a0</span><span>There was a spire.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Someone shot at my General from there </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cFrom that far away?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don\u2019t know the details but judging from Quantes, I think it is a very sophisticated magic device.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta viewed the spectacular sight of the world tree. It felt like a fairytale, with the continent war and cry of the chieftain seeming far away.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>The caruks cried out.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta opened his mouth and said. He regained his spirit. They descended the steep hill.\u00a0</span><span>The caruks slowly headed towards Spinoa.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI will check your identities,\u201d said the dark elf guard.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta gave the credentials that he received from Radet. The guard took it and confirmed the authenticity.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta looked around Spinoa\u2019s gates as he waited for permission. Nuridot and Nameragon were of no comparison.</span></p><br/><p><span>It included the attitude of the guards.\u00a0</span><span>Unlike Nameragon\u2019s defense captain who insulted Crockta, they treated him without any emotions.\u00a0</span><span>It was the same for the other people as well.\u00a0</span><span>The guards checked everybody that came, even the dark elves.</span></p><br/><p><span>When he saw them, Crockta suddenly missed Orcrox.\u00a0</span><span>The orc guards who guarded Orcrox like stone statues!\u00a0</span><span>He told them his name and left for a long time. Now he was in Spinoa in the north.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Crockta. It is nice to meet you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The guard returned. He returned the pass and politely asked for a handshake.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta shook hands instead of holding out his fist.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCrockta. Stay alive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I was waiting for you. Someone will soon come from the world tree. Can you wait a minute?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This way.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>It seemed like the world tree acted as the city hall.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta imagined the elves digging there to create a shelter.\u00a0</span><span>They would soon be able to enter Spinoa.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOhh...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo felt admiration.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta also looked around for a while.</span></p><br/><p><span>Some of the most developed cities that Crockta had ever seen on the continent were probably Quantes and Arnin, but now Spinoa was comparable to them.\u00a0</span><span>Dark-skinned dark elves stared at them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is the dark elves\u2019 capital.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Anor shrugged.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cNuridot is like a stable compared to this place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They stayed for a while at the guard\u2019s office beyond the gate. They followed another guard.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If you sit here, people from the world tree will come.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The guard seemed a lot younger. He had an excited face.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta sat down. The guard stood beside Crockta. It was a reaction commonly seen towards celebrities.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo and Anor shook their heads at the sight.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about you. It is an honor to meet you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t do that. It is embarrassing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He said that, but Crockta\u2019s face was pleased. The guard looked at Tiyo, who looked away.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKulkul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They had done a lot in the north, so they should be treated like this.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta stretched out and let Ogre Slayer peek through.\u00a0</span><span>The guard responded immediately.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That is a huge weapon!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grinned at the surprised voice. </span><span>He shrugged and explained. \"Yes. This is my friend and lover, my sword! Wow...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is General!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta stopped. The guard\u2019s eyes shone as he kept talking.\u00a0</span><span>\"I know about General that quickly dismissed the rebels. I heard there were splendid flashes of light and all the orcs were defeated!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s face stiffened, but he didn\u2019t try to stop it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI respect you. Tiyo!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo touched Crockta, who was standing beside him.\u00a0</span><span>\"Get out of the way </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta rose politely.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo sat down in his spot. Crockta stood beside Anor who looked out the window humbly.\u00a0</span><span>He placed both hands in front of his belly and said to Anor, \"Hum hum, Spinoa\u2019s architectural style is wonderful. Hum.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor patted his shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span>The guard was confused because he couldn\u2019t understand the situation.\u00a0</span><span>As Tiyo started boasting about General, the guard realized his error and smiled awkwardly at Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI say this </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! This General! Eh? Fire it once! The enemies are just so-so!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>After a while, a person from the world tree finally came.\u00a0</span><span>The uniform was different.</span></p><br/><p><span>Spinoa\u2019s residents were dressed in the dark elves\u2019 usual plain clothes, while the dark elf who came to them was wearing clothing that seemed to come from Greek mythology, just like the residents of Arnin.\u00a0</span><span>His eyes were a bright purple.</span></p><br/><p><span>He examined Crockta\u2019s party.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Crockta. Tiyo. Anor.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He looked at the correct party member every time he called a name.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cIt is nice to see you.

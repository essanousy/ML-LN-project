Through the legacy of the star god, she realized that there was a great magic that could reverse the fate of the universe and return it to the beginning.\u00a0</span><span>But there wasn\u2019t much time left and the sun continued to fall.</span></p><br/><p><span>She tried to reverse the fate of the world, before the sun\u2019s power was exhausted.\u00a0</span><span>The gods resisted.\u00a0</span><span>Thus, the grey god and the species of death collided against the gods of Olympus.\u00a0</span><span>It was a fierce fight.</span></p><br/><p><span>And he was there: Gushantimur, the most powerful dragon.\u00a0</span><span>Following their own beliefs, the dragons stood on both sides of the argument, with Gushantimur being one that followed the grey god.</span></p><br/><p><span>He was the last dragon who bit the gods by her side, until the grey god was defeated and thrown into another dimension.\u00a0</span><span>Due to his mighty power, he could keep himself fully awake, even though the other dragons were killed or in hibernation.</span></p><br/><p><span>After the grey god was thrown into another dimension, Gushantimur was left alone to contemplate the world.\u00a0</span><span>He became a hermit of the Black Forest.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShe is back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur set up a castle and reached out to those who needed help.\u00a0</span><span>They were mainstream people of the world, such as humans, elves, and dwarves, as well as those treated like monsters: the goblins, ogres, trolls, etc.\u00a0</span><span>Gushantimur shared the feelings of the weak and the small.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was just a moment in comparison to the time he had lived.\u00a0</span><span>However.\u00a0</span><span>These short moments were never in vain.\u00a0</span><span>They were raw but strong students.\u00a0</span><span>Their minutes and seconds shone so brightly compared to those who lived for a long time.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do I really want to see the end...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The grey god aimed to save the universe from its fate and reconnect the cycle of life.\u00a0</span><span>He looked at the sun and sighed.\u00a0</span><span>Now he didn\u2019t know what was heavier or more important.</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur closed his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>The wind blew through his hair. His disciples felt the aura of the grey god and looked towards the north.\u00a0</span><span>His always loud lair was locked in silence.</span></p><br/><p><span>There was a sad smile on his face as he remembered the grey god.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018The world will be saved from destruction.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>No one could see the world like the grey god.\u00a0</span><span>Therefore, no one could truly understand her despair.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018I won\u2019t let the universe cool down forever.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>The universe was nearing its end and all she saw was death.\u00a0</span><span>She saw the darkness in the morning sun and felt hopeless over the eternal void. It was a terrible sinking worse than death.</span></p><br/><p><span>A north wind blew.\u00a0</span><span>Gushantimur kept his eyes closed.\u00a0</span><span>He couldn\u2019t figure out what to do.</span></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, he remembered a warrior.\u00a0</span><span>The warrior was someone who caused miracles everywhere they went.\u00a0</span><span>A warrior who accomplished things that seemed impossible. He cut the neck of the great chieftain who was possessed by the Tribulation, faced the great empire alone and defeated a god.\u00a0</span><span>Now he was going against the grey god to save the world.\u00a0</span><span>One of the greatest fighters of this era.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>While their time together was short, he was someone who couldn\u2019t be forgotten.\u00a0</span><span>A tough face that always smiled mischievously. The one who wielded a huge greatsword. Someone who rushed recklessly and didn\u2019t know how to retreat.</span></p><br/><p><span>What was the reason for fighting like that?\u00a0</span><span>How could he do so?</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Someone called out to him, \u201cMaster!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He looked back to see a weak guy that just entered, an innocent kobold.\u00a0</span><span>He was the kobold shooter Komojak, and his idol was the goblin Kiao.\u00a0</span><span>He entered the Black Forest and begged to be his disciple.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I will shoot a bow today!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A straw doll was shaking in front of him. His accuracy wasn\u2019t that great but there was pleasure on the kobold\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I will shoot this twice tomorrow keong keong! Please train me tomorrow keong!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He said with a bright smile.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tomorrow.</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur looked at him blankly.\u00a0\u00a0</span><span>The kobold didn\u2019t know anything. Even though the countdown to the end of the world was going on, he was laughing and talking about tomorrow.\u00a0</span><span>Gushantimur looked around.\u00a0</span><span>Numerous disciples were looking at him. Unknown emotions were in their eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>If tomorrow came like the kobold said.\u00a0</span><span>It wouldn\u2019t stop tomorrow, there would be many more tomorrows.\u00a0</span><span>Gushantimur and all his disciples would enjoy tomorrow and the rest of their lives.\u00a0\u00a0</span><span>The sun would go down and rise again. Thus, they would live another day.\u00a0</span><span>Every day, every minute.</span></p><br/><p><span>That\u2019s right.\u00a0</span><span>He already knew.</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur spoke in a soft voice,\u00a0</span><span>\"Two times isn\u2019t enough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKeong?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou will have to shoot it three times, not two. Can you do it?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The kobold looked awkward.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\"T-Three keong...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He scratched his head and avoided Gushantimur\u2019s eyes.\u00a0</span><span>He looked at the straw dolls and the wounds on his hands, before nodding at Gushantimur.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"T-Three times is too much keong...but, let\u2019s try it keong...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur turned to the other disciples.\u00a0</span><span>Everyone was staring at him.\u00a0</span><span>He spoke again,\u00a0</span><span>\"Tomorrow, I want to see how everyone has improved. It will be a harsh day. Is everyone prepared?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Their eyes widened. The disciples looked at each other and nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur smiled. </span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His body floated in the air.\u00a0</span><span>Gushantimur\u2019s body, which was in the form of a young man, started to slowly change.\u00a0</span><span>Black scales sprouted on his body. His body extended. Wings spread out from his back and the irises of a beast appeared in his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>Now he was as big as the castle.\u00a0</span><span>His body was huge enough to cast shade on his entire body.\u00a0</span><span>Beautiful scales and broad wings.\u00a0</span><span>The mightiest species, a dragon.\u00a0</span><span>His true appearance was revealed.\u00a0</span><span>The kobold stared at him with wide eyes and a gaping mouth. Even his original disciples had never seen Gushantimur like this.</span></p><br/><p><span>After returning to the form of a black dragon, Gushantimur whispered.\u00a0</span><span>His voice was as soft as always.</span></p><br/><p><span>'Rest early today and prepare for tomorrow.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>One disciple asked aloud,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cMaster, where are you going?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018I...\u2019\u00a0</span><span>Gushantimur used his wings to turn his body.\u00a0</span><span>\u2018I am also preparing for tomorrow.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>He flew towards the Temple of the Fallen God.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kurwarwarwarwa!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The black dragon\u2019s breath poured towards the giant cannon. Crockta and Abaddon rolled to avoid the aftermath.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kurwarwarwarwa!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The world was filled with a ringing sound.\u00a0</span><span>The breath melted everything.\u00a0</span><span>The breath swallowed everything, leaving behind a huge hole.\u00a0</span><span>It was like lava flowed over the ground. In the place where the ancient weapon was, only a smoking hole remained.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta stared blankly at the sky.\u00a0</span><span>It was the first time he saw a black dragon.\u00a0</span><span>However, he knew the identity of the dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Gushantimur\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He appeared to neutralize the enemy\u2019s weapon. Crockta smiled. It was an unexpected salvation.</span></p><br/><p><span>He asked, \"Did you have a connection with Gushantimur?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Abaddon spoke in a dismal voice,\u00a0</span><span>\"As far as I know, he...he was a great friend who fought with us in the past. Why is he stopping us now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kulkul, the Gushantimur that I know is different.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He didn\u2019t know what Gushantimur was like in the past. But the Gushantimur that he knew in the Black Forest wasn\u2019t someone who would follow the grey god.\u00a0</span><span>Magic power stretched around Gushantimur\u2019s body in the air. According to his will, dozens of spheres dropped towards the magic cannons.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuok...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Abaddon extended his power to try and stop Gushantimur\u2019s attack, but Crockta struck quickly with God Slayer aimed at the demon.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hat!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Abaddon barely avoided the attack as one of his arms was cut, flames springing from the wound.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kuaaaaak!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Abaddon tried to stop the flames from God Slayer, but it didn\u2019t work.\u00a0</span><span>He fell helplessly to the ground.\u00a0</span><span>In the meantime, all of the magic cannons were destroyed by Gushantimur.\u00a0</span><span>Once the bombardment ceased, the gods advanced and destroyed the monsters.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Abaddon panicked.\u00a0</span><span>\"An unidentified shaman at the beginning and now the ancient black dragon, Gushantimur.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Things Abaddon thought would never be broken through were destroyed.\u00a0</span><span>It was by third beings that they didn\u2019t anticipate.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>'The heavens are helping me.\u201d Crockta said.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The heavens... hahaha, the heavens. Because of the heavens...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Abaddon laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>It sounded like something from a black comedy. Crockta also laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>Abaddon laughed for a while before saying,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cKill me. I can't fight anymore.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The last fire from God Slayer was still eating at his body. The flames rose from his arm to his shoulder, slowly burning his body.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta shook his head.\u00a0</span><span>\"I don\u2019t intend to kill you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If you don\u2019t kill me now, I will recover and hit your back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf you are able to do so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Why are you sparing me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked down at him and said,\u00a0</span><span>\"I still need you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNeed me...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You treated me to a wonderful dish.

So next time...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta grinned at Abaddon.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cLet\u2019s meet at the table.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he moved towards the Temple of the Fallen God.</span></p><br/><p><span>Abaddon stared blankly after him.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cNext time...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Abaddon smiled at the words.\u00a0</span><span>Somehow, he felt carefree. Maybe he secretly hoped for this conclusion. Avoiding death was the instinct of all living things.\u00a0</span><span>The gods were approaching. Abaddon moved away from the front lines to avoid them.\u00a0</span><span>He watched as the gods and mortals followed Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do you like spicy food?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Abaddon suddenly asked.</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur was standing next to him in human form.\u00a0</span><span>A weary face. It was difficult for him to use that degree of breath.</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur replied,\u00a0</span><span>\"I don\u2019t like nor dislike it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Is that so?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Abaddon said.\u00a0</span><span>\"If there really is a next time...I will make the spicy flavor for you. My spicy noodles are great, even Crockta\u2019s acknowledged it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see. I look forward to it. Sincerely.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hahaha, I\u2019m serious...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Above their heads, the white sphere created by the grey god floated.\u00a0</span><span>Now fate had left their hands. The ending was something that not even the gods could know.</span></p><br/><p><span>The battle for the world\u2019s fate ran without pause towards the end.</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><br/><p>I have also updated my\u00a0Patreon\u00a0to reflect my new novels.

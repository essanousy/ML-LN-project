He was a sturdy orc carrying a huge battle axe.</span></p><br/><p><span>Caburak was still laughing while surrounded by pink flower petals.</span></p><br/><p><span>The eyes of the two orcs met.\u00a0</span><span>It was a welcome reunion after a long time. There were all sorts of emotions in Caburak and Gorit\u2019s eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cFather!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Gorit was also thrilled.\u00a0</span><span>The son he hadn\u2019t seen for a long time had returned!</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo, who accompanied Caburak for a while, felt warm in their hearts as they watched the reunion. They quietly slipped back. Caburak and Gorit walked towards each other like they were going to hug passionately.</span></p><br/><p><span>The petals created by Caburak\u2019s magic streamed through the air.\u00a0</span><span>And...</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Peeok!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuuk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Gorit grabbed Caburak\u2019s collar and launched him into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cF-Father?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This guy disappeared without a word and now you are back?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>It was a serious punch.\u00a0</span><span>\"And what about the Constellation Staff?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I-It was destroyed, Father...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou...!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Gorit tried to hit his son again, but the orcs around him stopped it. It wasn\u2019t easy to stop the big Gorit, so many orcs had to hold onto him tightly.\u00a0</span><span>Gorit kept yelling wildly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Villagers! Listen to me! This son of mine suddenly disappeared with the treasure of my house, only to reappear and say that it is broken! Villagers, isn\u2019t this nonsense..!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If you hit him anymore then he might die.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Caburak muttered, \"My life has been saved three times...\"\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019ve lost my patience a long time ago! Now I will kill you!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Uhuh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo watched the disturbance from the corner.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It must hurt </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They were the guests but they didn\u2019t receive any attention because of Caburak.\u00a0</span><span>No, if it was known that they were Caburak\u2019s guests, Gorit might be furious at them as well.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta asked the dark elf Yanura standing next to him.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don't know. Gorit had a son that was a brilliant shaman...then I heard that he disappeared one day with the artifact of his house.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>One of the orc warriors in the village found them and sought their understanding.\u00a0</span><span>\"It looks like you are friends of Caburak so I\u2019m sorry. It is because Gorit is hot-tempered. It might be dangerous now, but he will welcome you later.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Thank you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"My name is Marak. It is a pleasure.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCrockta. Stay alive,\u201d greeted Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHoh. I didn\u2019t know I would hear that from an outsider. Stay alive!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He smiled and replied. Crockta\u2019s eyes widened. There weren\u2019t many orcs who knew this greeting in the north, and the orc warrior even extended his fist towards Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta bumped it with a sincere heart.</span></p><br/><p><span>Marak laughed again.\u00a0</span><span>\"It looks like you\u2019re not an orc of the Great Clan!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>In the end, Caburak used this as an opportunity to escape from Gorit. </span><span>He opened his mouth, \"Now, now. Crockta isn\u2019t from the Great Clan. Rather, he defeated people from the Great Clan and saved me. It was a big deal!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The orcs\u2019 eyes opened.\u00a0</span><span>\"Hoh, the warriors from the Great Clan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It wasn\u2019t just one but multiple warriors!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou must be a great warrior.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Gorit discovered Crockta, Tiyo, and Yanura.</span></p><br/><p><span>Gorit swallowed down his anger and approached Caburak. Caburak looked into his eyes. Caburak flinched as Gorit reached out, but Gorit just placed a hand on his head. Caburak looked like a little kid.</span></p><br/><p><span>Caburak spoke with narrowed eyes.\u00a0</span><span>\"These are my guests.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta greeted politely, \"We came here after receiving Caburak\u2019s invitation. I am the orc warrior Crockta. Stay alive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHoh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Gorit looked Crockta up and down.\u00a0</span><span>\"Are your parents from Orcheim?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019ve never seen anyone outside of Orcheim say this greeting. Are you really not from here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta laughed bitterly.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then Caburak said, \u201cListen to my story! I traveled a long way...but...that...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Caburak\u2019s voice gradually trailed off at Gorit\u2019s stare. He avoided eye contact.\u00a0</span><span>Gorit kept staring at Caburak and nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I understand but you\u2019ll have to explain it properly. We are being rude to the guests. Follow me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They said farewell to Yanura who was continuing her mission, then Crockta and Tiyo were guided to Gorit\u2019s house. </span><span>As the chief, Gorit\u2019s house was a large log cabin. It was built up so that there was a second floor. Crockta and Tiyo were taken to a guest room.</span></p><br/><p><span>They felt the accumulated fatigue as they set down their belongings. Crockta sat on the floor with Ogre Slayer, a weapon he always carried with him. He leaned back against the wall and a sound came out.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOhu...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>From then on, Tiyo stayed quiet. He was thinking about something with a sullen expression.</span></p><br/><p><span>It seemed like he was still shocked by Yanura\u2019s words. Tiyo was proud of gnomes. He firmly believed that gnomes were the wisest and most rational species. The magic engineering developed by the gnomes could be called the essence of civilization.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Are you okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019m fine </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>There was no strength in his voice.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You don\u2019t know the situation, so don\u2019t become too frustrated yet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don\u2019t need to hear the situation... gnomes should absolutely never hold hands with those selling slaves </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta laughed, \"So it seems like both you and I will need to hunt our own species.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That's right </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You should sound more assertive when saying this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo smiled as he got up.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThank you Crockta. But please don't worry. I was only thinking for a moment </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"How to slay those guys!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta nodded. Problems of the heart could only be solved by oneself. Tiyo would soon return to the Tiyo that Crockta knew.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019m going </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! Ohhhhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It seemed like he had already returned.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then the door opened and Gorit appeared. He stared down at Crockta and Tiyo.\u00a0</span><span>The duo became nervous due to his fierce eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He spoke curtly, \"Go where?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Where?\u201d Gorit cried out in a large voice.\u00a0</span><span>\"Isn\u2019t a bath necessary for men to know each other? To the hot springs!\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>The fatigue was resolved after soaking in the hot water.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ohhhh, good </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The best,\u201d muttered the duo.</span></p><br/><p><span>Gorit was sitting on the other side. The strength of his body was further emphasized by the hot spring. Despite his age, his chest muscles were bulging.\u00a0</span><span>Gorit scanned Crockta with a similar expression. His body was muscular and covered with tattoos. The flesh tempered from wielding his greatsword was magnificent.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hrmm.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta moved his gaze towards Caburak. He was a small orc. If it wasn\u2019t for his skin color, it wouldn\u2019t be strange for Caburak to be mistaken as a human.\u00a0</span><span>Caburak dropped his eyes at the gaze that seemed to rebuke his lack of a muscular body.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It has been a long time since I\u2019ve come to the hot spring to relieve fatigue </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! Thank you Gorit! Men need to bathe together!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The most surprising one was Tiyo.\u00a0</span><span>He had the face of a cute gnome but his muscles were like Bruce Lee. It felt like the face of a bird being placed on a tiger.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Huhut!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A six pack appeared on Tiyo\u2019s stomach!\u00a0</span><span>Crockta and Gorit had body fat as well as muscles, so they didn\u2019t have such clear abs. Tiyo stretched out and posed in front of everyone.\u00a0</span><span>The gnome showing off his muscles in front of orcs!</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCough!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Gorit opened his mouth, \"That gnome friend over there is good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The guards of Quantes don\u2019t neglect their training! Ohhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cQuantes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was an unfamiliar name. </span><span>Caburak explained, \"Father, they came from the south.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The south, do you mean the wilderness?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Even below that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Surprise appeared on Gorit\u2019s face. There was only one place beyond the wilderness. And nobody had come from that place in a long time.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPerhaps?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That south.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHah...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Gorit looked at Crockta again. Unlike his previous erratic behavour, it seemed like he was pondering something.\u00a0</span><span>\"Somehow it seems correct. You said that you were alive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do all the orcs in the south say this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOf course.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then you must remember the saying.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta understood what he was saying. </span><span>Crockta opened his mouth and they both spoke at the same time,</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2019tar!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2019tar!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The voices of the two people combined.\u00a0</span><span>Gorit got up. Crockta also got up. At the same time, the two bumped fists.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNice to meet you, Warrior Crockta!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Likewise, Gorit!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta finally met a real orc in the north.</span></p><br/><p><span>Gorit asked Crockta about the south. Crockta replied carefully and sincerely. Gorit nodded at the story of the orcs on the continent. He especially formed a fist after hearing about Crockta\u2019s mentor, Lenox.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The orc\u2019s soul still lives on in such a wonderful place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I think so as well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The north has forgotten all of this...hah...I am ashamed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>In the north, the only place that still followed the orc\u2019s traditions was Orcheim. Now even Orcheim was being threatened by the Great Clan.\u00a0</span><span>The orc who had become the great chieftain was really mad for war. He wanted to make the entire north the territory of the orcs.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe events in the north will also affect the south.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What do you mean?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOnce the southern wall is opened, that crazy chieftain won\u2019t leave the continent alone.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta realized something.</span></p><br/><p><span>The north would become completely opened in 10 years. The remnants of the creatures were still in the forest, but any army could go against them. Then the continent and the north would go to war.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Maybe the great chieftain is already thinking about it. The Great Clan has recently been heating up their war preparations.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Gorit hit the surface of the hot spring. Ripples spread out.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou mean...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The time that the Great Clan started to hunt slaves and invade other tribes on a massive scale was around the time you opened the north.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There are many shamans in the Great Clan. It isn\u2019t unusual for them to read this happening in the sky.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Gorit said with a firm expression, \"The great chieftain wants to unify the north and then invade the continent.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSomething strange...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The butterfly effect.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta was well aware of this. Any action he did would bring about tremendous changes that he couldn\u2019t predict. As Jung Ian, Crockta had assassinated many people and sometimes changed the situation of the world. In the permanently sealed secret records, Jung Ian was probably the wildest butterfly in the world.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s expression hardened. Tiyo\u2019s face became serious.\u00a0</span><span>Only Caburak had an unknown smile on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span>Gorit hit his son in an attempt to alleviate the atmosphere.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This guy, Caburak. What were you doing all this time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I did some traveling.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What type of trip...!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Gorit shouted. His eyes shook as he became angry again.\u00a0</span><span>He swallowed back his anger and whispered, \"All your power has disappeared...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo looked at Caburak. Caburak just laughed while revealing his broken teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You can\u2019t deceive me. You had much stronger blood than your mother, who is a shaman. But...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Gorit had been very glad when Caburak came back. It wasn\u2019t simple because Caburak was his son, but because a strong tribe member had returned. Caburak was a mighty shaman so they could resist the great chieftain threatening the north.</span></p><br/><p><span>But now the power felt inside Caburak was at the level of a mere shaman, maybe even less.</span></p><br/><p><span>The power of his son Caburak, who had been called a genius shaman, had almost disappeared. His magic power that was like the ocean, faded like the bowl had broken and only faint pieces were left behind.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Caburak just smiled instead of answering. Gorit shook his head with a dark expression.\u00a0</span><span>Then he spoke again, \"Cough! No. Something must\u2019ve happened. I won\u2019t ask anymore! It is enough that you came back safely.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Thank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAish!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Gorit shook his head and sprang up.\u00a0</span><span>\"I need to meet the mayor of Dejame so please enjoy this slowly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he left the hot spring alone. Crockta and Tiyo couldn\u2019t say anything as they watched Gorit put on his clothes.</span></p><br/><p><span>They didn\u2019t know anything about Caburak. At first, they thought he was just an optimistic orc but he turned out to be a genius shaman. Now he was an unfortunate man who lost all of that magic power.</span></p><br/><p><span>But Caburak\u2019s face still looked casual.\u00a0</span><span>\"Father is right, I lost too much. Should I tell you? Kyulkyulkyul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCaburak...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don\u2019t care so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Caburak slowly lowered his body. His body was submerged under the surface of the water, leaving only the area above his nose revealed. His eyes flashed through the vapor of the hot spring.\u00a0</span><span>Despite saying he was broken now, Caburak\u2019s eyes were calm and straightforward.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>A strange sensation was coming from him.\u00a0</span><span>His eyes seemed like he was looking into the distance. Then his shoulders suddenly trembled. He was recalling the past.</span></p><br/><p><span>Within a short period of time, Caburak\u2019s body rose up again.\u00a0</span><span>His pronunciation became clearer.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I said I would show you Orcheim\u2019s Holy Land.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta nodded. They stopped by here because of that in the first place.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I couldn\u2019t tell my father but before showing you the Holy Land, I want to tell you why I lost my magic power.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"No, I heard Crockta\u2019s words about the gods and realized something. That is why I have to tell you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The two people couldn\u2019t say anything.\u00a0</span><span>Caburak raised a hand to the surface of the water. He stared at his hand soaked in water like it was burning.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI saved the world.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>What did that mean? Crockta and Tiyo cocked their heads in confusion.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Caburak looked at them and laughed.\u00a0</span><span>Then he said once again, \"I risked my life to kill a demon and saved the world.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His eyes were shining.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta realized that Caburak was serious.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>A shaman who saved the world.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta nodded. Caburak had his own story. Crockta wanted to know more about this orc.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI understand. Tell me more.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is a long story so...I will tell you on the way to the Holy Land. Let\u2019s leave. It is hot.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Caburak left the hot spring. The tough bodies of the orcs emerged from the water.\u00a0</span><span>But one person wasn\u2019t seen.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked around and found Tiyo. He hadn\u2019t risen from the hot spring where he was soaking himself.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTiyo?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Um...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo winced. This wasn\u2019t the dignified gnome proud of his physical appearance.\u00a0</span><span>\"Get up first...I...slowly follow...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A shy attitude like he had lost all confidence!\u00a0</span><span>What had made him so timid?</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta followed Tiyo\u2019s gaze.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo was looking at Crockta and Caburak\u2019s bodies and slowly lowered his gaze.\u00a0</span><span>He moved past the orcs\u2019 solid chest and abdomen. Then the part of the orcs that was shrouded by steam...</span></p><br/><p><span>That...</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo dropped his head. </span><span>Crockta couldn\u2019t say anything...</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019ll go first...come slowly...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>...\u201d</span></p><br/><p>I'm going New Zealand tomorrow for 5 days.

Crockta tried to stop him, but Kumarak had already charged in anger.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta chased after him as Kumarak struck the grey god\u2019s shield with Destroyer.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, there was no change.\u00a0</span><span>Kumarak hit the shield several times. Blood was flowing from his severed arm, but he didn\u2019t seem to feel it.\u00a0</span><span>He screamed as he tried to smash the shield, \"Kuaaaaak!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>There was a sound that was like his body breaking, not the shield.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDamn woman!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The grey god used her power again and aimed at the target\u2019s heart.\u00a0</span><span>However, before it could be shot, something flew out from behind and struck the grey god\u2019s shield.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Puok!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The attack, which consisted of an arrow, stuck into the shield.\u00a0\u00a0</span><span>At the area where the arrow was stuck, black streaks spread out. It spread through the grey god\u2019s shield and cracked it.\u00a0</span><span>For the first time, confusion filled the grey god\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNow, Kumarak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus. His arrow, which had even killed the sun, broke the grey god\u2019s shield.\u00a0</span><span>Kumarak immediately brandished Destroyer. The shield shattered, and Destroyer didn\u2019t stop as it aimed for the grey god.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDieeeeee!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Destroyer hit the grey god.\u00a0</span><span>However, there wasn\u2019t the sensation of anything being cut.\u00a0</span><span>The axe struck the ground and dug in deeply. Kumarak\u2019s center of gravity was thrown off and he lurched forward.</span></p><br/><p><span>The grey god stood far away.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am impressed that mortals can reach this place.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Kumarak was unable to control his body and tilted down.\u00a0</span><span>\"It is regrettable. It would\u2019ve been nice if we met in a younger universe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There was a big hole in Kumarak\u2019s chest. He grabbed the axe and tried to hold on, but he soon fell to the ground. Blood leaked out. The white ashes on the ground were dyed red.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKumarak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta approached. Kumarak\u2019s breathing was fading,</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta shouted,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cGoddess of Mercy!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She raised her head from where she was lying down. It was a face that lost her spirit due to the grey god\u2019s attack.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta couldn\u2019t suppress his anger as he saw her face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cRecover your spirit! Wake up!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She nodded at Crockta\u2019s shout. Crockta moved away from Kumarak and held his greatsword tightly.\u00a0</span><span>The grey god was looking up at the sphere in the sky, showing no interest in them. It was like she was confirming the progress.</span></p><br/><p><span>The sphere in the sky kept growing.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Where are you looking\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta pursued her using everything he had.</span></p><br/><p><span>The world accelerated and causality reversed. His body used the most efficient movements to swing God Slayer as the greatsword moved in an extraordinary manner that nobody would understand. However, the grey god\u2019s fighting method was on another dimension.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s attack was destroyed in front of the grey god.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The grey god\u2019s power was pointed at Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta struck it with his sword, but some of it slammed into Crockta. He managed to withstand the attack, but dozens of fragments still managed to pierce his body.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kuaaaaak!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta soon became riddled with holes and cuts, with streams of blood flowing down the sides of his body.\u00a0</span><span>However, he didn\u2019t give up and gave strength to his crumbling legs.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Shit!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The scattered blood turned the ashy ground red.\u00a0</span><span>The grey god was once again standing far away.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta met her eyes a bloodshot glare. He squeezed God Slayer in his hand and stepped forward again.</span></p><br/><p><span>Defeat could be seen.\u00a0</span><span>It was always like this.\u00a0</span><span>However, this time, there was definite defeat in front of their eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta smiled and approached again.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...Everything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta muttered something as he headed towards the grey god.\u00a0</span><span>It was like he was singing. The grey god frowned as she listened and as the words of the song entered her ears.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA warrior doesn\u2019t attack unarmed people. Warrior...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The bloodied Crockta was smiling as he muttered the warrior\u2019s laws. His footsteps didn\u2019t stop.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"...Vengeance. A warrior protects the powerless...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The grey god was right in front of him, a protective shield appearing between her and Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>It was the shield that Zankus had barely managed to break, but it had appeared again as if nothing had happened.</span></p><br/><p><span>The great magic, the enormous power that would restart the world again.\u00a0</span><span>She was using it freely.\u00a0</span><span>It was the difference in power.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta stood before the grey god\u2019s shield.\u00a0</span><span>He didn\u2019t stop. He brought his face to the shield separating him from her. The bloodshot eyes were blazing. The iron helmet came in contact with the protective film and scratched the surface.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cProve your honor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At the end of the words, Crockta\u2019s God Slayer struck like a thunderstorm</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kakakakakakak!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Sparks flew. Crockta didn\u2019t stop his attacks. The greatsword struck downwards.</span></p><br/><p><span>The fire of the sun god emerged from God Slayer and wrapped around Crockta. Crockta brandished his greatsword without stopping. Fire splashed from the iron. God Slayer struck the wall like crazy.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is pointless. Crockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The grey god whispered from beyond.\u00a0</span><span>He wasn\u2019t able to break it. Crockta had to deal with the impact from his greatsword hitting it. But he didn\u2019t care. He cut at the shield hundreds of times.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a sad sight.\u00a0</span><span>The grey god had a sad expression on her face.\u00a0</span><span>\"I will end it quickly. There will be no pain. For your sake.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She raised her hand to the sky. The grey god reached for the power in the sphere in the sky.\u00a0</span><span>She focused her mind on gathering power.\u00a0</span><span>At that moment.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCrocktaaaaaaaaaa!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Somebody yelled. The grey god opened her eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Avoid it </span><i><span>dottttttt</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta rolled sideways.</span></p><br/><p><span>Next.</span></p><br/><p><span>A golden breath poured out.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo barely survived the explosion.\u00a0</span><span>His head shook. His hands didn\u2019t move well. General was heavy in his arms.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kuock...Anor, are you okay </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He touched his forehead and asked Anor, who was beside him.\u00a0</span><span>However, there was no reply.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAnor...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo shook Anor\u2019s body. Anor breathed weakly.\u00a0</span><span>Blood was flowing from his abdomen. The blood was quickly filling the surroundings.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAnor, Anor!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo hit his cheek. Anor\u2019s eyes slightly opened. However, he couldn\u2019t say anything.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAnyone, help </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! Any...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCalm down.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A green hand touched Anor\u2019s wound. Light shone from the hand.\u00a0</span><span>It was the shaman Tashaquil.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Anor is okay </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe isn\u2019t okay. If this fight continues...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo looked around. Kumarak was assaulting like crazy. He knocked on the shield of the grey god.\u00a0</span><span>Then it was broken by Zankus\u2019 arrow. Kumarak\u2019s axe descended towards her. But he was the one broken instead. He was bleeding from the chest.\u00a0</span><span>The grey god\u2019s eyes were calm.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta became furious.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo looked around.\u00a0</span><span>The gods realized the difference in power and lost their fighting spirit. The orcs lost their momentum and were like dogs without tails.</span></p><br/><p><span>He felt furious.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat are you doing </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo yelled, but the gods didn\u2019t respond.</span></p><br/><p><span>A mutter was heard,\u00a0</span><span>\"Whether the grey god\u2019s cause is wrong or not...at this rate, the world will perish.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo closed his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>It was to soothe the feeling in his chest. Otherwise, he might fire General at them.\u00a0</span><span>It pressed heavily on his shoulder.\u00a0</span><span>This was a battlefield of the gods, but they were scared.</span></p><br/><p><span>How did he come to this place?</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Huhuhu. Yes, that was it </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He was a soldier of the Quantes\u2019 Gnome Garrison. At a young age, he became captain and commanded his unit. He didn\u2019t doubt that he was the best soldier and a wonderful man of Quantes.\u00a0</span><span>Then he met Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>When the curious thing called the Demon\u2019s Mouth almost destroyed Quantes, he appeared and saved the city.</span></p><br/><p><span>Something hot filled Tiyo\u2019s chest. Crockta was more reckless than anyone Tiyo knew.\u00a0</span><span>More than himself.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo stood at the crossroads of choice.\u00a0</span><span>He was walking on a path that he knew well. However, now the path split in two. There was a strange path that he didn\u2019t know. Beyond that, something was glittering.</span></p><br/><p><span>He wanted to check it out. At the crossroad, he decided to take a step towards the unknown.\u00a0</span><span>Then everything changed.\u00a0</span><span>Another world.</span></p><br/><p><span>He met the great hunter Shakan. The north was opened and he explored an area that no one else had. He met Anor and they killed the great chieftain to save the north. He returned to the continent and fought with the empire. Then he came to know hidden secrets of the world.</span></p><br/><p><span>Now he stood on a battlefield where a god was trying to destroy the world, while an army gathered to stop her.\u00a0</span><span>There were no regrets.\u00a0</span><span>Who could\u2019ve expected?\u00a0</span><span>There was a spot for a little gnome on a battlefield involving the fate of the world.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018The artifact that you are using has no limit on its power.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur\u2019s voice popped into his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>In front of him, Crockta was wielding the greatsword like crazy. In a stationary world where no one else was moving, he was fighting alone.\u00a0</span><span>A much better man than all the gods sitting down in helplessness.\u00a0</span><span>This was the man Tiyo had decided to follow.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNow it is this Tiyo\u2019s turn </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He raised General.\u00a0</span><span>There was the sound of iron snapping as General started changing from the form of a rifle. The muzzle was expanded.\u00a0</span><span>General depended on Tiyo\u2019s will and energy. It was rapidly swallowing his body.</span></p><br/><p><span>It squeezed Tiyo\u2019s brain and ate all the energy in his body. His body gradually tilted.\u00a0</span><span>His life force was shaking.\u00a0</span><span>However, he gritted his teeth and ignored it.\u00a0</span><span>He didn\u2019t know how much he was losing because of this.\u00a0</span><span>But it didn\u2019t matter.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Crockta.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Huh?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018I want to go to the north with Crockta </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Everything was decided in that moment.\u00a0</span><span>There were two paths.\u00a0</span><span>The decision he made changed everything.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018General is a dragon slayer weapon. It is a dragon weapon designed to kill dragons.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Crest collectively saying towards himself, when Timur left. Tiyo didn\u2019t understand the words at the time, but now he did.\u00a0</span><span>General had no limit. There was no limit for the one who held General. If he wanted, he could do this.</span></p><br/><p><span>No matter what price he had to pay, he could do it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hoo, hoo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>General\u2019s transformation ended.\u00a0</span><span>At that moment, something was completely sucked from his body.\u00a0</span><span>There was no energy remaining in his body.\u00a0</span><span>It would probably never be regained again.\u00a0</span><span>It might be his life, his flesh.\u00a0</span><span>Maybe something even more valuable.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, he shouted.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCrocktaaaaaaaaaa!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>General, who finished its transformation, looked like a piece of art instead of a gun. Two wings spread open and the golden dragon, instead of a muzzle, opened its mouth.\u00a0</span><span>The dragon\u2019s eyes stared straight at its enemy.\u00a0</span><span>Light emerged from the dragon\u2019s mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo squeezed out all of his strength and yelled,\u00a0</span><span>\"Avoid it </span><i><span>dottttttt</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A golden breath filled the world.</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><br/><p>I have also updated my\u00a0Patreon\u00a0to reflect my new novels.

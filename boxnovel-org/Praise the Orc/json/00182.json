The shape, the center of gravity, the familiar pressure in his hands, everything about Ogre Slayer was the best!\u00a0</span><span>But no matter how close it was to him, it was unavoidable if its retirement time was approaching.\u00a0</span><span>He was willing to let it go!</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta nodded and said, \u201cThank you. I will get a new weapon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"New wine should be put in a new bottle.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019m envious </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>. My General is so strong that I can\u2019t change it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s group congratulated him.\u00a0</span><span>To them, equipment was disposable. Everyone received new and better equipment as time passed.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s heart pounded as he anticipated the new weapon.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Huhu, let\u2019s design a better weapon this time...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>As they tried to enter the inn with bright faces...</span></p><br/><p><span>Zakiro hurriedly blocked them again as he said, \"No, Warrior! That weapon, don\u2019t you have any affection for it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow can you just throw Ogre Slayer away!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A sword is just a sword, what are you talking about? It is reasonable to let it go when the time comes.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You shouldn\u2019t be like this! Ogre Slayer will be sad!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019m not a pampered person who personifies tools, Zakiro!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta puffed up his chest and proclaimed, \"Zakiro, keep this in mind. A weapon is a weapon, people are people! Don\u2019t give too much meaning to lifeless things. It is a fleeting impression. A warrior doesn\u2019t blame the tool or use it as an excuse.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a hard mindset of practical materialism!</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Only those who are weak care about such meaningless superstitions!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta didn\u2019t believe in superstitions. When he was a soldier, he saw many people giving meaning to minor things. They would tremble in fear, saying someone was cursed.\u00a0</span><span>This fear was a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading many people to a tragedy.\u00a0</span><span>So he didn\u2019t believe in such things.\u00a0</span><span>A sword was a sword.\u00a0</span><span>He only believed in himself during battle!</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Like this...a warrior with no romance...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Many of those romantic warriors have already died at my hands, and they met their weapon friends in the afterlife.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCough!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Zakiro dropped his head.\u00a0</span><span>\"My sword is in the hands of such a heartless orc...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kulkul, didn\u2019t you hear it from Thompson?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At the time, Thompson had a deal with the Golden Anvil Clan.\u00a0</span><span>Zakiro might be Thompson\u2019s friend.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI make weapons but I don\u2019t care who uses them. It is my philosophy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then you didn\u2019t know who I was?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zakiro looked at Crocka and laughed.\u00a0</span><span>\"An orc warrior is holding my weapon, that is all I know. I am called the \u2018Slayer Maker!\u2019 There are many warriors who want my sword. I can\u2019t afford to remember them one by one.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He appeared to have his own pride as a craftsman.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta nodded,\u00a0</span><span>\"I see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It had nothing to do with him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Anyway, it was good to meet you. Then I\u2019m going...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWait!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy do you keep blocking me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Now Zakiro was very close to the inn\u2019s door as he blocked them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Anyway, this is the relationship between us so I will accompany you to Geherad.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We don\u2019t need company...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Warrior, are you thinking of making your own weapon?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Zakiro looked at him with sad eyes.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were so cold-blooded to have no affection for your weapon. I made the weapon for you and Thompson without any consideration.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I heard it was in return for saving your life...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSo! Instead of the production cost! The debt will be cleared if you accompany me to Geherad.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zakiro was trying to get to Geherad at all cost.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta looked at Tiyo and Anor in turn. Tiyo\u2019s face was saying \u2018absolutely not\u2019 while Anor had no thoughts.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do you know the way to Geherad?\u201d Zakiro asked.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There is a map.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA map isn\u2019t enough when trying to get through the great forest. You guys don\u2019t know anything about Geherad. Do you know why Geherad is called Geherad?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI know. It means the last fire.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What is the last fire?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don\u2019t know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Look. You don\u2019t know anything. I will guide you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hrmm...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta nodded.\u00a0</span><span>He heard there was only one road but due to the danger zones in the forest, it could be hard to find another city.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta replied, \u201cI understand. Then tomorrow, meet here...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Cough, I should stay here with you today...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The value of your weapon...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Thus, Crockta was accompanied by Zakiro, the craftsman of the Golden Anvil Clan who made his sword.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>They left early.\u00a0</span><span>The route to Geherad required going through several rough areas.\u00a0</span><span>The first thing they encountered were goblins.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGoblins...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUmm...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo had goblins friends so they looked uncomfortable.\u00a0</span><span>The goblins didn\u2019t know who their opponent was and were mocking Crockta with their typical sneering faces.\u00a0</span><span>One of them showed his ass and laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta held down his rising anger and said,\u00a0</span><span>\"Hey, goblin friends.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblins understood the language to a certain extent, so they listened to Crockta\u2019s voice.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We don\u2019t want to fight, so can\u2019t you just let us go?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblins looked at each other. They discussed something and nodded.\u00a0</span><span>They started talking.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kyak kyak! Kyaak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>One goblin stepped forward. It was the one who laughed at them and shook his ass.\u00a0</span><span>He bowed like he was apologizing for his rudeness.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta laughed,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cHuhu. It is okay, goblin friend. You are trying to make a living...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblin put his hand in his pocket.\u00a0</span><span>Was he planning to give an apology gift?\u00a0</span><span>Crockta watched him. The goblin pulled out something from his pocket.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>He pushed it towards Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>It was nothing other than his own middle finger.\u00a0</span><span>Against his expectations, it wasn\u2019t a gift but an insult!\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s face stiffened while the goblins\u2019 laugh became louder.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kyak kyak kyak! Kyaak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kiyok kiyak? Kyaak! Kya kya kyak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKyaak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblins laughed and pointed towards Crockta. Then they looked around with hateful expressions.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta decided to forget about friendship with the goblins.\u00a0</span><span>Ogre Slayer shook.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKyaaaaak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblins felt a breeze pass by their cheeks.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Patter.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Then a hot liquid was splattered on their bodies. The goblins, who were pointing at each other and laughing at Crockta, turned their heads with blank faces.\u00a0</span><span>A goblin\u2019s head and body had been split apart.\u00a0</span><span>It was his blood that had splattered.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKyaaaaak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKyaak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblins stepped back in surprise.\u00a0</span><span>The confused goblins started to swing their shabby weapons towards Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>But the opponent was Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>He dealt with an army of the empire\u2019s elite knights alone, so the goblins couldn\u2019t hit him.</span></p><br/><p><span>Every time the greatsword moved, a goblin would fall to the ground.\u00a0</span><span>The surroundings soon became filled with blood.\u00a0</span><span>An overwhelming slaughter!</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHoh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zakiro watched from behind and nodded.\u00a0</span><span>The warrior was stronger than he thought.\u00a0</span><span>He wasn\u2019t aware of a warrior\u2019s skills since he made weapons all day long in the Golden Anvil Clan\u2019s workshop, but this orc warrior clearly had a great talent.\u00a0</span><span>Ogre Slayer danced playfully in his hands.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Not bad.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a strange feeling.\u00a0</span><span>His sword was showing its worth in the hands of a great warrior.</span></p><br/><p><span>His only goal when hammering metal was the finished weapon. He never thought about what his weapons would be used for once they left his possession. He thought that other craftsmen who were strict about the owners were stupid.</span></p><br/><p><span>But now he could understand to a certain extent.\u00a0</span><span>How sad would it be if his sword was in the hands of a fool?</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Beautiful.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Now Crockta had taken care of most of the goblins.\u00a0</span><span>The one remaining goblin trembled as he sat down and bowed to Crockta. Then he bumped his head against the ground, asking for forgiveness.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kyaaakyack...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblin left his forehead on the ground as he begged for mercy.\u00a0</span><span>The greatsword descended above his head.\u00a0</span><span>The goblin\u2019s head was cut off.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That stinger in your mouth won\u2019t work.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblin\u2019s head had a small pipe in it, its favorite stinger.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"These goblins... Kiao is much better </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He is someone who transcended beyond the limits of his species.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo shook his head as he remembered Kiao, the goblin who used spatiotemporal storm arrows at Gushantimur\u2019s lair.\u00a0</span><span>Then Crockta spoke to the stupefied dwarf,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cZakiro. Let\u2019s keep going.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh? Umm.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Zakiro regained his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor prayed for the dead. An unknown power flowed from his hands. It was the power of the necromancer to scatter the spirits of the dead.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Enter nirvana.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zakiro looked at Anor while moving after Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>He thought Anor was a magician or elementalist, but he was a necromancer. It was a class that he didn\u2019t often see.\u00a0</span><span>A powerful warrior and a necromancer.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are you doing </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>? Keep going!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>And a noisy gnome.\u00a0</span><span>It was a strange combination.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>After repelling the goblins, they soon came across new enemies.\u00a0</span><span>This time it was a troll encounter, with three trolls drooling as they surrounded the group.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Should I show my skills this time </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo grinned while placing General on his shoulder.\u00a0</span><span>It was the appearance of a small gnome walking towards three trolls.</span></p><br/><p><span>Zakiro glanced at Crockta,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWarrior, is it okay? That gnome...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Watch. Kulkul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Once the fight started, Tiyo fired General indiscriminately.\u00a0</span><span>Zakiro thought it was a rifle made of magic engineering, but its shape changed and it emitted a lot of energy.\u00a0</span><span>The trolls couldn\u2019t get close and were hit by the bullets.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat is an artifact!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is said to be a dragon\u2019s legacy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Indeed...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>General was a dragon slayer weapon!\u00a0</span><span>The artifact that grew with the user was now exercising the power of its name.\u00a0</span><span>Now that Tiyo\u2019s strength had increased further, the magic bullets could penetrate the trolls\u2019 thick skin.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAaaaack!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kuooh!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>They tried to repair the injured areas, but General was currently in the form of Vulcan!\u00a0</span><span>The trolls ended up riddled with bullets.\u00a0</span><span>Zakiro revised his assessment of Crockta\u2019s group.\u00a0</span><span>They weren\u2019t adventurers but real powerhouses.</span></p><br/><p><span>This thought reached its climax when the party met a group of ogres.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOgres are easy opponents.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The territory of the ogres was often called the tomb of adventurers. They were monstrous and challenging opponents. Adventurers either escaped or die.\u00a0</span><span>However, Crockta easily took care of such huge monsters. As the name suggested, he slaughtered the ogres with Ogre Slayer.</span></p><br/><p><span>The ogres screamed but the result was the same.\u00a0</span><span>The forest turned red every time he wielded it.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta moved beautifully in the heavy rain of blood, dancing with his sword. It was an organic swordsmanship that combined attack and defense.\u00a0</span><span>Not long after that, all the ogres died.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grinned at Zakiro,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cHow is it, my skills?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Zakiro nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\"Amazing. Really...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>When he first got the blueprints for a really big sword, he wondered if the owner could even deal with an ogre.\u00a0</span><span>He made the sword anyway.\u00a0</span><span>But he changing his mind after meeting the owner of Ogre Slayer.</span></p><br/><p><span>He was wrong.\u00a0</span><span>Ogres weren\u2019t a match for this warrior.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI did well to follow...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He formed a fist.\u00a0</span><span>He wanted to pound on iron right now.</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><br/><p>I have also updated my\u00a0Patreon\u00a0to reflect my new novels.

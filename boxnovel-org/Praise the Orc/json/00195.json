As if this wasn\u2019t enough, they also learned that the night sky was fake, an illusion.</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus glanced at Crockta, as if asking him for an explanation.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta didn\u2019t say anything.\u00a0</span><span>He didn\u2019t exactly know about the curse of the stars and the grey god had an unknown plan. The other gods probably spread such a strange divine message because of her.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta didn\u2019t know the proper context, so it felt like the story was heading deeper into a labyrinth.\u00a0</span><span>Abaddon, who seemed able to explain it, had disappeared.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is similar to when Crockta sometimes returns to the abyss of the stars <em>dot</em>. Is he like you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMy case is different. Maybe the god called him directly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUmmm...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo\u2019s mind was busy, his face scrunched up in concentration as he calculated different paths and outcomes.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThere is no need to worry <em>dot</em>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He got up after a few seconds.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"First of all, let\u2019s stop the gods\u2019 plan for Orcrox <em>dot</em>. Then the answers will gradually emerge.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The rest of the group nodded at Tiyo\u2019s words.\u00a0</span><span>His loud voice loosened the tense atmosphere. It was better for them to move than to sit still and worry.\u00a0</span><span>Everyone got up.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s group hoped that Abaddon would return safely to study a higher level of cuisine.\u00a0</span><span>They left a note for Abaddon.</span></p><br/><p><span>[We will come back someday, and we will be expecting spicier dishes.]</span></p><br/><p><span>As soon as he was about to leave the large space, Crockta found something.\u00a0</span><span>There were faded letters on the wall.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta focused on it. The words were written long ago. The ink had melted but the contents could roughly be understood.</span></p><br/><p><span>The contents were praising the star god.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta looked at the light illuminating this space.\u00a0</span><span>It was a comfortable light that the eyes could easily look at.\u00a0</span><span>Yes, like the stars.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta realized that this pyramid was a building for the star god. When he died, the temples serving him would\u2019ve disappeared. This pyramid might be one of the few remaining traces.</span></p><br/><p><span>Abaddon, he remained here in remembrance of the star god.\u00a0</span><span>The dead god.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018The stars have cooled down a long time ago.\u2019\u00a0</span><span>Crockta stopped.\u00a0</span><span>\u2018I always see death. Life is a process of convergence towards death. So I want to save everyone.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>The voice of the grey god flashed through his head again.\u00a0</span><span>The memory of that day was revived.\u00a0</span><span>It was the vision that she showed him before he confronted the imperial army alone. A desperate power that saw the last of all living things.</span></p><br/><p><span>The sky of dying stars that she planted in her white world.\u00a0</span><span>Maybe that was the real sky of this world.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You know the answer.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta touched the Demon\u2019s Mouth that was exposed to Abaddon. The guy in it didn\u2019t speak again.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta remembered the first time he met him. The demon, desperate from all the deaths and emptiness, had emitted his fears towards the outside world through the belt. Quantes almost became a land of death.</span></p><br/><p><span>The grey god and the demons.\u00a0</span><span>If he kept fighting, someday he would get the answer.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCrockta, what are you doing <em>dot</em>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo called out to him.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta stroked the blurred letters with his fingertips and looked at the luminous light again.\u00a0</span><span>It was a moment of silence for the star god.</span></p><br/><p><span>The rest were eagerly waiting for Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCrockta! We can\u2019t open the door <em>dot</em>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is like when the pyramid recognized Crockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We need Crockta this time as well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They were pushing the door this time.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta silently pulled the door. Listening to their praises, Crockta imagined that he might be very clever.\u00a0</span><span>Anor\u2019s bone sparrow was waiting for them at the pyramid entrance. Anor stroked its head and returned it to death.\u00a0</span><span>The snakes were no longer hostile to Crockta. Under their uncomfortable gazes, Crockta\u2019s party headed north again.</span></p><br/><p><span>Orcrox was getting closer.\u00a0</span><span>Many things had happened since he left.\u00a0</span><span>The previously immature orc was now a warrior shaking the continent.\u00a0</span><span>Somehow, it felt like the orc guards he saw at Orcrox would still be there.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Aklan looked at the army following him and smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span>They might\u2019ve been turned away at Maillard, but the size of the expedition was gradually increasing.\u00a0</span><span>Every town and city they passed, ambitious youths volunteered while religious nobles led their soldiers. By the time they arrived in Orcrox, it would be a huge force to be reckoned with.</span></p><br/><p><span>Humans, elves, dark elves, dwarves, and gnomes. While the members were mostly humans and elves, \u00a0there were quite a few varied members from the other species.\u00a0</span><span>The orcs would be destroyed by the followers of the gods.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The gods are watching us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in the gods too much.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Adandator said. He wasn\u2019t delighted by the scale of the expedition. </span><span>\u201cI just want to see a crazy guy who might kill a god.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator remembered the crazy orc warrior fighting the imperial army alone.\u00a0</span><span>People participated in the expedition to kill him, but it wouldn\u2019t be so easy.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuhu, we will soon arrive in Chesswood. There will be many more joining. Adandator should have faith.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Since the expedition\u2019s departure, everything had been smooth going except for Maillard. Aklan was confident.\u00a0</span><span>He would attract more people at Chesswood.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"But what about the support of the business companies for the expedition?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They needed supplies to sustain such a large number of people.\u00a0</span><span>Funds were sufficient due to donations not just from the empire, but from volunteers as well. They asked the business companies for a smooth supply of goods.</span></p><br/><p><span>The first one they contacted was \u2018Blacksmith\u2019, the largest business company on the continent.\u00a0</span><span>The Blacksmith Company decided policies through a meeting of its senior executives. The decision would take some time due to this meeting, but Aklan wasn\u2019t worried. Why would they refuse?</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThey will make a decision soon. Once we receive the materials from the Blacksmith Company, the expedition will become smoother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Aklan replied as passing volunteers bowed to him.\u00a0</span><span>The gods they believed in were different, but they all became one due to faith.\u00a0</span><span>It wasn\u2019t a mere conquest, but a struggle that would unify the continent.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOnce this fight is finished, the continent will become more peaceful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cReally...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cFaith will bind people together.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator shrugged.\u00a0</span><span>He thought that if the expedition won, there would be a bigger fight over the distribution of profits. However, Aklan\u2019s mind was more of a flower garden than he thought.\u00a0</span><span>Aklan was a pure man, despite being a paladin of the war god.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLook over there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Chesswood could be seen.\u00a0</span><span>It was named this because the villages scattered all the place looked like a chessboard. It wasn\u2019t a single city but many villages joined together, so the population exceeded a few big cities.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cRaise the flags higher.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They raised flags in the name of the gods to recruit volunteers.\u00a0</span><span>It meant there was a flag for each god. There was also the patterns for the nobles. Colourful flags showed as they headed towards Chesswood.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Let's go.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>They reached Chesswood.\u00a0</span><span>It was the first village. The sign said \u2018Dandelion Village.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is a nice name for a village.</span></p><br/><p><span>A man dragging three cows found them. The three cows were identical.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWonderful cows.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Huhu, they are my pride. Triplets.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCan you call the head of the village here? You might already know, but we are the expedition trying to destroy Crockta and the orcs...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>But before Aklan could finish what he was saying, something came flying.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Cheolpeok.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>It was an egg.\u00a0</span><span>An egg had been thrown at him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOh my, what is this?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The farmer pulling the three cows looked around with surprise. A village resident was holding a basket of eggs.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBad people. There is no one left to kill, so you want to kill Crockta?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHave patience, patience.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Mister, why should I be patient? Didn\u2019t you hear him?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"No matter how angry you are, it is dangerous to do that to someone holding a blade...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Let him stab me! I would already be a dead body if it wasn\u2019t for Crockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Aklan wiped the egg flowing down his head.\u00a0</span><span>The volunteers tried to pull out their weapons, but he restrained them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Haha, just listen to our story. We aren\u2019t going against the orcs for no reason.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Aklan\u2019s mind became complicated.\u00a0</span><span>It was the same atmosphere as Maillard.\u00a0</span><span>It was understandable that the Free Cities Alliance in the south refused to join them. They had waged war with the empire and Crockta helped them.</span></p><br/><p><span>But in Maillard, he came to know one side of Crockta that he had no idea about. In that city, Crockta was a great orc.\u00a0</span><span>Now his name had appeared again in Chesswood.</span></p><br/><p><span>The man with the triplet cows walked over to Aklan.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Aklan said while wiping off the eggs.\u00a0</span><span>\"As you can see, there are a lot of people. I would like to meet the village leaders of Chesswood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Well...you won\u2019t hear anything good but...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The man nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cPlease wait a while. I will report this to Ingram, who represents Chesswood, and he will come soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man left and Aklan waited with his troops at the entrance of the village.\u00a0</span><span>Then he suddenly heard a song from the village.\u00a0</span><span>At first glance, Chesswood was a land of musicians who produced a lot of minstrels, and they seemed to like songs.\u00a0</span><span>Once the expedition ended, minstrels would turn their story into an epic.</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment.\u00a0</span><span>While waiting for the leader, a bunch of children ran up to the expedition members.</span></p><br/><p><span>Aklan smiled.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cHello. Little friends.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>However, their expressions weren\u2019t bright. The children glared at the expedition before one child stepped forward.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Are you really going to kill Crockta and the orcs?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That's right. We are...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBad people!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Aklan made an absurd expression.</span></p><br/><p><span>The child shouted,\u00a0</span><span>\"You aren\u2019t worthy of our support! Concern for you? Get out of here right now! Stranger to language and rhyme! Change your metal head!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a type of rhyming song that recently became popular on the continent. A fresh form of music that criticized others.\u00a0</span><span>As expected from Chesswood, the children were booing them beautifully through song.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Misters should be careful! I will say it with my stormy rhyme! Listen carefully, Crockta is our hero! You don\u2019t know anything, just staring straight ahead with blind eyes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The other children cheered at the little boy\u2019s impromptu lyrics.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe best!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Truly our village\u2019s rhyme king!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The child didn\u2019t stop.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A crisis in Chesswood, the raid of evil people! We didn\u2019t have strength, like hitting rocks with eggs! Then he came, our friend Crockta! There was a fountain of blood every time he moved his greatsword! He is our savior! He always pursues justice! Don\u2019t bother Crockta, you bastards!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The song was over and the child turned around. Then he bumped shoulders with his friends and celebrated the impromptu lyrics. The children cheered.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes! Historic lyrics!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The best improvised song!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Those uncles are going crazy right now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Aklan was speechless.\u00a0</span><span>After listening to the lyrics, he learned there was a crisis in the village and Crockta had rescued them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMisters, Crockta is our hero. Remember that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The child who made the impromptu lyrics looked at them.\u00a0</span><span>Then a man appeared and tapped the child\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis brat, what are you doing here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLeader!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You can\u2019t do this.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If you just heard my lyrics...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cU-Understood!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the head of Dandelion Village. He looked at Aklan and the expedition troops.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hrmm...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>But his eyes weren\u2019t good.\u00a0</span><span>Aklan felt that things in Chesswood wouldn\u2019t turn out how he wanted.</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><br/><p>I have also updated my\u00a0Patreon\u00a0to reflect my new novels.

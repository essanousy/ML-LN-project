Those who were leaving this morning exited the door with their baggage.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Isn\u2019t there any knight in Alaste that can deal with Adandator </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There is one person, a grandmaster like Adandator.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then why isn\u2019t he </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe is old...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Alaste\u2019s grandmaster was an old, white-haired knight.\u00a0</span><span>His experience and skills were excellent but he was old, so many thought it was impossible for him to deal with Adandator. He was also hard at work training pupils.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If you go to Alaste, you can see him once. Not only is his swordsmanship famous, he is known as the master of knights who trains other knights in the right way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHoh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am a knight because of him. Hahahat.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He laughed loudly.\u00a0</span><span>\"Crockta is already strong enough, but I\u2019m sure you can get stronger if you meet him.

Hut!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The yells regularly rang out, \u201cBul\u2019tarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A gigantic roar shook the training grounds.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"How are the warriors these days?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNot enough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is like talking to Lenox.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>This was the cradle of orc warriors, Orcrox.\u00a0</span><span>Orcs were training to become warriors.\u00a0</span><span>After the death of the great warrior Lenox, another warrior became the new instructor.\u00a0</span><span>Hoyt, Lenox\u2019s disciple and the one who mastered the hammer, undergoing many fights. </span></p><br/><p><span>He had spent a long time recovering from his injury but after he recovered, he started enthusiastically teaching the orcs.\u00a0</span><span>Now the orcs who came to Orcrox learned from Hoyt, not Lenox.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do your best!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t just shout!

They squeezed out more strength, surpassing their limits.\u00a0</span><span>Although he was originally a warrior, Hoyt wasn\u2019t any less stringent than Lenox as an instructor.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What brings you here? Tashaquil.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The one who came to see him was the great shaman Tashaquil, the orc shaman instructor at Basque Village.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I had a dream.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA dream.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>If any other orc had talked about their dream, Hoyt would\u2019ve ignored it. But the other person was Tashaquil.\u00a0</span><span>The dream of a powerful shaman was like a prophecy in itself, as it contained a clue to the future.\u00a0</span><span>He wouldn\u2019t come here because of an ordinary dream.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat was the dream?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I saw a warrior.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tashaquil smiled.\u00a0</span><span>\"He is fighting to become a great warrior.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Who?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I won\u2019t reveal it to others.

Well, I wonder...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He chuckled in a low voice.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Fighting to become a great warrior...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Hoyt looked at his hammer on the ground.\u00a0</span><span>A masterpiece from Golden Anvil. The name of the hammer was \u2018Mountain Slasher.\u2019 As the name suggested, anyone hit by this hammer would die.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is very dangerous.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That is a warrior's life. Die or become great.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tashaquil chuckled.\u00a0</span><span>\"So I came here. Give me that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He pointed to one side.\u00a0</span><span>Hoyt\u2019s expression changed.\u00a0</span><span>This wasn\u2019t something he could give to Tashaquil.</span></p><br/><p><span>An old helmet.\u00a0</span><span>It was Lenox\u2019s legacy, the steel helmet he had used.\u00a0</span><span>It was hanging from a bar on one side of the training grounds and watching the orcs, just like Lenox during his life.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I can\u2019t do that. It is Lenox\u2019s.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He is gone. I will give it to someone who deserves it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"But that...it can\u2019t be anything else?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019m reluctant to give...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The moment that Hoyt was about to refuse...</span></p><br/><p><span>A blast of wind shot through Orcrox.\u00a0</span><span>It was strong enough to cause the sand scattered on the ground to rise.\u00a0</span><span>Hoyt and Tashaquil covered their faces with their hands.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>An incredible thing happened.\u00a0</span><span>Lenox\u2019s helmet was caught by the wind and fell off the bar to the ground.\u00a0</span><span>The steel helmet tumbled towards them.\u00a0</span><span>It was rare for heavy steel helmets to fly in the wind.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tashaquil laughed.\u00a0</span><span>\"Lenox seems to think he needs it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Hoyt didn\u2019t answer. It felt like Lenox\u2019s response.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hoyt. Can I send it to the warrior who needs it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Are you going to bring it directly to him?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I need to stay in Basque Village.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen...\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Tashaquil whistled.</span></p><br/><p><span>Something emerged.\u00a0</span><span>A huge shadow appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span>Hoyt laughed at the sight.\u00a0</span><span>\"King of the Forest.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. This guy will bring the helmet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNow I know for sure who the other person is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A giant tiger.\u00a0</span><span>He was 1.5 times bigger than a normal tiger.\u00a0</span><span>The ruler of Orcrox Forest, the one who created fear in the creatures of the forest!\u00a0</span><span>The tiger who was the king of the forest, Simba.\u00a0</span><span>The tiger Simba, who defeated the mutant wolf with Crockta, had now matured and reigned as king of the forest.</span></p><br/><p><span>He became a friend of the orcs due to his relationship with Crockta, and came here following Tashaquil\u2019s call.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSimba.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGrrrung...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Give him this.\"\u00a0</span><span>Tashaquil placed the helmet into a sack and tied it around Simba\u2019s neck.

I wonder what type of dream you had.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tashaquil grinned. He shook his staff and blessed the warriors in the training ground.\u00a0</span><span>Some of them would give up and others would continue to walk this path until they eventually became warriors.

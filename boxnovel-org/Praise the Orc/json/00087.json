There were three people who interfered with him.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>The orc warrior from the continent, Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>The gnome soldier who came with Crockta, Tiyo.\u00a0</span><span>Then the one who suddenly appeared with the forgotten bloodline of a necromancer, Anor.\u00a0</span><span>Without them, Nuridot would\u2019ve fallen into his hands without any great sacrifices. But the three of them had screwed up everything.</span></p><br/><p><span>He tried to do a last hurrah with his axe, but his body didn\u2019t move. A red tinge could be seen at the edge of his vision. Death was approaching.\u00a0</span><span>He felt sure that it was his end.\u00a0</span><span>In the end, Urok cursed them in order to see their triumphant expressions fall.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGreat chieftain... come after you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>However, the reaction he was hoping for didn\u2019t come out. Their expressions became more excited like they had been waiting for that to happen.\u00a0</span><span>Urok acknowledged his defeat. These people were bolder and stronger than he thought.</span></p><br/><p><span>He raised his gaze.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s greatsword was covering the sun.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ahh, that light, the flash of a soldier shining on the battlefield.\u00a0</span><span>A dark curtain started to descend from above his head. Urok realized that the darkness was the death that came to meet him. He saw little flashes of light bounce off the edge of the blade.</span></p><br/><p><span>Thus, he met his end with wide open eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe end.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The situation was reversed after Anor appeared. Crockta mercilessly slew the orcs and the orcs he killed were raised again by Anor. The dark elves didn\u2019t have to worry about damage to the undead, so they could shoot arrows randomly.</span></p><br/><p><span>The Great Clan warriors stubbornly threw themselves at the dark elves, but they couldn\u2019t reverse the situation.\u00a0</span><span>Urok\u2019s death was a signal as the orcs started to retreat.</span></p><br/><p><span>The dark elves cheered at the victory.\u00a0</span><span>However, the three men who led the battle to victory weren\u2019t pleased.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAnor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta called out to him. </span><span>Anor reflexively replied, \"What crazy bastard called me... ah, Crockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was now his reflex to spit out curses.\u00a0</span><span>What was this? </span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta shrugged.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYou seem to have suffered. Are your ears okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ah, yes. Well...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor touched the shortened ends of his ears. The ears were shortened, and he no longer looked like a dark elf, but a tanned human.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta nodded towards the dark elves.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"They seem to want an explanation.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Now that the orcs retreated, the dark elves were staring at Anor with loathe and fear-filled eyes..</span></p><br/><p><span>In the past, Crockta had met a man called Iron who liked wine in Chesswood. He was a necromancer like Anor. It was just like that time. The power to raise the dead always provoked people\u2019s fear.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor straightened his back.</span></p><br/><p><span>He decided not to care anymore.\u00a0</span><span>He cut off his ears in a crisis and the power was liberated.</span></p><br/><p><span>The fact that selfish dark elves tried to kill him for their own safety and he needed to free the power of the dark elves pointed out the duality of Nuridot. It might be argued that that the worst ones weren\u2019t the orcs, but the terrible prejudices of the dark elves.</span></p><br/><p><span>But Anor decided to abandon all of that.\u00a0</span><span>He had been persecuted for his whole life in Nuridot. The dark elves who treated him like that didn\u2019t deserve an explanation.\u00a0</span><span>There was nothing different.</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor said with a grin, \u201cWhat are you looking at, dog scum?\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian disconnected.\u00a0</span><span>He checked his watch and saw that he had been connected for a long time. Ian felt hungry. What was in the fridge?</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Nothing...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He opened the refrigerator and found nothing. It was mostly empty.\u00a0</span><span>Suddenly, he found an unfamiliar sealed container. A post-it note was attached.\u00a0</span><span>The post-it was from Yiyu and the following was written:</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Stop the game and eat.</span></i><i><span>Game loser.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>He opened it and found a sandwich. It was a bit out of shape, like she had created it herself. Ian smiled and bit the sandwich, tasting canned tuna among crunchy greens.\u00a0</span><span>The taste was okay.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHrmm...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He recalled the contents of the game as he walked into the living room.\u00a0</span><span>This time, he had connected for a long time.\u00a0</span><span>Since he played alone in the north where there were no users, he could immerse himself in Elder Lord. For a while, he forgot that he was Jung Ian and really lived like Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>If it hadn\u2019t been for the system warning message, he might still have been playing.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I really am a game loser.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He checked his phone. There were a few messages from Han Yeori. He had been connected to Elder Lord for so long that he hadn\u2019t seen her for a while.\u00a0</span><span>Ian decided to visit the cafe. He should do something for the hard-working Han Yeori.</span></p><br/><p><span>He washed up and headed towards Cafe Reason.</span></p><br/><p><span>The store was quiet. It was holidays so the number of students decreased.\u00a0</span><span>Ian smiled and turned to the counter.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Have you been well?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Han Yeori\u2019s eyes widened as she found Ian. Then she rolled her eyes and chatted to Yoo Sooyeon beside her.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Sooyeon, do you know what that face is?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBoss-nim?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"No, not the boss. A demon. That is the face of a demon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Yoo Sooyeon laughed. It seemed like the two of them had become very close.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe face of the capitalist demon, who entrusts his store to others and lives a leisurely life.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI can hear you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am saying it so that you can hear,\u201d retorted Han Yeori.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian smiled bitterly. He certainly didn\u2019t care for the store, as he only accessed Elder Lord all day long.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI understand. Should we meet up once you are finished?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian\u2019s words meant he would buy them dinner.\u00a0</span><span>Han Yeori quickly replied, \"Tuna.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Expensive tuna.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Yoo Sooyeon just tilted her head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Sooyeon hasn\u2019t eaten proper tuna. Boss-nim will let you try it today. The demon has a conscience.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She poked fun at Ian as she talked to Yoo Sooyeon. Ian smiled at the scene.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Okay, I understand.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Han Yeori smiled widely.\u00a0</span><span>He had a feeling that he would be spending a lot today.</span></p><br/><p><span>A group of guests entered. As Han Yeori and Yoo Sooyeon took their orders, Ian looked around the cafe.\u00a0</span><span>He aligned the chairs, checked the trash and refilled the supplies.\u00a0</span><span>Then he sat down in a corner of the cafe. He stared at the interior of Caf\u00e9 Reason. Ian became excited as he looked around his store.</span></p><br/><p><span>He decorated everything according to his own taste.</span></p><br/><p><span>From his childhood to the battlefield, Ian had lived in environments that he couldn\u2019t choose. He couldn\u2019t do anything as a child and he didn\u2019t have any freedom as a soldier. At best, he was only given a choice of what type of gun and knife to use.</span></p><br/><p><span>The first time Ian could think about what he liked was when he came home and set up a caf\u00e9. The work of decorating the store according to his own preferences acted as a rehabilitation that brought he back from his life as a soldier.</span></p><br/><p><span>From the dark walnut colored tables, the iron chairs that firmly supported the back, pipes that appeared in the steampunk and partitions to create a flow among the guests.\u00a0</span><span>He even picked out the font for the menu on the counter. The counter was at a low height for the customers and employees to easily see each other.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWelcome.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Han Yeori greeted a customer.\u00a0</span><span>Her eyes were welcoming and friendly.\u00a0</span><span>Yes, even she was his choice.\u00a0</span><span>He liked the lines around her eyes when she smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, he caught Han Yeori\u2019s eyes.\u00a0</span><span>Her eyebrows raised at his expression. Then as soon as a customer stood at the counter, her face changed abruptly as she smiled brightly.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian smiled and closed his eyes. He leaned back in the iron chair. That\u2019s right. All of this was his choice. Everything in Caf\u00e9 Reason was what he liked, and it was his wish to see it for a long time.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>[Boss-nim, Unni is wondering about the place? \u314b\u314b\u314b]</span></p><br/><p><span>The message came from Yoo Sooyeon.</span></p><br/><p><span>He had first met her on the day that Lenox died. He had gone back to Orcrox and was confused when he ended the connection. He went for an early morning walk and saved her from being bullied.</span></p><br/><p><span>Her profile picture was of her smiling while standing in Caf\u00e9 Reason. In a corner of the screen, Han Yeori\u2019s hand in a V sign could also be seen.\u00a0</span><span>Well, it was good that they seemed to be getting along. He hadn\u2019t asked her any details thus far, but her face had gradually brightened.</span></p><br/><p><span>[An area near the caf\u00e9. I\u2019ll let you know the location later.]\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Then Ian added as a joke,</span></p><br/><p><span>[You should bring some digestives in case there is an accident.]</span></p><br/><p><span>He hadn\u2019t cared for the caf\u00e9 lately, so he was planning to feed them properly today. Not long ago, the salary for an Elder Lord ranker was received. It was sufficient.</span></p><br/><p><span>The support for rankers was a lot bigger than he initially thought.\u00a0</span><span>It was huge.\u00a0</span><span>There was one more \u20180\u2019 than what he had been thinking.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...It is enough to buy the caf\u00e9\u2019s building.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was only the first settlement, but it would be enough if he got a loan.\u00a0</span><span>Then Ian pictured the face of the good-hearted landlord who occasionally came in for coffee.\u00a0</span><span>He might have a lot of money now, but Ian felt uncomfortable crossing a line.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian had been worried when the system asked for an account. He knew Ji Hayeon, the successor to the Myeongsong Group.</span></p><br/><p><span>He had a strange relationship with her due to his military background. It wasn\u2019t hard for her to find information about him. It didn\u2019t matter if she discovered that he was Crockta, but he felt like he wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy Elder Lord like before if his identity was known.</span></p><br/><p><span>So when he searched for information, Ian came up with a description of the core system.</span></p><br/><p><span>The entire funding for rankers was transferred to an account managed by the core system \u2018Albino.\u2019 The funds would be transferred to the virtual account created by Albino, and then distributed to the 500 rankers. Once the settlement was over, all the information including the virtual account was deleted.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a confidential security system designed for the users who chose to remain private among the rankers. Even the developers of the Elder Lord system weren\u2019t able to browse the personal information.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian turned off the chat program and heard a voice near him.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>-The Heaven and Earth Clan led by Choi Hansung\u2019s \u2018Rommel\u2019 has declared war on the Metatron Clan, which is ranked first on Elder Lord\u2019s power ranking.</span></i><i><span>There are some people who see the clan war as a fight between Korean and US users, because the clans are mainly composed of people from these countries.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>It was the familiar voice of the Elder Lord Times host. Someone was watching Elder Lord Times on their phone.\u00a0</span><span>Ian was also curious about Elder Lord.\u00a0</span><span>Ever since he left for the north, he didn\u2019t get much news about Elder Lord.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>-The Heaven and Earth Clan has recently expanded by interacting closely with the NPCs of Elder Lord.</span></i><em><span> This tactic reminds me of the Thawing Balhae Clan that is now gone. Choi Hansung...</span></em></p><br/><p><span>Ian\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u00a0</span><span>He confirmed the information on Choi Hansung. He had a handsome face and outstanding abilities. He was a person who could play the main character in a movie or drama.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>-Choi Hansung is currently ranked second in Elder Lord\u2019s rankings.</span></i><i><span>This is the highest number among Koreans.</span></i><i><span>Therefore, his stock has sharply and he received a lot of offers for CFs. (commercials).</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>-That reminds me, it seems like the \u2018Choi Hansung Ramen\u2019 is very popular recently.</span></i><i><span>He said that he enjoyed eating this ramen before playing Elder Lord.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The hosts of Elder Lord Times then changed the topic. They introduced various topics about Elder Lord.</span></p><br/><p><span>The war between the Heaven and Earth Clan and Metatron Clan, the independent user village created by the elf Elaine was enjoying tremendous prosperity and the fact that a new king was crowned as the head of the allied human cities.</span></p><br/><p><span>There was also a familiar name.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Organizations following in the footsteps of the Orc of Justice, Crockta, have formed.</span></i><i><span>Recently, I heard that the necromancer Iron has come to the fore as a member of Crockta\u2019s fan club, \u2018He\u2019s an Orc, yet still Praiseworthy!\u2019</span></i><i><span>Players from all over Elder Lord have joined.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>The Rehabilitation Brothers have succeeded in reforming the master of the Et Clan, aka Tiger Mask.</span></i><i><span>This has ended the long battle between the Rehabilitation Brothers and the ET Clan.</span></i><i><span>Let\u2019s listen to the interview.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Ian smiled warmly.</span></p><br/><p><span>Recently, the number of members in his fan club \u2018He\u2019s an Orc, yet still Praiseworthy\u2019 have increased. Youvidser Laney, who became famous due to Crockta, was a member of the fan club and some celebrities tried to follow the flow by mentioning Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>Everyone was hoping for his return.\u00a0</span><span>He would return to the continent with the head of the great chieftain.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kulkulkul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian unconsciously laughed like an orc, before coughing as he felt the gazes towards him.\u00a0</span><span>He had recently taken on Crockta\u2019s tone. He needed to be cautious so that Yiyu didn\u2019t notice.\u00a0</span><span>He had to be careful.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Boss-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Han Yeori and Yoo Sooyeon approached him. Han Yeori grabbed Ian\u2019s sleeve and pulled him up.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You should think about what to do to raise caf\u00e9 sales. You don\u2019t have a sense of crisis at all.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What's wrong with that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Let\u2019s go quickly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Yoo Sooyeon was smiling as she watched the scene. Ian laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I said tuna. No buying something else.\u201d Han Yeori declared.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Today has ended. Let\u2019s go, Sooyeon!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Han Yeori and Yoo Sooyeon left arm in arm. Ian followed them.\u00a0</span><span>As he saw Han Yeori\u2019s excitement, someone\u2019s face popped into his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>If it were him, he would say this.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Crockta! Nothing else </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! Tuna </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian stopped in his tracks.\u00a0</span><span>Would Tiyo know the taste of tuna? Somehow, it seemed like Ian\u2019s boundaries of reality was shaking.</span></p><br/><p><span>That\u2019s right.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian looked at Han Yeori who was beckoning to him.\u00a0</span><span>It was the reason why he fought against users in Elder Lord, and wore a headband to get along with NPCs.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Boss-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian\u2019s pace increased.</span></p><br/><p><span>There were people who were important to him. They might just be characters in the game, but they occupied a place in his heart just like the people in front of him.\u00a0</span><span>If something happened to Tiyo, he would really be upset.</span></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, Yoo Sooyeon hit the shoulder of a passerby. The passerby cursed in a low voice. </span></p><br/><p><span>Yoo Sooyeon apologized, \u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian thought as he watched the man pull away.\u00a0</span><span>It was an unavoidable instinct to protect his precious ones.</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0<strong>Next Patreon goal has been reached!!

Their blades flashed in the sun.\u00a0</span><span>The guards found Crockta and laughed. They were laughing but due to the tusks and heinous appearance, their faces seemed evil.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hey. Are you alive?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They hadn\u2019t changed.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta stood in front of them.\u00a0</span><span>He was no longer an apprentice warrior. He returned to Orcrox as a great warrior.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"At that time, it didn\u2019t seem likely...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe warrior who shook the continent has returned to Orcrox.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The guards laughed and Crockta laughed with them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou are alive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m not weaker than you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta bumped fists with the two guards.\u00a0</span><span>It wasn\u2019t enough for Crockta so he hugged them. The orc guards burst out laughing.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Crockta has been doing great things!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It was great to hear.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow embarrassing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta remembered when he first came here.\u00a0</span><span>At that time, he really hadn\u2019t known anything. He thought they were just well-formed NPCs.\u00a0</span><span>But that wasn't it.\u00a0</span><span>The orcs and the orcs of Orcrox lived in the world of Elder Lord, as well as all the warriors who died that day.</span></p><br/><p><span>Grom, Kim Hyunchul who was now in jail, Lenox, Gulda and all the orcs he met crossed his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAnyway, I am glad to see you again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The guards laughed with their arms around Crockta\u2019s shoulder. Then they looked at Zankus.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf it isn\u2019t Zankus.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt has been a while.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There were no orcs who didn\u2019t know Zankus, the hunter who penetrated the sun.\u00a0</span><span>The guards bumped fists with Zankus.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You are unchanged.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Zankus explained to Crockta\u2019s group.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThese guards have been protecting this place longer than Lenox. They were standing here when I first arrived.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Really?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>They were very old veterans.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta introduced Tiyo and Anor.\u00a0</span><span>\"They are my colleagues.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019ve heard the story. Very brave friends.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Huhu, my reputation has spread</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo was several times smaller than an orc, but he was the epitome of a man.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo imitated the orcs with the fist bumps, before entering Orcrox.\u00a0</span><span>There was a stir in Orcrox as soon as Crockta\u2019s group appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span>Orcs passing by discovered them and opened their mouths, \u201cCrockta and Zankus are together!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is an honor to meet you. I am alive!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Welcome back!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta first came to Orcrox as a stupid newcomer.\u00a0</span><span>Now he became a great warrior who people respected.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It feels like home.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta headed towards the training ground where Hoyt was.\u00a0</span><span>As he came closer, he could hear the orcs.\u00a0</span><span>He remembered the old days when he ran around the training ground under Lenox\u2019s command.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cFirst hit! First one! Focus every time you swing! Wield it like it is your life!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUwaaaaah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Is that lousy swing the best you can do? Is it? Burochwi!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Nooooooooo!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen swing again! Don\u2019t be afraid to die!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2019tarrrrrrrrrr\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a familiar voice.\u00a0</span><span>Hoyt, who was standing in the middle of the training grounds, shouted like Lenox. \u00a0</span><span>Crockta breathed in deeply and shouted.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAre you alive, Hoyt?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Everyone stopped for a moment as Crockta\u2019s group appeared at the camp.\u00a0</span><span>Orcs were sparring, swinging their weapons in the air and building strength through push-ups.</span></p><br/><p><span>Hoyt, Orcrox\u2019s instructor, just laughed.\u00a0</span><span>\"You came back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was Hoyt.\u00a0</span><span>It was the first time since the battle where Lenox died.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou are alive. Bul\u2019tar!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2019tar!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Hoyt bumped fists and embraced each other.\u00a0</span><span>It was a meeting of two great warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs that Crockta?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Just like the rumors, he has a fierce face and a menacing greatsword.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Even orcs felt fear at his appearance!\u00a0</span><span>In addition, his representative greatsword was much bigger than the rumors. The orcs nodded at the sight of Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIndeed, the warrior who fought the north and the empire.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>After Crockta finished his greeting with Hoyt, Zankus also extended his fist. They were familiar with each other.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Stop running around and stop by Orcrox often.\u201d Hoyt scolded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kulkul, a hunter doesn\u2019t settle down.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then it was Tiyo and Anor\u2019s turn. Hoyt welcomed Crockta\u2019s companions.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Magic Bullets Berserker\u2019 Tiyo and \u2018Death's Ruler\u2019 Anor were already famous as Crockta\u2019s companion.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We haven\u2019t met in a long time, so let\u2019s have a drink...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGood. Let\u2019s go quickly!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"But I don\u2019t want these guys to relax.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Hoyt looked around. This was the orc\u2019s training ground.\u00a0</span><span>A place where men were created. He was no less harsh than Lenox.\u00a0</span><span>Hoyt scanned the area like he was uncomfortable.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta went forward,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cLeave it to me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I was once one of them, so I know their minds very well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>All orcs focused on him as Crockta placed the greatsword on his shoulder.\u00a0</span><span>He was \u2018Northern Conqueror\u2019 and \u2018Empire\u2019s Deficit\u2019 Crockta. He was already a legend. Countless orcs who wanted to be like him flocked to this area.\u00a0</span><span>In addition, it wasn\u2019t just the orcs here.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat Crockta...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAwesome...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There were many users who became orcs because of Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Ever since the legendary broadcast of Crockta\u2019s fight against the empire, the influx of orc users greatly increased. Those who selected the warrior class were present on the training ground.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s fans willingly came to the training ground where no one wanted to train before.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta threw away their expectations.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Your eyes are cloudy!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta yelled loudly. The sudden rant made everyone\u2019s eyes go blank.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The eyes of the weak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grinned as he looked over at Hoyt.\u00a0</span><span>There was a time when he wielded the sword like these people.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta looked at every one of them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Can you be a warrior with such weak eyes? It is better to pull such rotten eyes out!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The orcs in training looked at Crockta with a face filled with complaints. Their pride as an orc was hit.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Is there a problem? Then let\u2019s make a bet! If you win the bet, there will be no more training for today! You can go to the pub for a beer and Instructor Hoyt will forgive you!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta shouted.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>The orcs were shaken.\u00a0</span><span>It was an opportunity to take a day off from harsh training and drink a cold beer.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBut! If you lose, you will have to sleep here. Train until the sun rises tomorrow!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cL-Late night training?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUgh..!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A harsh bet!</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then what is the bet?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grinned.\u00a0</span><span>He placed the greatsword on the ground. Crockta raised a hand towards the orcs and gestured.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Come at me all at once. Do whatever it takes. You will win if I fall to the ground once.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>In the end, it was a fight.\u00a0</span><span>The orcs looked at each other.\u00a0</span><span>They could win based on numbers, but the opponent was Crockta. There was no chance of winning, even with so many people.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou can\u2019t do it? All of you are cowards!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am standing alone without a weapon! Look at you now!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta moved forward and pointed to the nearest orc.\u00a0</span><span>\"Carrying a blade! Carrying an axe! You are acting like this despite holding a hammer! You aren\u2019t orcs. Humans! Elves! Not even dwarves!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDon\u2019t insult us!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Insult? Do you feel insulted?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta grinned.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThen come.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The nearest orc snorted. His axe shook before he aimed at Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>As expected from someone who trained under Hoyt, it was a great blow despite him being an apprentice.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2019tarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>However, the opponent was Crockta. The axe didn\u2019t reach him. Instead, Crockta\u2019s fist hit his abdomen.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKeheok!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>This was just the beginning.\u00a0</span><span>All the orcs on the training ground ran towards Crockta. A huge cloud of dust rose up as a massive number of orcs ran towards one person, concealing their appearance.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is hot.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Hoyt muttered as he watched the scene.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hehet, I remember when I fought 17 people in Quantes </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis is more like 40-50 than 17...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There were punching and moaning sounds from all over the place.\u00a0</span><span>Orcs flew through the air.\u00a0</span><span>Then after some time had passed, Crockta stood alone.\u00a0</span><span>He raised his fist and declared, \"You are lacking. Very lacking. Insufficient!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>But there were no longer any orcs who could challenge him.\u00a0</span><span>They moaned while clutching their wounds in pain.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs it hard? Painful? Nobody cares! Train! Get up and swing your weapon!\"\u00a0</span><span>Crockta kicked the orcs to hurry them up off the ground. The orcs rose to their feet after Crockta\u2019s kicks.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cStand up!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Keok, so painful...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTraining is practical! Will you stop fighting due to pain when going against enemies on the battlefield! Rise! Everything is hard! Nobody cares!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUgh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I will go to drink a cold beer with Instructor Hoyt. You keep training! Kuhahahahat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The orcs trembled at Crockta\u2019s vicious appearance.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis is the real Northern Conqueror!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019m glad that Hoyt is the instructor...\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus shook his head and said, \"If that guy were the instructor, he would be an unparalleled demonic teacher compared to Lenox and Hoyt.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That's right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta finished arranging the training grounds and returned to Hoyt with an innocent expression.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Now it is resolved. Kulkulkul!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anyway, thanks to Crockta\u2019s work, Hoyt could leave his position with a relaxed mind.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta suddenly stopped before he was about to leave the training ground. There was a stick in a corner of the training ground.</span></p><br/><p><span>All orcs knew what it was.\u00a0</span><span>The stick where Lenox\u2019s helmet had been. After he died, the steel helmet had always been watching the training ground.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hoyt. I should put the helmet back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo. You should continue to use it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Immediately before the battle against the empire, he had received Lenox\u2019s helmet from Simba and Kumarak.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta had continued carrying Lenox\u2019s helmet.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There is more work to do in the future.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>The military expedition was on the verge of arriving. \u00a0</span><span>At that time, Lenox\u2019s helmet would cover Crockta\u2019s head again.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhere is Kumarak?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He went out for a walk with Simba, and they will be back soon. Not just that, Anya, Wallachwi and other promising orcs have come.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPromising orcs?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus said with a smile,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI\u2019ve met them. They will be your competitors. They are still immature, but I am looking forward to them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The orcs like Zankus had already built their achievements and became legendary, but there would be a new generation like Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Tiyo and Anor, you are their targets as well, so be ready.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor jolted with surprise.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cM-Me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There are high-level shooters and necromancers who want to prove they are better than you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo burst out laughing. \"</span><span>Stupid bastards</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>! They won\u2019t be able to think such a cheeky thing after they taste General</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>! I want to see it!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kulkul, you are a very spirited gnome friend.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They chatted while entering the pub.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s eyes became distant.\u00a0</span><span>This was the place where he met Gulda and asked for advice about how to become qualified to be a warrior.\u00a0</span><span>The cheerful warrior Gulda who laughed and talked a lot.\u00a0</span><span>Even when he was about to die in the dungeon, he didn\u2019t lose his sense of humor as he laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kuhalhalhalhalhal!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, Crockta heard familiar laughter.\u00a0</span><span>He doubted his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>There was an orc warrior resembling Gulda, who had the same laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat is Gurokchwi, Gulda\u2019s son.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Gulda\u2019s son...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grinned.\u00a0</span><span>His appearance seemed to awaken Crockta. \u00a0</span><span>He was an orc warrior. Orc warriors didn\u2019t look at the past. He would enjoy this moment, like Gulda\u2019s son.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Drink!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They started drinking beer with the orcs.\u00a0</span><span>Others soon appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat? The Crockta from that time has become so big? You\u2019ve become a pretty big guy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Everybody is gathered! Drinking beer without me! Drink!

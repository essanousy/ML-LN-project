What are you doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man glanced at them before swinging his sword again.\u00a0</span><span>They tried to resist, but it was useless.\u00a0</span><span>The man\u2019s sword moved a few times, causing blood to fall to the ground.\u00a0</span><span>The users became grim as people were sliced to death.</span></p><br/><p><span>The users in the back tried to run away, but the man caught them quickly and stabbed them in the back.\u00a0</span><span>Users died one by one, and the crowd that gathered to watch the war were all bleeding on the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span>The man looked at the scene with emotionless eyes.\u00a0</span><span>Gradually, the users\u2019 bodies turned into white particles.\u00a0</span><span>It was a beautiful sight, as if it was snowing.\u00a0</span><span>The man looked at it and closed his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>[00:08]</span></p><br/><p><span>[00:07]</span></p><br/><p><span>[00:06]</span></p><br/><p><span>He muttered, \u201cIn the end, it is like this...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he opened his arms.</span></p><br/><p><span>[00:03]</span></p><br/><p><span>[00:02]</span></p><br/><p><span>[00:01]</span></p><br/><p><span>[00:00]</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hey, fix your positions!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBoss!

The timer was probably a vaccine to take care of the problem!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Understood!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The users were fighting with a group of goblins.\u00a0</span><span>They were a small clan and were in the process of defeating the goblins for a quest. They struggled due to the large number of goblins, but they effectively dealt with the enemies.</span></p><br/><p><span>The warrior classes rushed towards the goblins with their shields. After blocking the attack of the goblins, they stabbed with their spears and swords. The magician classes supported them from behind.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGood! Keep going...keheok!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>However, the goblins were tough.\u00a0</span><span>There was a goblin shaman among them. A fireball burst out and the warriors were caught in an explosion.\u00a0</span><span>The goblins rushed to strike with their weapons.\u00a0</span><span>The warriors bled out and died.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou guys...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The clan master in charge of the fight was enraged and rushed with the elite users. The goblins were frightened by the charge and started to retreat.\u00a0</span><span>The users didn\u2019t show any mercy to the goblins.\u00a0</span><span>Magic arrows pierced the backs of the retreating goblins. They screamed and collapsed. The warriors chased them to the end and killed them.</span></p><br/><p><span>The quest was successful.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Phew...it is over.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Everyone worked hard. The profit will be distributed when the dead members connect again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The clan gathered in one place.\u00a0</span><span>They confirmed their injuries. Some were killed by the goblin shaman, but most of them were unharmed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Everyone worked hard. There was a strange message so let\u2019s end it here. We don\u2019t want there to be any problems.

They smiled at each other and tried again several more times. However, they couldn\u2019t log out.</span></p><br/><p><span>The Elder Lord logout method was simple.</span></p><br/><p><span>When they thought about the logout button in the status window, the message, \u2018Do you want to log out?\u2019 would appear in the air. If they thought about logging out at that time, they would, usually, slowly return to the real world as the screen turned white.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, this time, the logout window didn\u2019t pop up.\u00a0</span><span>Everyone\u2019s face gradually stiffened.\u00a0</span><span>They were unable to terminate the connection to Elder Lord.\u00a0</span><span>Something was wrong.\u00a0</span><span>They wondered if there was a relationship to the message window.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Excuse me...Brother Culma.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That...isn\u2019t that a little...strange?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The clan master frowned and turned his head.\u00a0</span><span>A clan member was pointing with a speculative face.\u00a0</span><span>His gaze followed the direction of the hand.\u00a0</span><span>It was the dead clan members.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBrother.

So..uh...huh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The other clan members froze as they realized what he was saying.\u00a0</span><span>Users disappeared into white particles. Their connection was forcibly terminated, and they would be able to reconnect after a short delay.\u00a0</span><span>The \u2018aftereffects of death\u2019 lasted for a while, but there wasn\u2019t a big penalty.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, these bodies didn\u2019t disappear and remained in the world.\u00a0</span><span>It was like they really died.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...Hey, hey.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The clan master spoke in a loud voice,\u00a0</span><span>\"You saw it before.

However, they currently couldn\u2019t log out and the bodies seemed dead.\u00a0</span><span>The same was true for the goblin bodies.\u00a0</span><span>This was a game, but they really did seem dead.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...Hey, I feel bad. Let\u2019s get rid of them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The clan master said as he turned his gaze away.\u00a0</span><span>The clan members picked up the bodies and threw them into the bushes.</span></p><br/><p><span>During the quest, the timer was gone and four users were killed.\u00a0</span><span>They were the first victims.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Kim Chulmin, \u00a0the owner of an Elder Lord capsule room, detected abnormalities in the capsule management window.</span></p><br/><p><span>The Elder Lord capsules were driven by modern science.

Crockta\u2019s party stopped walking.\u00a0</span><span>At that moment, the party felt that this elf would leave soon.\u00a0</span><span>It was an unknown feeling.\u00a0</span><span>This would probably be the elf\u2019s final question.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What does this look like?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The elf raised his hand and a strange thing happened. The dense tree above them started to bow down.\u00a0</span><span>The branches of the trees slowly lowered towards them in a courteous gesture, like the trees were living creatures.\u00a0</span><span>The mouths of Crockta\u2019s group dropped open.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Crockta. What do you think of this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A sparrow on the branch moved onto the elf\u2019s finger.\u00a0</span><span>The trees and sparrow both moved for him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta looked at it.\u00a0</span><span>It was just a plain sparrow.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cA sparrow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right. A sparrow.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The elf raised his hand. The sparrow flew off. However, it didn\u2019t fly away and landed on the elf\u2019s shoulders.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cIt looks and sounds like a sparrow. Maybe it has a yellow beak. The important thing is that at least it isn\u2019t a crow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That's right. It certainly isn\u2019t a crow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen...\"\u00a0</span><span>The elf stared straight at Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>\"If everyone calls this bird a crow, what will you do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked confused because he didn\u2019t understand the question,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWhat does that mean...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This bird is clearly not a crow. It doesn\u2019t look like one. But everyone calls this bird a crow. Everyone in the world is saying so except for you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The sparrow once again landed on the elf\u2019s finger. The sparrow turned his head and gazed at Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>This elf didn\u2019t have a malicious mentality.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta could feel it. Otherwise, this little bird wouldn\u2019t be able to be in the elf\u2019s hands with a calm face.</span></p><br/><p><span>The elf continued speaking,\u00a0</span><span>\"The whole world except for you is calling it a crow. If you say this is a sparrow instead of a crow, everyone will turn away from you. Maybe they will tease you for being blind, or call you a liar. No matter how you shout, no one will listen. You will be labeled a maniac.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAhh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Crockta. Will you still call this bird a sparrow? Or will you turn away and say it is a crow?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta smiled.\u00a0</span><span>It was an easy question.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Well, if everyone is calling a sparrow a crow... It is a big deal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I see...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBut that is it.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta touched the handle of his greatsword.\u00a0</span><span>\"Unless a sparrow tells me that it is a crow, I will call a sparrow a sparrow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If people were to paint the feathers black and call a sparrow a crow, I will do my utmost to stop them and say that it is a sparrow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked at Tiyo, Anor and Zankus. They shrugged.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta smiled at the elf.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A sparrow is a sparrow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The elf shook his head,\u00a0</span><span>\"Then you will be alone. Nobody will want to be with you. Rather, you will become a strange being.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a soft voice.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta burst out laughing.\u00a0</span><span>His laugh rang through the silent forest.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You are a slave dressed like a king.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The elf\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0</span><span>No one had ever called him a slave. It was the opposite.\u00a0</span><span>He had a power that no one could understand, dressed in gorgeous clothing and was elegant.\u00a0</span><span>Now this orc had called him a slave.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You put on very nice clothes. But rather than your own beliefs, you think about the surroundings and other people. It is the mindset of a slave. If it is so scary, you can call the sparrow a crow-like everybody else. If they say something green is red, they are red. The night will become the day and the earth will be called the sea. If you give yourself up, everything will flow smoothly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"However, if you want to be the master of your own mind, pay attention to this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta reached out his hand. \u00a0</span><span>The sparrow stared at Crockta and jumped towards his fingers.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta gently cradled the sparrow.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Even if the world is pointing at me in ridicule, I will say that this bird is just a sparrow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The elf looked at Crockta, whose eyes were filled with conviction and an unshakable integrity.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The lines on the elf\u2019s face disappeared as his distressed face gradually softened. </span><span>He flashed a faint, yet beautiful smile.\u00a0</span><span>He declared, \"I dressed like a king but thought like a slave.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Now that I know, I should dress like a king and act like a king.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you for letting me know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The elf stared at Crockta. Then he looked at Zankus, Tiyo, and Anor.\u00a0</span><span>He spread open his arms.\u00a0</span><span>Then the forest changed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>A straight path to Orcrox opened up.\u00a0</span><span>The trees shook their bodies and twisted their roots, giving way to Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>It was an incredible sight.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Anor suddenly spoke. There was a look of realization on his face.\u00a0</span><span>The elf reached for Anor. Then a branch came down over their heads.\u00a0</span><span>As the elf moved his hand, the branch touched Anor\u2019s cheek, as if it was an extension of the elf\u2019s hand.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou\u2019ve had a hard time coming here. Child.\u201d The elf</span><span>\u00a0looked at each party member one by one.\u00a0</span><span>\"I saw you and tried to get an answer. An answer that I couldn\u2019t find. However, it wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t know the answer. In fact, I was ignoring the answer all along.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He looked at Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>\"Like a slave.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grinned.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cNow you seem like a king.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Thank you.\"\u00a0</span><span>The elf stepped back.\u00a0</span><span>It was time to leave.\u00a0</span><span>\"I came here as a slave dressed like a king, and will be leaving a king.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His body blurred.\u00a0</span><span>The vegetation of the forest leaned towards him.\u00a0</span><span>The wind bowed to him.\u00a0</span><span>The trees leaned down and worshipped him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I hope to see you again. The boy in the north wanted to say thank you. Crockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then the elf whispered.\u00a0</span><span>There was no sound.\u00a0</span><span>His whisper wasn\u2019t towards them.\u00a0</span><span>Anor\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta, Zankus, and Tiyo didn\u2019t hear it.\u00a0</span><span>All elves in the world heard the whisper.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The elves\u2019 world tree has withdrawn from the war.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t know why. The elves have started to leave.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Those who came of their own will are still left, but the elves who came because of the divine message are returning home. More than half the elves are gone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator frowned before starting to laugh.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cHow interesting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Aklan sighed.\u00a0</span><span>The elves heard the whisper of the world tree.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018The orcs aren\u2019t colluding with the grey god, and they aren\u2019t evil. Crockta is a hero.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>However, the other gods were different.\u00a0</span><span>Another divine message came down, encouraging the followers to believe them. They even blamed the world tree for poor judgment.\u00a0</span><span>This wasn\u2019t the behaviour of the gods he knew.\u00a0</span><span>It was remarkably like a human\u2019s behaviour.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Arnin won't turn out well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I guess so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They reached the city of elves, Arnin.\u00a0</span><span>After receiving this news, Arnin was unlikely to give support.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Try it once.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>But the result was as they expected.\u00a0</span><span>No, it was worse than that.</span></p><br/><p><span>Aklan sat in Mayor Ennis\u2019 office and felt a strange mood again.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDo you see this vest?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"An orc used to wear it, also known as the first captain of the Plains Rescue Team, which is a landmark and the pride of Arnin. He created the rescue team.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There was no need to ask who he was.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCrockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That's right. He because an honorary citizen of Arnin and revealed the killers and mayor who used a false mask to mock the citizens.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s story was told in the textbooks at Arnin\u2019s schools.\u00a0</span><span>He was an honorary citizen who represents Arnin.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAbove all, the world tree is stopping the elves from participating.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It will be useless to propose the agenda to Congress.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI understand. Thank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Eggs might be thrown at them, like Chesswood.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don\u2019t know how the situation with the gods turned out like this, but I will tell you as a person who met Crockta, not the mayor. Crockta isn\u2019t such an orc.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I didn't even know who he was then. He was just a plains officer. However, he helped the humans and elves with the triters on the plains. Despite being an orc, he is a light in the darkness.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLight...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He illuminates the surroundings. I wouldn\u2019t be the mayor if it wasn\u2019t for him. The travelers would still be losing their lives. They would die from the triters and that wicked girl.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Aklan nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You can stay for a day to recruit volunteers. But please think about what I said.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He left without any results.\u00a0</span><span>Arnin was a beautiful city. Aklan was heading to the expedition\u2019s camp when he suddenly stopped at Arnin\u2019s square.\u00a0</span><span>A monument stood there.\u00a0</span><span>It was a monument to honor the day when Elsanad, Elwina and Ilya, the demons of Arnin, were expelled.\u00a0</span><span>It wrote about the honorary citizen Crockta, who came as a traveler but left as Arnin\u2019s hero.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am an honorary citizen!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am the best citizen!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You just threw trash on the floor! I will accuse you!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Children played around, pretending to be honorary citizens.\u00a0</span><span>Aklan stared up at the sky and muttered,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI don't know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He shook his head and returned to the expedition\u2019s camp.\u00a0</span><span>The expedition was camping outside Arnin.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere was no result. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt was expected.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Thanks for the hard work.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>He came back with nothing, but Adandator and the expedition leaders nodded because it was already expected.\u00a0</span><span>Now they didn\u2019t have any great expectations towards the elves. Some elves volunteered but there weren\u2019t many due to the world tree.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"How about stopping by Quantes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGnomes don\u2019t believe in the gods...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Let's just give it a try. Anyway, the elves are gone so we need to fill up the numbers. Quantes is on the way to Orcrox.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOkay.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Aklan was silent during the meeting of leaders.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>The next day, they headed towards Quantes.\u00a0</span><span>Shortly before leaving Arnin, they could see the famous Arnin Plains Rescue Team and the triters.</span></p><br/><p><span>In the midst of it was a rock.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Aklan stopped.\u00a0</span><span>Letters were carved onto the rock.</span></p><br/><p><span>[A warrior doesn\u2019t attack unarmed people.]</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a rock written by Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Aklan never met him before, but he couldn\u2019t help feeling familiar with Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>He knew that Crockta was a great warrior.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat are you doing? Let\u2019s go quickly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>People shouted from behind Aklan.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Aklan held the reins.\u00a0</span><span>The march continued.\u00a0</span><span>Aklan turned and squinted at the rock, but he could no longer see it due to the army.\u00a0</span><span>Aklan looked at Adandator beside him. He saw the leaders, nobles and numerous expedition forces.\u00a0</span><span>Their faces was stiff. It might be because Orcrox was getting closer.</span></p><br/><p><span>Aklan closed his eyes. He couldn\u2019t stop here. They had already come so far.\u00a0</span><span>It didn\u2019t matter what type of person Crockta was anymore.\u00a0</span><span>All the gods called him a villain. It was enough. The people had gathered here for the extermination of Crockta and the orcs. They were overflowing with willpower.</span></p><br/><p><span>The decision wasn\u2019t made by him, but the enormous crowd.\u00a0</span><span>He erased Maillard, Chesswood and Arnin from his head. The vacancy was filled with the divine message, expedition army and the hatred of the random crowd.</span></p><br/><p><span>Aklan opened his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>It was a short moment of worry.\u00a0</span><span>He returned to being Aklan, a pious warrior of the war god.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018War God... Please bless our way.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>The horses, who started running the race, couldn\u2019t stop.</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><br/><p>I have also updated my\u00a0Patreon\u00a0to reflect my new novels.

Isn't that right?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Robina\u2019s arrow flew past his cheek.\u00a0</span><span>Edgar touched his cheek and took a step back as his past memories resurfaced.</span></p><br/><p><span>Misfortune came without warning.\u00a0</span><span>The students he taught were forced to leave the squad because of violence. Edgar had no backing so all of the responsibility was placed on him.\u00a0</span><span>He hadn\u2019t succeeded as a player, and his dream of becoming a world-class manager was canceled. To make matters worse, the business of his parents failed and his immediate livelihood was at risk.</span></p><br/><p><span>He didn\u2019t have time to play the game. He had to face reality.\u00a0</span><span>He started work as a laborer. He also reduced the amount of time he met Robina in the game and in reality.</span></p><br/><p><span>He tried not to but he became more sensitive.\u00a0</span><span>Edgar started to gradually lose himself.\u00a0</span><span>He was conscious of his shabby self as well as Robina who could fly away like a free-spirited bird at any time. He tried to ignore the cracks but the struggle cut at Edgar\u2019s heart.</span></p><br/><p><span>As his lover, she quickly noticed the changes in Edgar.\u00a0</span><span>His anxiety, his longing for her affection, and his occasional lack of confidence weren\u2019t part of the man that she once loved.\u00a0</span><span>That's why Edgar confessed everything.\u00a0</span><span>He talked about losing everything and the economic threat in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span>Once the story ended, Robina replied.\u00a0</span><span>\"What, you became like this because of money?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>She was born in a rich house so she couldn\u2019t understand Edgar\u2019s desperation.\u00a0</span><span>\"Well, it is like this. It doesn't really matter anymore. We\u2019re finished now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The words stabbed his heart.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don\u2019t love Oppa anymore.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>If she had shown him the same smile and comforted him, he would\u2019ve been able to stand up again for a short while.\u00a0</span><span>No, if she hadn\u2019t broken up with him, she would\u2019ve been a reason for him to fight reality.</span></p><br/><p><span>But there was no such thing.\u00a0</span><span>Edgar collapsed. The one who gave him a chance was the Heaven and Earth Clan.\u00a0</span><span>The Heaven and Earth Clan looked at Edgar, who was active in the Rehabilitation Brothers, and suggested he join them.</span></p><br/><p><span>Heaven and Earth was a large clan. The clan as a whole relied on economic logic.\u00a0</span><span>Heaven and Earth Clan members were paid and those in executive positions would be able to earn far more than before.\u00a0</span><span>So he joined the Heaven and Earth Clan. \u00a0Thanks to his excellent performance, he was promoted to head of the Maillard branch.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"At that time, I tried to die but I didn\u2019t die.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Edgar muttered as he jumped forward. Robina stepped back quickly.\u00a0</span><span>But he had no intention of a one-on-one fight with her. He turned right away and headed towards a member of the Rehabilitation Brothers.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I didn\u2019t die and the pain made me stronger.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He was Edgard, Maillard\u2019s Heaven and Earth leader.\u00a0</span><span>The confused Robina fired an arrow, but the shield warriors were already blocking her arrows. They persisted pursued Robina.\u00a0</span><span>They had already heard all about her strength from Edgar, and used specialist techniques against her.</span></p><br/><p><span>Once Robina was blocked, the rest was easy. When looking objectively, the Heaven and Earth members were far superior.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t kill as many as possible!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Edgar shouted, \"Use the Concrete method!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The Concrete method, the act of imprisonment that users feared the most in Elder Lord, was declared.\u00a0</span><span>While originally prohibited for users, it was occasionally done in warfare between opposing clans.</span></p><br/><p><span>People protested to Elder Saga Corporation but their answer was the same as always: User freedom!</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hah, you\u2019re going to use the Concrete method against us? Are you insane?\u201d Robina shouted.</span></p><br/><p><span>Edgar didn\u2019t care.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We are the Heaven and Earth Clan!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The Heaven and Earth members shouted. The Rehabilitation Brothers started to be pushed. The Heaven and Earth members were strong because they didn\u2019t act individually. It was a virtue that Edgar taught them.</span></p><br/><p><span>Now the members of the Rehabilitation Brothers were captured one by one.\u00a0</span><span>The battle seemed like it would end with the Heaven and Earth Clan\u2019s victory.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I will rise up.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>He would toss of the illusion of the old lover haunting him and rise to a place much higher than Robina.\u00a0</span><span>He would succeed through Elder Lord.\u00a0</span><span>If he kept rising in the Heaven and Earth Clan, he would someday become a ranker.</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, a voice could be heard in the distance, \"I guess I should come out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a somewhat familiar voice.</span></p><br/><p><span>Edgar turned his head.\u00a0</span><span>A huge orc was hiding awkwardly behind a rock. Next to him were two figures, a small gnome and a dark elf, who were watching the fight.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta and two unidentified people.</span></p><br/><p><span>As Edgar made eye contact, the dark elf dropped the fried corn he was eating.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUwah, our eyes met...cough!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta whispered to the dark elf.\u00a0</span><span>\"Raise your head proudly as Crockta\u2019s friend.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta glanced at Tiyo. Tiyo was already a proud person, so his neck was automatically stiff.\u00a0</span><span>How wonderful. It was enough if they stood shoulder to shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta nodded and raised his body.\u00a0</span><span>It was the appearance of the superstar orc, who drove people to join an orc fan club.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAre you Crockta?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Indeed...really manly...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The Heaven and Earth members stopped moving. The faces of the Rehabilitation Brothers being tied up by them brightened.\u00a0</span><span>The story that Crockta rehabilitation the three founders of the Rehabilitation Brothers had been passed down like a legend.</span></p><br/><p><span>He hadn\u2019t been seen since leaving the north, but now he showed up in Maillard.\u00a0</span><span>He was truly like the rumors.</span></p><br/><p><span>A red headband that seemed to represent his strong will.\u00a0</span><span>Wild eyes and a large body covered in tattoos.\u00a0</span><span>In addition, the greatsword that was almost too big to be a sword, Ogre Slayer!\u00a0</span><span>The appearance of an orc warrior who would make people shrink back just looking at him.</span></p><br/><p><span>This was the founder of the Rehabilitation Brothers.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I really get to meet him...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Get ready to be hit by Crockta!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The atmosphere reversed once Crockta placed Ogre Slayer on his shoulders.\u00a0</span><span>The same was true for the Heaven and Earth members. They only saw Crockta in captivity, so they never faced him with his full pressure unleashed.</span></p><br/><p><span>Now overwhelming pressure was pouring out from him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat...Crockta...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>But Edgar didn\u2019t back down. He took one step forward and said, \"You were once whining behind the steel bars, but act so brave now that you are outside.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Edgar mocked him in order to diminish Crockta\u2019s influence. \u00a0</span><span>\"I will let you know the truth of this world, along with your rehabilitation friends. The Heaven and Earth Clan is unbeatable.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grinned.\u00a0</span><span>He was an enemy, but Crockta liked this type of man.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was focused on him but Edgar desperately endured the pressure. An average person legs would\u2019ve already collapsed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEdgar,\u201d Crockta called out to him in a soft voice.\u00a0</span><span>\"You told me over a drink. A leader is a \u2018castle\u2019.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Edgar's eyes trembled.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was convinced. Edgar remembered what happened when he went on the drinking binge with Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I remember all the words you said when drunk. At that time, we were friends. So I am warning you in advance.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta raised his greatsword.\u00a0</span><span>It was a big sword.\u00a0</span><span>The amount of blood that had covered it would be enough to make a sea.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe Heaven and Earth Clan will soon perish.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>It was close to a declaration of war.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I will get rid of it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta remembered many of the ruins he saw on the broadcasted videos. The Heaven and Earth Clan.\u00a0</span><span>They spread war and famine in Elder Lord. They were multiplying the pain in this room without knowing what they were doing.</span></p><br/><p><span>Edgar shook his head.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYou alone? Don\u2019t make me laugh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At his signal, the Heaven and Earth members surrounded Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>The members of the Rehabilitation Brothers couldn\u2019t fight anymore so they just watched the confrontation.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You should discover yourself if it is funny or not.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta raised his greatsword.\u00a0</span><span>His opponents had moderately large numbers.\u00a0</span><span>But he was the warrior who slaughtered a large army in the north. In addition, he had reached the Hero realm beyond the Pinnacle.\u00a0</span><span>This much...</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Heaven and Earth!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was laughable.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"War!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The Heaven and Earth members rushed forward while shouting.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta stood still and faced their assault.\u00a0</span><span>They weren\u2019t a group of ragtag fighters. They were well trained soldiers in a formation that suited individuals as well as group roles.\u00a0</span><span>Indeed, it was understandable why the Rehabilitation Brothers had suffered one-sidedly.\u00a0</span><span>There weren\u2019t many groups of users with such skills.</span></p><br/><p><span>He saw Edgar heading towards him in the lead.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018All I needed when I fell into hell was for her to hold my hand.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>His drunk face was overlaid on top.</span></p><br/><p><span>'But she kicked me out. I was too weak. It doesn\u2019t matter. I will no longer care.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>He swung his sword.\u00a0</span><span>The woman called Robina didn\u2019t know how valuable she had been to Edgar. There was no need to know.\u00a0</span><span>The past didn\u2019t matter, only the fact that swords were pointed towards Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>In any case, Edgar was a man desperately living in the present.</span></p><br/><p><span>In order to rise to the top!</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Great momentum!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta shouted.\u00a0</span><span>He didn\u2019t know why this guy was struggling against the world, but he liked it nevertheless.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBut it is still lacking! Bul\u2019tarrrrrrrrrrrrrr!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta shouted and ran forward.</span></p><br/><p><span>There were dozens of materials.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was like a chariot as he wielded his greatsword.\u00a0</span><span>No one could stop him. Every time he waved his sword, users would be torn apart as their blood scattered every which way and as their bodies turned into white particles.</span></p><br/><p><span>He looked beautiful.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis... is Crockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The members of the Rehabilitation Brothers watched him blankly.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was surrounded by numerous enemies. Every time he wielded his greatsword, blood poured out and white particles filled the air.</span></p><br/><p><span>Red and white scattered in every direction around him.</span></p><br/><p><span>They started thinking.\u00a0</span><span>He really might end the Heaven and Earth Clan with his own hands.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\"How is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Now Crockta and Edgar were the only ones left.\u00a0</span><span>The rest had turned into white particles.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Edgar couldn't say anything.\u00a0</span><span>Now matter how great the NPC was, he hadn\u2019t expected them to be so overwhelmed.\u00a0</span><span>There wasn\u2019t a drop of blood flowing from Crockta\u2019s body. He was fine, while Edgar\u2019s companions had been turned into white particles.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"...I admit defeat.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Edgar sighed.</span></p><br/><p><span>The end.\u00a0</span><span>After this, he would be demoted. Gaining another opportunity wouldn\u2019t be easy.\u00a0</span><span>He wanted to execute Crockta, but everything was ruined by the dumb guard Lee Jungmin. No, maybe they couldn\u2019t afford to go against Crockta in the first place.</span></p><br/><p><span>No.</span></p><br/><p><span>Edgar had a hunch.\u00a0</span><span>The \u00a0Heaven and Earth would disappear in the near future.\u00a0</span><span>He watched Crockta and couldn\u2019t think of a way to stop this orc.\u00a0</span><span>Would the top rankers and Choi Hansung of the Heaven and Earth Clan be able to stop this person?</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It was in vain.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Edgar had barely grabbed the rope to climb up, only for it to be cut.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta called out to him, \u201cEdgar. I declared that I will destroy the Heaven and Earth Clan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then what will you do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>He looked at Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>If this man really took down the Heaven and Earth Clan, the world of Elder Lord would be upset.\u00a0</span><span>No one thought that Crockta could eliminate the Heaven and Earth Clan alone, but he spoke like he knew the future.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grinned.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cEdgar. On that day, you said that you\u2019d treat me as a brother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI just...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"My brother.\"\u00a0</span><span>Crockta came closer and whispered in his ears, \"I will never turn away when you fall.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I will reach out to you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Edgar's eyes trembled.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta had listened when Edgar said what he wanted.\u00a0</span><span>Someone who would stand with him even if he fell into hell.\u00a0</span><span>He wanted to hear that the person wouldn\u2019t turn away. If someone had said that to him, it wouldn\u2019t have been so painful.If someone had just held his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he wouldn\u2019t have accepted the Heaven and Earth Clan\u2019s proposal.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If I had met you sooner...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Edgar closed his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>He didn\u2019t regret it then, but he was regretting it now.</span></p><br/><p><span>Edgar said to Crockta, \u201cCrockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, Edgar pierced his own neck with his sword.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Suicide.\u00a0</span><span>Blood flowed down his neck and he soon turned into a flurry of white particles.\u00a0</span><span>Edgar muttered something towards Crockta just before the connection was terminated.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta watched carefully.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt was a great victory Crockta</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo said from behind him. But Crockta didn\u2019t move.</span></p><br/><p><span>He thought about Edgar\u2019s last words.\u00a0</span><span>Edgar had spoken without any sound.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Beware the Heaven and Earth Clan, Brother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><br/><p>I have also updated my\u00a0Patreon\u00a0to reflect my new novels.

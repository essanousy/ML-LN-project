Zhang Yang smiled secretly and thought in his heart, looks like this future icon of a tank has already started to feel indebted to Lone Desert Smoke. As long as they do more raids together, then Zhang Yang would not need to doubt Endless Starlight\u2019s loyalty to Lone Desert Smoke.</p><br/><p>Wei Yan Er was preoccupied with digging about for further loots since the first item was already distributed. She kept an eye out for the valuable white gleam. Green-Copper items have longed been ignored by her.</p><br/><p>[Feather Skirt] (Gray-Silver, Cloth Armor)</p><br/><p>Defense: +4</p><br/><p>Vitality: +96</p><br/><p>Intelligence: +48</p><br/><p>Spirit: +16</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 40</p><br/><p>Han Ying Xue smiled and said, \u201cGive this to Daffodil Daydream first, I\u2019m wearing a full set of equipment and I do not want to ruin the set equipment effect just yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>She gave up her roll, so Daffodil Daydream embarrassingly received the skirt and equipped it.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang said: \u201cIn fact, Level 30 Gray-Silver equipment cannot replace set equipment, but 3 pieces of Level 40 Gray-Silver equipment can replace the 5-piece set equipment\u2019s 10% damage increment! Most importantly, Level 20 equipment simply gives too little HP, and to clear future Hardcore Mode Castle dungeons, your HP needs to be up to at least 5,000!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c5,000\u2026\u201d Fatty Han rolled both of his eyes and said, \u201cMy HP is only 4,300!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to keep one set of equipment from the Garden? Have you sold it already?\u201d Zhang Yang glanced at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it is still in the Bank!\u201d Fatty Han laughed as he replied.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang let out a sigh of relief after hearing Fatty Han\u2019s reply. After clearing here, they would need to explore the dungeon of the Castle. Everyone was strictly required at least 5,000 HP to fight the fourth boss. If any single person did not make it, the party would be annihilated!</p><br/><p>[Skill Book: Beast Rage]</p><br/><p>Use: Grants the skill </p><br/><p>Class Requirement: Hunter</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 30</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang could help but laugh in joy and said, \u201cFatty and Hundred Shots, this skill is really good! It can increase the damage dealt by your pet temporarily like Shimalue Gutan\u2019s pets just now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hundred Shots said: \u201cFatty, let\u2019s roll the dice!\u201d</p><br/><p>Both of them rolled the dice and Fatty Han obtained the skill book.</p><br/><p>: Increases the damage dealt by your pet by 50%. Last for 15 seconds. Cool time down: 2 minutes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis skill is really useful for Beastmaster!\u201d Hundred Shots could not help but exclaim when he saw the skill description posted by Fatty Han.</p><br/><p>Fatty Han said delightedly, \u201cWith this skill, my damage output going to increase once again! Who else in the world could defeat me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Shing\u2019, Sun Xing Yu pulled out both of her daggers, the sound crystal clear in the silent atmosphere, and she glanced at Fatty Han coldly.</p><br/><p>Fatty Han could not help but feel intimidated, he trembled in fear of this lady.</p><br/><p>The gang was not interested in the remaining eight Green-Copper items so they just simply threw it into their inventories and continued moving forward.</p><br/><p>They arrived at the fourth level after clearing a few skeletal tiger and skeletal wolf monsters at another long stone stairway.</p><br/><p>It was empty within the resplendent palace, except for the huge pillars, which needed to be held up together by three men, set up a distance from each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo monsters?\u201d Daffodil Daydream could not help but feel delighted.</p><br/><p>It was already 11 P.M. at night. The gang was thought of having a look at the fourth level before logging off and retiring for the night before continuing with the following two levels tomorrow. But if there were no monsters, they could fight the boss directly which would save up a lot of time!</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang and Sun Xing Yu yelled at the same time.</p><br/><p>Han Ying Xue could not help but laughed and said: \u201cBoth of you really have an unspoken bond!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike husband like wife!\u201d Wei Yan Er also laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck\u201d Zhang Yang rolled his eyes at that two gloating ladies and said, \u201cIt might be stealth monster! Starlight, you\u2019ll have to take one for the team, go in front!\u201d</p><br/><p>Endless Starlight looked as if he was about to cry, and plaintively said, \u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense, you have a solid defense!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you go in front?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to pull the monsters!\u201d</p><br/><p>Poor Endless Starlight, who was sold to the monster by the gang, held on his shield and walked in front. After he walked for seven to eight steps, he stopped suddenly and rotating stars appeared above his head which represented a status.</p><br/><p>A person in black appeared from the back of Endless Starlight and he raised his two swords and stabbed Endless Starlight\u2019s back, each stab took about 1,000 of Endless Starlight HP.</p><br/><p>[Shadow Assassin] (Elite, Spectre)</p><br/><p>Level: 46</p><br/><p>HP: 92,000</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, it was not a centaur but an elf\u2026 a dead one.</p><br/><p>Endless Starlight was about 8 meters away from the gang, which was also the range of so Zhang Yang immediately rushed towards him with .</p><br/><p>\u2018-752!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-1554!\u2019</p><br/><p>After Shadow Assassin recovered from being stunned, Shadow Assassin immediately changed his target and attacked Zhang Yang with his two gleaming swords.</p><br/><p>\u2018!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-212!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-80!\u2019</p><br/><p>Due to the monster having double physical attacks, even if Zhang Yang used , he still received an attack. But this attack was caused by off-hand weapon which also inflicted 80 points of poison damage.</p><br/><p>In \u2018God\u2019s Miracle\u2019, off-hand attacks are reduced by 50% and its damage was much lesser compared to one handed attacks. In general, weapons with long attack intervals would be equipped in one hand slot to increase damage of single hit skills. While weapons with shorter attack intervals would be equipped in off-hand slots, in order to trigger some passive skills or poison effects.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is there an elf in centaur\u2019s palace? Could it be\u2026\u201d Daffodil Daydream was psyched. Daffodil Daydream was a \u201cFujoshi\u201d, and she started to fantasize about a boys\u2019 love scenario.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find all manner of evil sorcerers in this dungeon, it won\u2019t be surprising to have a few elf thieves!\u201d Zhang Yang laughed and said.</p><br/><p>Daffodil Daydream was disappointed, she pursed her lip and stopped talking.</p><br/><p>With the strong ability of team\u2019s damage dealing, this Shadow Assassin could only live for 10 seconds and died, dropping a few pieces of clothes and a Black-Steel item.</p><br/><p>Poor Endless Starlight continued walking in front of the gang, acting as bait to attract the attacks of stealth monsters and reveal themselves.</p><br/><p>This level was full of thief type monsters with stealth abilities. Theses undead were members of several races such as humans, beasts, dwarves, elf and even goblins and trolls! The team moved on for a while before Zhang Yang announced that today\u2019s activity would end here and that they would continue tomorrow.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang logged on the game the next morning, and Yan Wei Er showed up in the team as expected.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed and said, \u201cLittle brat, were you planning to apply for leave continuously until we done with this main quest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn!\u201d Yan Wei Er nodded her head determinedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t the kids nowadays wish to go the school and play with their friends?\u201d Zhang Yang thought that it was odd. When he was studying, he also wished for holidays but after a long holiday, he would also wish to go back to the school, as it was more lively and fun!</p><br/><p>Yan Wei Er pursed her lip with a disdainful expression and said, \u201cWhat is fun in playing with those childish little brats?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang was suddenly taken aback and looked at Han Ying Xue, he determined that Yan Wei Er had to have been influenced by this devilish woman.</p><br/><p>Han Ying Xue noticed Zhang Yang looking at her so she looked back Zhang Yang with her seductive eyes and said, \u201cSilly Yu, please just say so that you like me, don\u2019t steal glances at me like that, otherwise, you\u2019re going to develop a cross-eye!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Wei Er asked, \u201cSis, what is a cross-eye?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Ying Xue squinted, briefly crossing her eyes and made Yan Wei Er laugh out loudly.</p><br/><p>All members of the gang soon showed up and the gang continued moving forward.</p><br/><p>The higher the level, the lesser the monsters spawned. So the gang only used five hours to clear the fourth level. The first level took two days to clear, the second and third level which took more than a day each to clear. So, these five hours were considered a very short period!</p><br/><p>Halfway through the passage, Zhang Yang and Daffodil Daydream gained a level once again and both of them were now Level 41. The rest of the members were not far from achieving Level 42 as well.</p><br/><p>There were two bosses.</p><br/><p>[King Kinglose Turk] (Gray-Silver, Spectre)</p><br/><p>Level: 48</p><br/><p>HP: 960,000</p><br/><p>[Princess Annie Balrum] (Gray-Silver, Spectre)</p><br/><p>Level: 47</p><br/><p>HP: 940,000</p><br/><p>MP: 470,000</p><br/><p>This incestuous couple was snuggled together and passionately kissed like a loving husband and wife from time to time.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, these incestous b*stards!\u201d Fatty Han scolded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt just so happens that we have two tanks, so each tank for each boss!\u201d Zhang Yang thought of it and said, \u201cPrincess is a magic-type monster, so Starlight, you tank the princess and I will tank the king!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have only one healer. Will she be able to heal the two of you together?\u201d Yan Wei Er said.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuest item!\u201d Sun Xing Yu interrupted suddenly.</p><br/><p>The gang recalled that they had received a quest spear from a quest of killing the king and princess which would be needed to use when fighting the king and princess.</p><br/><p>Yan Wei Er impatiently took out the spear from her inventory immediately and chose to use the spear. Instantly, an illusory centaur figure appeared in front of everyone, it was the Prince Chateau Turk of centaur race!</p><br/><p>[Shadow of Revenge] (Elite, Soul)</p><br/><p>Level: 44</p><br/><p>HP: 100,000</p><br/><p>Once this Chateau Turk\u2019s [Shadow of Revenge] had appeared, he stared at that incestuous couple in anger and roared then stomped his hoofs and rushed towards them.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang selected the quest spear in his inventory but the system showed that one [Shadow of Revenge] already existed, invalid to use temporarily. He pulled out his sword and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the strategy, let\u2019s try them out first, at least we\u2019ll find out what the skills of these bosses are!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cB*tch, I want to kill you!\u201d [Shadow of Revenge] rushed towards Princess Annie Balrum angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cChateau, you dickless trash! Even in death you persist to bother us!\u201d Annie Balrum said with contemptuous laughter. She waved her right hand and a wand appeared, which she directed towards the [Shadow of Revenge] and a flash of flaming fire burst from the wand.</p><br/><p>\u201cB*tch, if it was not for me marry you, you would still be a commoner, is this how you repay me?!\u201d [Shadow of Revenge] roared again and started fighting with Annie Balrum.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it is the Prince and Cinderella! Unfortunately, their marriage has changed!\u201d Endless Starlight muttered.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang saw that they were fighting and said immediately, \u201cStarlight, don\u2019t pull the princess yet, let [Shadow of Revenge] pester her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Slash!</p><br/><p>\u2018!\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang dashed towards Kinglose Turk and smashed on him immediately.</p><br/><p>\u2018653!\u2019</p><br/><p>After a normal attack, a low-valued damage text appeared above Kinglose Turk\u2019s head. Zhang Yang frowned as Kinglose Turk\u2019s Defense value was about 300, which was very high! But he was not in fear as he had and the rest of the members could rely on which reduced 150 Defense value on Kinglose Turk, it would greatly aid the damage output.</p><br/><p>Kinglose Turk yelled angrily, pulled out a spear and struck Zhang Yang: \u201cLittle human, how dare you provoke the great king of centaur, I\u2019ll hack you into pieces!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIncestophile, go to hell!\u201d Yan Wei Er yelled, dashed forward by using and whirled her weapon.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brat, you learned a new word in no time, huh!\u201d Zhang Yang laughed.</p><br/><p>Yan Wei Er answered arrogantly, \u201cI hate trash like this guy who uses people and throws them aside for anything new. I\u2019ll kill this shameless fellow!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the other side, [Shadow of Revenge] fought with Annie Balrum.</p><br/><p>[Shadow of Revenge] pierced Annie Balrum by using his spear but it did not cause any damage to Annie Balrum. Yet, [Shadow of Revenge] was still the first who held the aggro. So, even if Han Ying Xue healed continuously, the HP recovery would not exceed [Shadow of Revenge]\u2019s aggro.</p><br/><p>Annie Balrum was a Spellcaster, she used a chain of DOT first, then damage reduction debuff, followed by and which assaulted [Shadow of Revenge]\u2019s HP. Luckily [Shadow of Revenge] had 100,000 HP, and with Annie Balrum\u2019s damage output, she would need to attack for quite some time before she could kill [Shadow of Revenge].</p><br/><p>Back at Zhang Yang\u2019s side, Sun Xing Yu and the rest already started to deal damage in full force towards the incestuous king, causing the king\u2019s HP to drop dramatically.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuards! Guards! Kill all the intruders!\u201d Kinglose Turk shouted loudly.</p><br/><p>Fatty Han laughed loudly and said, \u201cKeep shouting, nobody is going to help you even if you cough your throat out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Kinglose Turk has released [Summoned Guard]!\u201d</p><br/><p>Eight strong centaurs appeared in formation at the back of Kinglose Turk.</p><br/><p>\u201cPervert Fatty, you have such a bad mouth!\u201d Yan Wei Er said angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cCoincidence! This must be a coincidence!\u201d Fatty Han quickly claimed that he was innocent.</p><br/><p>[Summoned Guard] (Elite, Spectre)</p><br/><p>Level: 45</p><br/><p>HP: 90,000</p><br/><p>\u201cI will kite them all, you guys use AoE skills to kill them all quickly!\u201d Zhang Yang used followed by to reduce the monsters\u2019 movement speed, before leading them in circles.</p><br/><p>However, Kinglose Turk movement speed was still faster than Zhang Yang, even if his movement speed was reduced by 50%, Zhang Yang unable to flee from him! Luckily, Zhang Yang\u2019s plan was to reduce the elite monsters movement speed only, thus, it did not matter if Kinglose Turk was unhindered.</p><br/><p>They killed all the eight monsters within a minute and the field was back to normal after the chaos.</p><br/><p>But Kinglose Turk\u2019 HP dropping became slower, Kinglose Turk\u2019 HP dropped only by about 100,000. The guards had reduced the party\u2019s damage output by 67%!</p><br/><p>\u201cGuards! Guards! Kill all the intruders!\u201d Kinglose Turk deserved to be called a king indeed, as he continuously summoned guards and stabbed repeatedly with his spear.</p><br/><p>Eight strong centaurs appeared at the back of Kinglose Turk once again.</p><br/><p>Based on Zhang Yang\u2019s speculation, Kinglose Turk would summon the number of guards according to the number of people who held the aggro! Thus, this was actually beneficial to an elite team like them as if there was a 100-man team, Kinglose Turk would instantly summon 100 elite guards which will quickly wipe them out.</p><br/><p>The gang continued using AoE skills and they killed the second round of summoned guards instantly. However, AoE skills drained a huge amount of MP from Spellcasters. After killing two rounds of summoned guards, Daffodil Daydream\u2019s MP had depleted. Bandits and Hunters would recover their energy and Focus point in a fixed time. Warriors had it even easier, they functioned on Rage, where it did not matter whether they were attacking or being attacked by others, they would regain their Rage.</p><br/><p>After another round of guards, Daffodil Daydream\u2019s MP dried out once again, so she could only stand aside and spectate.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

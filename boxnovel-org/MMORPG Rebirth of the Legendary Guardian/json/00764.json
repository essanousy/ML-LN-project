His presence had really given Zhang Yang a tremendous amount of stress!</p><br/><p>\"Please, sit!\" Zhong Xiu Hua was acting like a civilized gentleman in front of Sun Xin Yu. He looked like an easy going person at the moment. He did not look intimidating at all.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang was tired of keeping up with all these false pretenses. So he sat down with a plonk and pulled his chair a little closer over to Sun Xin Yu. Initially, the table only had three chairs around. The distances between the 3 chairs were the same. Well, it would not matter where Sun Xin Yu and Zhang Yang sit, the three of them should look like three enemy generals from three different kingdoms. However, because Zhang Yang moved his chair like that, he instantly made Zhong Xiu Hua feel like he was isolated by the two of them sitting nearer together.</p><br/><p>Well, this fellow really knows how to do unexpected things!</p><br/><p>Zhong Xiu Hua took a closer look at Zhang Yang. Even though the two of them had crossed paths many times in the dark, they had never seen each other in person, in real life. This should be the first time that they are meeting face to face. However, he did not waste much time on Zhang Yang. Instead, he quickly turned towards Sun Xin Yu and said, \"Little Yu, you\u2019ve not gone back to Beijing for quite some time ever since. My mother, my grandpa and my grandma always talk about you! They miss you a lot!\"</p><br/><p>\"Oi! Stop calling my wife like you\u2019re very close to her!\" Zhang Yang immediately cut in and said. He also rested his arms over Sun Xin Yu\u2019s shoulders. He was declaring to Zhong Xiu Hua that he had the indisputable \u2018sovereignty\u2019 over the frosty and yet mesmerizing Sun Xin Yu.</p><br/><p>Witnessing Zhang Yang landing his \u2018porky hand\u2019 on Sun Xin Yu, Zhong Xiu Hua revealed a sense of murderous intent in his eyes. What he could not understand was that Sun Xin Yu did not push Zhang Yang\u2019s hand away. Instead, she revealed a sense of comfort and joy on her face. The sides of her lips were slightly raised. That was a smile filled with love and happiness! That was her happy expression!</p><br/><p>God damn it! What was so good about this man, then? Did he really have anything that could match Zhong Xiu Hua? Why? Why would Sun Xin Yu abandon him to be with Zhang Yang?!</p><br/><p>The reason Zhong Xiu Hua attempted to pursue Sun Xin Yu was more of a political factor. He wanted to form an \u2018alliance\u2019 between the two political families to gain much more benefits. Of course, the beauty of Sun Xin Yu would also match his status. Her appearance would not make him look bad in public either. After all, couples with handsome men and ugly wives or pretty wives with ugly husbands can be found everywhere in the political circle.</p><br/><p>And now, Sun Xin Yu actually decided to \u2018abandon\u2019 him. Zhong Xiu Hua felt more humiliated by her decision more than ever. The feeling was like knowing that his wife was having an affair outside! He quietly swore that he would marry Sun Xin Yu in the future. By then, he would punish her and make her understand the cost of not behaving decently as his wife!</p><br/><p>However, now that Zhang Yang and Sun Xin Yu were showing off their love in front of him, Zhong Xiu Hua was so infuriated that his grip almost broke the teacup in his hand.</p><br/><p>Well, thank god he still managed to bury his tantrum deep inside. He forcefully endured the pain and calmed himself down. Meanwhile, a waiter came up to serve them dishes. That did ease the situation up a little bit.</p><br/><p>While they were having their meal, Zhong Xiu Hua kept bringing up the memories about Sun Xin Yu back in the years when he and Sun Xin Yu were still young. He ignored Zhang Yang as much as possible. However, Sun Xin Yu was not the type that talks a lot. Well, she would not even talk much while looking at a man she hates so much. As Zhong Xiu Hua knew no boundary on when to stop talking, she felt uncomfortable listening to that pr*ck babble on.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m going to the washroom for a bit!\" Sun Xin Yu could no longer tolerate Zhong Xiu Hua\u2019s crap. So, she pushed the chair back and walked out of the room.</p><br/><p>\"Zhang Yang ---\" The moment when Sun Xin Yu left the room, Zhong Xiu Hua\u2019s face changed instantly. That prideful and cold expression was revealed all over his face. His eyes were filled with disdain. So, that was his true colour beneath that hippy mask! His impression about Zhang Yang was that Zhang Yang was just merely \u2018New Money1\u2019. He would not have what it takes to match himself with the born-to-be \u2018Prince\u2019 Zhong Xiu Hua!</p><br/><p>He coldly glared at Zhang Yang and said, \"You\u2019re digging your own grave, do you know that? When little Yu is tired of toying you around, you\u2019ll be a worthless piece of sh*t! I\u2019ll tear down your Silky Soft Holdings bit by bit. Then, I\u2019ll take everything you have in the \u2018God\u2019s Miracle\u2019 from you!\"</p><br/><p>\"Aihh\u2026 other than using your father\u2019s name or your grandpa\u2019s influence, can you actually do something that is worth my time?\" Zhang Yang did not even bat an eyelid.</p><br/><p>\"Humph! In life, there is always a difference between every individual! There are the noble ones, and there are the cheap ones! Everything is written in the genes!\" Zhong Xiu Hua spoke proudly.</p><br/><p>\"Cut the crap! Was your ancestor born with a golden diaper on him?\" Zhang Yang conveniently threw a chicken bone over before Zhong Xiu Hua\u2019s plate and said, \"100 years ago, your grandpa's grandpa might be one of those coal miners! Is that written in your genes as well? If that\u2019s true, why don\u2019t you hustle up and go mining now? Why are you still here wasting time?\"</p><br/><p>Zhong Xiu Hua\u2019s face instantly turned red!</p><br/><p>Well, before his family miraculously became influential and powerful, his ancestor was indeed a miner back in the ancient times. Everything changed when his great grandpa married an officer\u2019s daughter. He suddenly rose to a position of great importance in the society. When he retired, he had become an important person with a ministerial position in society. After that, it was his grandpa and his father\u2019s turn to shine even better. They became even more influential in the society than their ancestor. If nothing goes wrong, Zhong Xiu Hua\u2019s father would be climbing up to the top of the power ladder. If that ever happens, the Zhong Family would be at the peak of their life\u2019s achievement, a height they had never reached before!</p><br/><p>Because of that, Zhong Xiu Hua could not stand people speaking on his past the most. The pride and arrogant expression on his face vanished without a trace after hearing what Zhang Yang had to say. Then, he ground his teeth together, as if he wanted to swallow Zhang Yang alive!</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019re digging your own grave!\" Zhong Xiu Hua\u2019s eyes were blazing with murderous intent!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang smiled vaguely and said, \"You\u2019ve tried to provoke me three times. So, do you think everyone is some sort of toy or a puppet for you to meddle with? You know, when a man is really angry, he can spill the blood of his enemy 5 feet across the floor. So, you better watch out when you step out of your house!\"</p><br/><p>\"You ---\" Zhong Xiu Hua was infuriated to the point that he lost his voice. This fellow actually threatened him!? Does he not know about his status? Zhong Xiu Hua would be like a crown prince in the ancient times. How dare Zhang Yang threatens him like that?</p><br/><p>\"Oh? Are you mad now?\" Zhang Yang shook his head and said, \"If you can become mad just because you\u2019re teased with a few words, should I be exploding in anger? You\u2019ve got to be kidding me! You\u2019ve tried to spy on me by placing people around me. Then you tried to frame me for murder! I should be planting nukes in your yard and blow you to kingdom come!\"</p><br/><p>\"Zhang Yang!\" Zhong Xiu Hua slammed the table with both of his hands. Then he pushed himself a little forward towards Zhang Yang and said, \"The day that Sun Xin Yu abandons you is the day you die!\"</p><br/><p>\"Then you should just go to hell before me!\" Zhang Yang roared out like a spartan. He suddenly swung out his fist and gave a solid uppercut straight up at Zhong Xiu Hua\u2019s chin! Zhong Xiu Hua did not expect that to happen at all. He did not even react at all as he was punched so hard that the punch threw him off balance. He spat out a few teeth and some blood from his mouth as he fell! His fall caused his body to knock the chair over and he fell straight to the ground.</p><br/><p>Everything happened so fast that even the bodyguard standing behind Zhong Xiu Hua could not react! Well, Zhang Yang\u2019s reflexes were extremely good. Or else, he would not have become number one in the entire server of \u2018God\u2019s Miracle\u2019!</p><br/><p>However, that bodyguard still managed to shove himself between Zhang Yang and Zhong Xiu Hua to protect his master on the next moment. At the same time, the two bodyguards who heard something that was happening in the room charged into the room as well. The three bodyguards were charging at Zhang Yang with the intention of killing him!</p><br/><p>Well, Zhang Yang did not falter at all. Although these three bodyguards looked like they were well trained and all, however, they were just some muscles hired from the Security Firms. They were not as good as the bodyguards who stayed by the sides of Sun Xin Yu\u2019s old man. Those bodyguards were definitely iron-blood military soldiers trained in the Zhongnanhai!</p><br/><p>After all, even though Zhong Xiu Hua had a very special and precious identity, he would only be a second-rate fellow carrying a second-rate title walking around. So it would not be possible that the Zhongnanhai would actually send bodyguards to guard by Zhong Xiu Hua\u2019s side. Furthermore, his father was a man who does great things. So he would definitely pay attention to small details such as these!</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>The door was kicked open. Sun Xin Yu walked into the room filled with murderous intent. The moment she entered, she glared at the three huge bodyguards coldly.</p><br/><p>If it was one against three, Zhang Yang would stand a lower chance of winning the fight. However, with Sun Xin Yu joining his side, he was very confident that the two of them could take out the three bodyguards.</p><br/><p>\"Zhang Yang!\" Zhong Xiu Hua crawled back up on his feet with blood all over his face. The rage was ablaze in both of his eyes. He was so angry that his face became crooked, \"You\u2026 are\u2026 digging\u2026 your\u2026 own grave!\" He attempted to speak the sentence word by word.</p><br/><p>Sun Xin Yu humphed coldly and said, \"If you dare to touch even one hair of him, I\u2019ll crush every single bone in you and rip your bones out one by one until you are the spineless, boneless coward that you are!\"</p><br/><p>Even though she spoke calmly, but Zhong Xiu Hua could feel the intense murderous aura hidden in her tone. Based on his understanding on Sun Xin Yu, he knew that she would never have talk crap about anything! She would only say it when she was capable of doing it! If she mentioned that she would crush every single bones in Zhong Xiu Hua, she meant it with all her heart! There would be no bone in him if things continue to escalate.</p><br/><p>No one would be capable of provoking a crazy woman! Especially a crazy woman who has the same level of influence and background as him!</p><br/><p>Zhong Xiu Hua quickly calmed himself down. Then, he pointed at his mouth and said, \"Are you saying that I was punched over nothing?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, you\u2019re punched over nothing! So what?\" Sun Xin Yu said indifferently.</p><br/><p>Zhong Xiu Hua almost popped a vein after hearing what she said. Who is he to get punched in the face? However, he was a little terrified while he was confronting the mad woman. He remembered very clearly that something gruesome happened back then when they were still very young. A huge boy once attempted to bully Sun Xin Yu. However, he ended up with a fractured skull, and one foot in the grave!</p><br/><p>That was one of the main reasons why Sun Xin Yu left Beijing long ago. The witch of Sun, the crazy b*tch Sun Xin Yu! Those were the nicknames she was called by the rich kids back in the days. Those rich kids would still be terrified the moment when they talk about her!</p><br/><p>\"Are you done talking to him?\" Sun Xin Yu turned her eyes over on Zhang Yang. Then, she spoke gently to Zhang Yang. Zhong Xiu Hua felt extremely jealous because of that.</p><br/><p>\"We\u2019re done. Let\u2019s go home!\" Zhang Yang tidied up his clothes a little before walking out of the room with Sun Xin Yu.</p><br/><p>Zhong Xiu Hua was overwhelmed by the mixed feelings on his chest at the moment. However, after hesitating for quite some time, he did not order the three bodyguards to make their moves on Zhang Yang and Sun Xin Yu. He was not worried if his bodyguards would lose. He was worried that Sun Xin Yu would do something that would cause him to tremble in fear. After all, Sun Xin Yu was an existence that he could not handle. If she really gets mad at him, she might even use a gun on him!</p><br/><p>His thoughts rested the moment he thought of how crazy Sun Xin Yu could get. He could not help to feel a chill up his spine. However, that punch would not go unanswered! He touched his swollen face as he was staring at the view of Zhang Yang\u2019s back as Zhang Yang was leaving with murderous intent. Well, he decided to start on Silky Soft Holdings, then. Furthermore, it was about time that he summons all his troops in the \u2018God\u2019s Miracle\u2019 and lays siege on Lone Desert Smoke.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>After walking out of the restaurant, Sun Xin Yu looked at Zhang Yang. Then, she asked with care, \"Did you get hurt?\"</p><br/><p>\"No. There were only that few of them. I could have taken them all out with only one hand!\" Zhang Yang exaggerated with the intent of comforting Sun Xin Yu. The two of them went to the car. Then, Zhang Yang smiled, \"I never thought that you\u2019d be so fierce and fearsome back there! That Zhong Xiu Hua could not even talk or even fart!\"</p><br/><p>\"You can\u2019t underestimate him. He\u2019s just being considerate because I was there! Furthermore, you\u2019re too reckless to have landed a punch on him! Far too reckless!\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang shook his head and said, \"He got used to being high up all the while. So, he thought he could just bully anyone he sees. If I only strike back at him at the wrong moment, he would only act even cockier! Now, he wanted to take you away from me, and he wanted to destroy Silky Soft Holdings. He even wanted to take everything that I have in the \u2018God\u2019s Miracle\u2019 away from me! So, should I hold back on this kind of opponent?\"</p><br/><p>Sun Xin Yu remained silent for a moment, then she said, \"As long as no one dies, I will allow you to do anything you want.\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang instantly got touched. It would take a lot more love than anyone could imagine for her to say such words. Zhang Yang felt the heat building up his chest. It was joy. It was excitement out of affection. He turned around and hugged Sun Xin Yu. Then he began to passionately touch and kiss Sun Xin Yu\u2019s body parts.</p><br/><p>\"Are you crazy? This is a parking lot. Someone might see us!\"</p><br/><p>\"There\u2019s no one here at this hour! Also, we\u2019ve not tried it in a car before!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmm ---\"</p><br/><p>TL Notes:</p><br/><p>1.

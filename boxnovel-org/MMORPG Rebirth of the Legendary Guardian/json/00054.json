That\u2019s mean!\u201d Drizzler laughed underneath her covered mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brat! What do you know! This is called deception in war!\u201d Fatty Han was trying mimic the looks of the great philosopher Zhu Ge Liang.</p><br/><p>\u201cDrizzler! That\u2019s called \u2018Learning from Experience\u2019! Even in game he would use some kind of trickery to deceit others. Obviously, he would also be a swindler in reality! Drizzler, you must take this chance to learn. Next time, when you see someone like Fatty, you\u2019d better get far, far away from him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Drizzler stood upright and saluted her like a soldier to a captain. \u201cSir! Yes Sir!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone laughed at the cousin\u2019s skit.</p><br/><p>Fatty Han quickly tried to rectify to situation. \u201cHey! I have the 4 virtues of a youngster! It\u2019s just you guys who could not recognize it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich four?\u201d said Hundred Shots. Being the silent type, he rarely participated in talks but since the mood got quite rowdy, he decided to join in.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little greedy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA little horny!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA little baddie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA little fatty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god\u2026\u201d All four of them pointed their middle fingers at Fatty Han.</p><br/><p>Once that was over, the team revived themselves and ran over to the second boss. Everyone sat outside the boss\u2019s chamber to consume some health recovery items.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, all set! Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>! !</p><br/><p>Both Zhang Yang and Drizzle activated at almost the same time. They dashed through the floor and arrived in front of the boss.</p><br/><p>!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang immediately locked on to the boss\u2019s aggro. He used and a normal attack after, damaging the boss with his sword.</p><br/><p>\u2018-335!\u2019</p><br/><p>He gained 34 Rage and immediately he used and . Zhang Yang managed to stack two layers of as soon as the two seconds of wore off.</p><br/><p>Earth Spirit Oz grumbled and opened its mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cInvaders. Oz will not allow you to destroy Lord Marzerway\u2019s plans to destroy all of humanity!\u201d After the opening speech was over, Oz began to charge towards Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh\u2026 human annihilation. I guess that is the only dream all bad guys could ever have!\u201d Drizzler scoffed.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, Marzerway is the victim here. Quite the pity as well.\u201d Zhang Yang explained while he swung his sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you read the official introduction?\u201d Zhang Yang sounded disappointed. \u201cSigh, every dungeon has their own lore!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, Fatty here doesn\u2019t care about that. All I want is the equipment!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just care about the gold pieces!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?! Come on guys! The developers put their hearts and souls into making this game to be as detailed for the sake of the players! What you have done is spat on the efforts the developers! What a waste of a beautiful game!\u201d Zhang Yang shook his head in disappointment.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch! What an elderly act. You\u2019ll surely be elderly soon enough!\u201d Drizzler scorned.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright\u2026 Let\u2019s hear it out. What\u2019s the story?\u201d Little Snow resumed her pace, winking about again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the lore, Marzerway was a famous Spellcaster who was part of a Spellcaster guild in the Empire\u2019s Royal Family. A few years back, he joined the army to fight against the invading specters, leaving behind his loving wife in the hands of a noble. Little did he know that the noble tainted his wife, causing her to grieve, and she eventually killed herself. When Marzerway returned, and found out the truth of his wife\u2019s death, he sought out to have his revenge. Sadly, he was deemed a traitor to the empire. Hated by all, he was imprisoned, waiting to be executed.\u201d Zhang Yang looked around. Everyone was listening carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnguish and despair beyond any human can endure, Marzerway surrendered his soul to the demon and exchanged it for unlimited power. He escaped the prison and desecrated the Snow Sprite City, killing everyone and everything in it! After that, Marzerway occupied the city and summoned countless of elemental monsters to defend the city against the Empire\u2019s army.\u201d Zhang Yang finished his story and look around again. He suddenly yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Why are you guys just standing there! We\u2019re still in the middle of a fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>The four of them were shaken, as if they were woken up from a dream. Drizzler bit her lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cAw\u2026Marzerway is quite pity!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 this truly is sad. If only I can get married to someone as loyal as Marzerway\u2026 that would be nice!\u201d Little Snow had a yearning kind of tone in her voice.</p><br/><p>\u2018Cousin! What\u2019s the use if he is just loyal? A true gentleman must be straight forward, brave, handsome and cool! If he is anything like Fatty Han, then you might as well give up.\u201d Drizzler giggled and turned around to make sure he heard what she said.</p><br/><p>Fatty Han shriveled up. He only joked around to cheer the party, and now he made himself public enemy number 1. How did it turn out this way?</p><br/><p>\u201cFoolish intruders! Taste my wrath!\u201d A red glow covered entire Oz\u2019s body, increasing his power by a level.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Earth Spirit Oz has gain a effect (1 stack). All physical attack is increased by 5%!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cCrap! No time to play around anymore guys! Strike him with all you\u2019ve got!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Zhan Yu received ! Stunned for 2 seconds!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-305!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-316!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-84!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018+120!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-312!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018+297!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-301!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-84!\u2019</p><br/><p>This round, Little Snow used instead of . With only 1.5 second casting time, she could easily heal in between the boss\u2019 furious attack. After enduring that barrage of attack, Zhang Yang\u2019s HP remained at around 900. He then evade one attack, and used on the other, giving Little Snow enough room to cast . After he was healed, his HP was back to 70%.</p><br/><p>90%, 80%.... the boss\u2019 HP dropped continuously and it was not slowing down. However, the boss was also growing in damage. 5%, 10%, 15%...</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, this is going well. Guys! Maintain this pace and we can surely win this round!\u201d Zhang Yang encouraged the party.</p><br/><p>\u201cPathetic little intruders! I will crush all if you into smithereens!\u201d Earth Spirit Oz growled. The red glow engulfed his body over and over again and when Oz\u2019s HP reached 10%, he stacked over 12 layers of !</p><br/><p>\u201cHere comes the most dangerous time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Zhan Yu received ! Stunned for 2 seconds!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-487!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-128!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018+120!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-482!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-489!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018+302!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-128!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-491!\u2019</p><br/><p>After a serious beating, Zhang Yang\u2019s HP stopped at 57 points! The boss has yet to stop attacking!</p><br/><p>\u2018Evade!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018!\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang quickly consumed a bottle of red potion while waiting for Little Snow to heal him.</p><br/><p>\u2018+399!\u2019</p><br/><p>The potion\u2019s healing only managed to put him out of the danger zone, but he was still not out of trouble!</p><br/><p>9%, 8%, 7%... Death was inevitable!</p><br/><p>4%!</p><br/><p>3%!</p><br/><p>2%!</p><br/><p>1%!</p><br/><p>0%!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 L-Lord Mar\u2026 Marzerway will resurrect me a-again! I-I will\u2026.c-crush\u2026\u201d With its last dying words, Oz came crashing onto the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cWE DID IT!\u201d Finally, they did it. All of them let out a sigh of relief and cheered.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You can the party member around had killed Earth Spirit Oz. Obtaining 26,450 Experience points (50 party bonus point)!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Your party has successfully conquered Marzerway\u2019s Lair: Front Wing (Hardcore Mode) and obtained the \u201cFirst Clear\u201d Achievement! This glorious accomplishment will be recorded in the Hardcore First Clear Achievement Board. As the party leader, please name your party!\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang paused and thought for a while. He turned around and said, \u201cHey little brat, I\u2019ll key in your guild\u2019s name into this achievement for 1,000 gold pieces! How does that sound?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWah! Come on, uncle. We\u2019re so close to each other now! Would you still charge us for it?\u201d Drizzler screamed and shouted. To take her money was on the same level as robbing a bank; there would be resistance.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Friendship is one thing, business is another! Come on! Pay up!\u201d Zhang Yang continued to play with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAwww\u2026\u201d Drizzler then tried to follow Little Snow\u2019s seductive behavior by trying to wink. After so much effort, all she could only manage to close one of her eye. It\u2019s freaking tiresome! Drizzler gave up and stomped the ground. \u201cAh, well. How about I offer you Little Snow\u2019s nudes! Yeah. You heard it right! Her nudes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Snow\u2019s eyebrow twitched. \u201cAhem! You little witch, what are you blabbering about?\u201d A seductive look naturally formed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you for real?!\u201d Fatty Han got excited. Everyone could see a pinkish erotic aura emitting from him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s real!\u201d Drizzler patted her chest.</p><br/><p>Little Snow did not really care at first but when she saw Drizzler smiling ear to ear, she began to feel that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly be serious\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHEHE!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou brat, when did you\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou always like to leave the door open whenever you take a bath. I was just passing by one time and when you didn\u2019t notice my presence, I took a picture!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh no you little witch! YOU\u2019RE SO DEAD WHEN I GET MY HANDS ON YOU!\u201d Little Snow voice became louder.</p><br/><p>Fatty Han took the opportunity to sneak in.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey Little Drizzler, since WE are also quite close\u2026 so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey! We\u2019re not that close!\u201d Drizzler played along.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time I\u2019ll key in your guild name. The next dungeon, I\u2019ll key in my own guild name!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? When did you join a guild?\u201d Little Snow asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Not yet. After these two dungeons, Fatty Han, Hundred Shots, and I will establish a guild of our own. How about it? Feel like coming over to this side?\u201d Zhang Yang gazed at the two girls. There were fine specimens after all!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy so troublesome?\u201d Drizzler pouted her lips. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come to our guild? I\u2019ll pass the guild master position to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang was surprised. \u201cEh? You would do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine! My cousin and I established the guild just for the fun of it. Being a guild master is so troublesome after all. I had to do this and that, manage here and there\u2026 Argh! I\u2019d wanted to quit for so long! To think that you could take over my position! I would be glad to pass it to you!\u201d Drizzler sounded very decisive.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang could never have predicted this outcome.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better think this through and through. \u2018God\u2019s Miracle\u2019 is not like any other VRMMORPG. In the future, the game will have so many more players joining in! You could basically call this game the \u2018second Earth\u2019! If the guild is managed properly, you could earn a living from the income!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. How could you talk so much? It\u2019s so annoying! Ain\u2019t that right, cousin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEm, that\u2019s right. Besides, in less than a month, Drizzler will heading back to school. She won\u2019t have much time to play this game anymore. It\u2019s would be in the best of interest if you took over the guild!\u201d Little Snow nodded.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang felt bad for those under these two lazy bums. He would not mind to take over the guild\u2019s responsibility at the least. He thought for a while and considered it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then, in that case, add all 3 of us into the guild! Fatty Han, quit your guild now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty Han was a little unwilling, \u201cSigh\u2026 if someone as handsome and cool as me left that guild, I\u2019m afraid those pretty chicks would go crazy without me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Drizzler has invited you to join her guild: Lone Desert Smoke. Will you accept her invitation?\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang entered the guild. After a short while, he saw the guild notification refreshed.</p><br/><p>Player Slim and Handsome has joined the guild.</p><br/><p>Player Hundred Shots has joined the guild.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang then keyed in the name Lone Desert Smoke as the party name and selected \u201cConfirm\u201d. The server channel then dyed in red again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Server announcement: Party Lone Desert Smoke has obtained the First Clear Achievement: Marzerway\u2019s Lair, Front Wing (Hardcore mode).

Player Prideful Precepts has joined the party!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Player Kindling Chest Hair has joined the party!</p><br/><p>After the battle, Floral Shorts had been urging Zhang Yang to re-invite the other two players into the party or they would have lost the chance to bid for an equipment once somebody had touched the boss\u2019 corpse.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang gave a slight smile and sent the party invitation to the two of them. Before they could even start arguing, Zhang Yang preemptively said, \u201cAll of you Pride members, no one speak from now on! I will kick anyone who can\u2019t keep their mouth shut. If all four of you can\u2019t keep your mouth shut, I\u2019ll kick all four out! We don\u2019t even need that many players in Normal Mode!\u201d</p><br/><p>Stunned by Zhang Yang\u2019s authoritative assertion, even though the four Pride players held a grudging look, no one dared make a noise. If these words were to come from Zhang Yang had they first started the dungeon raid, they would have treated it as a passing joke. After experiencing 2 boss battles though, they knew that Zhang Yang was a pro player, someone much more skillful than them!</p><br/><p>Other party members smiled, their anger subsiding. They began to think even more highly of Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cTouch the corpse!\u201d Zhang Yang said casually.</p><br/><p>Although Floral Shorts had stayed silent, his reaction was incredibly fast, rushing to the boss\u2019 side and with a touch, 3 equipment and a Roll-the-Dice window had appeared in front of everyone.</p><br/><p>In Roll-the-Dice Mode, for items higher than White tier dropped by the boss, each player in the party could roll should they desire it. The system would then randomly generate a number between 1 \u2013 100; the player who had the highest roll would obtain the item they had rolled for. Of course, if there was no need for the item, one could pass.</p><br/><p>[Bloodstained Hat] (Black-Steel, Cloth Armor)</p><br/><p>Armor: +1</p><br/><p>Vitality: +3</p><br/><p>Intelligence: +1</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 5</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang had chosen to pass and the others were quick in making a choice. A total of 5 players rolled for the equipment.</p><br/><p>Prideful Precepts, 36 points.</p><br/><p>Flame Emperor, 87 points.</p><br/><p>Prideful Babysitter, 76 points.</p><br/><p>Floral Shorts, 27 points.</p><br/><p>Kindling Chest Hair, 92 points.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Player Kindling Chest Hair has obtained Bloodstained Hat!\u201d</p><br/><p>The party boiled with anger again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy the hell did you roll for a cloth armor when you\u2019re not even cloth classed, motherf*cker! Where did this barbaric Pride Guild come from? All barbarians!\u201d</p><br/><p>Those from Pride kept mum, be it due to having qualms about Zhang Yang\u2019s warning or their arrogance which was keeping them from arguing. What was clear though, was that they were determined to be barbarous to the end. It did not matter whether the other two equipment fit them, they had chosen to roll for them anyway.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang sent a private message to the other party members one by one saying, \u201cLevel 5 Black-Steel equipment are not much better than White-Wood rarity ones. Let them \u201cNeed\u201d1 roll! Let us clear the Difficult and Hardcore Modes later and show them what real loot is. Make them jealous, that\u2019s the best payback!\u201d</p><br/><p>The players were thrilled. This would mean that Zhang Yang had intended on leading them to raid both Difficult and Hardcore Modes! After battling two bosses with him, they already had no doubts regarding Zhang Yang\u2019s capabilities. Perhaps Hardcore Mode could be a problem, Difficult Mode though, there would be a big chance that they could clear it!</p><br/><p>Receiving such a promise, the party calmed down. To be honest, Level 5 Black-Steel equipment would have been insignificant to Level 10 players. It would have been discarded after a few levels of use. The players from Pride had humiliated themselves for temporary benefits and had also lost their chance to raid the Difficult and Hardcore Modes with Zhang Yang. It was obvious whether they had benefited or suffered a loss.</p><br/><p>[Hard Leather Chest Plate] (Black-Steel, Leather Armor)</p><br/><p>Armor: +2</p><br/><p>Vitality: +2</p><br/><p>Dexterity: +2</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 5</p><br/><p>The rest of the party had fought back mercilessly in dealing with the Pride players\u2019 shameless act. All the players besides Zhang Yang had joined the roll, Ocean Despair ended up obtaining the equipment. He then passed the equipment to the leather armor classed player, Defiant Monk, who had the second highest roll. Defiant Monk was utterly grateful.</p><br/><p>[Hard Leather Gloves] (Black-Steel, Leather Armor)</p><br/><p>Armor: +2</p><br/><p>Vitality: +1</p><br/><p>Dexterity: +1</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 10</p><br/><p>This equipment, however, had fallen to one of the Pride members. The four of them had looked as contented as winning a 500 million dollar grand prize. The others had already adjusted their emotions and had treated them as a joke. Only scornful smiles appeared at the corners of their lips, none of them saying anything.</p><br/><p>The Pride Quad thought they had put a halt to the other party members\u2019 momentum, feeling all the more pleased with themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s move forward!\u201d Zhang Yang said calmly after the equipment distribution.</p><br/><p>Bangar Crypt had a total of 3 bosses and another 7 waves of minions along their way to the last boss. The party had spent 20 minutes clearing the minions and had finally reached the ultimate boss after passing through a long tunnel.</p><br/><p>[Gnome Leader Dadarerda] (Black-Steel Boss)</p><br/><p>Level: 14</p><br/><p>HP: 42,000</p><br/><p>Dadarerda was a 5-meter tall giant gnome sitting on a plain throne. By his side, 2 guards in duty were guarding seriously.</p><br/><p>[Royal Guard] (Elite)</p><br/><p>Level: 13</p><br/><p>HP: 6,500</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang set his mind straight and began to explain the strategy, \u201cThis boss\u2019 battle is divided into 2 parts. First, eliminate the 2 guards. I will grab ahold of their aggro when we begin. Target the \u2018star-marked\u2019 one first and then the \u2018sun-marked\u2019 next. Then we follow-up with the boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe boss has two skills. He will randomly place fire pits on the ground for the first skill. I think it should be about 10 to 15 pits. You have to pay attention and avoid the pits, because each step will cost you 100 points of damage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe boss will spin and spew a cone-shaped flame for his second skill, and 300 HP will be taken once you\u2019re burned! However, there\u2019s a 2 seconds casting delay that can\u2019t be interrupted but can be used as an indication of attack. The boss does not spin very fast, so as long as you follow its rotation, you\u2019d be able to avoid the flame. What you need to pay attention though is that you\u2019ll have to also focus on the fire pits as you evade the spewed flame. Keep your eyes on both dangers!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang paused and asked, \u201cIs everyone clear? If you don\u2019t understand, ask me now. I can repeat the strategy again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone remained quiet.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well, we shall start now!\u201d Zhang Yang wielded his sword and ran forward. When he was within the casting range, Zhang Yang used and stunned Dadarerda, slashing it at the same time. \u201c-52\u201d damage text then floated across the boss\u2019 head.</p><br/><p>When the battle began, the gate to the passageway would be closed automatically and would not open again unless the battle had ended.</p><br/><p>Both the royal guards immediately shrieked in their strange voice and charged towards Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c-32!\u201d reflected damage.</p><br/><p>\u201c-92!\u201d Zhang Yang used on the \u2018star-marked\u2019 monster.</p><br/><p>\u201c-136!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c-142!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c-129!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang immediately chained with his previous attack, causing yellow damage numbers to drift across all three monsters\u2019 heads.</p><br/><p>Without further instruction from Zhang Yang, the party had initiated their attack on the \u2018star-marked\u2019 monster at once.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Dadarerda used . Lasts for 60 seconds!\u201d</p><br/><p>10 fire rings with 1 meter diameter each then appeared randomly on the battlefield. Some had appeared right beneath the players\u2019 feet while some had appeared randomly across the battlefield.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeware of your steps!\u201d Zhang Yang reminded.</p><br/><p>Evading 10 pits was fairly easy. Everyone resumed attacking the \u2018star-marked\u2019 monster, killing it in just a short amount of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! The party you are in has killed a Royal Guard! Obtained 700 EXP (50 points Party Bonus)!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNext target! Continue!\u201d Zhang Yang commanded.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Dadarerda used . Lasts for 60 seconds!\u201d</p><br/><p>Another 10 fire pits appeared on the field and everyone started becoming busy evading the pits.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Dadarerda stopped attacking and raised its hands. A progress bar appeared on its head as it began chanting in a weird language.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet ready! The boss is going to spit fire! Be on your feet!\u201d Zhang Yang turned and moved away from the boss\u2019 front, pulling the \u2018sun-marked\u2019 monster with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Dadarerda used \u201d</p><br/><p>Dadarerda opened his mouth and a flame more than 30 meters long was spat. He then slowly twirled and began his rotating attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake note of where you\u2019re stepping!\u201d Zhang Yang pulled the \u2018sun-marked\u2019 monster\u2019s aggro while moving along with the boss, hiding by his side the whole time.</p><br/><p>Even with Zhang Yang\u2019s reminder, a few players had forgotten about the beneath their feet as they evaded , causing damage text to float from their heads one by one.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Player Floral Shorts has died!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Player Prideful Magus has died!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Player Prideful Babysitter has died!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Player Flame Emperor has died!\u201d</p><br/><p>Good job, 4 members had died in an instant! On the other hand, if it were not for Kindling Chest Hair\u2019s 700 HP accommodating his damage from , he would have turned into a corpse already.</p><br/><p>\u201cContinue the attack!\u201d Zhang Yang did not want to criticize anyone. After all, since this had been everyone\u2019s virgin battle against this boss, progressing in any way was inevitable. Furthermore, the boss would cast every 10 seconds. Since the fire pits would last for 60 seconds, it meant that there would have been a total of 60 fire pits on the field later on, making things even more chaotic.</p><br/><p>And this was only in Normal Mode. The fire pits in Difficult Mode would have lasted for 90 seconds with an extra 30 pits while Hardcore Mode\u2019s would last for 120 seconds, covering almost the entire field with fire pits.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Dadarerda used . Lasts for 60 seconds!\u201d</p><br/><p>30 seconds later, there were 30 pits on the field. Fortunately, \u2019s activation rate was less frequent.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! The party you are in has killed Royal Guard! Obtained 700 EXP (50 points Party Bonus)!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Sun monster\u2019 kept it up for a while but had eventually succumbed to the party\u2019s nuke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and attack the boss!\u201d Zhang Yang hollered softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Dadarerda used . Lasts for 60 seconds!\u201d</p><br/><p>Almost simultaneously, Dadarerda stopped his attack and a progress bar appeared on its head once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Babarerba used !\u201d</p><br/><p>With 40 fire pits on the ground, all hell broke loose.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Player Snowy Death has died!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Player Defiant Monk has died!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Player Kindling Chest Hair has died!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Player Hundred Shots has died!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Player Ocean Despair has died!\u201d</p><br/><p>Amidst the raging flame, Zhang Yang became the sole survivor in his party!</p><br/><p>Translator Note</p><br/><p>1 In Roll-the-Dice Mode, the options a player is given is normally either Need, Greed, or Pass. Players who rolled Need will be given the highest priority, and so if you rolled a \u20181\u2019 when you chose Need, it did not matter if someone rolled \u2018100\u2019 as Greed. You would still be the final winner of the item. In most cases, the game\u2019s system would prevent a player from rolling Need if the item could not be used by the player\u2019s character. However, this does not seem to be the case for \u2018God\u2019s Miracle\u2019.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

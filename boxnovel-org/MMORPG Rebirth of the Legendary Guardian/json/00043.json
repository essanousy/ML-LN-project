Opening his Friend List, he saw Fatty Han online and realized that he was only Level 15! So painfully low! Hundred Shots was online too, and he was only a level lower than Fatty Han!</p><br/><p>Looking through the Level Ranking Board, Floating Fire Ball was at Level 19, while the other three were Level 18, except for Clear Color who was Level 17. Hundred Shots and Fatty Han\u2019s levels were just too low!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang suddenly had an idea; I know an excellent place for a quick level up! He sent the party invitations to them, and Fatty Han accepted it immediately.</p><br/><p>Even Hundred Shots accepted it. He has been maintaining good ties with Zhang Yang by chatting him up for the past few days.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys, I found an amazing place to grind!\u201d exclaimed Zhang Yang through the party channel. \u201cGo, go, go!\u201d Fatty Han shouted excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHold up! I need to invite two more players!\u201d and Zhang Yang sent a message to Little Snow, \u201cI found a great place to train, want to join? All I need is a healer and an attacker.\u201d After some time, Little Snow finally replied, \u201cScrawny rascal, what are you planning to do with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch! Yes or no. I could always find someone else!\u201d Even Zhang Yang knew how to act tough.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Of course I want to! Hang on, I\u2019ll call Drizzler!\u201d And she logged off immediately. Soon, she re-logged in and sent a private message, \u201cSend a party invitation to Drizzler and me!\u201d and they were added into the party too.</p><br/><p>Fatty Han was thrilled to see them. \u201cWhoa! Pretty ladies!\u201d Hundred Shots could only chuckle at him. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even seen their faces, how could you call them pretty just because they are ladies?\u201d Fatty Han decided to play the devil\u2019s advocate against Hundred Shots,</p><br/><p>\u201cLadies, this guy dared to say you\u2019re not pretty! Should I just punch him in the face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Drizzler giggled and said, \u201cPunch him! I\u2019m definitely a pretty lady, and soon to be a pretty queen, charming thousands around me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Snow couldn\u2019t help but to rain on her parade, \u201cLittle brat. What\u2019re you bragging about when you just woke up? You haven\u2019t even brushed your teeth!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHan Yin Xue! How dare you say that out loud! I was sound asleep until you came in and made a mess! Hmph! Hmph!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty Han tried to keep the conversation going, but he was just spouting nonsense, \u201cEh? Pretty Snow is also a Han. What a coincidence, my surname is Han too! This is destiny, truly destiny!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, gather at the North of the city. We\u2019ll follow my lead once everyone is here!\u201d Zhang Yang could not resist adding another sentence, \u201cDrizzler, please keep that directional idiot on the right track!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is the idiot?!\u201d Little Snow retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhomever that responded is the idiot!\u201d Zhang Yang laughed as he replied. \u201cNow, hurry up and stop wasting time! We have to get to Level 20 today!\u201d Drizzler seemed doubtful about this and strongly protested against the idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cLevel 20? Zhan Yu, have you lost your mind? At my current Level, I need at least 1,000,000 Experience Points and even if I spend my whole day grinding, I can only gain one level. My couusin and I are only at Level 13, and I don\u2019t think you can even make it to Level 20 either!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! That\u2019s the reason why I called you here; to grind at the Holy Training Ground!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Is there really such a place?\u201d Drizzler began doubting her own thoughts as Zhang Yang spoke with such confidence. To think this man actually defeated the once undefeatable boss Martyr Unduin\u2026 He definitely has some secret up his sleeve! \u201cLet\u2019s go for it!\u201d</p><br/><p>After finally meeting up, they embarked on their journey through the sky-blue lakes and peaceful plains, before finally entering the Spider\u2019s Forest. It was dark and dim, filled with all kinds of spiders roaming everywhere, leaving cob webs hung with animal carcasses as the forest\u2019s decoration. There were little globs that were white spiders\u2019 eggs rest beneath the tree, and they were absolutely disgusting.</p><br/><p>\u201cEww\u2026\u201d Little Snow and Drizzler both frowned at the sight of it. Fatty Han stepped forward in front of them and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry ladies, for this Fatty will protect you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFollow me!\u201d Zhang Yang continued to lead the way, guiding the other four into the deeper parts of the forest. They slain a number of minions along the way and soon reached a cave entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not being fond of darkness in the cave, Little Snow and Drizzler forced themselves to press on as they were already here and it would a waste to turn back! The girls stuck closely behind Zhang Yang while Fatty Han and Hundred Shots guarded their rear. As they proceeded on route while killing more small spiders, they finally arrived at the deepest part of the cave. It had a massive space and two gigantic spiders as tall as two-storey buildings sat on their webs, taking up almost half of the area. All eight of their legs were thicker than an elephant\u2019s and the hair covering them looked more like daggers.</p><br/><p>[Broodmother] (Green-Copper Boss)</p><br/><p>Level: 20</p><br/><p>HP: 60,000</p><br/><p>Little Snow whispered, \u201cHey, do you actually think we could level up to 20 after killing these monsters?\u201d Zhang Yang laughed loudly. \u201cOf course not!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the game, speaking loudly would not provoke or attract a monster\u2019s attention, unless you were in the monster\u2019s aggro range.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yang, where is this so called training ground that you spoke of?\u201d Fatty Han looked somewhat confused despite having faith in Zhang Yang. \u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d Zhang Yang spoke nonchalantly.</p><br/><p>The other four players began expressing confusion. This is a Level 20 boss, and even though it is a Green-Copper boss, the divided experience points earned after killing it would be low! The only way to gain even one level from this was if the boss had unlimited respawn and we killed it 40 to 50 times!</p><br/><p>The unpredictable Zhang Yang then pointed to the two rocks to their left and said, \u201cI\u2019ll give the signal to hide later. Fatty, Hundred, and Little Snow; you three must stand in the middle of the rocks while Drizzler and I defend the front.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Drizzler asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know soon enough! Get ready, I\u2019m starting the fight!\u201d Zhang Yang then wielded his sword and used .</p><br/><p>\u2018-133!\u2019 Normal attack.</p><br/><p>Broodmother quickly recovered from the stun effect that lasted for a second and then moved one of its long legs to thrust it towards Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>\u2018!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-78!\u2019 reflected damage.</p><br/><p>\u2018-178!\u2019 !</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang shouted \u201cStart the attack!\u201d after he made sure he kept the aggro on him. Little Snow and the others still had no clue to what Zhang Yang was thinking, but they played along and began to strike.</p><br/><p>95%, 83%, 71% \u2026 the boss\u2019 HP kept dropping at a tremendous rate.</p><br/><p>Within two minutes, Broodmother was left with only 15% HP. \u201cStop! It\u2019s time to hide!\u201d Zhang Yang ordered loudly. Having left a professional impression on the team, Little Snow and the others followed the plan even if they still had some doubts in him. They stood between the rocks once more, having to lean on the side as it was too small for three of them.</p><br/><p>14%, 12%, 11%, 10%!</p><br/><p>Broodmother gave a piercing shriek, ignoring Zhang Yang and climbed the web to its eggs. With a swing of its feet, 4 smaller spiders jumped out and tackled Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Broodmother hatched Baby Spiders!\u2019</p><br/><p>With the system notification sound, Zhang Yang withdrew to the rocks with Drizzler. With each taking one side, they stood their ground and defended Little Snow and their team. The Baby Spiders did not stop hatching from the eggs and swarmed at them.</p><br/><p>[Hatched Baby Spider] (Normal)</p><br/><p>Level: 15</p><br/><p>HP: 300</p><br/><p>\u201cKill the smaller ones!\u201d Zhang Yang yelled as he swung his sword, using that caused numerous damage texts to pop out, ranging from 286 to 302. Some of the Baby Spiders were killed, while the rest had only a sliver of health left. His necklace was frantically activating, popping out \u201c-20\u201d constantly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You and the party members around have killed Hatched Baby Spider. Obtained 110 Experience Points (50 points party bonus)!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You and the party members around have killed Hatched Baby Spider. Obtained 110 Experience Points (50 points party bonus)!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You and the party members around have killed Hatched Baby Spider. Obtained 110 Experience Points (50 points party bonus)!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Little Snow and the others were both surprised and happy. \u201cDo you understand now?\u201d Zhang Yang asked while he smiled at them. Fatty then asked, \u201cThese Baby Spiders\u2026 do they spawn unlimitedly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, as long as you don\u2019t kill the boss, they\u2019ll keep on spawning!\u201d and thus the secret was revealed. According to the boss mechanics, having lesser than 10% HP prompted it to continuously summon minions to fight. The proper way to fight was to battle until it was dead, but a player\u2019s wisdom knew no limits. Someone immediately thought of a way to abuse this mechanic to level up fast! As long as there were two high defense class players blocking the rocks with healers to sustain them, they could grind indefinitely without a problem!</p><br/><p>However, as soon as the method was revealed to the public, the game developers immediately modified the boss\u2019 mechanics to only summon ten Baby Spiders instead, demolishing the unlimited spawn method. Since Zhang Yang played the game a little later, he was not able to personally experience this method of levelling. He only heard it from others as they joked about \u2018God\u2019s Miracle\u2019.</p><br/><p>Aside from Little Snow, Zhang Yang and the rest of the party were attacking furiously. The two melee fighters were blocking any incoming attack while the range attackers fired from behind. Little Snow did her job to heal Zhang Yang and Drizzler. As they were blocking a stone each with half of their body, only 10 Baby Spiders could attack at once. Most of the aggro were held by Zhang Yang and having 70 points of defense, they only struck him with a measly 4 points of damage each. It was a breeze! Safe, fast, and with unlimited monster spawning, this was the smoothest way to level up!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang\u2019s devastating Attack Power truly allowed him to perform at his best here! As there is a high monster count, reflect damage could be considered a multi-target damage skill. Each damage could bring three to four \u2018120 and above\u2019 damage text. , on the other hand, was much more overwhelming. With high basic attack damage, it could accumulate up to 5,000 damage in a single use against 10 monsters!</p><br/><p>Drizzler did not have any multi-target skills, so her total damage output was far from Zhang Yang\u2019s; from 30%, it jumped to 74%.</p><br/><p>Fatty Han began to feel the excitement, \u201cThis is awesome! Look at my EXP bar go!\u201d Even Hundred Shots expressed his gratefulness, \u201cZhan Yu, you\u2019re amazing! You could even discover such an amazing way to level up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Two of them gained a level first. Even though it was slow for Zhang Yang to level up, it only took him 20 minutes longer to reach level 19! After an hour, Little Snow and Drizzler levelled up to 14.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

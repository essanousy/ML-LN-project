The silver, pale metal axe was coated in dried blood on the blade; one could only imagine exactly how many people he has killed, or perhaps drained their blood dry!</p><br/><p>\u2018!\u2019</p><br/><p>Other than the protection of the shield, he had nothing special to offer. His attack power was nothing much, yet it was the only thing that he depended on whenever his shield breaks. He would try to keep his attackers at bay with sheer attacks, capable of pushing healers to heal until they were out of MP! The boss would only use normal attacks on Zhang Yang. There was no need for Zhang Yang to rely on to survive as he usually did, unless he was up against an ulti.</p><br/><p>\u2018-2123!\u2019</p><br/><p>After the second attack only did he manage to damage Zhang Yang. However, the boss had already received 3 stacks of and had his own defense value dropped significantly.</p><br/><p>\u2018!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018!\u2019</p><br/><p>Completing the maximum 5 layers of , Zhang Yang had rendered the boss to be completely \u201cnaked\u201d as he fought him. Every attack was completely disregarding his defense!</p><br/><p>Sun Xin Yu and everyone else had surrounded the boss and pushed themselves to attack as fast as they can. Since the boss had other self-defensive measures hidden up his sleeves, they could not afford to drag the battle for long!</p><br/><p>99% 97%, 95%... Bit by bit the boss\u2019 HP dropped down like an old man walking down the stairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon from the abyss! Heed my call and engulf Drizzler\u2019s soul!\u201d 10 seconds into the battle, Angelo raised both his hands in the air and activated a skill.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Angelo has used !\u2019</p><br/><p>Right in front of her, a mirror image character of Drizzler appeared. With a dark hue and a translucent body, the summoned shadow character was a splitting image of her!</p><br/><p>[Demonic Shadow] (Normal, Summon)</p><br/><p>Level: 41</p><br/><p>HP: 10,000</p><br/><p>Once the shadow appeared, the aggro was automatically fixed to Wei Yan Er. However, as the timing would have it, Han Ying Xue had cast a healing spell on Zhang Yang, drawing the aggro away from Wei Yan Er to herself.</p><br/><p>Wei Yan Er shouted angrily: \u201cBastard, don\u2019t run away! Don\u2019t you dare look down on me! I will chop you up into ground meat!\u201d She quickly broke formation from her spot beside the boss and chased after the Demonic Shadow.</p><br/><p>In the eyes of everyone, she was inexplicably talking to the air, murderously raising her axe and dashing towards Han Ying Xue.</p><br/><p>\u2018Slash!\u2019</p><br/><p>She slashed in Han Ying Xue\u2019s general direction with her axe.</p><br/><p>\u2018-1,328!\u2019</p><br/><p>In the meantime, Han Ying Xue screamed and a damage text appeared above her head. She then stared at Wei Yan Er and said, \u201cYou little brat! You should hit the shadow, why are you hitting me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it was the shadow that slashed you and I\u2019m avenging you! You are my cousin, how could I possibly slash you?!\u201d Wei Yan Er quickly answered, feeling that she was wrongly blamed!</p><br/><p>In the eyes of Wei Yan Er, Demonic Shadow turned around to face her instead of attacking Han Ying Xue. Similarly, Demonic Shadow also slashed towards Wei Yan Er with axe.</p><br/><p>\u2018-1,334!\u2019</p><br/><p>2,296!\u2019</p><br/><p>One normal strike and one totaled up to a massive amount, taking off Wei Yan Er\u2019s HP by 3,600!</p><br/><p>\u201cSister, quickly help me!\u201d Wei Yan Er was well aware of her own skills, and , has not been used by Demonic Shadow yet! After she passed the quest at A difficulty, she had a 50% healing reduction effect along with the 150% melee damage of the skill, which was very powerful!</p><br/><p>Han Ying Xue had cast on Wei Yan Er, at the same time, she also cast so both of them healed about 1,000 HP, and finally she cast a on Wei Yan Er.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damage absorb!\u2019</p><br/><p>Demonic Shadow slashed Wei Yan Er again but this time the damage was fully absorbed by . However, the 50% healing reduction effect from the attack, , still appeared across Wei Yan Er\u2019s head!</p><br/><p>Wei Yan Er already summoned her [Servant: Centuar Guard] and attacked Demonic Shadow together. Hundred Shots and Fatty Han\u2019s was effective on the servant as well. Although it was only increased 3% damage, it was still worthwhile!</p><br/><p>Even though the Demonic Shadow\u2019s HP was higher than Wei Yan Er\u2019s HP, a peerless healer was standing behind her, so how ever much damage she took from Demonic Shadow would be covered by healing. Ten seconds later, Demonic Shadow turned into a ray of white light and crashed down on the ground. Wei Yan Er quickly picked up a blood-red shiny thorn from Demonic Shadow\u2019s corpse.</p><br/><p>[Evil Blood Thorn] (Consumable)</p><br/><p>Use: Dispel Angelo\u2019s .</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brat, do not immediately use [Evil Blood Thorn] when Angelo is casting , wait for demonic Snow to cast a on Daffodil Daydream first!\u201d Zhang Yang promptly reminded Wei Yan Er.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are such a nag, am I that stupid?\u201d Wei Yan Er pursed her lips.</p><br/><p>Another ten seconds later, right after another attack from Angelo, he shouted, \u201cDemon from the abyss, heal me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Immune!\u2019</p><br/><p>A black colored light shield immediately encircled Angelo, and the debuffs from and deadly poison effects appeared across his head were all dispelled. He even gained immunity to all the attacks from Zhang Yang and the gang. Still, Angelo never stopped attacking Zhang Yang and continued hacking away with his axe.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Angelo has obtained \u2019s effect. Recover 3% HP every second and immune to all damage. Lasts for 33 seconds!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Ying Xue immediately cast a on Daffodil Daydream and yelled, \u201cYan Er, break the shield!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Yan Er had already taken out the [Evil Blood Thorn] from her inventory and was at the ready. Once after she heard Han Ying Xue giving the order, she promptly targeted Angelo and selected [Evil Blood Thorn].</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Angelo\u2019s \u2019s effect has dispelled!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018-4,000!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-5,000!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-5,000!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Angelo\u2019s shield was broken and scattered into pieces of black colour flames which shot towards Zhang Yang and the gang and huge damage texts floated over all of their heads. Han Ying Xue quickly cast and on everyone. Fortunately Angelo\u2019s melee attacks were not any powerful. While healing the tank, Han Ying Xue also had enough time to recover everyone\u2019s HP to full.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, Angelo\u2019s HP recovered from 88% to 94% which wasted half their efforts.</p><br/><p>Ten seconds later, Angelo used another and a mirror image character of Hundred Shots appeared.</p><br/><p>Conversely, would only clone the shadow of player and not pets, therefore, the attack power from Hunter\u2019s shadow would definitely be much lower! Hundred Shots was a Beastmaster and almost half of his attacks came from his pet. So how could the Demonic Shadow defeat Hundred Shots if didn\u2019t clone Hundred Shots\u2019 pet?</p><br/><p>Besides, Demonic Shadow\u2019s aggro was drawn by Hundred Shots\u2019 pet. So, Demonic Shadow was foolishly fighting against Hundred Shots\u2019 pet! On the other hand, how could a cornered melee Hunter produce high damage? Thus, Han Ying Xue did not need to be distracted and Hundred Shots defeated the Demonic Shadow easily.</p><br/><p>A Beastmaster\u2019s pet could share its master\u2019s attributes, thus, the stronger its master, the stronger the pet it is! Currently, Hundred Shots had 5,240 HP while his pet, Wind Wolf, had 5,920 HP which was much higher HP than its master!</p><br/><p>Han Ying Xue had the previous experience of Angelo\u2019s \u2019s effect, she casted a on Daffodil Daydream five seconds in advance. So, when Angelo used his , Han Ying Xue immediately shouted, \u201cHundred Shots, break the shield!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Shoot!\u2019</p><br/><p>Angelo only got to recover his HP once before his shield was dispelled again. The shield which broke into pieces caused massive damage to the gang once again!</p><br/><p>85%!</p><br/><p>It was really hard to fight against Angelo as the gang had clearly reduced 22% of Angelo\u2019s HP but Angelo in turn, had abruptly recovered 9% of his HP!</p><br/><p>Ten seconds later, right after was dispelled, the third was used by Angelo once again. This time, a mirror image character of Endless Starlight appeared.</p><br/><p>Endless Starlight fought against Demonic Shadow confidently this time as Demonic Shadow would fight back and he did not need to worry about running out of MP anymore! Luckily, this Demonic Shadow was a clone of Endless Starlight but obviously it did not know how to heal using or . Otherwise, the gang would need to surrender if any Defender, Guardian or healing classes were selected by !</p><br/><p>In spite of Demonic Shadow\u2019s high defense value and most of Endless Starlight\u2019s damage being Holy Damage, the damage wasn\u2019t affected by defense value! Even so, when Endless Starlight was fighting against Demonic Shadow, Angelo had already used for three seconds!</p><br/><p>\u201cStarlight, hurry up and throw the thorn!\u201d Han Ying Xue already cast a on Daffodil Daydream.</p><br/><p>Endless Starlight hurriedly picked up [Evil Blood Thorn] and quickly threw it towards Angelo without aiming carefully.</p><br/><p>\u2018Shoot!\u2019</p><br/><p>Angelo\u2019s broken into pieces once again and causing huge damage to everyone. His HP recovered from 74% to 86% which was 1% higher than the second time the shield was broken!</p><br/><p>Endless Starlight felt so sorry and guilty. He said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf apologizing is so useful then it is pointless to have the police!\u201d Wei Yan Er gave a short laugh.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s alright, we just need to fight a little bit longer!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was clear about usual pattern of Angelo using his skills. Ten seconds after breaking , Angelo would use and twenty seconds later, Angelo would use once again. Thus, players had only twenty seconds to kill Demonic Shadow and pick up the [Evil Blood Thorn]!</p><br/><p>The fourth time of , a mirror image character of Han Ying Yue appeared.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang immediately yelled, \u201cDemon Snow focus and kill the Demonic Shadow, do not bother about me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn!\u201d Han Ying Xue answered Zhang Yang but she still cast on Zhang Yang before casting a on herself. After that, she started to cast on Demonic Shadow.</p><br/><p>Demonic Shadow would not know how to use healing skills, so its only attack skill was . Demonic Shadow immediately fought back against Han Ying Xue.</p><br/><p>\u2018-1,812! -1,831! -1,819! -1,823!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Damage absorb!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-542! -1,523! -1,511!\u2019</p><br/><p>Although it was the same attack, Han Ying Xue drank a [Beginner Power Potion] just now, so, her attack power had instantly increased by 20%!</p><br/><p>However, the disadvantage of being healer class was shown, by the fourth time both of them had cast on each other, Demonic Shadow had about 2,800 remaining HP while Han Ying Xue had only 1,700 HP. If both of them continued casting on each other like that, they would die at the same time!</p><br/><p>Luckily, this was Han Ying Xue! She still had an instantaneous healing skill, which was ! Even if she never learned , Zhang YanG still had two skills to aid teammates, which were and &lt; Vanguard's Aggression&gt;. So, it was unnecessary for Han Ying Xue to worry about being killed!</p><br/><p>Han Ying Xue used only twelve seconds to defeat the Demonic Shadow. She immediately picked up [Evil Blood Thorn] and waited for Angelo to use .</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon from the abyss, heal me!\u201d Angelo shouted loudly and activated !</p><br/><p>Han Ying Xue cast a on Daffodil Daydream and threw the [Evil Blood Thorn] towards Angelo.</p><br/><p>\u2018Shoot! had broken!\u2019</p><br/><p>Angelo recovered his HP once and back to 78% HP!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is really tiring killing this boss!\u201d Fatty Han complained. Even though they successfully break the shield right after Angelo recovered his HP once, the HP recovery was 3% which was also equaled to 45,000 HP!</p><br/><p>\u201cCut the bull sh*t and just fight the boss!\u201d Sun Xin Yu coldly said.</p><br/><p>Fatty Han suddenly had a cold sweat and dared not to voice out anymore. But he personally sent a private message to Zhang Yang, \u201cLittle Yang, I never thought that you would favor girls with strong personality. You dared keep such a tough girl! This is the first time I\u2019m not envious of you having the luck to be adored by a pretty girl!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang got speechless and replied, \u201cCut your bull crap and continue attacking the boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, you are really acting like her husband already! Sigh, somebody had hoes before bros, I despise you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Because Angelo had HP recovery skills, if the gang could break the shield once Angelo casted , then they could reduce about 15% of Angelo\u2019s HP every minute. But if they were unsuccessful in breaking the in the beginning, sometimes Angelo\u2019s HP reduction could be much lesser than his HP recovery!</p><br/><p>They worked so hard and successfully reduced Angelo\u2019s HP to 6% in nine minutes!</p><br/><p>They had used such a long time to fight Angelo, that even though Han Ying Xue had her skill costs reduced by 75%, she was at her limit! If it was not due to the fact that she was an expert in MP management, her MP would be totally running out! Still, she had only 7% of her MP remaining.</p><br/><p>What was most unfortunate was that selected Han Ying Xue this time. After killing Demonic Shadow, her MP was almost depleted and she did not even have enough MP to heal her HP to full!</p><br/><p>\u201cRanged positions stand behind melee and I will use !\u201d Zhang Yang immediately made a decision without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Five seconds later, Angelo used .</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang hurriedly caged everyone into his \u2019s protection barrier, at the same time, he also used .</p><br/><p>Both Han Ying Xue and Zhang Yang had an unspoken bond, and then she immediately threw the [Evil Blood Thorn].</p><br/><p>Shoot!</p><br/><p>Angelo\u2019s shield broken into pieces again, with the effect of , it almost nullified the damage on everyone!</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon Snow, don\u2019t need to heal anyone and use this few seconds to recover your MP!\u201d Zhang Yang said. He also used the necklace [Heart of Fallen Warrior] and Angelo\u2019s damage was instantly reduced to about 500.</p><br/><p>In \u2018God\u2019s Miracle\u2019, Spellcasters would recover their MP by relying on Spirit attribute during combat. But this had to follow the so-called \u201c5 seconds principle\u201d where the Spellcaster needs to stop casting any spells or skills for 5 seconds before the MP recovery that relied on the Spirit attribute would kick in!</p><br/><p>Ten seconds later, Han Ying Xue\u2019s MP recovered to 7% while Angelo remained at 5% HP. Angelo used another and Endless Starlight was selected this time!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother about Demonic Shadow, everyone focus and fight against Angelo. If we don\u2019t kill him this round, we are going to be annihilated! Drink your Power Potion if it is not in cool down and release all the damage you could to Angelo!\u201d Zhang Yang shouted loudly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

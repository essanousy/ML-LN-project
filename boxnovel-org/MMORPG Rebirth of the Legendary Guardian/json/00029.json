Make sure that there\u2019s at least 5 meters of distance between each other!\u201d Zhang Yang commanded as he pulled aggro, \u201cThe 3 melee attackers! Snowy Death, you stand on boss\u2019 left and Phantom Day on its right. Crimson Fire, you\u2019ll attack from behind it! F*ck, Snowy Death, can\u2019t you differentiate left from right? Go to the other side!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! All out, ramp up the DPS! The aura effect might seem to cause only a little DoT but every 3 seconds drains away 30 HP per character which would lead to 300 HP in total. Healers might not be able to handle that much healing once it\u2019s dragged on!\u201d said Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>The party nodded in agreement. Everyone performed at their best and attacked the boss with all their might.</p><br/><p>All 6 bosses from Hard and Hardcore Mode had given Zhang Yang and the party a total of 18 equipment, which was about 2 equipment per player on average. Compared to when they had first started the dungeon raid, it was a huge improvement! Especially those who had obtained new weapons, their damage dealing capabilities had increased by leaps and bounds.</p><br/><p>With both Phantom Day and Fatty Han already in possession of strong damaging power, their attack power had risen to a whole new level after swapping in new weapons, enough to allow them to be on par with Zhang Yang!</p><br/><p>\u201cZhan Yu, check out the stats, I\u2019ve already caught up to you!\u201d said Phantom Day delightedly.</p><br/><p>It was true. According to the damage statistics, Zhang Yang, Phantom Day and Fatty Han were in a rat race for the top 3 places in the list. With their miniscule difference in damage output, any first strike would have allowed that player to place first.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed, \u201cAren\u2019t you a little shameless to be competing damage output with a Guardian?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Are you really a Guardian?\u201d Phantom Day bemoaned.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Demonized Momorermo has demonized player Defiant Monk!\u2019</p><br/><p>During the intense fight, the boss had suddenly turned its head around as he directed a blood-red mist towards Defiant Monk! The mist flew at such an incredible speed that Defiant Monk was not able to react in time. His entire body suddenly shone with a crimson glow, expanding to at least double of his original size while his HP increased to 3,000 points!</p><br/><p>\u201cRanged players including healers, quickly get away from Defiant Monk and nuke his HP!\u201d commanded Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>Hundred Shots and the rest of the ranged players switched their targets immediately and fired towards Defiant Monk.</p><br/><p>Being controlled by the boss, Defiant Monk had lost control over his own character and could only watch helplessly as his character proceeded slowly towards Silky Snow who was the closest to him.</p><br/><p>\u2018-52!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-47!\u2019</p><br/><p>A chain of damage figures landed on Defiant Monk and his HP was briskly reduced to 0. His body then returned to its normal size and his HP rewound to its original value.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop! Resume attacking the boss!\u201d Zhang Yang multitasked while maintaining his watch on the situation with Defiant Monk all along.</p><br/><p>Still, Hundred Shots and the rest of the ranged attackers were a little slow in reacting, allowing their fireballs and arrows free rein and damaging half of Defiant Monk\u2019s 300+ HP!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou beasts! Couldn\u2019t you guys be a little gentler?\u201d Defiant Monk hurriedly consumed a red pot to reduce the healer\u2019s load.</p><br/><p>Another 10 seconds or so had passed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Demonized Momorermo has demonized player Phantom Day!\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang swiftly took off and pulled the boss away. \u201cRanged, attack Phantom Day. Melees, don\u2019t even try. You\u2019d be wiped out instantly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShitty boss, why the hell would you pick me?! Did I ever offend you?\u201d Phantom Day was pissed, as his damage output was a close tie against Zhang Yang\u2019s and Fatty Han\u2019s but now that he was demonized, he could only watch as his name plummeted down the damage statistics.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy fellow comrades, fire upon me!\u201d Phantom Day shouted, \u201cKill me! Hurry!\u201d</p><br/><p>With their initial experience, the ranged attackers became quicker in halting their attacks after depleting Phantom Day\u2019s HP. It was fortunate that they did it in time as he would have been killed by his own teammates with his measly HP that was less than 300.</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty, have you seen the crystal yet?\u201d Zhang Yang asked Fatty Han just as he saw the boss\u2019 HP drop to 80%.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, I saw it!\u201d Fatty Han replied just as quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, don\u2019t hit it yet! Wait for a little longer!\u201d Zhang Yang said as his eye locked onto the boss\u2019 HP bar.</p><br/><p>79%, 78%, 77%...</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty! Unleash your attacks upon the crystal!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Fatty Han changed his target immediately, firing his arrows toward the crystal that was half a person in height.</p><br/><p>76%!</p><br/><p>\u2018Crack!\u2019</p><br/><p>The crystal broke and a blue, translucent, hemispheric light shield about 3 meters long in diameter appeared in its place.</p><br/><p>75%!</p><br/><p>\u201cMomorermo is going to show you the real demon!\u201d Momorermo had suddenly stopped attacking to chant something in an odd language, a progress bar appearing on its head.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone stop and follow me!\u201d Zhang Yang turned and dashed towards the light shield. \u201cThis boss\u2019 skill has a 3-second cast time! Make haste, everyone!\u201d</p><br/><p>The party members had formed some sort of spontaneous reaction to Zhang Yang\u2019s order and had ran with him into the light shield.</p><br/><p>\u201cFlame Emperor! Snowy Death! The both of you are too slow! Hurry up and run!\u201d As he got into the shield, Zhang Yang turned and saw both Flame Emperor and Snowy Death being left behind. Even with Zhang Yang leading the party, each player\u2019s response speed still varied.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Momorermo has casted !\u2019</p><br/><p>A dark light with Momorermo as its core blasted out, its range reaching more than 200 meters!</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Flame Emperor has died!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Snowy Death has died!\u2019</p><br/><p>Two enormous \u2018-1,000\u2019 damage text appeared on their heads as both Flame Emperor and Snowy Death succumbed to the blast.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out of this shield and go back to your original positions! Continue the attack!\u201d Zhang Yang rushed out of the shield and used on the boss, stunning it.</p><br/><p>The shield then faded after a few seconds.</p><br/><p>Everyone spread back out to their positions and resumed the original attacking momentum but the loss of two members had greatly reduced their attacking power. Luckily the two who died were not the main damage outputs so the impact was not as disastrous. Since two of the players died, the healers also had a lighter load in healing the remaining team members.</p><br/><p>\u201cHundred Shots, be my slave!\u201d Demonized Momorermo let out a deafening growl and flung a blood-red mist towards Hundred Shots.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Demonized Momorermo has demonized player Hundred Shots!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cRanged attackers, fire towards Hundred Shots!\u201d Zhang Yang instantly commanded.</p><br/><p>Under Zhang Yang\u2019s instructions, the battle progressed smoothly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Demonized Momorermo has demonized player Slim and Handsome!\u2019</p><br/><p>Less than a minute later, the boss had turned and threw the mist towards Fatty Han.</p><br/><p>\u201cMelees stop what you\u2019re doing! Ranged, nuke Fatty Han back to our side!\u201d Zhang Yang commanded swiftly. The boss had 53% HP currently. If they had dropped it to 50%, would be triggered and with the demonized players still on the field, it would have been extremely chaotic, resulting in more deaths!</p><br/><p>Once Fatty Han was released from demonization, Zhang Yang said quickly, \u201cFatty, quickly break the crystal!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it!\u201d Fatty Han hurriedly fired at the crystal.</p><br/><p>52%!</p><br/><p>51%!</p><br/><p>\u2018Crack!\u2019 With the crystal broken, the blue, translucent shield reappeared.</p><br/><p>50%!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Momorermo will show you the real demon once more!\u201d Momorermo stopped its attacks and began casting .</p><br/><p>\u201cSprint your way to the shield! Don\u2019t insist on attacking! Only living players can deal damage!\u201d said Zhang Yang as he sprinted towards the light shield.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Momorermo has used !\u2019</p><br/><p>A wave of dark light pulsated through the entire field.</p><br/><p>\u201cCarry on the attack!\u201d Zhang Yang dashed towards the boss and brandished his sword, dealing significant damage.</p><br/><p>\u201cSilky! Ocean! How\u2019s your MP?\u201d Zhang Yang\u2019s main concern was still the healers\u2019 healing endurance due to \u2019s existence which would drop everyone\u2019s HP to their deaths once the healers ran out of MP.</p><br/><p>\u201cI still have 40% MP but my blue pot cooldown is almost done!\u201d said Ocean Despair.</p><br/><p>\u201cI only have 30%. I just consumed one MP pot!\u201d Silky Snow had also hurriedly replied.</p><br/><p>Silky Snow had expended her MP much faster than Ocean Despair as she had to make sure everyone had on them.</p><br/><p>[Regeneration]: Restores target\u2019s HP to the equivalent of 200% Magic Attack every 3 seconds over 15 seconds.</p><br/><p>The boss still had 50% HP, this would be a little difficult!</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep up the effort! We can do this!\u201d said Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>40%, 35%, 30%\u2026 the boss\u2019 HP continuously dropped.</p><br/><p>\u201cStand strong! Just one more and there\u2019ll be hope for us to clear this!\u201d Zhang Yang encouraged the entire party. \u201cFatty! You can break the crystal now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRoger that!\u201d Fatty Han immediately drew his bow to shoot the crystal. After a chain of attacks, the crystal shattered and the blue, translucent light shield appeared once again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Momorermo has used !\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cZhan Yu! My blue pots are out!\u201d declared Silky Snow.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can do a few more!\u201d Ocean Despair reported.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, got it!\u201d Zhang Yang used on the boss and said, \u201cFatty! When the next crystal spawns, break it right away!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p><br/><p>22%, 19%, 16%\u2026</p><br/><p>Without Silky Snow\u2019s , the entire team\u2019s HP began to drop significantly, leading Ocean Despair to frantically spam . His MP bar that did not have much to begin with flashed in alert.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yang! The crystal has spawned!\u201d Fatty Han yelled and immediately fired.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang scanned the area and located the crystal\u2019s location, hastily making his way towards it while pulling the boss. \u201cEveryone gather at the shield!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the boss\u2019 random demonization?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe shield makes us immune to it, no fear!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Crack!\u2019 Again, the crystal broke and the hemisphere appeared.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang withdrew himself to the very border of the shield and had the boss blocked outside of it. This way, he was immune to damage yet it allowed him to continue dealing damage to the boss.</p><br/><p>\u201cOcean! Silky! How long till you can consume another blue pot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c24 seconds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c14 seconds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, after you consume the blue pots, focus your healings only on Fatty, Phantom Day and me. Ignore the rest of the team!\u201d [Beginner Mana Potion] could only restore 100 MP, forcing Zhang Yang to make sacrifices.</p><br/><p>15%, 14%, 13%, 12%. Just as quickly as it appeared, the shield vanished and everyone began to lose 30 HP every 3 seconds once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cOcean Despair, become my slave!\u201d With the boss\u2019 demonization, Ocean Despair\u2019s body expanded and he became the boss\u2019 underling.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind him! Focus on the boss! Just half a minute more and we\u2019re through!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang dragged Momorermo away from Ocean Despair.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a waste! If only he could consume one more blue pot to heal us for a little longer before being demonized!\u201d Fatty Han murmured.</p><br/><p>11%, 10%, 9%, 8%!</p><br/><p>Silky Snow kept her eyes on the blue pot\u2019s cooldown time. Once the time was up, she quickly consumed one and her MP went up by 100 points.</p><br/><p>Immediately, she casted on Zhang Yang, Fatty Han, and Phantom Day, expending her MP. A \u2018-30\u2019 red damage text floated across her head, depleting her last drop of HP and killing her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Silky Snow has died!\u2019</p><br/><p>7%!</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Crimson Fire has died!\u2019</p><br/><p>6%!</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Hundred Shots has died!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Defiant Monk has died!\u2019</p><br/><p>5%!</p><br/><p>4%!</p><br/><p>3%!</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Phantom Day has died!\u2019</p><br/><p>2%!</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Slim and Handsome has died!\u2019</p><br/><p>Momorermo still had 1,747 HP left but Zhang Yang only had 124!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can do it!\u201d everyone cheered.</p><br/><p>Just in the nick of time, a crystal spawned!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang was thrilled, using towards it and slashed his sword repeatedly against it.</p><br/><p>Even though the crystal pillar had 1,000 HP but since it had 0 defense value, its HP had dropped rapidly.</p><br/><p>The boss came up to him!</p><br/><p>\u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang swiftly activated on the pillar, depleting its remaining HP. He jumped right into the shield as soon as it had appeared, stopping his HP from dropping further at a worrying 4 points remaining. He then immediately turned and attacked the boss!</p><br/><p>1%!</p><br/><p>0%!</p><br/><p>With a loud, enraged growl, the red-skinned monster had finally fallen.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! The party you are in has killed Demonized Momorermo. Obtained 45,050 EXP (50 points Party Bonus)!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWe did it!\u201d everyone shouted in celebration.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

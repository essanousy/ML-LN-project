Without much hesitation, he added a valuable Skill Point on the divine skill.</p><br/><p>[Block] (Level 2): Raise your shield, blocking one frontal attack from the enemy for 1 second. After a successful block, it will cause 100% damage to the enemy, generating a huge amount of aggro. Builds some Rage. Cooldown time: 9 seconds. Requirement: Shield.</p><br/><p>The reduction in cooldown time of the skill had not only increased the attack immunity but more importantly, had also increased the usage frequency of . This was of utmost importance to Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>All the substantial quests in Beginner Village had already been completed. The next objective would be to level up to Level 10 and then proceed onwards to the Capital!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang had no other option now but to solely depend on grinding through monster killing. He had come to the Scorched Valley where there were the fewest players, intending to grind here until he reached Level 10. With , his current grinding ability had risen to a whole different level, making it harder for other players to catch up!</p><br/><p>Before entering the valley, Zhang Yang was surprised to see that there were now more than 10 players at the mouth of the valley. All of them did not hide their names and shared the same name tags of \u2018So-and-So, Rogue Clan\u2019 above their heads, most of them appearing to be Level 5 \u2013 6 players.</p><br/><p>\u201cRogue Clan!\u201d Zhang Yang could not help but grit his teeth.</p><br/><p>Rogue Clan was a guild. There were Guild Master Rogue Bunny, Vice Guild Master Bunny Bro Two, and following their seniority ranks, it would be Bunny Bro Three and Bunny Bro Four\u2026 In short they were all bunny brothers! This guild was very popular in Zhang Yang\u2019s previous life but it was not because their guild was strong, it was because everyone in this guild was a hooligan!</p><br/><p>Guild Master Rogue Bunny was said to be a gangster too in real life. The people in his guild were originally his gang members and were regularly involved in organized crime such as cheating, abducting and bullying. This rogue guild had never changed its objective even upon entering the game. As long as it was beneficial to them, they were willing to do anything, making up whatever scoundrels tricks they could think of along the way!</p><br/><p>When the guild Clear Water was going against Liu Wei\u2019s guild, Myth, Liu Wei had hired Rogue Clan to bash members of Clear Water. Those rogues had spammed deliberate messages of insults and slanders in the Capital every day, using words which were extremely derogatory and vile that would even disgust one to nausea!</p><br/><p>Rogue Bunny had even personally led dozens of men and stationed themselves at the entrance of the Clear Water Guild. Whenever a female player came out, they would take off their pants, slap their asses and talk dirty, an absolute demonstration of the absence of their ethics!</p><br/><p>The frustrating part was that the Clear Water Guild was not powerful enough, and thus could only set up their base in the Capital\u2019s zone instead of freely picking their own base outside. This was primarily because PK among players was restricted in the Capital.</p><br/><p>Unable to do anything, Zhang Yang and the others could only watch these scoundrels behave the way they were! During that time, the situation had caused hundreds of female players to not go online for days, indirectly affecting the morale of male players.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang had hated these guys for a while now. Just as he wanted to draw his sword and PK, he aborted this idea reluctantly.</p><br/><p>--Beginner Village was also protected by the system; players were unable to engage one another in a PK.</p><br/><p>\u201cRogue Clan is camping this field. Other players leave the field immediately or we will kill you back to Level 0!\u201d a player with the name Bunny Bro Nine spoke arrogantly when he saw Zhang Yang walking towards them.</p><br/><p>Ah the arrogance! With just a few Level 5 or 6 players, they had wanted to take over the entire field!</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, there is really a boss inside! I think it\u2019s called Firebender Barr, a Black-Steel Boss! But there is a player fighting it now!\u201d a Thief player appeared suddenly from mode and said excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss is indeed Boss, knowing there is a boss inside even before entering, awesome!\u201d one of his subordinate pandered.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d Rogue Bunny laughed, all conceited and superior, \u201cLet us have this boss killed and have the system issue an announcement! By then, the Rogue Clan will be renowned across the world. We can then recruit thousands of brothers and become rich!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of Boss, brilliant, valiant and prophetic! You made us all sell our things to buy these gaming helmets and play the game as a group. No one but Boss would have been so bold!\u201d another man sang his praise.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, Boss, I\u2019ve heard that the server only makes announcements for being the first to kill a Black-Steel Boss\u2026\u201d one of his men stated.</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense! You dare doubt Boss\u2019 words, was your head kicked by a donkey?\u201d Bunny Bro Eight lectured him immediately.</p><br/><p>Rogue Bunny threw out a kick and sent that player who objected flying, \u201cIf you were so smart, you wouldn\u2019t need me as your boss now, would you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Boss is brilliant!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPeerless, handsome Boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlmighty Boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rogue Bunny shifted his gaze and saw Zhang Yang watching their little show by the side. He then angrily said, \u201cYou there, fool, why are you still here? Do you want to be killed back to Level 0?\u201d</p><br/><p>These people did not seem to know that the Beginner Village had PK restrictions. An idea came to Zhang Yang\u2019s mind and he grinned, \u201cKill me back to Level 0? Hehe, come and try, I am insusceptible to damage!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, insusceptible to damage, in your dreams!\u201d Bunny Bro Four raised his sword to slash towards Zhang Yang\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang did not move nor evade but welcomed the sword with a smile!</p><br/><p>\u201cSha!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Beginner Sword cut right through Zhang Yang\u2019s head but it had seemed to be cutting through a shadow. Zhang Yang was completely unaffected.</p><br/><p>-- With the protection of \u2018System God\u2019, every player was the same.</p><br/><p>Bunny Bro Four was incredulous, he waved his sword a few more times but it was the same, the system had nullified the attack.</p><br/><p>Rogue Bunny and his gang gasped in shock, their eyes staring wide as saucers.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss! He really is insusceptible to damage!\u201d Bunny Bro Five shouted.</p><br/><p>Rogue Bunny immediately replaced his overbearing and arrogant expression with a smile and said, \u201cFriend, I\u2026 I am Rogue Bunny, Guild Master of Rogue Clan. Brother, let\u2019s be friends!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out of my way! I\u2019m gonna go f*ck the boss!\u201d Zhang Yang said with an intentional rough tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, brother, wait!\u201d Rogue Bunny stopped Zhang Yang at once, his face wearing a smile of flattery, \u201cDon\u2019t be so spiteful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang sneered and said, \u201cYou want in on my indestructible body?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, how did you get this indestructible body? Is there any secret?\u201d Rogue Bunny asked in earnest.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang looked as though he was so very contented. He seemed like he wanted to share it with them, yet had to hold himself back, all while looking at Rogue Bunny and smiling.</p><br/><p>Rogue Bunny was restless, \u201cBrother, bro, our acquaintance is fate. Don\u2019t be so selfish!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang put up a mysterious front, carefully peeking around. Rogue Bunny and his followers came nearer and surrounded him, wearing the same expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually this secret is very simple. All you need to do is to chant the spell!\u201d Zhang Yang exposed his \u2018secret\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat spell?\u201d more than 10 people asked simultaneously.</p><br/><p>\u201cWee-Aar-Ol-Stew-Pee!\u201d Zhang Yang lowered his voice and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe it, try it out!\u201d Zhang Yang shrugged.</p><br/><p>Rogue Bunny randomly pointed at one of his men and said, \u201cCome, chop me!\u201d</p><br/><p>That man eagerly picked up his weapon and wanted to swing it\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Rogue Bunny quickly shouted, \u201cI haven\u2019t chanted the spell!\u201d</p><br/><p>He adjusted his expression and chanted loudly: \u201cWee-Aar-Ol-Stew-Pee!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHere I come!\u201d</p><br/><p>That man, too, roared before he gave a chop with his sword.</p><br/><p>Null!</p><br/><p>Rogue Bunny was delighted, he immediately laughed out loud and said, \u201cIt really worked! Haha, indestructible body!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, now that we have this secret, we can kill any boss we want and wipe out anyone we wish?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rogue Bunny waved his arm mightily and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go, follow me and let\u2019s kill the boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Zhang Yang quickly said, \u201cThe duration of the spell is very short, so you have to keep chanting. It may also not work if your voice is not loud enough!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOK, we got it! You can fuck off!\u201d Rogue Bunny resumed his wretched character, burning the bridge after he had crossed the river. He laughed maniacally and led his men towards the valley.</p><br/><p>More than 10 players rampaged without a care and gained the aggro of 7 to 8 Fire Elementals shortly.</p><br/><p>These people were fearless. Each of them loudly chanted \u201cWee-Aar-Ol-Stew-Pee\u201d and started to fight the monsters.</p><br/><p>Players of Level 5-6 versus Level 10 monsters. As a result\u2026</p><br/><p>Complete annihilation!</p><br/><p>Some ten minutes later, these people resurrected and came back running.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, why is it not working?\u201d Bunny Bro Eight complained.</p><br/><p>Rogue Bunny thought about it and said, \u201cMaybe we didn\u2019t chant loud enough? Let\u2019s try it again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWee-Aar-Ol-Stew-Pee!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Again, all of them got completely wiped out.</p><br/><p>Another 10 minutes later, the Rogue Clan members ran back after resurrecting.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, I think we have been fooled! Doesn\u2019t the spell sound like \u2018we are all stupid\u2019?\u201d a man voiced his suspicion.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck you! You are the stupid one!\u201d Rogue Bunny was mad, \u201cChant it louder, go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are all stupid!\u201d</p><br/><p>They went on in batches.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang watched them for a while in a hidden spot at the mouth of the valley, laughing until his belly ached. He waved his Beginner Sword and began his grinding journey.</p><br/><p>The first time he had came here to collect Refined Fire Essences, he was alone. So before he could even enter one-tenth of the valley, monsters had already spawned behind him. Therefore he did not have to continue moving inwards.</p><br/><p>Recalling that the members of Rogue Clan had said that there was a boss in the valley, Zhang Yang got excited and made his way in as he grinded.</p><br/><p>As he reached the middle of the valley, Zhang Yang came across a sacrificial altar that took up a lot of space. Complicated magic circles were engraved in the middle of the altar, with white rays flowing out of it.</p><br/><p>In the center of the sacrificial altar, a crimson-colored Fire Elemental was fighting an elf girl cladded in a snow-white sorcerer\u2019s robe. The other Fire Elementals were far away from the altar.</p><br/><p>The Fire Elemental currently engaged in the battle was significantly bigger than the other ordinary Fire Elementals. Its color was also much deeper. Each attack delivered by the Fire Elemental carried a dazzling fire glow. That elf girl was obviously in a disadvantageous position. She kept dodging but was still cornered and attacked. Her HP bar reaching an alarming level!</p><br/><p>[Firebender Barr] (Black-Steel Boss)</p><br/><p>Level: 10</p><br/><p>HP: 2286/5000</p><br/><p>[Calina] (Normal)</p><br/><p>Level: 10</p><br/><p>HP: 537/2000</p><br/>\n</div>"}

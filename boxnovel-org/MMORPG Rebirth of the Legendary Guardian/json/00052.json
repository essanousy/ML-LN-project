Luck was not something you can control. There\u2019s really nothing you can do about if something went bad and luck did not favor you.</p><br/><p>On their second run, Hundred Shots\u2019 first was already a miss, leading the team to death once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the f*ck is going on!? I swear that this is just an easy boss, but how did we get ourselves in this freaking shitty situation!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty, I think it\u2019s your karma biting back at you. This is probably a payback for peeping at your neighbor\u2019s little sister.\u201d Zhang Yang joked.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to hell little Yang! I\u2019m a true gentleman! Why would I try to peek under a girl\u2019s skirt?\u201d Fatty Han said a honest face.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Bro! Zhan Yu didn\u2019t say anything about peeking under a skirt. Did you just dig your own grave?\u201d Drizzler giggled away happily.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang frowned, suddenly feeling envious of Fatty Han. \u201cWhy did you address him as Big Bro and I\u2019m the uncle?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yang, you\u2019re the type that gets old quickly. Don\u2019t be jealous of Fatty Han\u2019s eternal youth!\u201d Fatty Han reached out his hand to pat Zhang Yang\u2019s shoulder but his hands just went through his shoulder like air; they are still in the soul state.</p><br/><p>\u201cHandsome, my ass!\u201d</p><br/><p>The five of them revived again and proceeded towards the Water Spirit Wattland. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that all of us are used to the strategy by now. Winning or losing depends on luck now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang unsheathed his sword and pointed it to the air. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>90%, the first was disrupted by Fatty Han.</p><br/><p>80%, the second was disrupted by Hundred Shots.</p><br/><p>70%....</p><br/><p>60%...</p><br/><p>50%...</p><br/><p>There was no \u201cMiss\u201d this time while the boss\u2019 HP dramatically dropped. In a while after, Wattland\u2019s HP had almost reach its red zone.</p><br/><p>7%!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let your guard down! What needs to be disrupted must be disrupted. What needs to be evaded must be evaded! Don\u2019t get us all killed at 1%!\u201d Zhang Yang warned. He was not looking forward to repeating the process all over again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlmost there! Ahhh! I can see it. The glowing luster of gold pieces! Ahhh!! Almost there!\u201d Drizzler\u2019s strange feminine cries filled the atmosphere, and her attacks got faster and wilder in the heat of the moment.</p><br/><p>3%!</p><br/><p>2%!</p><br/><p>1%!</p><br/><p>0%!</p><br/><p>And the boss finally fell.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You and the party members around have killed Water Spirit Wattland. Obtaining 25,250 Experience points (50 points party bonus)!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cAww yes! We are the best! YEAH!\u201d Drizzler was jumping about in joy, much like a little girl who had just won her first teddy bear in a circus; the rest of the party members just smiled happily.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang smiled with satisfaction. He was pleased to see the team working hard together, achieving victory hand in hand. His vision of seeing the team together became clearer.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang then clapped his hand to get their attention. \u201cAlright, guys! It\u2019s time to open the corpse!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! I wanna touch it! I wanna touch it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I want to do it! Let me do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty Han knees felt weak as he heard the cousins fighting over the right to open the corpse.</p><br/><p>\u201cA-Ah girls? Stop fighting. Come, touch me! I\u2019m pretty nice to rub around. I assure you that you\u2019ll be extremely satisfied after a session with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Same rule, same game, and Little Snow won another round of rock-paper-scissors. Drizzler looked sadly at her fist making the shape of a rock and sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could I always lose at this game?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re a big idiot!\u201d Zhang Yang sighed. He could not believe that she did not realize her own mistake.</p><br/><p>Drizzler got up with her hands on her waist, angrily speaking with her cheek bursting with anger. \u201cWhere did I go wrong?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis game only needs one of your hands to play. Your playing hand was behind you but their other hand was out in front. I don\u2019t know why your other hand would have the same gesture. That\u2019s why everyone could see through your act. Even a dummy could know what you\u2019re playing next in scissors-paper-stone! And if they can\u2019t see through you, they\u2019re as dumb as you are!\u201d Zhang Yang explained in his stoic face, holding back his urge to laugh out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaa!!!!\u201d No wonder Drizzler could never win her elder cousin sister in this game! No, she never stood a chance because of this habit of hers!</p><br/><p>\u201cHan Yin Xue!! I\u2019m cutting ties with you!\u201d Drizzler screamed from the top of her lungs.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, and this is the\u2026 hmm I can\u2019t recall the times you\u2019ve wanted to cut ties with me.\u201d Little Snow replied her screams nonchalantly, ignoring her and reaching out for the corpse to open it. The others may not show it but they had been waiting for the equipment excitedly.</p><br/><p>[Frost Crown] (Green-Copper, Metal Armor)</p><br/><p>Defense: +6</p><br/><p>Vitality: +24</p><br/><p>Strength: +12</p><br/><p>Dexterity: +4</p><br/><p>Level requirement: 20</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, little brat. Let\u2019s forget about the system roll and settle this with a game of rock-paper-scissors!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSneaky little kid!\u201d Drizzler rolled her eyes and quickly rolled for the equipment. Zhang Yang laughed and rolled for the item as well. He won with 84 points.</p><br/><p>[Briskly Crown] (Green-Copper, Leather Armor)</p><br/><p>Defense: +4</p><br/><p>Vitality: +20</p><br/><p>Strength: +6</p><br/><p>Dexterity: +14</p><br/><p>Level requirement: 20</p><br/><p>Fatty Han gave up the equipment humbly and offered them to Hundred Shots again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You have distributed 10 silver pieces!\u2019</p><br/><p>As the body started to disappear, Fatty Han got upset, \u201cThat\u2019s it? Two equipment only?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, yeah. That\u2019s about right. Getting two equipment in a 5-man dungeon is already considered quite good!\u201d Zhang Yang nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s all just hats! Tch! This boss sure has some weird hat collecting habits, huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis first boss would only drop helms and boots. We\u2019re lucky enough to get all helms.\u201d Zhang Yang explained. \u201cAlright then. Let\u2019s proceed to the next boss and claim the \u201cFirst Clear\u201d achievement!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>The team was filled with thirst for victory; everyone was eager to win the fight. Their morale could never have been higher.</p><br/><p>After the first boss, the element changed from water to earth. The next enemy is a huge earth elemental with 7 to 8 smaller earth elementals around.</p><br/><p>[Inflated Earth Elemental] (Elite)</p><br/><p>Level: 21</p><br/><p>HP: 50,000</p><br/><p>[Deflated Earth Elemental] (Normal)</p><br/><p>Level: 20</p><br/><p>HP: 1,000</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. These smaller minions are quite troublesome!\u201d Zhang Yang frowned as he rubbed his forehead. He missed the days where he could just kill off skill-less minions in Bangar Crypt.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pointless to kill the smaller ones. As long as the big one is still alive, it will quickly re-spawn the dead minions! Still, we can\u2019t drag the battle too long or else the big one will command the small ones to self-destruct. Each of those pesky little minions could cause 200 damage per explosion. You\u2019ll actually get blasted and literally be at cloud 9!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo\u2026we are supposed to fully focus on the big one before it commands the small ones to explode at us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shush! Zhang Yang rushed over with along with Drizzler doing the same.</p><br/><p>With Zhang Yang there to pull in the minions, the others did not have to worry about aggro problems; they just focused their attack on the elite monster. With such strong focus fire, it was defeated fairly fast. The party then used all their AoE skills to clear of rest of the surviving minions.</p><br/><p>Hunter\u2019s and Berserker\u2019s were AoE skills, and they were much stronger than a Guardian\u2019s ! But neither one of those skills could be compared to Zhang Yang\u2019s 200% damage ! Stacked with the powerful Grey-Silver sword and the skill, the final damage was truly remarkable!</p><br/><p>\u201cZhan Yu, I want your !\u201d Drizzler was feeling envious.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d</p><br/><p>Drizzler tried to tempt him with something else to make him yield, \u201cBut I can give you Little Snow\u2019s address!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty Han\u2019s ear\u2019s suddenly twitched. Little Snow may not have the best beauty complexion but that ridiculous body of a succubus was truly something worth. Furthermore, the in-game appearance and real-life appearance are not necessarily the same. There was still a chance that this lady might look like a goddess in reality!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little brat! You must be sick of living for so long now! Are you so eager to die?\u201d Little Snow raised her fist.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Drizzler! I\u2019m here to protect you!\u201d Fatty Han stood out with his chest up high. \u201cQuickly! Reveal her address!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if she told you. China is such a big place! Can you really find it out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed. \u201cTch! Who knows? We might be in the same city!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re living in Zhou Su City. How about you?\u201d Drizzle asked.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang and Fatty Han froze at the same time. \u201cWhat a coincidence! We\u2019re also living in Zhou Su City!\u201d Zhang Yang flinched. Zhang Yang did have some suspicion that they were living in the same city before.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! This is destiny! This is fate!\u201d Fatty Han began to feel extremely grateful.</p><br/><p>Drizzle giggled happily. She blinked her big eyes and said, \u201cLittle Snow is living at No.105, Shi Zi Street! Got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty Han began to chant the address like a mantra, fearing of forgetting the address later on.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang shook his head. If memory served him right, No.105, Shi Zi Street was the police station! Thinking of it, he recalled the policewoman he met earlier that morning! The soft and supple sensation of those melons. They were surely ranked number one if he compared them with a previous encounter in his previous life!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang smiled evilly. The thought that he could Fatty Han\u2019s face when he would discover the truth of that address made Zhang Yang refuse to let him know about the police station.</p><br/><p>The party went onwards and after 20 minutes of fighting more small minions, they arrived at the entrance of the second boss.</p><br/><p>[Earth Spirit Oz] (Green-Copper)</p><br/><p>Level: 22</p><br/><p>HP: 132k</p><br/><p>There was a large brown-colored Earth Elemental; its size looked sturdy and enormous, being as high as 15 meters tall. Even without a visible weapon, the spirit\u2019s own gigantic body gave off a certain kind of pressure.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d they all asked. They \u201cknew\u201d that Zhang Yang was a beta player!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang walked up confidently. Several days before this fight, he had been squeezing all of his brain juice to remember all of Marzerway\u2019s skills and fight strategy, which was why he could casually explain everything as if he already knew it all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis boss is basically a physical attack type. His attacks are like a bulldozer; very strong and powerful, which means we\u2019ll need to depend on Little Snow for this round as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Snow turned to Zhang Yang and winked seductively. \u201cIn that case, I want some overtime pay!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin! Would it kill you to just stop behaving like a slut?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh heh heh. I\u2019m used to it!\u201d Little Snow then winked at Drizzler, sending a cold shudder all over her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis boss\u2019 first skill is . He will only cast this on the person with the highest aggro, which is me. If he casts this skill on anyone else, that would only mean that I died! This is a DoT attack, so I will lose 100 HP every second. The damage will not be affected by defense value. F*cking sh*t!\u201d</p><br/><p>As a Guardian, he absolutely hated skills that would ignore his defense attribute.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second skill is ! This skill will also be cast on the person with the most aggro, which is again, me! itself does not do any damage but it stuns me for 2 seconds and casts a debuff, increasing his attack frequency by 100%! This skill cannot be blocked or evaded, which means I would have to take it head on! The most dangerous part is when I\u2019m hit by it. I can\u2019t voluntarily move to block any attack. The boss originally has a very fierce attack and I could get killed off any time!</p><br/><p>Little Snow rolled her eyes glamorously and said, \u201cWell then, I must ask for a raise!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin, can you please be a little more lady-like?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd where am I not a lady?\u201d Little Snow threw another wink. Her glamorous and show-off behavior made the other party members a little awkward to put up with.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

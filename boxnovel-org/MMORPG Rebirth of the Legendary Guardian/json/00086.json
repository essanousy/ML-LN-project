Their total damage was much higher than the remaining ten damage dealers!</p><br/><p>The capability of the team was still guaranteed as long as there was a powerful damage output from five of them as the team\u2019s foundation, even if the other party members were not as powerful.</p><br/><p>Little Snow was like a flag, and everyone followed her wherever she went and it was like playing the \u201cEagle catches the chicks\u201d game which everyone found hilarious.</p><br/><p>The third stage of Marzerway was still as exhausting as and could instantly kill 80% of the tank\u2019s HP! The four healers in the team were trying very hard to heal Zhang Yang\u2019s HP. Even though he was dealing with , even if he was hit with the combo, he could have 100 HP remaining!</p><br/><p>Because of this remaining 100 HP, they were able successfully proceed to the fourth stage of Marzerway!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe great Air Spirit, unite with me and kill all these corrupted sinners!\u201d Marzerway raised his wand and roared like a beast.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang frowned as the difficulty of the Marzerway was mainly concentrated in fourth and fifth stage! The fifth stage was slightly easy as Marzerway could be defeated by using [Beginner Anti-Shadow Potion]. Thus, the fourth stage would be the hardest for them!</p><br/><p>Evading and destroying the were the tests for an individual\u2019s combat capabilities. However, these tests would most likely collapse the team!</p><br/><p>\u201cAll melee attackers, go back to the ranged positions first!\u201d Zhang Yang started to adjust strategy tactics.</p><br/><p>The Thieves, Berserker and the tank Defender that was Ironhill went back to the ranged position.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Spirit of the Air will purify all of your souls!\u201d Marzerway shouted loudly. Ten white balloons gradually floated out from his body and split into different directions.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Marzerway has casted !\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang immediately kited Marzerway away and said: \u201cOkay, melee attackers, come over and continue with the damage output!\u201d</p><br/><p>Due to the high number of melee attackers, if they did not retreat to the ranged position first, they would easily be hit by the and it would not even need to chase after them.</p><br/><p>\u201cRanged positions, split and do not stand together!\u201d Zhang Yang shouted.</p><br/><p>If they all crowded together, the would accumulate and crowd around them, forming into a giant net. The would gradually nibble away the players\u2019 activity space and finally force the players into a dead corner!</p><br/><p>The speed of the was fortunately not as quick, making it easy for the players to evade it, as long as they did not blindly attack Marzerway.</p><br/><p>\u201cStupid fellow, I want to bombard your soul into pieces!\u201d Marzerway roared loudly and a blast of white air wave suddenly struck directly on Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>\u2018-1,524\u2019.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang\u2019s mouth twitched a little as the from Marzerway was very powerful!</p><br/><p>From the healers\u2019 team, Little Snow immediately healed Zhang Yang\u2019s HP back to full.</p><br/><p>\u201cHundred Shots, Fatty Han and Defiant Monk, are you guys clear about what I had explained previously?\u201d Zhang Yang asked in the team.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Three of them nodded their head at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, Marzerway is going to cast . We\u2019ll have to depend on you guys to see whether the can be destroyed as soon as possible!\u201d</p><br/><p>After a while, Marzerway shouted again: \u201cLet\u2019s have some fun!\u201d</p><br/><p>Marzerway waved the wand, three immediately floated from its body and gradually floated on top of his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Marzerway has casted !\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll ranged positions, I\u2019ve marked a cross symbol on the monsters!\u201d Hundred Shots shouted and marked one of the with a cross symbol at the same time. \u201cFire!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Summoned Cloud] (Elite)</p><br/><p>Level: 1</p><br/><p>HP: 10,000</p><br/><p>From a 5-man dungeon to a 20-man dungeon, the amount had increased a lot and the HP also increased several folds!</p><br/><p>By listening Hundred Shots\u2019 command, the ranged attacking team immediately switched their targets and bombarded the that was marked with the cross symbol. Those that had fought the Middle Wing Normal Mode knew the true strength of the .</p><br/><p>Pa! The first was destroyed.</p><br/><p>Pa! Another was destroyed!</p><br/><p>However, the ranged team\u2019s damage output was still quite weak. The third still had at least 4000 HP while chasing after a player.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Player Iron Hand Chicken Catcher hit by : Rotten stink, stunned for 10 seconds!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, every single changed targets and surged towards that player.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverybody, gather to my side!\u201d Zhang Yang shouted loudly.</p><br/><p>Except for the stunned player, the rest of the people quickly moved closer to Zhang Yang\u2019s position.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeal! Heal me at your full force!\u201d Zhang Yang used and guarded all nineteen people within the protection barrier.</p><br/><p>\u2018-1,200!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-120!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-120!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-1,920!\u2019</p><br/><p>The first exploded and caused 1,200 damage to Iron Hand Chicken Catcher. The rest of the people were guarded within the protection barrier so the damage dealt was reduced to 10% and the HP deduction was extremely limited! However, Zhang Yang was suffering and his HP almost dropped to zero!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang immediately used and waited for the healing spell\u2019s channel duration!</p><br/><p>Another exploded on Iron Hand Chicken Catcher and the damage value filled up the screen again.</p><br/><p>\u2018-1,200!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-120!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang had just healed up to about 1,500 HP when another 1,920 damage value from the hit him again, killing him in the process!</p><br/><p>The team was wiped out!</p><br/><p>It would be dangerous using without !</p><br/><p>At the Graveyard, Little Snow thought for a while and said: \u201cCan we kill the person directly bounded by the ? That way, the will not explode!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang stunned and said: \u201cI never thought about this before!\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, Zhang Yang did not experience a lot of low-level Hardcore mode dungeons. When he joined the game in his previous life, \u2018God\u2019s Miracle\u2019 was already operating in its third year. At that moment, he just went on for low-level Hard mode dungeons as long as his equipment could be used for training. He would not bother to go for low-level Hardcore mode dungeons unless there was someone to lead him. When his level was much higher, he began leading the \u201cbeginners\u201d to the low-level dungeons where he did not need to consider strategy tactics or details at all!</p><br/><p>Little Snow\u2019s suggestion was excellent, but it would mean having lesser teammates, especially when it came to the ranged damage dealers. Ultimately, it would mean destroying the would be slower as well! Having lesser teammates to that extent would certainly collapse the party.</p><br/><p>(Even though the player would be killed by another player in the dungeon, they would not drop a level!)</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang thought for a while and said: \u201cFirst of all, we still have to try our very best to destroy all of the first. If there really is no other choice and it chased after a player, only then would we attack the stunned player!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go people!\u201d</p><br/><p>They resurrected to re-enter the dungeon and ate some HP recovering snacks to gain back their health.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang took out the [Beginner Anti-Shadow Potion] from his inventory and distributed two per person to the party and said: \u201cHold them tight, drink this medicine together when I tell you to drink and do not use this potion at any other time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was puzzled but they took the medicine and kept it well.</p><br/><p>The last stage would be the fifth stage, and Marzerway would just cast Area of Effect (AoE) and with no other tactics. This meant that the team would just need to keep on dealing damage and healing.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start people!\u201d</p><br/><p>The third battle started again.</p><br/><p>The first stage, passed smoothly.</p><br/><p>The second stage, barely passed.</p><br/><p>The third stage, breathtakingly passed.</p><br/><p>The most dangerous that is the fourth stage started!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have some fun!\u201d The same speech prompted from Marzerway and he casted three .</p><br/><p>\u201cAll ranged players, focus on the marked cross symbol on the monsters!\u201d Hundred Shots temporary held a command job and cooperated with Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>The first was destroyed\u2026 The second was destroyed as well\u2026 the third still had about 3,000 HP and chased after Ironhill with great speed and caused him to be stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill him!\u201d Zhang Yang cried out, as he swung his sword and slashed the Defender.</p><br/><p>Although the pitiful Ironhill was a tank with thick armor and shield, he was not able to defend the powerful damage output and died after two to three hits!</p><br/><p>The surged then spread out as they lost their target. They slowly floated in the air and searched for a new one.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d All of them were excited and exclaimed like they had just defeated Marzerway.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s once again begin to deal some damage on Marzerway! The is casted every half of a minute, so we have to be quick and try our very best to get through the fifth stage. Otherwise, reducing party members will wipe us out as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>38%, 36%, 34%... Marzerway casted for the second time.</p><br/><p>Although the party had lost a teammate, the overall damage output was not severely affected as the second tank had basically nothing much to do!</p><br/><p>The first , destroyed!</p><br/><p>The second , destroyed!</p><br/><p>The third had about 3,000 HP and surged towards Fatty Han!</p><br/><p>\u201cKill!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty Han died.</p><br/><p>32%, 30%, 29%... Marzerway threw another three !</p><br/><p>The damage output had now been reduced after losing Fatty Han. After destroying the second , the last chased after Angel Descend and caused her to be stunned. Before Angel Descend\u2019s HP dropped to zero, Little Snow was also stunned!</p><br/><p>The party hurriedly killed two of them and caused the strength of the team to dramatically be reduced, since now the main healer died too. The stress of healing was increased to such an extent that the healers could not cope with it anymore!</p><br/><p>They barely reduced Marzerway by 4% HP and when Marzerway casted another for the fourth time, but now the team finally collapsed and was wiped out.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Snow, practice like the 5-man dungeon. You help destroy as well when the is casted!\u201d Zhang Yang started to fine tune the strategy at the Graveyard.</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh, there\u2019s no need to wait for your command, I started to destroy them long before!\u201d Little Snow showed an arrogant face to him.</p><br/><p>That was a bad news then!</p><br/><p>\u201cNoob tank, use that scroll!\u201d Drizzler suggested.</p><br/><p>[Magic Scroll: Rising Morale (Level 1)], increase 5% of team damage and lasts for 5 minutes!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang frowned. Aside from the purpose of practicing, he did not wish to use that scroll so fast. But he did consider about the rest of the party other than the original five. The rest of their equipment were not strong enough and they even needed to exploit the extra damage. The only way was to rely on the external force!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I will use the scroll when we enter the fourth stage! The other three Hunters must be on alert. When entering the fourth stage, the Hunters just need to use the normal attack and keep the Focus Points and skill cooldowns for the ! is casted every 30 seconds and every round after we destroy them, the Hunters can attack Marzerway for about 20 seconds. After that, the Hunters need to keep the Focus Points and skill cooldowns again and wait for the next !\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right, let\u2019s continue people!\u201d</p><br/><p>They resurrected, entered the dungeon, and ate HP recovering snacks again. After a few times of being wiped out, most of the party members already decided not to just rely on the main force but started to put effort into this battle because they felt helpless, miserable and angry. Alongside with the team\u2019s desire to defeat Marzerway, their fighting spirit rose once again and the team\u2019s unity became stronger!</p><br/><p>That was good news for Zhang Yang.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

You really did kill the boss! Haha! I knew you could do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Snowy Death: \u201cPro, bro! Taking on the boss without inviting a bro? Come on, bro!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hundred Shot: \u201cCongratulations!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty Han: \u201cF*ck you, man. How could you have hoes before bros? There are two babes right there, and you can\u2019t even let me have one?\u201d</p><br/><p>Crimson Fire and Silky Snow sent their regards too, he knew there was envy and jealousy hidden in their words.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang could not tolerate those two anymore, \u201cAlright, alright! You\u2019re all grown-ups now. Stop acting like children! I\u2019m opening the corpse!\u201d They were so intoxicated with money that their eyes glowed into a weird symbol of money.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You have obtained 40 silver pieces after distribution!\u201d</p><br/><p>Such a stingy Gray-Silver boss, only giving 1 gold and 20 silver.</p><br/><p>Drizzler openly replied to him, \u201cZhan Yu, you should get all the equipment since technically, you killed the boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang pondered and then said, \u201cYou do know that any one of these equipment can easily be sold for at least 1,000 gold. How can you let this chance slip by when the two of you are so intoxicated with such little amount of silver?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! I\u2019m not a miser!\u201d Drizzler then threw a look of disgust onto Zhang Yang. \u201cYou know, as the saying goes, \u2018For what you earn, pray that it\u2019s clean\u2019! You can\u2019t accept a fortune that is not by your effort!\u201d Zhang Yang grinned, and replied, \u201cI prefer the saying, \u2018A horse without wild grass would be thin; man without a fortune is poor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh! What a waste of time!\u201d Then the girls stepped aside.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang thought for a while and said, \u201cSince we fought the boss together, everybody should get a share. How about this? I will help myself with whatever I like, and the rest of the loot will be shared between both of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSounds good!\u201d The girls agreed, as it was still the battle loot from a Gray-Silver boss!</p><br/><p>[Martyr Ring] (Gray-Silver, Ring)</p><br/><p>Vitality: +10</p><br/><p>Strength: +10</p><br/><p>Equip effect: Increase Critical Strike chance by 1%</p><br/><p>Level requirement: 20</p><br/><p>The girls gave up their roll at the same time and the equipment went to Zhang Yang. At least he was lucky once. He continued to open the corpse.</p><br/><p>[Spellcaster\u2019s Circlet] (Gray-Silver, Cloth Armor)</p><br/><p>Defense: +4</p><br/><p>Vitality: +48</p><br/><p>Intelligence: +24</p><br/><p>Spirit: +8</p><br/><p>Note: This once belonged to the great Spellcaster Unduin, signifying intelligence and strength!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang was the first to reject the roll, leaving Little Snow happily smiling.</p><br/><p>[Carved Boots] (Gray-Silver, Leather Armor)</p><br/><p>Defense: +8</p><br/><p>Vitality: +15</p><br/><p>Strength: +5</p><br/><p>Dexterity: +20</p><br/><p>Level requirement: 20</p><br/><p>Since all three of them could not equip this, they rolled together and was obtained by Drizzler with 78 points.</p><br/><p>[Holy Prayers] (Skill book)</p><br/><p>Use: You will learn .</p><br/><p>Class requirement: Priest, Knight.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly, use it! What does it really do?\u201d asked Drizzler curiously.</p><br/><p>Little Snow obtained the skill book after Zhang Yang and Drizzler gave up their roll. She then patted the book on her chest and posted the skill description after learning it.</p><br/><p>[Holy Prayers] (Level 1): Heals target\u2019s HP for 100% of the current magic attack. The nearest surrounding players will receive healing for 25% of the current magic attack. Up to 4 players maximum.</p><br/><p>MP Cost: 50.</p><br/><p>Cast time: 1.5 seconds.</p><br/><p>Cooldown time: 10 seconds</p><br/><p>It was not clear what would happen after levelling up the skill, whether it was increased healing capacity, shorter casting time, or even reduced cooldown time. It did not matter as this skill was meant for mass healing which greatly reduced the difficulty of raiding dungeon bosses that used multi-target skills.</p><br/><p>Under the boss remained the last item, a skill book with a red cover.</p><br/><p>[Eagle Eye] (Skill book)</p><br/><p>Use: You will learn </p><br/><p>Class requirement: Warrior, Knight, Hunter, Thief.</p><br/><p>Drizzler was once again curious. \u201cEh? This skill is so versatile; it can be learned by so many different classes. What skill is this, exactly?\u201d Zhang Yang, on the other hand, got excited and said, \u201cPlease, let me have this one!\u201d Drizzler curled her lips to his response, \u201cTch! What are you getting so excited about? I\u2019ve already said that all the loot belongs to you!\u201d She then gave up her roll. Little Snow had the intention to tease Zhang Yang again but as she also agreed to let him have all the items, she gave up her roll as well.</p><br/><p>Once Zhang Yang had gotten hold of the skill book, he quickly patted it against his chest and with a flash of light, a new skill appeared on his skill window.</p><br/><p>Seeing Zhang Yang giggling like a madman, Drizzler could not resist and asked. \u201cPost it out! I want to see it too!\u201d Zhang Yang laughed too and posted the newly gained skill description to the party channel.</p><br/><p>[Eagle Eye] (Passive) (Level 1): You now have the ability to thoroughly search the enemy\u2019s weak points. All attacks will now ignore 50% enemy defense.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, and here I thought it was some godly skill. The warrior\u2019s Level 20 skill also has a 50% armor reduction!\u201d and Drizzler curled her lips again.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh huh. First. can only cause 10% armor reduction upon each stack and you can only have 50% armor reduction after 5 stacks! By then, I would have attacked a number of times already! Plus, if you were to fight against a group of monsters then you\u2019ll have to apply 5 stacks of on each monster. How long would that take?\u201d Zhang Yang giggled uncontrollably. \u201cSecond. effect can be stacked with !\u201d</p><br/><p>Both girls were surprised.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang loved this skill in his previous life. Sadly, \u2019s skill book drop rate is too low, and there were not more than 100 players who had this skill in the entire China server. Zhang Yang never managed to pick up this skill book before and he had never seen this skill book being sold in the auction house. The maximum level for this skill was 10, and the ignore defense value would increase to 95%. This was especially efficient when it was used against high defense bosses or in PK against Knights or Guardians.</p><br/><p>If Zhang Yang had possessed during the boss fight just now, he would have immediately ignored 50% of the defense and his attack would increase by 50. That was almost double his attack power!</p><br/><p>Later on, he opened another 7 to 8 other equipment but none of those suited him. He was lucky enough to roll these three equipment: two leather armor and one heavy armor for a support Knight. The leather armors were for Fatty Han and the heavy armor was for Ocean Despair. But Zhang Yang decided to sell it off in the auction house because he knew that Ocean Despair would reject his offer out of courtesy.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, everything has been distributed. Let\u2019s return to the city!\u201d Zhang Yang took out a [Teleportation Scroll] and tore it apart nonchalantly. Before the magic circle formed completely, Zhang Yang asked, \u201cOh, right. Have you guys tried Bangar Crypt in Hardore mode?\u201d</p><br/><p>While tearing their [Teleportation Scroll] as well, Drizzler replied, \u201cThe first boss is too tough. We had two tanks but they could not maintain the aggro. One fell after the other, and we could never conquer it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you ask? Are you willing to take us there?\u201d asked Little Snow. After a white pillar of light flashed, Zhang Yang emerged out of the teleportation waypoint in the White Jade Castle. Following closely were Drizzler and Little Snow in the same white light.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just want a mineral that appears at the third boss. You guys can have everything else. How about that?\u201d said Zhang Yang, smiling. Right now, [Earthern Round Shield] is selling extremely well. If the Plain Copper Vein could produce two to four [Plain Copper Ore], he could earn up to two to four gold pieces!</p><br/><p>Even though the two girls were a little crazy whenever it comes to money, but their way of conduct was truly to be respected; which was why Zhang Yang would only involve people he thought was worthwhile in a mutual beneficial act.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, sure, sure! I\u2019ll form a party now!\u201d Drizzler was happily cheering, but she stopped after a while, turned around and looked at Zhang Yang with suspicion in her eyes, \u201cHey\u2026 you\u2019re not actually trying to get my cousin and me, right?\u201d Little Snow nodded in agreement and said, \u201cDrizzler, there\u2019s always something hiding behind a good will.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not!\u201d Zhang Yang shook his head. \u201cVery well then!\u201d Drizzler bought into his words and went on jumping happily. \u201cInnocent little idiot!\u201d Little Snow withdrew with defeat.</p><br/><p>After checking the system clock, Zhang Yang suggested to them, \u201cIt\u2019s almost 7pm. How about we all take our dinner and meet back here in an hour?\u201d</p><br/><p>Drizzler then turned to Little Snow, \u201cHurm, now that you\u2019ve mentioned it, I am kind of hungry! Cousin, where shall we eat later?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 How about at the Arc de Triomphe? That place has some good beef steaks!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay! Let\u2019s go! Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>And with that, the two girls logged off faster than Zhang Yang could, and their characters instantly disappeared right in front of him. He thought it was a little amusing, chuckled, and then logged off himself.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang suddenly thought, \u201cThese two girls must be from a rich family,\u201d There was also a Western restaurant called Arc de Triomphe in the city where he was living in and it really was famous for its beef steak. In his previous life, he went there and ate several times while he was rich. It truly was delicious, and it could be a chance that they were all actually living in the same city!</p><br/><p>After a brief thought, Zhang Yang ran downstairs and bought two packets of 5 dollar boxed rice. It had to be two as he always had a big appetite and would not be contented with just one. After dinner and some rest, Zhang Yang came back online. He first spent some time at the Smithing shop and raised his Smithing level. When it was almost an hour past, he already made more than 900 pieces of [Beginner Whetstone] and obtained Amateur Smithing level.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Drizzler has invited you to join her party. Would you accept the invitation?\u2019</p><br/><p>8pm sharp. These two girls were really punctual. Zhang Yang accepted the invitation and with him, there were 10 other players, including Defiant Monk. After greeting each other in the party, they headed to the dungeon entrance and as soon as everyone gathered, the fight began.</p><br/><p>What really surprised Zhang Yang were the girls; they both had strong gaming abilities! Drizzler was just a little girl wielding a two-handed sword, but she held it fiercely and with great strength. Her knowledge in using her skill rotations was quite formidable as with proper rotation, her total damage was high enough that she would come in second place in terms of damage output as compared to Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>Little Snow had good crowd control. Whoever had their HP dropped low, she would be there to instantly cast a [Regeneration] spell and would consider whether to continue casting a healing spell. Her MP management was incredible as she had never wasted a single drop of MP! Whenever a fight ended, she could control and manage her MP to be more or less half, while the other healer completely drained his MP to zero. Little Snow was leading in total healing by 62%!</p><br/><p>If these two persons were willing to be trained and studied a little, they could be professional players in the future! Though it might not be possible to guarantee a victory in the S-class Professional League, they could still completely conquer the A-class with ease. It is weird. How have I not seen their names before?!</p><br/><p>Lost Paradise was not really a big guild but at least they were a semi-professional one sponsored by a business company. That was why all the elites in the guild were fluent in the game basics. However, Lone Desert Smoke was way beneath them. Even though Drizzler chose the players with the best equipment to join the party, their attacking power was still far from that of Lost Paradise.</p><br/><p>The good thing was that Zhang Yang was already level 18. All his equipment were almost Green-Copper, pressuring the boss\u2019 own attack. Along with Drizzler\u2019s capability and Little Snow\u2019s healing control, they managed to overcome obstacles and defeated the dungeon\u2019s third boss Dadarerda.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

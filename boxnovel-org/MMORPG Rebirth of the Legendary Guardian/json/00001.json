Night. In a luxury suite on the 19th floor of the Tian Lun Pavilion Grand Hotel.</p><br/><p>Even though the desire had died down, but the ambiguous feeling of it still lingered around. Zhang Yang sat in his bed with his top half naked watching the bare and empty pillow on his bed, his heart filled with the inconceivable.</p><br/><p>He came to participate\u2026 no... perhaps in other words, he came here as a final resort to stop his girlfriend\u2019s wedding. Based on only one sole reason\u2026 that is, because he was not the groom!</p><br/><p>He and Lin Yu met each other through an online game called \u2018God\u2019s Miracle\u2019. Though they first started off as enemies, they eventually got to know each other and ultimately developed feelings towards each other. However, Lin Yu\u2019s family\u2019s background was worlds apart from his. Her family had reached a point where their assets had surpassed a massive number which was in the billions. So naturally, they would not hand over their only daughter to some unheard-of man such as him!</p><br/><p>Even then, Zhang Yang was not a poor and miserable nobody. He had a luxurious home, a few branded cars, and a few hundred thousand in his bank account. In the eyes of regular women, he was what they would deem as a bachelor with exceeding qualifications. Still, as compared to the Lin Family, there still existed a huge gap between them.</p><br/><p>With his efforts in vain, the elders of the Lin Family treated him just as coldly. They almost chased him out of the house! The only thing that Lin Yu could do was to shed her tears for him. She could not ever agree to leave this planned marriage for his own. She only resorted to one desperate request and that was to never see her again.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang knew that Lin Yu was a girl who obediently respects her elders. Her mother threatened to take her own life to compel Lin Yu to go along with their wishes. That was enough reason for Lin Yu to accept the hand in marriage between the equally wealthy Liu Family\u2019s only son, Liu Wei! In fact, the marriage should have been held 3 or 4 years back. It was only delayed because of Lin Yu\u2019s constant struggle. But right now, it was obvious that her struggle had come to an end.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang withdrew quietly from Lin Yu\u2019s wedding and went back to his hotel room. His heart fell into the depths of despair as he thought of his beloved who would become someone else\u2019s wife. He went to have a dull drink before retiring to his room completely drunk. In the midst of it, he received a call. He could not recall what he said but not long after that, a woman came into his room and laid on his bed.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang was so incredibly drunk that he instantly went into \u2018action\u2019 when the both of them embraced each other. As the situation developed, Zhang Yang sobered up and realized that he recognized the woman who he was entangled with. It was the person who taught him Chinese Studies back in university, Miss Yu Li!</p><br/><p>Eventually, Yu Li too recognized Zhang Yang. They ended their \u2018session\u2019 as they were both unimaginably abashed. But as compared to him, Yu Li was more embarassed than he was. She became a hostess but bumped into her old student. This made her feel ashamed, resulting in her bolting out of the room without even bothering to collect her payment.</p><br/><p>With the mark left on his chest where Yu Li kissed him, Zhang Yang shook his head as he struggled to get the thoughts of this one night stand out of his mind.</p><br/><p>But still, why would Yu Li give up her job as a teacher to sell herself to a hotel to become a hostess? There were many possibilities for her to do so. Perhaps a teacher\u2019s salary was insufficient, or perhaps she had bad luck in making acquaintances and was forced by her boyfriend or husband to do this. Or perhaps she needed the financial help to pay for her parent\u2019s illness\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang did not have much left in him to think about Yu Li because right now, while he was sober, he was being tortured by the pain in his heart. In his mind, there was only one person he could think of. Lin Yu.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bang!\u2019</p><br/><p>The sound of the door crashing was heard as two burly men wearing suits and dark sunglasses barged in. Their cold facial expressions and body builds carried a strong killing intent.</p><br/><p>Trailing behind them, of average height and size, was a man who walked in wearing a white formal suit and a pair of gold-framed glasses. He had the handsome face of a young man, yet he wore a careless smile on his face like a true gentleman.</p><br/><p>\u201cLiu Wei!\u201d Zhang Yang immediately recognized that young man as he gritted his teeth.</p><br/><p>One of the burly men grabbed a chair and Liu Wei immediately sat on it. He crossed his legs and said, \u201cYou must be wondering why I left my newly wedded wife to come here in the middle of the night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, cut the bullshit!\u201d said Zhang Yang coldly as he stared at his \u2018rival\u2019. Both he and Lin Yu knew that Liu Wei was adamant in marrying Lin Yu. However, this was not because of his feelings towards her, it was due to the Lin Family\u2019s fortune. Both the Lin and Liu Families were heads of the business world. If they were to unite through marriage, then they could rule over a larger market together.</p><br/><p>Liu Wei laughed but his facial expression contained no intentions of humor. He said, \u201cAny women that belongs to me should not have any other men in their minds. And even if they do, I\u2019d allow only the memories of a dead man! Do you understand now, Zhang Yang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang was astounded. He knew that this man, the only son of the Liu Family, would do something outrageous. But this is a hotel, a public place. It was just beyond imagination!</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be surprised! This state of Ji is under my family\u2019s influence. Even if I put a hole in the sky, there would be someone to patch it up for me in my stead.\u201d Liu Wei continued to speak as he laughed coldly, \u201cThat bitch actually delayed the wedding for 4 years because of you! Hmph! After I\u2019m done with you, I shall go back and take really good care of her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang went into rage, fiercely did a backflip from the bed and onto his feet and shouted, \u201cIf you even dare to lay your hand on a strand of her hair, I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, not only will I be going to touch a strand of her hair, I will also be going to mess her up, mess her up really badly! That bitch actually slept with you for a number of times, did she not? That bitch actually made me out to be the bad person!\u201d Liu Wei\u2019s handsome countenance faded.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d Zhang Yang screamed and leaped towards Liu Wei.</p><br/><p>Liu Wei scoffed and commanded the two burly men, \u201cThrow him off the balcony!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRoger!\u201d Answered the men instantly and simultaneously as they went into action.</p><br/><p>Liu Wei had the highest of confidence in his experienced bodyguards and in a very relaxed manner he said, \u201cA man broken by the lost of the love of his life, jumped off to end his life. How does that sound as the title of tomorrow\u2019s newspaper headlines? I do wonder how that bitch would react to this. The face that she would make would certainly be very amusing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even so, Zhang Yang did not show any signs of fear. He lost both his parents when he was very young and had been rebellious ever since. Since then, there was no one who bothered to care about his brawls, and he eventually became some sort of the local\u2019s little tyrant. Eventually he toned down after he enrolled in a university. He stopped getting into fights and instead joined a martial art\u2019s society and had proper skill showdowns.</p><br/><p>He was born with a naturally strong and agile body build. After joining the society for merely two years, he was said to have beaten the 9th National Martial Arts Competition\u2019s Champion\u2019s instructor. Through the years, he had never stopped his training and this led to his unparalleled strength.</p><br/><p>These two men must have had a certain degree of skill to become Liu Wei\u2019s bodyguard. But still, in Zhang Yang\u2019s eyes, they were still nobodies.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang\u2019s fists were as fast as electric, flowing and dancing around. His feet moved like a snake and with a move called \u2018False Steps Chaos Punch\u2019, he beat them both until they had no chance of countering.</p><br/><p>Liu Wei was both surprised and enraged. He never knew that Zhang Yang had such formidable skill. Without actually thinking things through, he pulled out a small firearm and fired at Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang was not curious about how a notorious family like the Lius could have gotten hold of a firearm. Instead he was surprised that Liu Wei would actually open fire at a public place! At the moment, his eyes were directed at the black hollow muzzle of Liu Wei\u2019s gun, he instinctively waved his arm and hit one of the bodyguards who staggered in front of him, blocking his front.</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa!\u2019</p><br/><p>As the deafening sound of gunshots faded into the distance, a mark of fresh red blood appeared on the vest of the bodyguard. The man fell onto the ground before he could even let out any cries of pain.</p><br/><p>Liu Wei did not stop there, even though he was stunned for a moment, he held his gun back up and aimed at Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang, who was not afraid of getting a beating went to brawl with the other man. He then held the man as a meat shield and rushed towards Liu Wei.</p><br/><p>The man saw that Liu Wei was aiming directly at him. Terrified, the man started to sweat as he screamed, \u201cPlease Master Liu, don\u2019t shoot! Don\u2019t shoo- \u201c</p><br/><p>\u2018Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!\u2019</p><br/><p>Being selfish and reckless, it was impossible for Liu Wei to listen to the cries of his own underlings. He then pulled the trigger repeatedly, letting 6 shots off as he emptied his magazine.</p><br/><p>Within the smoke, bullet wounds could be seen on the dead bodyguard\u2019s abdomen, chest and head. He had died before death could come to him. Zhang Yang pushed the body aside and rushed forward so quickly that he hit Liu Wei as he reloaded his gun.</p><br/><p>In a flash, Zhang Yang emerged from behind the dead man\u2019s body. He then powerfully lifted his hammer-like fists and punched Liu Wei\u2019s face firmly.</p><br/><p>The punch was so powerful that it sent Liu Wei\u2019s gold-framed glasses flying off. A stream of blood came oozing out from a brand-new wound that he had just received.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang pulled Liu Wei out from under the man\u2019s body and immediately, another punch followed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201c</p><br/><p>He screamed continuously. Liu Wei was a man born with a silver spoon in his mouth, he had never and could never endure this level of pain. In the end, however, he was still a ruthless man. With eyes carrying ill intent, he glared at Zhang Yang and yelled, \u201cYou bastard. You dared to strike me! You\u2019re a dead man! Not only will I kill you, I\u2019ll mutilate your corpse and feed them to the dogs!\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how well one could control his temper, under the circumstances of being shot for 7 rounds, one might still lose his nerves completely. Zhang Yang\u2019s rage was already well beyond comprehension. After listening to Liu Wei\u2019s endless taunting, his rage rose by yet another level as he delivered one more punch. With a \u2018Pa!\u2019 sound, Liu Wei\u2019s face was covered in his own blood and with \u2018Wa\u2019 sound, he spat out 7 to 8 pieces of his broken teeth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Liu! Master Liu!\u2019 several voices could be heard echoing through the hallway and more burly bodyguards came rushing into the room. Some of them had bulging waists, indicating that they were carrying weapons.</p><br/><p>Liu Wei regained his composure and screamed shrilly, \u201cKill him! Kill him!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Qiang! Qiang! Qiang!\u2019</p><br/><p>The bodyguards who received the order rushed towards Zhang Yang. Some of them even pulled out their knives.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang\u2019s blood was dripping from his waist. Even though he had a meat shield to protect him, he still got shot in his abdomen. In just mere moments, he could feel the energy in him gradually seeping out. His vision blurred and he knew that he could faint at any time.</p><br/><p>In a situation like this, staying conscious alone would be difficult, what more taking on those burly men.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang directed his gaze at Liu Wei and murmured, \u201cAm I actually going to be doing the citizens a favor?\u201d</p><br/><p>With a burst of laughter, Zhang Yang grabbed onto Liu Wei and dashed towards the balcony. Gaining an unstoppable momentum, the two of them soared into the air before falling down from the 19th floor like two shooting stars.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

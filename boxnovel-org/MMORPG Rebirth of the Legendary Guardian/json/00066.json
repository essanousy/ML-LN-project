We aren\u2019t getting anywhere with our current numbers!\u201d said Fatty Han. Drizzler nodded. \u201cI agree as well! We need more people!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Zhang Yang had an idea. \u201cEveryone! Resume your attack! I have a plan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak your mind!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang smiled. \u201cBrat! Pay attention the boss\u2019 HP. When it reaches 91%, I want you to use the [Poison Essence]!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Drizzler asked honestly.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch! The one you got from the Frog King! The Special Item that can poison everyone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Why?\u201d Drizzler asked again.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! Why would you keep asking questions?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll ask. I don\u2019t know what you are up to!\u201d Drizzler pouted her lips, trying to act cute.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah! Fine. I give in!\u201d Zhang Yang sighed. \u201cI think I remembered something about this boss skill. If the targeted player has the status, the will have no effect!\u201d</p><br/><p>There were not many bosses in game that possessed ability, which was why Zhang Yang could not immediately come up with a counter measure for the boss\u2019 skill. It would have solved the problem if he recruited more people to fight, but there was an easier way. If one could somehow inflict the poison status onto the targeted player, the boss\u2019 life stealing skill would be nullified and in reverse, the boss would receive more damage!</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d said Drizzler even though she felt otherwise.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to rearrange the battle position. Little brat, I want you to stand directly in front of the boss. Little Snow and the rest of the party will stand behind Drizzler. When Drizzler lets out the poison, all of you must run into the poison ring and get the effect!\u201d Zhang Yang explained.</p><br/><p>The normal playstyle would have a Bandit in play. The Bandit would enable Friendly-Fire mode, and had his weapon coated in poison. When the boss used a Lifesteal skill, the Bandit would then attack the target player and inflict on him. This method could completely counter the boss\u2019 Lifesteal skill.</p><br/><p>However, since Zhang Yang\u2019s party did not have a Bandit onboard, he would have to resort to the self-poisoning method. It was lucky that the party found the [Poison Essence] from the Frog King.</p><br/><p>\u201cNoob tank! Why\u2019d you say I would \u201clet out poison\u201d!? I\u2019ll smack you in the face!\u201d Drizzler clenched her fist and pointed at Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey Little Yang, what happened between the two of you? You won\u2019t be able to get the both of them if this goes on!\u201d Fatty Han sent a private message to Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you always thinking of perverted stuff? Get both girls? I\u2019ll get both of my fist you\u2019re your face!\u201d Zhang Yang replied angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Little Yang! Just look at them! They\u2019re both quite good! The elder one has the bobbylicious body even though her face is just \u201cmeh\u201d. As for the little one, her body still has more room to mature but her face is just- GRAHHH- I can\u2019t take it anymore! Remember, Little Yang! You must grab the opportunity while it\u2019s just lying there! Imagine, two girls, one man! GAH! Thinking about it alone boils my blood!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Fatty Han. You\u2019re really a beast inside that meat suit aren\u2019t you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>94%, 93%, 92%, 91%. Zhang Yang alone could not damage fast, but when everyone attacked together, the boss\u2019 HP dropped like a landslide.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brat! Use it now!\u201d Zhang Yang shouted.</p><br/><p>Drizzler was someone Zhang Yang had his eyes on, as her ability was on the level of an A-tier Professional League player. Her reaction speed was nothing something made up. With that, she quickly smashed the [Poison Essence] and released a green mist from her body, instantly engulfing 30 meters around her. The party did not even need to get close to her to get the poison effect.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You have received the effect of [Poison Essence]. Receiving 150 Natural Damage every 3 seconds for 15 seconds!\u2019</p><br/><p>The green mist appeared and disappeared in an instant. It only lasted for a second before the mist dispersed. Everyone, including Zhang Yang and the boss as well were inflicted by the poison effect. Their body were glowing in a greenish hue.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Little Drizzler. Just now, what you did, it was as if you have just let out a massive fart!\u201d Fatty Han laughed maniacally.</p><br/><p>\u201cYuck!\u201d Drizzler face was filled with disgust. \u201cWretched Fatty bum! I won\u2019t forgive you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFoolish Hunter! I\u2019ll suck your blood dry!\u201d The boss activated its skill just as its HP reached 90%. It sprinted across the field like a lightning bolt, and sank its fangs into Fatty\u2019s Han\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u2018-2000!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-2000!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-2000!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>A chain of red damage texts attack appeared.</p><br/><p>After 10 seconds, instead of healing, the boss\u2019 HP had dropped to 76%! \u201cHaha! Have a taste of your own medicine!\u201d Fatty Han shouted. He turned around and shook his butt provokingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh come on! Do you actually be more wretched than this?\u201d said Drizzler.</p><br/><p>Fatty Han thought for a while and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I could even undo my pants and shake my bare-naked ass at the boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>They thought that he was only joking but when he was about undress, they yelled, \u201cStop! We mind! We mind!\u201d Fatty Han was shocked at their reaction and quickly stop his act. \u201cHey hey! I was just joking. I wasn\u2019t serious about doing it. Do you really think I would actually fool around like an idiot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that you\u2019re absolutely not an idiot. But when you\u2019re fooling around, you\u2019re worse than an idiot!\u201d Zhang Yang sighed loudly. Fatty Han laughed. \u201cHaha! Precisely! That is why you\u2019re my own brother from another mother!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Gawain took severe damage from its own skill, it did not activate the skill again immediately. Instead, it waited until its HP dropped till 50% to activate it again. However, under Zhang Yang\u2019s guidance, Drizzler was able to maintain everyone\u2019s status and made sure that they could always counter the boss\u2019 . However, the credit was not to Drizzler alone; Little Snow was able to heal everyone in time. Luckily, she was as good of a support as her own massive \u201csupports\u201d underneath her clothes.</p><br/><p>After taking damage again instead of healing, the boss\u2019 HP was reduced to only 36% when it had done \u201cpoisoning\u201d itself.</p><br/><p>36%. Just a little more\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Take that, vampire wannabe! Let\u2019s see how you die, being defeated by your own skill!\u201d said Drizzler jubilantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you mentioned about vampire, I remember a story. It was a\u2026\u201d Fatty Han let out a cynical smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you just shut up?!\u201d Two girls cried out while rolling their eyes. They did not have to listen, they knew that any story told by that Fatty bum would be something indecent. \u201cWoo\u2026why would you say that? I was just trying to lighten the atmosphere!\u201d said Fatty Han.</p><br/><p>30%, 25%, 20%, the boss\u2019 HP was shaved off by the party without any noticeable problems. When it reached 10%, Gawain activated the skill for the last time. Its action only accelerated its impending death. The party killed off the boss before it could finish the skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Die like the dead man you already are!\u201d Drizzler went up the body and stomped on it to release her frustration. \u201cLittle brat! You\u2019re quite the feisty one aren\u2019t you?!\u201d Zhang Yang laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that she\u2019s stomping on a skeleton, I have a story about Skeleton Stomping. Once upon a time\u2026\u201d Everyone yelled in unison, \u201cShut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWuuuuu\u2026\u201d Fatty Han pretended to cry and secluded himself to a corner.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s check out the goods!\u201d Drizzler began opening the corpse.</p><br/><p>[White Skull Hammer] (Green-Copper, One-handed Hammer)</p><br/><p>Weapon attack: 95-113</p><br/><p>Attack interval: 2.6 seconds</p><br/><p>DPS: 40</p><br/><p>Level requirement: 20</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! What luck! Another item up for the auction house!\u201d cried Fatty Han.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! This is still 300 gold here!\u201d Little Snow was delighted instead. She quickly pushed the others to give it to her to put it up in the auction house. \u201cHah. Now that you mentioned it. How much was the sword you sold yesterday?\u201d Zhang Yang asked casually.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! 300 gold coins!\u201d Little Snow answered in the same manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh I see\u2026 So, after distribution, all of us should get 60 gold coins each, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is still the 10% service charge of the auction house!\u201d Little Snow crossed her arms angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh. I understand. So after deducting the service charge, we should all have 54 gold coins each, correct?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTechnically, yes\u2026\u201d Little Snow\u2019s voice was getting softer, as if she was guilty of something.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang raised his voice. \u201cThen why am I getting only 54 silver coins?\u201d Little Snow started to get scared. \u201cErhm\u2026 Maybe you\u2019re mistaken\u2026 Did you look properly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Snow lowered her head. \u201cI think you\u2019re mistaken!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough! Imburse my money! If not, pay with what you have!\u201d Zhang Yang smiled menacingly. He had confirmed with both Hundred Shots and Fatty Han that both of them had obtained 54 gold coins from Little Snow. He was the only one that obtained 54 silver coins!</p><br/><p>Little Snow rolled her eyes and said, \u201cThis lady here has nothing but her smile to offer!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty Han walked over. \u201cAlright then, smile for me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck off!\u201d</p><br/><p>[White Bone Crown] (Green-Copper, Heavy Armor)</p><br/><p>Defense: +4</p><br/><p>Vitality: +20</p><br/><p>Strength: +16</p><br/><p>Dexterity: +4</p><br/><p>Level requirement: 20</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang\u2019s current helm was already the same as this new equipment. He then rejected the roll and offered it to Drizzler.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You have obtained 11 silver pieces!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? That\u2019s it?\u201d said Fatty Han as the body started to disappear. \u201cWell I\u2019ll be damned. This boss is really stingy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, technically in the field, the last boss is one level higher than the mini-boss. So, we\u2019re considered lucky enough to fight a Gray-Silver boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang led the way forward and went through a tiny and narrow walkway.</p><br/><p>Shush!</p><br/><p>Just as Zhang Yang poked his head out, eight debuffs simultaneously appeared on his head. He scanned the area and saw 8 Skeleton Spellcasters running towards him! He frantically shouted, \u201cGet back!\u201d and led the team back into the walkway.</p><br/><p>The Skeleton Spellcasters chased after them until the walkway and stopped right there. They remained there for a while before turning back into the shadows. \u201cHoly shit! There are so many of them!\u201d Fatty Han swallowed his saliva. Everyone could hear the sound of it and realized how frightening it was.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang\u2019s head popped out \u2018-80\u2019 damage texts and only stopped after 15 seconds. Little Snow got busy immediately.</p><br/><p>[Shadow Decay]: Curse a target with the power of the shadow. Causes 500 shadow damage over 15 seconds to a target.</p><br/><p>Hundred Shot shouted as well. \u201cDamn, these monsters sure are strong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNecromancers. They are also known as the Curse Magicians. Their DoT skills are very OP!\u201d Zhang Yang sucked in a long breath. \u201cThis is quite a problem here. There are so many monsters inside. There\u2019s already eight of them waiting for us at the entrance. Damn! It\u2019s going to be a crowd inside there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty Han tapped Zhang Yang\u2019s shoulder and asked, \u201cHow do we fight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang thought for a while. \u201cAt this level, the Curse Magicians have not only but also another skill called ! The cast range of is 30 meters while the cast range of is only 20 meters! Did you guys notice, those monsters cannot leave the second floor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Four of them remained stoic, their eyes glinted with a plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh. I knew you guys were smart. Let\u2019s drag them to the entrance and kill them with our AoE skill!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Hundred Shots! Quick, take down the clouds!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the light of a dangerous situation, Zhang Yang commanded the team properly while bearing the responsibility of a party leader. Drizzler was scared beyond words. If she would really take it in, even a tiny bit of that boss\u2019 putrid fart would make her not eat anything for days!</p><br/><p>With Zhang Yang\u2019s clear words, Hundred Shots and Fatty Han turned around and changed their targets quickly and began attacking the cloud. However, the cloud\u2019s movement speed was too fast for them to properly react. Even though they managed to take half of the cloud\u2019s HP off, they were not quick enough to stop it from touching Drizzler. As soon as the cloud touched her, she cried out for help.</p><br/><p>\u201cNO! NO!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Drizzler has received the effect: Rotten Stink, Stunned for 10 seconds!\u2019</p><br/><p>The stationary Drizzler wobbled back and forth while the slowly floated towards her.</p><br/><p>\u2018-1200!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-1200!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-1200!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-1200!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-960!\u2019</p><br/><p>Aside from Zhang Yang, the rest of the team\u2019s HP were in the red zone. As she was still stunned, Drizzler had another bomb coming at her.</p><br/><p>\u2018-1200!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-1200!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-1200!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-1200!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-960!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Drizzler has died!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Little Snow has died!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Complete annihilation.</p><br/><p>Five souls appeared at the revive points.</p><br/><p>\u201cBleh! Bleh! Bleh! Stinky boss! Rotten boss! Shit! Shit! Shit!\u201d Drizzler\u2019s face had nothing but the expression of disgust. She stuck out her tongue and spat out everywhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down, Drizzler. This is all just a game! There\u2019s nothing real about this!\u201d Zhang Yang consoled.</p><br/><p>\u201cB-but, it\u2019s just so real! It\u2019s so smelly! I think I can still smell it on me!\u201d Drizzler cried. Fatty Han smiled evilly. \u201cUse XXX soap! Wash up for your health!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d Four middle fingers pointed at him.</p><br/><p>Shush! Five new souls entered the revive point. At this period of the dungeon exploration stage, there would be many parties sent by many guilds, wiped out in different ways, crowding the revive points.</p><br/><p>The newly arrived souls were Crimson Rage\u2019s party!</p><br/><p>Snow Seeker posted a question in the local channel, \u201cOh, it\u2019s none other than Zhan Yu, the party leader! Where did you guys stop at? Have you guys defeated the first boss?\u201d</p><br/><p>With the appearance of a beautiful woman, Fatty Han started to behave \u201cmanly\u201d. He then replied, \u201cActually, Miss beautiful Snow, I\u2019m the real player behind the scene. I was the one who trained Little Yang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ignoring his comments, Zhang Yang answered her question with another question. \u201cHehe, Snow guild master! What about you? Where did you guys stop at?\u201d</p><br/><p>Snow Seeker replied after a few moments later at the local channel, \u201cWe started off with the Middle Wing. Right now, we\u2019d defeated the first boss and are still fighting the second!\u201d</p><br/><p>They started the dungeon with the Middle Wing?</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang thought for a while about it and finally pieced it together. What they did was to hide the truth within a lie! While everyone was fighting furiously for the Front Wing First Clear Achievement, these girls silently raided the Middle Wing. This way, they would have saved themselves a lot of time!</p><br/><p>This method\u2026 no, this strategy was indeed ingenious! The only hiccup they could have ever faced was Zhang Yang\u2019s party!</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, what a coincidence! We\u2019re also fighting the second boss!\u201d Zhang Yang decided to tell her the truth since the other party was doing the same.</p><br/><p>Shit! All five Crimson Rage party members grit their teeth.</p><br/><p>How could they be so far?</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Snow, could he be lying to us on purpose? I think he\u2019s trying to inflict us with mental stress!\u201d Ever since her last encounter with Zhang Yang, Thorny Rose had nothing but a bad impression of him.</p><br/><p>Snow Seeker thought for a while and shook her head, denying her suggestion. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the case. We can clearly see how fast Zhan Yu\u2019s team proceeded to conquer the Front Wing. It would only be normal to think that they could progress this far!\u201d</p><br/><p>White Orchid became worried. \u201cT-then\u2026we s-should\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet the horses loose; empty the stable! There is no other way but forward! We\u2019ll have to use all our efforts to win this round! We have to defeat this boss!\u201d Snow Seeker turned her gaze at her teammates.</p><br/><p>\u201cDancer, Perfume! I want the both of you to increase your attack speed on the ! Rose, for god\u2019s sake, please pay attention to the , don\u2019t just chase the boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cB-but Sister Snow, I\u2019m all boobs\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>White Orchid interjected Thorny Rose\u2019s word. \u201cAll boobs no brains! Yeah, I\u2019ve heard that a thousand times now! Please stop using that as an excuse for your incompetence!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m warning you! If you make another mistake, I\u2019ll take a plane and fly over to Zhou Hang! I\u2019ll personally go to your house and burst those meaty sacks of fat!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch!\u201d Thorny Rose lowered her head in submission and whisper, \u201cMy boobs are really that big\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Perfumed Water suddenly voiced out, \u201cYou know\u2026if you want to compare breast sizes, our Sister Snow here is the real deal! Hehe! She\u2019s 36F!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that for real?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s real! It\u2019s a pity that Sister Snow always wears loose clothing. What a humble woman she is! Hehe! I even felt her size myself!\u201d Perfumed Water continued to brag.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little witch! How dare you defile Sister Snow! I-I haven\u2019t even touched hers before\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Snow! Let me touch\u2019em!\u201d</p><br/><p>The five women turned the quiet scene into the utmost chaotic room.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang\u2019s party went into the dungeon and revived.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah! That fight was really intense!\u201d</p><br/><p>The party members started to have small talk as they ran into the boss chamber.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yang! T-They\u2019re all freaking beautiful! How about this, we let them have this round! You know, to get them to owe us a favor! Who knows one day they may repay us! That\u2019s when we can hit on them back! I could have two! No, three! Argh! I\u2019d have them all!\u201d Fatty Han started to dwell in his own imagination.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 what? I didn\u2019t hear you. I was thinking that I should find another Hunter to replace you when I take down the next dungeon!\u201d Zhang Yang sighed loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh brilliant! I concur!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have my vote as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo thumbs up for me!\u201d</p><br/><p>3 voices spoke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Since when did I become public enemy number 1?\u201d Fatty Han shook his head, disapproving their action.</p><br/><p>When the party arrived at the entrance of the boss chamber, all five of them sat down and started to chew on recovery snacks before they moved into the chamber together.</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty Han! Hundred Shots! I\u2019d leave the to you guys!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe got it covered!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHere I go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shush! Zhang Yang used to dash into the fight once more.</p><br/><p>Remembering the fart from the boss, Drizzler guts were still filled with boiling rage. You did not need to tell her, she would go on and fight the boss herself. As she furiously fought the boss, swinging her weapon around wrathfully, she looked like someone who had completely lost her mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! More pesky bugs have come here to offer their lives!\u201d Ains laughed manically and raised its spear to pierce Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cI shall personally send you all to hell!\u201d</p><br/><p>The battle began!</p><br/><p>After a minute into the fight\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty! Hundred! The clouds!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrap! I\u2019m stunned!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShit, it\u2019s about to explode!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026..</p><br/><p>The five of them were sent back to the revive point.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yang, I really think that the two of us are not enough! Let little Drizzler help us with the clouds!\u201d Fatty Han voiced out his suggestion.</p><br/><p>\u201cBleh! Bleh! Bleh! No way in hell am I going near those smelly clouds!\u201d Drizzler shook her head left and right as fast as she could. Zhang Yang also shook his head, disagreeing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMelee attackers can\u2019t attack the clouds. She would be stunned once she makes any contact with it! Okay, let\u2019s try it this way. Once the cloud is out, Little Snow, I want you to stop healing and start attacking. I think I can handle myself when all 3 of you are busy with the clouds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026 Sounds good. Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>They revived, entered the dungeon, recovered their health, and started the boss fight.</p><br/><p>Two minutes later, they were wiped out again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm... That was satisfactory\u2026 three of you with the clouds. Yes. That\u2019s the way. Let\u2019s stick to this!\u201d Zhang Yang tried to console the team.</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty! I think you should really consider dieting! If your head weren\u2019t so big, the cloud would take 0.1 seconds more to reach you! We can still destroy that cloud instead of it smashing onto you directly!\u201d Drizzler playfully ridiculed.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Drizzler, This fat body of mine is as important as my own life!\u201d Fatty Han chuckled. \u201cThere are three benefits when you have a meaty body!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh here he goes again! Fatty Bro, are you trying to fool around again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHell no! Listen! Being fat has 3 benefits! Number 1, fat has high buoyancy, I won\u2019t drown that easily! Number 2, fat makes me heavy; heavy makes good momentum, you\u2019ll be sure to be at advantage in a fight! Number 3, fat is cool!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*****CK!\u201d 4 members booed Fatty Han.</p><br/><p>The party restarted the fight and tried again.</p><br/><p>Complete annihilation. Again.</p><br/><p>All dead. Again and again.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yang, this boss is very tough!\u201d Fatty Han shook his head. \u201cI-I can\u2019t continue on anymore. My equipment\u2019s durability is almost gone! I\u2019d need to go back to the city to have it fixed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need!\u201d Zhang Yang hurriedly answered. \u201cThere is an NPC in the entrance of the dungeon there. He\u2019s a blacksmith! He can fix your equipment. Let\u2019s revive and get out of the dungeon first then!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could we fail that many times?\u201d Drizzler thought about it but she could not find a way to solve it. The battle strategy was clearly laid out, but every time the fight started, she always got messed up. Making mistakes where she should not have made mistakes. The only reason she could think of is the not being destroyed fast enough which led the to kill them all.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have been fighting for some time now. Everyone must be tired!\u201d Zhang Yang thought of a solution and said, \u201cGuys, after we repaired our equipment, let\u2019s all log off and rest for an hour! It\u2019s already after 3pm now and we haven\u2019t had our lunch yet. This is a bad condition for us to continue playing. Have a meal, have some rest and we\u2019ll meet back here at 5pm sharp! We\u2019ll defeat the boss in one go then!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Everyone nodded their head in agreement. In the beginning, they were eager to fight, excited to defeat the boss and claim the \u201cFirst Clear\u201d Achievement. Of course, they would not feel hunger. However, once the fight dragged on longer and longer, and getting wiped over and over again, everyone lost their will and was unable to properly focus in battle. Unsurprisingly, mistakes will be made.</p><br/><p>They revived and went out of the dungeon to get their equipment repaired to its full durability. One by one, the team logged out and rest.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuh!\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang took off the helmet and let out a deep sigh. He cannot help but reminisce the Gaming Capsule he used 5 years later. In about half a year later, \u2018God\u2019s Miracle\u2019 would have released a series of revolution!</p><br/><p>Number 1, a change in the gameplay style, allowing players to continue to play the game even in sleep!</p><br/><p>This method allowed countless of working adults to fully enjoy the game! Furthermore, the in-game time and reality time was set to be 3:1. Three hours in game would be one hour in reality, allowing everyone take part in this wonderful world.</p><br/><p>Number 2, introduction to the Gaming Capsule!</p><br/><p>The utilization of both the gaming helmet and the Gaming Capsule would not cause any effect on the player character! The Gaming Capsule was developed by the aerospace technology and the stasis chamber. It had the function to provide nutrients and supplement the body needed in a fixed time interval. As long as the players were willing to do it, they could continue to play the game as long as 15 days in real life with no side-effect! When the Gaming Capsule was first released, it was obviously too expensive for normal citizens to purchase. It was a luxury only the rich could afford. One set of Gaming Capsule actually caused millions of dollars! Even a luxury car was inferior to the machine! It was only after two years later when the developers managed to solve a manufacturer problem that the Gaming Capsule became cheaper and many now could enjoy the product!</p><br/><p>Number 3, the launch of the Professional League Championship!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang clenched his fist tightly. His heart was filled with immense excitement! He only had one year left to prepare himself. One year, that was when Yu Li entered the game! With her in his mind, Zhang Yang eyes turned soft and kind, his mind was calmed down instantly as if a heavenly tree grew in his heart.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The lava will continue to flow for 30 seconds so remember to avoid it at all cost! Anyone standing in it will take 500 damage!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, sounds pretty simple. We should be fine as long as we can avoid the lava!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fourth skill\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly crap, there\u2019s a fourth skill?! Little Yang, please finish your sentence! Don\u2019t leave us hanging here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed at Fatty Han.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fourth skill is quite simple. For every party member\u2019s death, the boss gains 50% damage increase; which is why you have to survive at all costs! In summary, stay alive and don\u2019t die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>!</p><br/><p>\u201cHo! Where did these pests come from? How dare you step into my domain! Hmph! Water Spirit and Earth Spirit are completely useless! How could they let these pests get past them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Being completely immune to \u2019s stunning effect, Farr raised its fiery fists and hurled them at Zhang Yang. \u201cHahaha! I will burn your soul into the depths of the abyss! Enjoy wandering forever, never to return!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yang, is it just me, or does this boss love to talk a lot?\u201d Fatty Han asked while firing a shot.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I feel the same way too! Zhan Yu, this boss could actually be on the same level as you! Annoying as hell!\u201d</p><br/><p>Drizzler used to dash towards the boss and began hacking and slashing. Noticing high damage texts that were popped out rapidly, her face flushed with excitement.</p><br/><p>Hmph, if I were to keep my mouth shut, do you think we could reach to this stage?</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang had a little monologue and smiled bitterly by himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cSome boss\u2019 difficulty factor lies on their attack and skill. For others, like this one, have another way to annoy players, and that\u2019s through trash-talking!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty Han laughed. \u201cHuh? Trash-talking? Can they actually do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, just wait for it! This will be our first encounter of a trash-talking boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>While they were happily conversing, Zhang Yang had already stacked 5 layers of and made the vulnerable boss even more vulnerable.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou stinky piece of walking flesh! I\u2019ll use my flame to burn all of you into roasted meat, and then I\u2019ll eat you for dinner!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fire Spirit Farr began to chant . Three seconds later, a giant fireball flew rapidly towards Zhang Yang. He could not block nor escape from it and took a hit while simultaneously a huge \u2018-800\u2019 damage text flew across his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Foolish mortals! How does it feel being burnt into a crisp?\u201d Fire Spirit Farr then switched to its fiery first to strike. \u201cPerhaps I shall keep your skeletons and fashion them into a table! That would be a perfect decoration for my palace!\u201d</p><br/><p>After a few fist attacks, Fire Spirit Farr started to chant a . Being a Spellcaster-class monster, it would naturally prioritize its magic attacks as it\u2019s main.</p><br/><p>Boom! A fireball flew off, hitting Zhang Yang again.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible! You, a mere mortal withstanding my almighty attack! No! Why are you still alive?! NO! You must die! You must die NOW!\u201d Fire Spirit Farr growled loudly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Fire Spirit Farr is enraged!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Fire Spirit Far has unleashed !\u2019</p><br/><p>A circular wall appeared with Farr at the center of it. The wall then blasted away in all directions and knocked back Zhang Yang and Drizzler, while leaving a debuff effect on them. \u201cFoolish creatures! I will not hold back any longer!\u201d The fire spirit then chanted another , aiming at Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>Fatty Han could not hold it in any longer. \u201cWhat the hell?! This boss can really talk\u2026 a lot!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang snickered, \u201cHaha, trash-talk! This is considered as a challenge. Once you encountered enough of these kind of bosses, you\u2019ll get used to it soon enough. Still, you wouldn\u2019t really get yourself mad from a computer, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Snow was holding on for quite some time, but eventually she lost it too. \u201cWould you guys just kill it already?! I\u2019m suffering here!\u201d</p><br/><p>After casting , Fire Spirit Farr scanned the party. \u201cHmph! You who would only sneak behind and attack, I will burn you all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Woosh! Eight rivers of lava flowed out from the boss\u2019 body, across the battlefield. Fatty Han and the rest managed to evade it by a hair\u2019s breadth, but the melee fighters did not have enough time to react at all. It was only luck that the boss\u2019 did not target a specific player. When the lava started to spew from the boss\u2019 body, it went past Zhang Yang and Drizzler, scaring the hell out of them!</p><br/><p>90%, 80%, 70%... the boss quickly lost its HP at a fast pace. As it talked too much, the party began striking and shooting at their best and maybe even a little more as they were pretty much annoyed by the trash-talking.</p><br/><p>\u201cDespicable human! Curse you!\u201d Fire Spirit Farr cried in pain after being attacked. \u201cLet the flame cleanse you away!\u201d Using again, the boss blasted his firewall everywhere and almost killed Zhang Yang with only over 600 HP left.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank god this boss didn\u2019t curse my future baby child or something like that, or I\u2019d be really furious!\u201d Fatty Han said as he happily drew his bow and shot at his own pace.</p><br/><p>\u201cSlim and Handsome, you\u2019ve been shooting for almost half a day, and yet nothing came out! How could you call yourself a man?\u201d</p><br/><p>That was it. Fatty Han stopped his attack suddenly and furiously walked up to the boss! \u201cWho said I can\u2019t shoot it out?! People call me the \u20187 shot man\u2019! I can shoot it out in five minutes! Hmph! I can\u2019t shoot? I\u2019ll shoot in your f*cking face!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, take a chill pill there, horny brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDisgusting prick!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty, you just revealed your secret here!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was then Fatty Han realized that he had been played by a computer! How could he allow himself to be fooled by a computer to lose his temper?</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Fatty, I think you\u2019ve completely tarnished your good name!\u201d Zhang Yang laughed loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, get out of there!\u201d Fatty Han was angry right down to his bone. \u201cThis boss\u2019 perverseness is just as good as mine!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBullsh*t! You\u2019re the only one here with that kind of mind! The boss is insulting your marksmanship, not your\u2026 you know! Hey, Fatty Han. Could it be that a certain part of your body isn\u2019t working properly? I know an old medical officer that lives just down the alley here\u2026\u201d Zhang Yang could not help himself to laugh even more.</p><br/><p>\u201cMind your own business! My little brother is as fine as it is!\u201d Fatty Han defended his own \u201cability.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fire Spirit Farr began provoking Hundred Shots as well, \u201cHundred Shots, you\u2019ve been shooting for almost half a day, and yet nothing came out! How could you call yourself a man?\u201d</p><br/><p>Being Hundred Shots, the man that never lost his \u201cchill\u201d, he remained steady and undisturbed as he continued to fire his arrow unfazed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee that, Fatty Han? That\u2019s what I call style. Cool as a cucumber!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch! Hundred Shots, tell me the truth now, how old are you?\u201d Fatty Han asked.</p><br/><p>Hundred Shot sniggered before he answered, \u201c30!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you are 30, you\u2019ll have that problem. When you are 40, you can\u2019t do anything about it besides having those thoughts! This is not style, it\u2019s a fact! I\u2019ll never have the problem about shooting it out!\u201d</p><br/><p>With this topic now in the air, not a single man would leave themselves undefended. Hundred Shots curved his lips and said, \u201cWell, according to my wife, I\u2019ve no problem with my little brother. And if it\u2019s a problem, it\u2019s not a problem at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBullshit philosopher!\u201d</p><br/><p>Both Zhang Yang and Fatty Han were surprised at Hundred Shot\u2019s comment and laughed out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, are you guys fighting or not?!\u201d Drizzler angrily cried out. She could not take it any longer; it was not about the dirty adult talks that revolved around their private matters, but the fact that she could not understand any bit of it! If she could not understand it, then it did not matter anymore!</p><br/><p>\u201cDrizzler! Are you giving me a massage? If that\u2019s the case, it would be a waste! I could barely feel anything!\u201d Fire Spirit Farr turned and pointed at Drizzler, starting to say something insulting again. \u201cI will flatten you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Flat? Flat chest? Did you just call me flat-chested!?\u201d It\u2019s hard not to admire how Drizzler interpreted that. From the word \u201cflatten\u201d to \u201cflat chest\u201d. Still, the angered little Drizzler was triggered to fight even wilder than ever!</p><br/><p>Fatty Han laughed and said, \u201cThis boss sure is fun to play with!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHorny boss! Perverted Fatty!\u201d Drizzler continued to land more hits on the monster.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey, hey! I\u2019m a normal and serious man!\u201d Fatty Han was quick to refute.</p><br/><p>\u201cDespicable mortal! Feel my wrath!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lava began to flow out again, causing the entire party to jump like cats and dogs. As the party regained their composure, the boss\u2019 HP was left with only 20%.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis boss is quite easy to defeat! If it wasn\u2019t because of its crap, I could fight this kind of boss anytime!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang shook his head. \u201cWe were only lucky. We didn\u2019t get hit by the and combo! That one is a lethal skill!\u201d</p><br/><p>15%, 10%, 7%... The boss\u2019 HP continued to drastically drop.</p><br/><p>5%, 3%...</p><br/><p>Boom! A landed on Zhang Yang and reduced his HP down to 512 points. At that moment, the boss opened his mouth and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve angered me, mortals!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Fire Spirit Farr has unleashed !\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-600\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang was instantly killed by the attack.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Zhan Yu has died!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop! Kill it! Kill it!\u201d Zhang Yang shouted.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Fire Spirit Farr has gained a effect. All attacks have been increased by 50%!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Delicious soul! I can feel my powers grow stronger!</p><br/><p>Fire Spirit Farr\u2019s body grew larger. Now that Zhang Yang died, the boss changed its target to the second most aggro player; Drizzler. Luckily, this boss did not have the tendency to use . Even if Drizzler was hit by a , it would only cause 450 damage and then kill her off easily with a few normal attacks. It did not need to use the 3-second delay !</p><br/><p>2%, 1%...</p><br/><p>\u2018-2250!\u2019</p><br/><p>Carrying the debuff, Drizzler was vulnerable to attacks. Even if Little Snow could heal her back to full HP, her pitiful 1200 HP could only withstand a single attack from the boss. Soon after, Drizzler also died.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Fire Spirit Farr has gained a effect. All attacks have been increased by 100%!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a wonderful feeling! My powers grow stronger again!\u201d Fire Spirit Farr laughed evilly, and then turned to face Fatty Han and casted .</p><br/><p>\u20181200.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018950.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018740.\u2019</p><br/><p>The boss had a little over 1,000 HP left!</p><br/><p>\u2018400.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018143.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-2000!\u2019 was cast. Fatty Han was defeated.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Fire Spirit Farr has gained a effect. All attacks have been increased by 150%!\u2019</p><br/><p>This time around, the boss did not cast a . It rushed over to Hundred Shots and attacked him with physical strikes.</p><br/><p>\u2018-176!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-413!\u2019</p><br/><p>A simultaneous attack came from both Hundred Shots and Little Snow.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, no! This isn\u2019t happening! I am the Immortal Fire God! No one could have killed me! No\u2026!\u201d With an unwilling expression, Fire Spirit Farr fell defeated.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You and your party members have killed Fire Spirit Farr. Obtaining 69,050 Experience Points. (50 points party bonus)!\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

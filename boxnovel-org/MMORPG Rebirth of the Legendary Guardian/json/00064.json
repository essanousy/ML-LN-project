This is absurd! How could there be a venomous frog!\u201d Drizzler scolded.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed. \u201cAh come on! Even something like milk, or\u2026or\u2026eggs has poison in them! What\u2019s so strange about a poison spitting frog?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty Han continued to wail alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoo\u2026I got sprayed in the face\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEw\u2026\u201d The girls turned away from Fatty Han in disgust.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang and Hundred Shots burst into laughter after they understood what Fatty Han meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-It\u2019s fine Fatty. Haha\u2026You\u2019re won\u2019t get inseminated by the Frog seme- I mean, poison!\u201d Zhang Yang quickly ran off to his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cNoob tank! Since when did you learn all the indecent stuff from Fatty Han?!\u201d Drizzler turned and gave a scornful look at Fatty Han.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! What did you mean by that? Zhang Yang was the bad influence! Not me! I was young and pure when this guy came along and dragged me down into the dark side! Ladies! You must set the facts straight!\u201d</p><br/><p>While they were having their conversation, everyone went back to their body and revived.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that you have seen what the frog can do, you should now know what to do! But just to be sure, don\u2019t stand together! Don\u2019t let the poison infect another person. We cannot withstand that kind of damage!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang walked towards the boss and triggered its aggro. The fight started as the monster leapt towards him.</p><br/><p>\u2018-359!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-381!\u2019</p><br/><p>Wielding a one-handed weapon, Zhang Yang could still deal a much stronger damage than Drizzler with her two-handed weapon. Still, it was all because of the sword Zhang Yang wielded. The Level 20 Gray-Silver sword was still the strongest sword so far. Coupled with the passive skill and 5 stacks of , Zhang Yang was practically fighting a boss with 0 defense! Any attack in that state would be extremely devastating! Fatty Han and the rest could only stare in jealousy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Venomous Frog King has used !\u2019</p><br/><p>The dark-reddish liquid was sprayed all over the place, hitting everyone with the liquid. Upon contact, their body glowed in a deep red color. Beneath their feet, there was a circle shaped red mist, measuring approximated 1 meter in diameter. A debuff icon appeared on everyone\u2019s head and they started to receive damage from the poison.</p><br/><p>However, having died once under this skill, everyone proactively moved around and spread across the battlefield, preventing further infections. Little Snow quickly did her job without having Zhang Yang to remind her.</p><br/><p>Her current magic attack exceeded 300 and her heals were over 120 HP per tick, overshadowing the boss\u2019s DoT damage. Her completely nullified the boss\u2019s poison effect! That is, if the team did not do something foolish like infecting each other with the poison.</p><br/><p>80%, 70%...the boss HP started to drop at a steady rate.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! You smelly frog! Let\u2019s see how long can you hold on!\u201d Drizzler laughed out manically as she swung her weapon around like a true psychopath.</p><br/><p>\u201cCroak croak!\u201d The frog \u201canswered\u201d.</p><br/><p>60%, 50%, 40%!</p><br/><p>The boss damage was undeniably strong, but Zhang Yang\u2019s evasive capability was stronger. Little Snow\u2019s healing strength was also on another level to begin with. With the both of them working together, even a tougher boss could not stand a chance against them.</p><br/><p>5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, 0%!</p><br/><p>A loud thud could be heard when the boss\u2019 huge body fell.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You and the party members around have killed the Venomous Frog King. Obtaining 30,050 Experience Points (50 points party bonus)!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cShitty boss! Rah! Take that!\u201d Drizzler stomped the lifeless body.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder how many [Frog King\u2019s Blood] would this boss drop\u2026\u201d Zhang Yang reached out his hands and opened the corpse.</p><br/><p>[Frog King\u2019s Blood]: Quest item</p><br/><p>Thank god there were 5 of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it depends on the number of people who accepted the quest!\u201d said Hundred Shots.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho cares about that! As long as there\u2019s enough for everyone to complete the quest!\u201d said Fatty Han as he took one of the [Frog King\u2019s Blood] and kept it inside his inventory.</p><br/><p>\u201cHas everyone collected one each already?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay! Move aside! I want to get our prize now!\u201d said Drizzler as she pushed Zhang Yang aside.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed and talked to Little Snow.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you guys use to compete for the right to open the corpse? What happened to your petty squabble? Are you guys at peace now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying? To let the young ones have their way is what an elder sister is supposed to do!\u201d Little Snow winked.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch! What are you lying about this time! You cheated me of my limited-edition cologne! Both of them!\u201d Drizzler quickly overruled Little Snow\u2019s sweet talk.</p><br/><p>Little Snow rolled her eyes and said, \u201cYou\u2019re still too young to put on cologne! And I didn\u2019t cheat. I was taking them away for your own good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Drizzler scoffed, unconvinced.</p><br/><p>[Poison Essence] (Green-Copper, Special Item)</p><br/><p>Use: Causes all targets (Including the user) within 30 meter to be poisoned, receiving 150 Nature Damage every 3 seconds for 15 seconds. Effect cannot be stacked.</p><br/><p>Charge left: 50/50</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? What is this? I have never seen this kind of item before!\u201d said Fatty Han.</p><br/><p>\u201cA Special Item class. It\u2019s some sort of a play toy like item. You can\u2019t really keep using them as they have limited usage. If it can be used unlimitedly, it would be the same as having another AoE attack skill!\u201d Zhang Yang explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cGimme! Gimme! I call dibs!\u201d Drizzler\u2019s demanded. She wanted this extra little tool to increase her damage as she had always lost to Zhang Yang in damage power. Drizzler was quite overbearing whenever she voiced out her demands, so everyone gave it up for her.</p><br/><p>[Frog King\u2019s Flap] (Green-Copper, Cloth Armor)</p><br/><p>Defense: +1</p><br/><p>Use: Grant you the ability to jump higher, last for 10 seconds. Cool down time: 1 minute.</p><br/><p>Level requirement: 20</p><br/><p>\u201cFuh! Good item!\u201d Zhang Yang eyes quickly glinted. \u201cMine!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNoob tank, this is a Cloth Armor! Death sentence to you who takes item without consideration!\u201d Drizzler complained with her puffy cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really that dumb? This item is designed to be a Cloth Armor so that the 6 main classes could equip this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat so special about it?\u201d Fatty Han started to show some interest.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith this item, you can reach places you normally could not reach!\u201d Zhang Yang had no intention to keep it a secret. In the game, there were places that could only be reached with equipment such as the [Frog King\u2019s Flap]. Those hidden places may contain treasure chest and also NPCs that could issue special quests!</p><br/><p>Fatty Han faces morphed into a perverted look.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlaces that could not reach\u2026like a girl\u2019s bathroom window\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to hell!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before this, Zhang Yang had rarely ever voiced his wants, so everyone willingly gave up their roll when he asked for the item.</p><br/><p>[Unhatched Little Tadpole] (Green-Copper Pet Monster)</p><br/><p>Use: Hatch a little Tadpole. Who knows, someday it could become a handsome prince!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is a Pet Monster?\u201d Fatty Han turned and looked at Zhang Yang, waiting for an explanation. All of them knew that Zhang Yang was a \u201cbeta player\u201d.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang walked and stood in front of them. He dusted off his clothes and adjust his cloth.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone took a step closer, expecting the explanation to be epic.</p><br/><p>\u201cA Pet Monster is\u2026a pet monster!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhaa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhaha, I\u2019m just kidding. A Pet Monster is like a pet dog or cat. A companion that you could bring along anywhere you go. However, this pet monster and a Hunter\u2019s pet is not the same! This pet cannot attack nor has it any attacking ability!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is nonsense!\u201d Fatty Han puffed an angry breath through his nose.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis boss only dropped these 3 stupid toys and no equipment at all! This is preposterous!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang shook his head. \u201cTch Tch Tch! These 3 \u201ctoys\u201d are worth much more than some equipment! You must keep this in mind. With our leveling speed, how long do you think an equipment will last? A Level 20 equipment could only last until you reach Level 30! The turnover rate for equipment at our low-level period is very fast! However, non-combat items are different! They can be used for as long as you want! Especially Pet Monsters! Pet Monsters\u2019 drop rates are extremely low! After half a year, you could probably sell this Pet Monster for at least 10,000 gold pieces in the auction house!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang was not making thing up. In his previous life, pet monsters could be sold for a very high price, especially those are extremely rare. Those rare pets could be sold for at least a few hundred thousands! What he told them was an understatement.</p><br/><p>\u201cT-ten thousand!?\u201d Both Drizzler and Little Snow eye\u2019s glinted with the money symbol! Both of them rolled for the item in the same time.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang gave up the item because he was not all that fond of the money. Fatty Han and Hundred Shots also gave up the pet because they were not as interested.</p><br/><p>Little Snow obtained the item with 76 points, while Drizzler only got 43 points.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, time to submit the item and complete the quest! Once we have completed the quest, we will get a reward. And that reward is the one that we should be excited about!\u201d said Zhang Yang even though he never did complete a single main story quest in his previous life!</p><br/><p>The party then headed back to the Antelope Village and killed themselves to talk to Emmy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWonderful! You have gathered the ingredients to make the antidote!\u201d Emmy smiled happily.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother! Elder sister! Please head to the evil Necromancer\u2019s Lair and save all the villager\u2019s soul!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Emmy has a quest for you: Rescue the Villagers\u2019 Souls. Will you accept it? This is a main story quest. Complete the quest to receive a luxurious reward!\u201d</p><br/><p>Here it comes!</p><br/><p>The party quickly accepted the quest.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You have obtained the item [Properly-Made Antidote]!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Rescue the Villager\u2019s Soul] (Difficulty Level: S)</p><br/><p>Quest description: Emmy pleads with you to save the souls of the residents of Antelope Village. You will have to defeat the evil Necromancer Zac in order to release the imprisoned souls! You can find the evil Necromancer Zac at the Cave of Bones, west of the Desolated Ghostly Flatlands.</p><br/><p>Be wary! Zac is extremely strong and powerful. Make sure you have enough players to fight him together!</p><br/><p>Progress: Released Villagers\u2019 Soul 0/1</p><br/><p>[Properly-Made Antidote] (Quest Item)</p><br/><p>Use: Grants you the immunity to the deadly poison! Last for 10 minutes.</p><br/><p>Charge left: 3/3</p><br/><p>\u201cWe finally got the main story quest!\u201d said Drizzler excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Furthermore, Emmy is no longer the NPC that we will need to meet to complete the quest! In other words, we do not need to kill ourselves anymore!\u201d said Zhang Yang with a smile on his face.</p><br/><p>Everyone quickly turned their sights to the girl\u2019s head and there is no white exclamation mark on her head! The NPC to complete the quest is someone else!</p><br/><p>Hundred Shots suddenly said, \u201cWe did an A-level difficulty quest and fought a Green-Copper boss. Now, our quest is an S-level difficulty; which means the boss we will be fighting is a Gray-Silver boss?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Right!\u201d Little Snow\u2019s voice overwhelmed Hundred Shots. \u201cRemember the Gray-Silver boss Andoin or Andola\u2026 I can\u2019t remember his name. Has he spawned already?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang scratched his head and thought for a while.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026That Gray-Silver boss will re-spawn after 3 days. Which means\u2026it\u2019s today!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAwesome! We must fight it later!\u201d Little Snow licked her lips. \u201cSo much money\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure! However, we must first kill this current quest boss!\u201d Zhang Yang waved his arms forward. \u201cLet\u2019s go heroes! We have ourselves a bad guy to kill!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

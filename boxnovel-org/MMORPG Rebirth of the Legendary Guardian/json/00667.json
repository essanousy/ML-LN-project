It was rather valuable after all. Hence, using the rolling method was not too practical. Lucky players like the little brat or even Han Ying Xue could easily get them. Players like Zhang Yang and Daffodil Daydream had never been very lucky in that sort of thing.</p><br/><p>Hence, items with high value were distributed via turns instead. This time, the crystals fell to Endless Starlight. Since there were only 10 of them, farming the next one should not be too difficult.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang had the [Identifying Scroll] in hand and he had the two Ethereal tier equipment identified. The heavy armor equipment was given to the little brat.</p><br/><p>[Anti-Shadow Helmet] (Ethereal, Heavy Armor)</p><br/><p>Defense: +320</p><br/><p>Vitality: +6668</p><br/><p>Strength: +2265</p><br/><p>Intelligence: +972</p><br/><p>{Level 5 Socket 1}</p><br/><p>{Level 5 Socket 2}</p><br/><p>Equip: Increases your maximum HP by 13,330</p><br/><p>Equip: Increases damage dealt and healing rate by 8%</p><br/><p>Equip: Absorbs 940 damage on attack.</p><br/><p>Equip: Increases Shadow Magic resistant by 10%</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 150</p><br/><p>Special: Lower Requirement reduced by 20 Levels.</p><br/><p>Anti-Shadow Set: Anti-Shadow Helmet, {Anti-Shadow Chest Plate}, {Anti-Shadow Greeves}</p><br/><p>3 Equip set: Increases Shadow Magic resistant by 20%..</p><br/><p>Note: Once belonged to a warrior who tried to defeat Brosh. Sadly, he failed to do so. He had spent a fortune to craft a set of heavy armor with strong Shadow Magic resistance. However, it was obviously not strong enough.</p><br/><p>\"Set equipment?!\" Everyone had their eyes wide with delight. After Level 80, the number of set equipment appearing was extremely low. However, even if they had managed to find the set equipment, it was a set equipment that was designed to counter a specific type of magic attack. It was too specific and not versatile enough to wear it all the time.</p><br/><p>However, if every equipment set does come with a 10% Shadow resistant, three equipment, and the equipment set effect would total up to 50% Shadow resistance. It was good enough to counter a Shadow elemental magic monster such as Brosh.</p><br/><p>Although the equipment stats were rather plain and average, it was still an Ethereal tier item at that. The stats were disappointing. In fact, the only benefit a player would get from equipping such equipment would be the high Shadow resistance. However, it was still a rather strong Guardian equipment!</p><br/><p>\"NUUUUUU! Why! Why! Why must it have Intelligence stats!?\" Wei Yan Er wailed sadly as she tossed the helmet to Endless Starlight.</p><br/><p>\"Pervy boy! Here\u2019s to you. May it give you a little more Intelligence in your empty brain!\"</p><br/><p>Endless Starlight laughed and said, \"Little Yan Er, I have over 4,000 Intelligence points. How much do you have?\"</p><br/><p>Naturally, all Warrior, Hunter and Thief class players have zero!</p><br/><p>The little brat rolled her eyes and said, \"So? 4,000 Intelligence, yet you still have the brains of a pig! You\u2019ve got some nerves to show it off like that huh!\"</p><br/><p>Instead of being angry, everyone laughed at the little girl\u2019s petty attempt to pick a fight. She was, after all, a little girl at heart despite being 18 years old.</p><br/><p>\"Endless Starlight. I will take your tanking skill seriously from now on. You have the equipment now. I expect better performance,\" said Zhang Yang with a nod.</p><br/><p>Wei Yan Er took out the blue colored ring and held it up high to the sky. Under the bright light, the ring gave off a bright, yet calming blue radiant. It was as if the ring was made from the ocean\u2019s water.</p><br/><p>[Brosh Engagement Ring] (Ethereal, Ring)</p><br/><p>Vitality: +1667</p><br/><p>Intelligence: +566</p><br/><p>Spirit: +566</p><br/><p>Equip: Increases maximum MP by 1,130</p><br/><p>Equip: Increases damage dealt and healing rate by 8%</p><br/><p>Equip: Absorbs 485 damage on attack.</p><br/><p>Use: Turns a target that is facing you into your lover. Target that is inflicted will not attack you. You will lose the ability to attack the target as well. Effect lasts for 10 seconds. Cooldown: 4 hours.</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 150</p><br/><p>Special: Level Requirement reduced by 20 Levels.</p><br/><p>Note: After the kidnapping of Brosh\u2019s fianc\u00e9, the young man dwelled into the Dark Arts in order to search a means to have his revenge.</p><br/><p>Seems like the item does have some flavor text concerning the boss.</p><br/><p>Since the item was meant for magic classes, Han Ying Xue, Daffodil Daydream, and Fantasy Sweetheart rolled for it. Daffodil Daydream won the item after rolling 87 points. She then equipped the ring and smiled as if it was her own engagement ring. Items such as rings, shield, and necklace do not have any sockets. Hence, after Identifying the equipment, the item will unlock its full potential. Weapons and Armor still have to be socketed before a player could use it for a real battle.</p><br/><p>All equipment had been distributed, leaving the skill book last to be reviewed.</p><br/><p>[Skill Book: Eagle Eye]</p><br/><p>Use: Teaches you {Eagle Eye}</p><br/><p>Class Requirement: Warrior, Knight, Thief, Hunter</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 20</p><br/><p>After playing for so long, they had finally obtained the second skill book for {Eagle Eye}. For more than 2 years since the game had been launch, everyone in Zhang Yang circle knew about the skill and had kept on checking on the auction house for the book. However, for so long, they had never found a single book.</p><br/><p>\"WAHAHAH! The first {Eagle Eye} was stolen by the noob tank! Now I can have the skill as well!\" Wei Yan Er jumped around happily.</p><br/><p>\"Hey\u2026Since when I steal it?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah! You did!\" Wei Yan Er exclaimed and pouted. \"Not only had you stolen the book, you have also stolen my cousin sister\u2019s heart! You evil man!\" Wei Yan Er crossed her arms and gave Zhang Yang an evil glare. \"Son of a b*tch!\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang popped a vein in his forehead.</p><br/><p>\"What did you just call me?\" Zhang Yang cracked his knuckle to show his dominance to Wei Yan Er.</p><br/><p>\"Son of a--- AWWW!\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang grabbed her and pressed his knuckles against the top of her head.</p><br/><p>\"You use that word again and I\u2019ll put on my metal gauntlet next time.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone laughed.</p><br/><p>Still, the book was extremely precious. Even though they had a potion to grant them a 20% Defense ignore effect, it was not that they could 100% ignore all the Defense of the enemy! However, with the skill {Eagle Eye} at Level 1, they could pair with Zhang Yang or Wei Yan Er\u2019s {Cripple Defense} to completely ignore all the enemy\u2019s armor! It was exceptionally strong against high Defense enemy.</p><br/><p>All physical attack class players then were getting their hopes up. Let the system decide for the roll!</p><br/><p>After an intense session of rolling, Sun Xin Yu was the final winner. With everyone admiring her luck, they could do nothing but clap their hands as Sun Xin Yu patted the book against her mighty chest and learned the skill.</p><br/><p>\"Imagine that\u2026Sister Sun\u2019s attack have always been high. Now that she has the skill, her attacks would be even higher!\" Daffodil Daydream smiled and praised. Even if the skill could ignore 100% Defense, it would do no good for her since her magic attack would already ignore all defense!</p><br/><p>\"Nyehahaha! Noobie tank has a proper rival now! Sister Sun will definitely kick your *ss!\" cried Wei Yan Er happily.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang smirked. \"Perhaps she would. Perhaps she won\u2019t. However, I\u2019m sure of one thing. You can never defeat me!\"</p><br/><p>\"Grrr\u2026It\u2019s your fault\u2026for taking my S class Inheritance\u2026\" Wei Yan Er muttered disgruntledly and sulked at a corner.</p><br/><p>As the quest was completed, everyone flew back to Maanya Castle and reported the successful mission to Count Ropolly.</p><br/><p>As they approached the gates, Count Ropolly himself was there to welcome Zhang Yang and the party. Since everyone had accepted the quest from Zhang Yang himself, they obtained 10,000,000 experience points. However, the only person who could enter the vault was Zhang Yang alone. With the count walking by his side, Zhang Yang was escorted to the castle\u2019s treasure vault. The vault was extremely huge and was filled with chests. Zhang Yang walked casually and opened random chests. Most of them were just gold coins. Hanging on the walls on all corners were weapon and equipment. Even though the count had given Zhang Yang the freedom to choose, most of the equipment available there were junks that were so useless that Zhang Yang would not even consider putting them in the Little Merchandize Shop. Zhang Yang continued to walk deeper into the vault and found four equipment that were radiating with a metallic luster. Zhang Yang sighed. Now those are the \u2018real\u2019 treasures. They were mostly boots of Leather, Heavy Armor, and Silk types. Hanging in the last compartment was a red colored magic staff which was the item that he needed. The Specter of Fate.</p><br/><p>Since the rule only allowed an item, Zhang Yang had no choice but to pick the Scepter of Fate. However, at then, Zhang Yang had no interest in anything below the Ethereal tier.</p><br/><p>After completing and accepted the quest reward, Zhang Yang disbanded the party and returned to Morning Town. He then went to the Ten Barren Seas, headed to the dungeon and had Margery break the third seal of the Sword of Purging Devourer.</p><br/><p>[Sword of Purging Devourer] (Ethereal, Two-Handed Sword)</p><br/><p>Weapon Attack: 12,006 \u2013 20,006</p><br/><p>Attack Interval: 3.8 seconds.</p><br/><p>DPS: 4,212</p><br/><p>{Level 5 Socket 1}</p><br/><p>{Level 5 Socket 2}</p><br/><p>Equip: Increases damage dealt by 30%</p><br/><p>Equip: Increases Critical chance rate by 5%</p><br/><p>Equip: Grants a 4% chance to replicate a previous attack after a successful attack on a target</p><br/><p>Equip: Grants a 15% chance to stun a target after a successful attack on a target.</p><br/><p>Special: Consumes a weapon and absorbs the weapon special effect. Can only be use once.</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 150</p><br/><p>Special: Level Requirement reduced by 20 Levels.</p><br/><p>Bound.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang would not dare to use one-handed weapon as a sacrificial tool for the sword to prevent a chance for the sword to turn back into a one-handed sword. This time, the last of the seals was broken and there cannot be a second chance.</p><br/><p>Since the consumed weapon only needed to have a strong special skill, the tier of the weapon was not need to be considered. Zhang Yang went to the auction house and search for any weapon with a better effect and tossed it to the sword to \"eat\" it.</p><br/><p>The last sword special effect gained was: \"Grants a 2% chance to receive a 10% damage buff for 10 seconds after a successful attack on a target. Effect cannot stack.</p><br/><p>Even though the Sword of Purging Devourer had the same DPS as the Dragon Slayer Axe, Warrior had the passive skill to gain an additional 5% Critical rate and damage boost. Even with the sword, Zhang Yang could not gain the tiny boost of damage, his basic attack was already as high as 78,978 \u2013 98,978. A single sword attack could reach as high as 100,000!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang had the two new equipment that he obtained from a while back socketed with a Level 5 Strength Gemstone and after enhancing the Gemstone, Zhang Yang was free. He had nothing to do, then. The only thing that he could find to fill up the time was to help Fantasy Sweetheart kill her Inheritance quest boss. However, the quest boss was so easy that even Endless Starlight could tank it with ease.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang then decided to fight in the Battle Team Professional League and the Individual Ranking Competition after that. When he was bored that those, he took of with the Phoenix to grind some monsters. He then came back to town and crafted some potions. When he was bored with even that, he logged out of the game to do some adult-leisure-romance-action activity with Han Ying Xue and Sun Xin Yu. With the entire day well spent, Zhang Yang felt that it was one of those days that he truly was living the life. The next big thing that he should pay attention to was the Level 140 dungeon, the Death Abyss Grouped Dungeon.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

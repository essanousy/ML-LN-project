Every swing of its sword felt like a crashing airplane; even the space around the sword was being distorted!</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Snow! Focus your heal on me!\u201d Zhang Yang cried.</p><br/><p>The final moment of the fight was the most important but it was the most dangerous too. I all came down to this moment. One wrong move, one missed step, and it will be the end of the party!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang emptied his mind and focused on evading every single one of the boss\u2019 attack!</p><br/><p>\u2018Dodge!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Dodge!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Block!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-1,184!\u2019</p><br/><p>It only took one successful hit for Zhang Yang to lose over 60% of his HP. Were he to absorb full damage including the 600 Shadow damage and the falling rain, he would have certainly died!</p><br/><p>Little Snow went all out. She did not even care to calculate to save Mana points, or time. All she knew that she had to do all that it took to prevent Zhang Yang from dying!</p><br/><p>9%, 8%, 7%!</p><br/><p>The boss\u2019 HP dropped but Little Snow\u2019s MP dropped faster!</p><br/><p>\u201cFight on guys! Only 20,000 HP left! It\u2019s almost dead!\u201d Zhang Yang boosted their confidence to excite the party. Even though they were still standing strong and not on the verge of death, they could still feel a tremendous amount of stress, pressure, and fatigue in comparison to a thousand battles.</p><br/><p>However, now that the battle has almost reached its end, the ranged attackers were extremely relaxed! The boss no longer casted Shadow Control nor did it summon anymore minions. As long as they could keep watch for the rain, they would be essentially out of harm\u2019s way. On the other extreme end, if Zhang Yang ever missed a block or Little Snow was a millisecond slow in casting her heal, the entire team could be wiped out!</p><br/><p>5%, 4%, 3%, 2%!</p><br/><p>The tension has never been that high! The party mustered any ounce of strength they had left to finish the fight! No one wanted to fail in this fight when there was only 2% HP left!</p><br/><p>1% left!</p><br/><p>3,000!</p><br/><p>2,000!</p><br/><p>1,000!</p><br/><p>589!</p><br/><p>210!</p><br/><p>0!</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You and the party members around you have successfully killed Shurian. Obtained 80,050 Experience points (50 points party bonus)!\u2019</p><br/><p>As the system notification rang, the boss fell off its horse and slammed against the ground. The horse stomped the ground and groaned while a magic circle appeared underneath it and a pillar of dark light blasted towards the sky. The horse vanished without a trace.</p><br/><p>Tired and breathless, Drizzler knelt down to rest, but as soon as she saw her horse being taken away, she quickly jumped to her feet and wailed.</p><br/><p>\u201cArgh\u2026 my horsie\u2026 gimme back my horsie!\u201d She quickly dashed towards the magic circle but when she arrived, it disappeared as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWuu\u2026\u201d Drizzler actually cried. Tears was flowing down her cheek! \u201cI want my horsie\u2026Gimme *hic* back my *hic* horsie\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>With no enemy left to defeat, the green mist dispersed and eventually disappeared, leaving the air clean and free of any contaminant.</p><br/><p>Fatty Han went over and soothe Drizzler. \u201cLittle Drizzler, don\u2019t be sad anymore. Here, I\u2019ll be your horsie.\u201d He actually went on all fours.</p><br/><p>Seeing Fatty Han actually going to that extent, Drizzler could not help but to laugh it off. She then tried her best to glare angrily at him. \u201cDo you really think that I am still a 3-year old baby?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>With that level of crying and wailing, who wouldn\u2019t think that way?</p><br/><p>Everyone else was thinking the same thing but to save the trouble of debating with her afterwards, they kept it to themselves.</p><br/><p>Foosh!</p><br/><p>A wind blew by and a ghostly figure of an old man appeared from nowhere. It then floated towards the party and bowed with a sense of appreciation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thank you all for defeating the demon!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was confused at first, but they quickly looked up and read his title.</p><br/><p>[Stark, Antelope Village Member] (Normal)</p><br/><p>Level: 1</p><br/><p>HP: 0/50</p><br/><p>It was a ghost, but it was an unusual thing for them; but when the NPC finished its speech, a yellow question mark appeared on his head!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe quest NPC!?\u201d Everyone exchanged the same look and quickly opened the quest log, only to see that their quest [Rescue the Villager\u2019s Soul] has been competed! Neither one of them understood what was going on. They were tasked to kill the Necromancer Zac and rescue the villagers\u2019 souls, so how could the quest be completed when they now have killed a totally different boss?</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang thought for a while and talked to the ghost.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were sent here by a young girl name called Emmy from the Antelope Village!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! Emmy?! My dearest Emmy!\u201d Stark looked both shocked and happy. \u201cHow was she? Is she alive?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang shook his head, \u201cSadly, no. She\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Stark lowered his head. It was obvious that he was feeling down since his character started to fade in and out repeatedly. After a while, he raised his head and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeroes! What you did was brave and outstanding! I cannot ask anything more from you but please, I still have one more request for you! You need to rescue the villagers\u2019 souls. There are still traps set by that evil Necromancer. He is\u2026 he is too dark\u2026 Everything about him reeks of evil! He will do something to those innocent villagers and condemn them to a fate worse than hell!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You have completed a main story quest: Rescue the Villagers\u2019 Souls. Obtained 50,000 Experience Points! You have obtained a reward : Luck +1.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Stark has a quest for you: Pursue the Evil Necromancer Zac. Will you accept it? This is a main story quest. Complete the quest to receive a luxurious reward!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArgh\u2026 It\u2019s still ongoing! How long is this freaking main story quest?\u201d Fatty Han complaint.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh well. Let\u2019s not quarrel over simple things. Just accept it first!\u201d That being said, Zhang Yang was also not fond of the quest length.</p><br/><p>Stark thanked the party and left the place; probably headed towards his daughter soul to rest in peace.</p><br/><p>[Pursue the Evil Necromancer Zac] (Difficulty level: A)</p><br/><p>Quest description: Once you have located the Evil Necromancer Zac, see to it that you could save the souls that he had imprisoned!</p><br/><p>Progress: Locate the Evil Necromancer Zac 0/1</p><br/><p>\u201cThis has no end! The game map is just too huge! How are we supposed to find him without any leads?\u201d said Fatty Han.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang replied him, \u201cWe\u2019ll put this aside for now, there will be some sort of hint mentioned on other quests! Besides, the quest was only to locate not exterminate. Furthermore, the quest difficulty level is A, which means that the place that we\u2019re supposed to look for should be higher level than our current level! And besides, we got a Luck attribute as a reward! We didn\u2019t lose anything here!\u201d</p><br/><p>1 point of Luck attribute was actually nothing, but with enough accumulation, it will naturally display its effectiveness!</p><br/><p>Fatty Han did not like the answer he got and muttered unwillingly on the side.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince we have defeated a Gray-Silver boss, let\u2019s obtain our reward now, shall we?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhang Yang mentioned the word \u201creward\u201d, Drizzler\u2019s spirits were lifted a little and she proceeded to grab the chance to open the corpse.</p><br/><p>\u201cMine! I\u2019ll open it! Let me! Let me!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Athena, Bow of the White Bones] (Gray-Silver, Ranged weapon)</p><br/><p>Weapon attack: 306-366</p><br/><p>Attack interval: 2.8 seconds</p><br/><p>DPS: 120</p><br/><p>Level 1 Socket</p><br/><p>Level 1 Socket</p><br/><p>Equip effect: Increase 1% critical chance.</p><br/><p>Level requirement: 30</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly f*ckin\u2019 moly! This weapon is OP!\u201d Fatty Han quickly forgot his frustration about the quest length and was excited to see the new bow that popped out.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhan Yu. What is this socket thing for?\u201d Hundred Shots questioned.</p><br/><p>\u201cSocket are for Gemstones upgrade. There are many types of Gemstones, such as Dexterity Gemstone, Intelligence Gemstone, and more. You can choose to have many different types of upgrade! If you slot in a +10 Intelligence Gemstone into an available slot, you will gain additional 10 Intelligence attribute. Gemstones have 8 tiers. A high-level Slot can fit in a low-level Gemstone, not the other way around.\u201d Zhang Yang explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cLow level Gemstones can be bought from the Gem Shop in the city. High level Gemstones can be obtained from defeating bosses, completing main story quests, hidden quests, or even break a Hardcore Mode record!\u201d Zhang Yang added.</p><br/><p>\u201cHundred Shots bro! This time I\u2019ll fight for this item. I\u2019m not going to let this off! Let\u2019s roll!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on!\u201d Hundred Shot replied</p><br/><p>Hundred Shots, 78 points.</p><br/><p>Fatty Han, 3 points.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahahahaha!\u201d Drizzler laughed until she fell on the floor, rolling. \u201cPervy Fatty! Now you know how karma tastes like!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty Han laughed it off. He knew that there would be another chance for him to get the item when the boss re-spawned.</p><br/><p>Hundred Shots kept the bow in his inventory as he could only equip it when we would be Level 30.</p><br/><p>Drizzler snickered.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe! My hands are full of luck aren\u2019t they!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! In that case, if you ever open anything lower than a Gray-Silver, we will cut off that hand of yours!\u201d Zhang Yang raised an eyebrow.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch\u2026 You\u2019re the lowest!\u201d Drizzler pouted her lips like a sore loser. She reached out her hand again to open the corpse.</p><br/><p>[White Bone Necklace] (Gray-Silver, Necklace)</p><br/><p>Vitality: +18</p><br/><p>Intelligence: +9</p><br/><p>Spirit: +3</p><br/><p>Level 1 Socket</p><br/><p>Equip effect: For each time you cast a spell, there will be a fixed chance to increase 100 magic attack. Last for 10 seconds. Effect cannot be stacked.</p><br/><p>Level requirement: 30</p><br/><p>\u201cSister! You\u2019re so lucky to be the only magic user here. No one else here will fight with you for any magic type equipment!\u201d said Drizzler. There was a hint of jealousy in her voice.</p><br/><p>Little Snow was actually smiling sweetly but when Drizzler mentioned that, her smile turned even wider.</p><br/><p>[Chaos Gem] (Usable)</p><br/><p>Use: Permanently increase your inventory by 10 slots.</p><br/><p>\u201cIncrease inventory size! This is very useful!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s us all roll for it!\u201d</p><br/><p>As they obtained more and more extravagant items, Zhang Yang\u2019s understanding to why guilds would occupy this place increased even more. This treasure mine just kept getting better and better!</p><br/><p>Everyone rolled but Little Snow obtained the item with a perfect 100 score.</p><br/><p>[Skillbook: Vanguard\u2019s Aggression] (Skillbook)</p><br/><p>Use: Teaches you Vanguard\u2019s Aggression</p><br/><p>Requirement: Guardian, Defender.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Tanks only?\u201d Everyone quickly urged Zhang Yang to learn the skill and expose the skill ability.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang was surprised and happy. He had always wanted to have this skill in his previous life, and he would never have thought that it would appear here!</p><br/><p>Every time a field boss was killed the first time, the item quantity and drop rate would always be better. Once the boss was respawned and killed the second time, the drop rate would become normal again.</p><br/><p>He picked up the book and learned the skill, and the posted the skill description in the party channel.</p><br/><p>Vanguard\u2019s Aggression: Cast a 3 x 3-meter protection barrier. Every ally that is in the barrier will receive 90% reduced damage. However, the caster will receive 100% increased damage. Last for 10 seconds.</p><br/><p>Cooldown time: 10 seconds.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It\u2019s Morphin\u2019 time!\"</p><br/><p>Fatty Han laughed out loud while the rest of the team giggled as they activated their Transformation skills. One by one, all sorts of forms were unleashed. Each time they went through this, Wei Yan Er would never fail to laugh at Endless Starlight the king kong, and Fatty Han the overweight vampire.</p><br/><p>It was also the first time Cheng Xue Yao was using her Transformation skill in front of anyone else. As an A class Inheritance, her Transformation was both flashy and beautiful. Unlike the others, Cheng Xue Yao\u2019s transformation caused all her equipment to fade away. 80% of her naked body was exposed to the world, and her skin had turned ice blue. The air around her crystalized and dropped on the floor as snowflakes. She looked like a beautiful ice sculpture. The sort of elegance she gave off was extravagant, paired with the icy crown resting on her forehead and metallic brassiere that only covered her breast and private parts.</p><br/><p>As expected of the Ice Queen Inheritance, her presence in the field was exactly like the Hindu goddess Shiva.</p><br/><p>Everyone, including Zhang Yang had to stop and stare at the beauty of it. Fatty Han would never hold back against women, hence, when Cheng Xue Yao Transformed, he immediately went ahead and tried his luck to sweet talk his way to court Cheng Xue Yao. Endless Starlight had to hide away to conceal his red face. Amongst the men around, Endless Starlight was the only person around who had never seen a woman dressed in such an alluring manner. That was probably the closest thing he could go to seeing a woman naked. As the other men were behaving as expectedly when greeted by the sight of a beautiful lady, Female Raid Covent was behaving oddly. Instead of being infatuated with Cheng Xue Yao\u2019s most alluring appearance, the weird fellow was not flustered. Instead, he had only taken a short glance at Cheng Xue Yao before turning to Wei Yan Er, the flat-chest loli.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, guys! Get killing now!\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang spread his wings and soared into the sky. When he was close to the boss, he shot down like an eagle. The environment they were in had forbidden true flying. Hence, Zhang Yang was not able to properly gain altitude and could only glide his way at a certain height. Despite that, he was still able to move at a breakneck speed.</p><br/><p>\"Hmph\u2026? Attackers?\" Ganesh hummed softly as he turned his head. His lips were sealed tightly, yet he was still able to speak. His calm facial expression suddenly turned sour. He lifted his hammer and smashed it towards the ground where Zhang Yang stood. \"Who sent you! Antoine? Dustan? Margalor?\"</p><br/><p>All three names that he had uttered must be the names of the other bosses. \"That\u2019s for me to know, and for you to find out. The hard way!\"</p><br/><p>\"So be it! I shall pry the truth from your body! One bone at a time!\"</p><br/><p>Ganesh roared, and his hammer slammed downward. Zhang Yang lifted his shield, planted his feet solidly into the ground, and took the hit.</p><br/><p>PANG!</p><br/><p>The hammer struck the shield, yet Zhang Yang stood as still as a mountain during a blizzard. However, the ground beneath him cracked, causing Zhang Yang to slip. Lava started pouring down from the shield. Zhang Yang immediately felt the burning heat in his grip and he quickly jumped away. The Lave was oozing out of the boss\u2019 hammer like a water from a wrung sponge.</p><br/><p>\"Haha! Noobie tank couldn\u2019t keep his balance! Looks like it\u2019s time for the Black Ranger to kick his steamy butt!\" cried Wei Yan Er as she glided across the room like a black crow.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang stomped the ground and re-established his stance, prepared to strike back. The attack that had exceeded more than a million damage had generated more than enough Rage points that his gauge could hold. With a quick combo, Zhang Yang chained {Charge Up Strike} after {God of War Devastation}.</p><br/><p>\u2018-11,687,895!\u2019</p><br/><p>When the boss could deal only a million damage on Zhang Yang, Zhang Yang had turned around and returned 10 times the damage to his face. Such a powerful smack to the face had made Ganesh grunt in pain.</p><br/><p>\"Imbecile! Mortals like you will never understand the gravity of your crimes! Only death shall teach your kind!\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed. \"Oh really?! Well, you\u2019re nothing but a burning pile of gas that was spawned from the Fire Essence Pearl! Even if you\u2019re the real God of Fire, I\u2019m the inheritor of the God of War! I am stronger than a god. A true God Killer! The only thing you should do is to start kneeling down and grovel beneath my feet!\"</p><br/><p>Ganesh burst into flames. His breath was literally fires coming out of his nostril. \"May Hades have mercy on your soul, for I shall wipe it from the face of this earth!\" The boss wielded his hammer and spun around, trying his best to strike Zhang Yang, while sending out countless of lava droplets flying everywhere.</p><br/><p>\"Haha! What is going on with Little Yang?! He has never talked down a boss like that before!\" cried Fatty Han.</p><br/><p>\"Tch. Tch. Tch.\" Wei Yan Er clicked her tongue demeaningly and shrugged. \"Looks like noobie tank is just being childish!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone laughed hard when they heard Wei Yan Er, leaving the little girl twitching as she was genuinely confused.</p><br/><p>The party went all out with the fight. Every 5 seconds, the party will hurl a ball of Fire Elemental Core that will deal 200,000 damage to the boss. Although the boss is technically made out of fire, unlike the Phoenix, the boss did not have immunity to Fire attacks. It was fortunate for the party, or else both the Phoenix and Daffodil Daydream would be attacking the boss like throwing salt into the sea.</p><br/><p>Cheng Xue Yao and Lost Dream had Inheritances with Ice attributes, hence, their attacks were amplified on the boss. Sadly, Cheng Xue Yao was underleveled by more than 30 Levels. With the Level suppression system acting up, her amplified damage was suppressed down to a normal level. At times, if she was unlucky, her damage will be reduced down to 50% and sometimes even 10%.</p><br/><p>Lost Dream was already Level 210 by then. Unlike Cheng Xue Yao, he was able to deal full, unaffected damage to the boss. His overall damage, in this match, was on par with both Wei Yan Er and Daffodil Daydream, despite being a Thief!</p><br/><p>His Inheritance was a B class. In a non-Transformed state, the damage difference between him and an A class Inheritance player would not be large. Note that the damage bonus difference between A class and B class was only 5%. On the other hand, during his Transformed state, the difference will be large, since the damage boost was 300% and 400%, respectively.</p><br/><p>The reason why Lost Dream was able to deal more damage during this fight was all due to the Elemental Conflict of Ice and Fire. However, even though he could deal higher damage than the norm, Fire damage would also inflict stronger damage on Lost Dream and Cheng Xue Yao. Hence, amongst everyone else, those two were taking more damage compared to the whole team.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Cheng Xue Yao was suffering from the Level Suppression damage amplification. Hence, to make sure she stays alive, Zhang Yang had proactively used {Surrogacy} on her. Little did Zhang Yang know that both Sun Xin Yu and Han Ying Xue were madly envious of her. It was all because of the skill name! If only the name was \"Protect Teammate\" instead!</p><br/><p>The boss\u2019 skill {Burning Ground} was putting a lot of pressure on the team, instead of the boss\u2019 attacks himself. All battle companions that dealt little to no damage were unsummoned to lighten the load on the healers. While the others were facing quite a challenging situation, both Zhang Yang and Fatty Han\u2019s Phoenixes were doing extremely well, since they had never taken any damage! Flames after flames being burst on them, and they literally felt nothing but comfort due to their natural constitution.</p><br/><p>\"Fire Tornado!\" the boss growled and unleashed his skills.</p><br/><p>Molten lava started to appear all around the battlefield, a hundred meters away from him. There were 10, 5 meters wide pools of lava that were slowly circulating on their own. In just a short amount of time, the pool started to give off hot steam that formed a small tornado that gradually grew in size.</p><br/><p>Without any word of warning, everyone moved about to get away from the pool of hot lava. The spinning pillar of hot air had grown too large to a point of no return. If anyone were to get close to it, the suction power will suck them in and burn them for 50% HP. If they are burnt twice, it\u2019s sayonara for them.</p><br/><p>Luckily, the skill {Fire Tornado} had spawned the tornados, only within 100 meters around the boss. Since the entire battlefield was wide and spacious, the team did not need to worry much about moving around. In fact, everyone had taken their sweet time to adjust their positions. The problems started to double up after 1 minute. The boss had cast the second{Fire Tornado}, increasing the number of tornados in the battlefield to 20.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang and everyone else got serious and moved around swiftly until the boss had finally stopped casting the skill, when most of the area around him was surrounded by the deadly tornados.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang predicted that the tornados would not disappear until the boss is killed. Luckily, the entire fighting arena was so huge, that everyone could find a safe spot even after the boss had continually cast more and more of those tornados. If they find themselves unable to attack the boss due to the tornadoes around them, Zhang Yang would then kite the boss somewhere else and continue the fight there.</p><br/><p>The fight continued on with loud banging sounds of the [Fire Elemental Core]. One hour in the fight, and the boss was left with only 31% HP. Thanks to the bombs, only was the team able to deal so much damage. That or, they might not have been able to deal so much damage. The boss probably would have over 50% by then.</p><br/><p>At the one hour mark, Zhang Yang cast {Glare of the Death God} but it failed to activate. However, it was not much of an issue as long no one dies. If someone dies, the boss will gain a 100% attack boost! If one person dies, the damage dealt by {Burning Ground} would increase to 500,000. That would take more than 4 healers to support the party!</p><br/><p>\"DIE! SCUM OF THE EARTH! ROT IN HELL!\"</p><br/><p>\"THE GODS SHANT NOT BE SULLIED BY THE LIKES OF YOU!\" </p><br/><p>\"THE SEA OF FLAMES SHALL PURIFY YOUR SOUL! SURRENDER AND BE CLEANSED!\"</p><br/><p>At one point, everyone was sick of the boss\u2019 random screaming and decided to tone down the game volume.</p><br/><p>25%...22%...20%...</p><br/><p>Eventually, the boss had reached 20%, which was its most vulnerable state. The DPS of the party had increased dramatically and was able to deal more damage than usual. However, it was still a short burst of damage, since skills like {Killing Cleave} do have a cooldown and are not able to deal high enough damage to end the boss right there and then.</p><br/><p>\u2018-20,254,352!\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang\u2019s axe glowed vibrantly for a brief second and the damage that Zhang Yang had dealt during that instance had breached past 20 million damage.</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s not {Rising Dragon Strike}, is it?\" asked Daffodil Daydream. It was not. If it was, an ethereal dragon will appear and everyone would know it. Zhang Yang quickly reviewed the battle log and found the reason. It was the axe\u2019s special effect to deal 8x normal damage. Furthermore, it was stacked with a Critical strike! The total damage dealt was 16x the normal attack~!</p><br/><p>\"OOOOOO DAYUM SON!\"</p><br/><p>\"Noobie tank! How are you doing that! I want that axe as well!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone screamed with excitement. Zhang Yang could only smirk at them. That was the benefit of wielding a two-handed weapon. Although the total damage of a two-handed weapon will lose to a dual wielding configuration, the single instance damage dealt with a two-handed weapon will always be stronger than any one-handed weapon!</p><br/><p>15%...10%...5%...</p><br/><p>Truth be told, Ganesh was probably the weakest among all four bosses, since the battle was not too complicated, nor did the boss possess strong AoE attack skills. The only dangerous skill the boss had was the {Fire Tornado}. All the players had to do was to avoid them, and they could kill it easily.</p><br/><p>After less than 10 minutes, the boss was killed, and rewarded the party with a large pile of loot.</p><br/><p>\"GG EZ.\"</p><br/><p>\"No! It\u2019s GGWP!\"</p><br/><p>\"Nah\u2026The best one for this fight would be, EZ GAME EZ LIFE!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Everyone cheered happily, while Zhang Yang remained unfazed. He was contemplating about the difficulty of the quest. He recalled the extreme difficulty of retrieving the [Wind Essence Pearl,] yet this boss was all too simple. It\u2019s like the system was compensating players for the extreme difficulty of the previous quest by giving them an easy boss to defeat. Somehow, Zhang Yang felt that it was unfair, for he had to put out so much effort! All by himself!</p><br/><p>Wei Yan Er chirped happily as she hop-skipped her way to the loot. She tidied up the loot and arranged all the shiny, glowing loot in an orderly manner. The boss was kind enough to give 10 Ascended tier equipment and 7 Holy tier equipment. Furthermore, all of them had the special 30 Level Requirement reduction!</p><br/><p>Although the Ascended tier weapons were good enough for both attack and defense, the Holy tier equipment were not too good. It was all too \"one-sided\".</p><br/><p>Wei Yan Er first distributed all seven Holy tier equipment. It was plainly obvious that a Level 240 Holy tier equipment would be stronger than the Level 170 Holy tier equipment farmed from the Spectre's Hidden Cavern dungeon. After the lower tier equipment was distributed, Zhang Yang shared the [Tesseract] and combined two of the equipment into one to upgrade them. Since it had an hour cooldown duration, the rest would have to wait for their turn.</p><br/><p>The Ascended tier equipment distribution was different. Priority would be given to those from the main party. If anyone required the equipment, they would be put in front of the list. While the others managed to haul weapons, Zhang Yang had only received a cape.</p><br/><p>[Cape of the Flame Lord] (Ascended, Cape)</p><br/><p>Vitality: +11762</p><br/><p>Strength: +2060</p><br/><p>Dexterity: +2060</p><br/><p>{Level 8 Socket}</p><br/><p>Equip: Increases maximum HP by 23,520.</p><br/><p>Equip: Increases damage dealt and healing rate by 12%.</p><br/><p>Equip: Absorbs 1,778 damage from attack.</p><br/><p>Use: Grant immunity to all Fire elemental attack.

Those that were not in the midst of battle were fine, but the other 15 people; 3 teams of 5 players were instantly distracted and got killed off and appeared at the revive point.</p><br/><p>The results were far too much for them to take in! Who were they to even compete with Zhang Yang\u2019s team when they were still struggling at the first boss of the dungeon?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At Crimson Rage\u2019s side\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Snow! It happened, just like you said it will!\u201d Thorny Rose cried out admirably as Fire Spirit Farr\u2019s body fell defeated. \u201cHow did you do it?! How did you know that Zhan Yu\u2019s team would be the first to win the Front Wing\u2019s dungeon? If we had followed along to take on the Front Wing, we\u2019d be crying our eyes out by now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thorny Rose and the rest of the Crimson Rage party were currently in the Middle Wing dungeon.</p><br/><p>During the start of the fight, Crimson Rage\u2019s two 5-man party first entered the Front Wing dungeon. However, after two minutes in, they quickly switched and headed to the Middle Wing instead!</p><br/><p>According to the official website, the Middle Wing\u2019s bosses were level 23 and level 24 while the Front Wing bosses were level 21 and level 22. Normally, players would choose to tackle on the easy ones first and left the harder selection for later on. However, Crimson Rage guild master had a different way of approaching this matter. She chose the other way around to conquer the dungeon!</p><br/><p>Snow Seeker raised an eye brow and smiled lightly. \u201cEven though I may have predicted that Zhan Yu\u2019s team would be the one who will claim the \u2018First Clear\u2019 achievement, but I could not have foreseen that they could complete the dungeon in such a groundbreaking speed! Sure, we might have defeated the first boss, but Zhan Yu\u2019s team already cleared the Front Wing and may be proceeding to the Middle Wing, and if he does, not even I would how that will turn out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could this be?\u201d Thorny Rose expressed her disbelief. \u201cWe have gained the Boss\u2019 information beforehand and had several days ahead to devise a strategy! We even died several times to win this boss! Don\u2019t tell me that they also had a relative in the development team!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Snow Seeker thought it through and shook her head at the impossibility.</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to my brother, during the boss skill design phase, everyone will be in charge of their own department. There was absolutely no interaction nor communication between departments! Furthermore, the initial designer and the editor were strangers who did not have any connections. There was no possible way that a person would have the knowledge of all the boss\u2019s skill! We only knew about the first boss\u2019 skills and gone through hell and back for the second boss\u2019 skills!\u201d</p><br/><p>Snow Seeker stopped her speech suddenly and realized something far more important.</p><br/><p>\u201cI for one, hope that Zhan Yu had gotten himself some information leak. Or else, how could you explain his incredible speed at clearing the Front Wing dungeon?\u201d She shook her head to get rid of that frightening thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone! Get yourself together, even though we are one step ahead of them, we must not let down our guard! They are\u2026 strong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHUURAH!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>For some members of Lone Desert Smoke, they were excited when Zhang Yang, Hundred Shots, and Slim and Handsome joined the guild. That was, however, just the tip of the iceberg. When the server channel was flooded with the server announcement of their achievement, things got even wilder! For almost half day long, the guild channel was just as noisy as a subway station! Chattering and cheering were everywhere! Even though they did not contribute into the party in taking the \u201cFirst Clear\u201d Achievement, they still praised and bragged around about their guild!</p><br/><p>\u2018Player Drizzler has surrendered the Guild Master position to Player Zhan Yu. Player Zhan Yu is now the current Guild Master!\u2019</p><br/><p>Another important news!</p><br/><p>Even so, members of Lone Desert Smoke did not express any objection to this matter! They were actually happy with the change! After all, they have all heard of the name \u201cZhan Yu\u201d. The guild members were happy and contented to have a professional commander like Zhan Yu to lead the guild to glory!</p><br/><p>\u201cSo guys\u2026 should we just rest a bit or do we go on to raid the Middle Wing?\u201d Little Snow asked Zhan Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cStrike the iron while it\u2019s hot! Of course, we shall move on!\u201d Zhang Yang laughed loudly. Pointing at the corpse, he continued, \u201cHowever, let\u2019s distribute the equipment first!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! Oh! Me! Me! Let me open it!\u201d Drizzler jumped like a rabbit and quickly touched the corpse.</p><br/><p>[Heavy Stone Boots] (Green-Copper, Metal Armor)</p><br/><p>Defense: +6</p><br/><p>Vitality: +12</p><br/><p>Strength: +6</p><br/><p>Dexterity: +2</p><br/><p>Level requirement: 2</p><br/><p>\u201cTch! Hey! Take this boot and raise your pathetic HP amount!\u201d Drizzler rejected her roll for the equipment. \u201cDon\u2019t get yourself killed in just one strike!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was not just Drizzler who had the thought to prioritize the main tanker\u2019s equipment; it was in everyone\u2019s mind as well. They started to get a little cautious ever since they witnessed the sheer attack power of a Hardcore-level boss. Zhang Yang laughed guiltily. He too knew that he needed to pump up his HP to face a Herculean-like boss in the Hardcore Dungeon. He put on the new equipment and also invested the SP he gained on , reducing its cooldown time to only 5 seconds.</p><br/><p>\u201cFriends of Lone Desert Smoke! Congratulations on obtaining the \u2018First Clear\u2019 Achievement! I represent The Dominators to congratulate you on this awesome achievement!\u201d Humbly Gentleman posted in the local channel.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! What you say doesn\u2019t match your intention! Gentleman, my ass!\u201d someone from Sky High began insulting to provoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Where did this barking dog came from?!\u201d Members from The Dominator started to retaliate.</p><br/><p>Sky High did not want to admit defeat, and they started to return their insults. Eventually the entire local channel was flooded with words of scorn and abuses.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang\u2019s team started to feel a little annoyed. With a flick of a button, they turned off the local server feed and the whole world went dead silent.</p><br/><p>[Blinders Skirt] (Green-Copper, Cloth Armor)</p><br/><p>Defense: +2</p><br/><p>Vitality: +16</p><br/><p>Intelligence: +16</p><br/><p>Spirit: +6</p><br/><p>Level requirement: 20</p><br/><p>This equipment obviously belonged to Little Snow.</p><br/><p>[Lined Cape] (Green-Copper, Cape)</p><br/><p>Vitality: +6</p><br/><p>Dexterity: +4</p><br/><p>Equip effect: Increase 1% critical strike.</p><br/><p>Level requirement: 20</p><br/><p>Only Dexterity and no Strength, this equipment was obviously suitable for either a Thief or a Hunter.</p><br/><p>Just when Fatty Han wanted Hundred Shots to have the item, Hundred Shots rejected his chance to roll.</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty, it\u2019s fine now. My equipment is quite strong. You don\u2019t need to give it up anymore! From now on, let\u2019s just roll for the next equipment fair and square!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then!\u201d Fatty Han nodded and accepted the cape.</p><br/><p>The party then ran towards the dungeon entrance. Fatty Han suddenly turned around and asked Zhang Yang, \u201cHey Little Yang, are there any hidden bosses in this dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang shook his head. \u201cNot all dungeons have hidden bosses. As for Marzerway\u2019s Lair, there are no hidden bosses in any of the three dungeons!\u201d</p><br/><p>After a while, the party got out from the Front Wing and entered the left entrance of the dungeon.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! You have entered Marzerway\u2019s Lair: Middle Wing (Hardcore Mode)!\u201d</p><br/><p>The atmosphere and background of this new dungeon was exactly the same as the previous one. The only difference was the monster patrolling inside were now fire elementals.</p><br/><p>[Demonized Fire Elemental] (Elite)</p><br/><p>Level: 22</p><br/><p>HP: 6,000</p><br/><p>There were so many monsters here; too many in fact! With just a look, it felt like the room was cramp and tight.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo-freaking many!\u201d Fatty Han took in a deep breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. The monsters here are far stronger than before. They\u2019re all magic attack types. They just love to spew fireball at you and those are painful as f*ck!\u201d Zhang Yang explained. \u201cHowever, the good thing is that their HP is very low. They are about half of those elite monsters. We can just use our AoE attacks and they can be killed off easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang walked ahead and used to initiate the fight.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang cut down one of the monsters for 342 damage and gained 36 Rage. He immediately used .</p><br/><p>\u2018-701!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-745!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-726!\u2019</p><br/><p>Many more damage texts overlapped each other in the tight crowded space.</p><br/><p>A total of 8 fire elementals had their targets set to Zhang Yang and began conjuring fireballs.</p><br/><p>The team followed up and started unleashing their AoE skills like and .</p><br/><p>3 seconds later, the monsters finished casting their spells and threw 8 fireball towards Zhang Yang. A barrage of attacks landed on Zhang Yang, causing \u2018-122\u2019, \u2018-119\u2019, and \u2018-125\u2019 damage to him. Zhang Yang lost around 1000 HP in this wave.</p><br/><p>Little Snow was prepared for it. The moment she saw damage texts popping out on Zhang Yang\u2019s head, she waved her hand and used on him, restoring 400 HP. At the same time, healed him for 130 HP every 3 seconds. 2 seconds later, Little Snow conjured another and healed Zhang Yang almost to his full HP.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Another 8 fireballs landed on Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cArgh\u2026.I don\u2019t want to do this anymore\u2026This is so tiring!\u201d But being the only healer in the party, Little Snow had to continue her healing alone or else Zhang Yang would die and the whole team would be defeated.</p><br/><p>30 seconds into the battle and all of the minions were killed off, granting the party immense experience points.</p><br/><p>Little Snow jeered at the hallway and saw waves and waves of minions patrolling. She turned sour and said, \u201cGod, how long would this last!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin, I\u2019ll give you a back massage after all these minions. Is that good enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty Han suddenly gave a lusty expression. \u201cPressing and pushing is something only Fatty can do best! I\u2019d tell you, no one else could do it better! Little Snow, take my number and call me whenever you\u2019re in the mood for a back massage. I\u2019ll be over in a jiffy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Drizzler walked over to Fatty Han and observed his fleshy hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh. Now that I\u2019ve seen your hand. I finally understand why the Mandarin language has the phrase \u2018Salty Pig Hands\u2019, you pervert!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone laughed for a bit and moved on forward.</p><br/><p>The monsters were indeed strong and their attacks were stronger, but the only person working furiously was Little Snow, while the rest of the party were calm and relax all the way.</p><br/><p>20 minutes later, they finally arrived at the first boss.</p><br/><p>[Fire Spirit Anni] (Green-Copper)</p><br/><p>Level: 23</p><br/><p>HP: 138k</p><br/><p>Standing at 10 meters tall, the gigantic elemental spirit was burning away like a huge bon fire pillar. In this enormous palace, there were no other minions around anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, rape our ears, Little Yang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang shook his head and sighed. He then began to explain the boss\u2019 strategy and skills.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you could guess, the boss is a Spellcaster class. Its physical attacks are not strong so it will cast at the person with the most aggro. The skill has a 3 second casting delay and deals 1,000 damage per shot! Little Snow, just give up! As the only healer in this Hardcore Mode dungeon, it is your fate to heal till you drop!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty Han laughed and said, \u201cLittle Snow, just give up and listen to Little Yang!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPervert Fatty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPervy Brothers!\u201d</p><br/><p>The girls scolded together.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang expressed innocence. \u201cHey! Why am I in the same category as him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Snow replied, \u201cBirds of the same feather\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026flock together!\u201d Drizzler continued her cousin\u2019s idiom. \u201cThe two of you looked like brothers in arms. That is why both of you must share the same bad habit!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!? Argh! A gentleman must not be arguing with a lady!\u201d Zhang Yang gave up and used an escape card to avoid the argument. He then continued his boss explanation. \u201cThe boss\u2019 second skill is called . This skill will cause every target in its effective range to be knocked back 3 meters behind, and will also receive 500 fire damage. At the same time, the target will be inflicted with a debuff called , causing all fire magic damage to be increased by 50%! The debuff is quite dangerous. If I\u2019m hit with and while gaining the debuff, I will receive about 1,800 damage! I will be instantly killed if I were to receive that combo without a full HP status!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

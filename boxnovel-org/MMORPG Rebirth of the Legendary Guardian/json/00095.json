Just when he finally decided to leave, the door of the elevator opened and the two troublemakers hopped out again.</p><br/><p>A policewoman walked out of the door, glanced at them, and moved on as if nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>The two girls did not like her reaction, and they tried to move in closer to her. Wei Yan Er was dressed as a zombie, and she reached both her hands out to grab the policewoman\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>Swoosh! Pak!</p><br/><p>The policewoman swiftly turned around and caught her hand before Wei Yan Er could make any contact. She locked her shoulder and flipped her off her feet, causing her to fall onto the ground hard.</p><br/><p>\u201cArgh\u2026\u201d The little brat was tears. Her hand rubbed her painful butt. Her cute and happy little expression was now replaced with a painful one. Tears flowed down her cheek, removing a part of her thick make-up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Dressing like a ghost in the middle of the night! You\u2019re disturbing the residents who live here!\u201d The policewomen scoffed coldly and took out a pair of handcuffs. \u201cI\u2019ll just bring you to the police station!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHold up there!\u201d Zhang Yang quickly stepped in. \u201cExcuse me, officer! They\u2019re just playing around. They don\u2019t mean any harm to anyone! Try to reason with them! Maybe they just went slightly overboard!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! She was about to assault a poli-\u201d She raised her head. Zhang Yang and her finally met face to face. She was completely stunned when they saw each other.</p><br/><p>He was the man that had defeated me in the alley! Not to mention, he\u2026 he\u2026 grabbed\u2026</p><br/><p>She was the policewoman that Zhang Yang met when he encountered the scammers in the streets! The beautiful and sexy, but cold and arrogant policewoman!</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm... Hmm! It\u2019s you!\u201d Her face tensed up as she looked at Zhang Yang with serious eyes.</p><br/><p>Ka chack!</p><br/><p>She cuffed Wei Yan Er and let her be; she won\u2019t be leaving anytime now. The policewoman rolled up her sleeves and stared Zhang Yang with a strong killing intent.</p><br/><p>Sigh\u2026What a shitty coincidence! He would not have left the car if he knew this would have happened!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang heavily sighed.</p><br/><p>The policewoman kept quiet. She kicked off the ground and dashed towards Zhang Yang like a leopard going for the kill. She swung her leg out flying, aiming for his shoulder!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang had his dose of fighting experience with this woman. He knew that he should not underestimate her, which meant no room for mistake. He tensed up, gathered his focus and quickly raised his hands to block the kick.</p><br/><p>When the first attack missed, the woman flipped around and went for her next attack! Furious as ever!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang was not a just a random street fighter. He was a member of the Wushu Club that beat the National Wushu Tournament all time champion down to a pulp. His strength was not something you could find randomly at anywhere in the world! But when these two titans clashed, their fight could be described like a tiger going at a lion; extremely intense!</p><br/><p>Han Yin Xue immediately sobered up from the surprise \u201cattack\u201d. She quickly ran up to Wei Yan Er to help her up.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister\u2026wuu\u2026 My butt felt like it was cracked in two!\u201d cried Wei Yan Er.</p><br/><p>\u201cStupid little girl! You have two butt cheeks there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah\u2026 it was over. The policewoman must have caused this little girl to be the complete idiot of the century!</p><br/><p>Han Yin Xue raised both her legs, lifting her skirt and almost revealing what lied beneath, and took off both of her high heels. She held them in her hands, preparing to hit the policewoman with it if she insisted on dragging her little Wei Yan Er to the police station.</p><br/><p>After battling and trading blows for a while, Zhang Yang had finally gotten the upper hand! Zhang Yang had the body of a man that had always been stronger than a woman; even when his arts and skills were not as strong as a military man, he could still overpower with sheer strength.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang dodged and attacked, jumped and kick, and finally managed to pin the woman to a wall with a headbutt. He quickly reached out his hand and firmly grabbed her neck before she could turn around! She did not want to give in just yet, as she raised her leg backwards, trying to kick him at the very least. However, Zhang Yang was quick enough, and he was able to dodge the kick and quickly trap her leg between his thighs.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go!\u201d The policewomen cried out while panting tiredly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh\u2026 If I let go, would you still fight?\u201d Zhang Yang asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><br/><p>Stupid! Why would you say it out loud?! At least try to keep it to yourself. How can I let you go now?</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang shook his head and sighed. \u201cLook, we have absolutely no reason to fight. Why would you come to me and start to fight like your life depended on it? Why don\u2019t we put this all behind us and be friends? They say that we should solve a problem rather than letting it grow worse. If we continue this fight, an eye for an eye and soon the whole world will be blind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! I don\u2019t care! Try and hold me for the rest of your life, then!!\u201d the woman scorned.</p><br/><p>How stubborn could this woman be! Argh!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang got furious and yelled back at her. \u201cFine! I\u2019ll hold you on for the rest of my life! Let\u2019s see who will give up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Both of them were so busy at each other\u2019s neck that neither of them realized their current position and their conversation could have a double meaning. After a while, the policewoman\u2019s face flushed with embarrassment.</p><br/><p>Holding on to her neck and legs, Zhang Yang could feel her tensed body suddenly relax and turned as soft as cotton.</p><br/><p>Gah! That\u2019s just so sexy!</p><br/><p>\u201cOfficer! My cousin and I were just playing around! Please don\u2019t take us to the station!\u201d Both Wei Yan Er and Han Ying Xue walked over to her. The little girl raised her hands up, with her apologetic face full of honesty. Her makeup was completely removed, revealing a clean, natural beauty.</p><br/><p>The policewoman turned and snorted. But she quickly turned back and stared at her intensely and said, \u201cYou\u2019re Drizzler?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? How did you know my IGN?\u201d Wei Yan Er startled. Just when she was about to raise her hand higher, she pulled the clutches between her hands as she was still in handcuffs, and nearly scratch herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re Little Snow?\u201d She turned her gaze towards Han Yin Xue, or rather her breasts, since those were the things that stood out most.</p><br/><p>They were always her most prideful \u201cweapons\u201d, but when they were stared at by a woman, it felt a little strange, as it was not the usual stare she would normally get. She took a step back and covered her chest with her hands and whispered to Wei Yan Er, \u201cShe\u2019s not into girls now, is she?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang stuttered. \u201cY-You\u2026 Are you playing \u2018God\u2019s Miracle\u2019 as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>This kind of cold and arrogant woman, who had never seen smiling the entire time could actually be a gamer? Zhang Yang could not help but to think that he was actually dreaming right now!</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re Zhan Yu, I suppose.\u201d The woman turned back to him and stared menacingly. \u201cI\u2019ll beat you one day!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang jumped. He let her go and withdrew. He picked up his courage and cried. \u201cYou are Frost Night!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?! You\u2019re really Frost Night? Oh my! You\u2019re so beautiful! And I\u2019d always thought that underneath that piece of black cloth was someone ugly!\u201d As expected of a little kid, she always said what immediately came to her mind. There was no secret that she would keep from the world.</p><br/><p>The policewoman turned back and flexed her arms and feet. She pointed at Wei Yan Er and scolded. \u201cNext time, don\u2019t go around troubling the neighbors!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Wei Yan Er dropped her head and accepted the scolding obediently. She then raised her hands and said, \u201cMiss Officer, could you please let me go? My wrists are hurting!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Little brat! How could you suddenly say something like that!\u201d Zhang Yang teased.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Wei Yan Er rolled her eyes.</p><br/><p>The policewoman took out her keys and opened the cuffs. She then turned around and asked Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you live here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t live here! We do!\u201d Wei Yan Er quickly interjected. \u201cMiss Officer, you just came out from the elevator just now, did you came over for a case or do you live here as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI live here.\u201d She answered coldly.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang could not help to think that this place was not a random place that anyone could just live in. This place was considered to be the \u201cuptown\u201d of the entire Zhou Su City! Each house here could cost at least 10 million dollars! How could a police officer like her have the money to live here?</p><br/><p>Could she be the lover of some billionaire or a greedy government officer? Tsk tsk tsk\u2026Such a pity. Such a beautiful lady and yet she would waste her youth for this\u2026 Zhang Yang could not help but to look at her in a different perspective.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang\u2019s sudden change in perception was just for a second. A moment where no one could have even picked it up. Being as sharp as she was, she avidly managed to catch his thoughts and suddenly turned colder.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you must be living a boring life that makes you want to die now, do you?\u201d</p><br/><p>What was that? Is she really an officer of the law or a street gangster?</p><br/><p>However, Zhang Yang was not afraid. He only snickered evilly and said, \u201cHey, be nice. I\u2019m still your guild master. If you\u2019ve wronged me, I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019ll never get any equipment!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of person are you? You sick bastard!\u201d Wei Yan Er rolled her eyes at him and changed her look at the officer with great admiration. \u201cMiss Officer, you\u2019re so cool! You even know how to fight like a pro, unlike my cousin here who can only boast about her black belt karate crap. She can\u2019t even beat me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little brat! Do you really want me to mess up your life?!\u201d Han Yin Xue finally voiced out after being quiet for the entire scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin, I really think that you should get a breast reduction surgery! Or else you\u2019re gonna have saggy breast by the age of 30! By then, you can\u2019t even fight, what more properly walk!\u201d Wei Yan Er said with a serious tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft!\u201d Zhang Yang could not hold it in and choked. He laughed loudly and said, \u201cKids these days are really just plain scary, aren\u2019t they!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStinking brat! If I don\u2019t teach you a lesson today, you\u2019ll never learn how to behave properly next time!\u201d Han Yin Xue growled. With one hand on her waist, and the other pointing at her chest, she said, \u201cLook at these! How could you say that they would sag huh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>These two sisters are just the best!</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Officer, which floor did you live in? Can I go and visit sometime?\u201d Wei Yan Er\u2019s innocent smile was just too pure to ignore. This little brat really knew how to take advantage of her cuteness to get close to others.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease stop calling me Miss Officer. It\u2019s annoying. My name is Sun Xin Yu!\u201d To be able to make her be treated like an acquaintance instead of a complete stranger was a feat that even Zhang Yang had to be impressed with.</p><br/><p>This girl could someday win an Oscar Award!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Looks like we have been fighting the wrong side after all. We are all a big family!\u201d Living among each other, they should not start war when there was no reason to. Zhang Yang laughed and started to walk back. \u201cYou ladies have a lovely night. I have go back now to make more potions! Remember to bring me grinding tomorrow yeah! See you then!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince when were a family, noob tank?!\u201d Wei Yan Er rushed to Zhang Yang and pulled a face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to go now! You guys head back! Remember, no more pranking!\u201d Sun Xin Yu ordered coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Wei Yan Er answered like a baby. Her thought was wandering elsewhere, namely, how to bring Sun Xin Yu to play along with her. With her subzero cold expression, she could easily be the best ghost there was!</p><br/><p>Just when Zhang Yang exited the building, Sun Xin Yu managed to catch up to him and said, \u201cNo matter in the game or in real life, I will defeat you!\u201d</p><br/><p>This woman was just so prideful!</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, you have to put some effort into it! See you tomorrow!\u201d Zhang Yang did not even turn back to look at her. He only walked on and waved goodbye.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What a bunch of rude bastards! Look at what you\u2019ve done to my garden! Oh\u2026 my Crescent Moon Flower\u2026\u201d He suddenly stopped talking. The face that the party saw was filled with malice and anger, they could feel the burning rage emanating from him. Laxus lowered the giant scissors in his hand and jumped off the stool. As he approached the party with the anger of a thousand angry men, his face, bulging with blood vessels that looked like they would burst at any time, looked frightening as hell.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will pay for your impudent behavior!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shush! The boss used to dash towards Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang used as well, taking him head on. He screamed, \u201cDon\u2019t start anything yet, I haven\u2019t gotten a hold on his aggro!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the both of them slammed against each other, the boss remained unscathed while Zhang Yang was stunned for 2 seconds.</p><br/><p>\u2018-2,137!\u2019</p><br/><p>Laxus struck Zhang Yang furiously, dealing extreme damage to him. As circumstances would have it, the boss did not circle around to hit him from behind, lest the attack would have not been absorbed by the shield, and he would have taken an additional 200 damage!</p><br/><p>Once Zhang Yang recovered he had lost more than half of his HP. The Rage he gained filled up, enabling him to chain his skills.</p><br/><p>\u201cAttack now!\u201d</p><br/><p>!</p><br/><p>\u2018-278!\u2019 .</p><br/><p>\u2018-664!\u2019 Normal attack.</p><br/><p>\u2018-2,546!\u2019 critical strike.</p><br/><p>\u2018-1,388!\u2019 .</p><br/><p>The skills casted was almost continuous without any pause in between them. If a warrior had enough Rage, the burst damage would not be any weaker than Thief; even more so if the warrior was a Berserker, since the weapons they wielded were two-handed weapons with slower attack intervals. Their attack power was devastating high and their skills damage were much higher than a dual-wield Thief. In any PK fight, if a Berserker was able to chain their skills, they could easily kill off any class!</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn boy! That damage is just too much!\u201d Fatty Han cried.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang shook his head. \u201cThat was the reason I wanted you to complete the S-level difficulty class quest! This is WAI1!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWAI you mother! Don\u2019t go all western with me! I hate in-ge-ri-su!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Yan Er could only stare at Zhang Yang with envy. Her weapon was a two handed weapon, her normal attack alone was far stronger than Zhang Yang. If she could get her hands on a 200% melee damage skill, her total attack power would increase drastically!</p><br/><p>However, the little kid was quickly discouraged. The S-level difficulty quest was just too difficult for her. She had been an impatient and drastic little kid, not having the persistence to slowly kill off the monster in her quest!</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Noob tank! Why don\u2019t you help me complete my class quest?\u201d Wei Yan Er nudged Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. The quest can only be done by the character alone. Even if you bring me in, the system will automatically deny you entry to the quest zone since this has to be done alone!\u201d If this wasn\u2019t the case, he would have naturally helped everyone in the party to complete their S-level difficulty quest for them to obtain the best possible outcome!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can use my account!\u201d said Wei Yan Er with a smug look on her face, staring at him with a patronizing look.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Young lady, pray tell, how do I log into your account?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll lend you my gaming helmet! You could use my helmet to log into my account!\u201d Wei Yan Er frowned. \u201cHow could you be our team captain when you\u2019re this dumb?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBUAHAHAHAHA!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone laughed.</p><br/><p>This little brat was oblivious to the existence of brain waves and the fact that developers had used this scientific phenomenon to bind each account to their respective owners. It did not help that she could blatantly criticize Zhang Yang with a smug on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cInsolent pest! I will burn you alive!\u201d The boss roared. Fiery pits started to roar to life on the ground. The skill was similar to that of Bangar Crypt\u2019s third boss.</p><br/><p>Everyone started moving around to evade the fire.</p><br/><p>Han Yin Xue immediately casted on everyone. She kept for later use.</p><br/><p>\u201cTremble in the presence of my powers!\u201d Laxus the Gardener let of a thunderous roar that rivaled the sound of actual thunder! A skull appeared above everyone\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Laxus the Gardener had used . Lasts for 6 seconds!\u2019</p><br/><p>Everyone started to run around randomly in all directions, unable to control their own character. Some were screaming, some were cowering while others ran into the fire in the midst of their haphazard running.</p><br/><p>[On Fire]: Receive 800 Fire damage every 3 seconds, for 15 seconds.</p><br/><p>\u2018-2,337!\u2019</p><br/><p>Laxus dealt another powerful attack, immediately forcing some to recover from the . This skill could be dispelled early before the stipulated duration if a player took damage. The higher the damage, the faster you could recover.</p><br/><p>The boss pupils glowed red and the huge scissors in his hands skewered through the air towards Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Laxus the Gardener has used !\u2019</p><br/><p>!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang could not afford to receive any damage since the healer Han Yin Xue was still on the floor cowering.</p><br/><p>With no healer, Zhang Yang had to resort to the skills he had at hand.</p><br/><p>Zoom!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang activated the sword skill effect. The sword gave off a blood red glow and Zhang Yang quickly attacked the boss with all his highest attack skill.</p><br/><p>\u2018-1428!\u2019 .</p><br/><p>\u2018+1429!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-1399!\u2019 .</p><br/><p>\u2018+1399!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-657!\u2019 Normal attack.</p><br/><p>\u2018+657!\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang activated and completely recovered all his HP in an instance.</p><br/><p>6 seconds passed and the effect of had worn off. Everyone returned to their positions and attacked. Little Snow begun to heal the party.</p><br/><p>As expected of Han Yin Xue the Super Healer. With only a few healing spells, she had healed everyone till full health.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for an IQ test!\u201d Fatty Han cried.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! With your level of intelligence! What kind of questions can you ask? For 3 year old? 5 year old?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was calm. Even after the commotion, none of them had lost their composure.</p><br/><p>Fatty Han scoffed. \u201cHaha! It shall be for 7 years old and above!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome! Give it to us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the situation. There were two men and two women stranded on an inhabited island. They waited for a rescue but there were no boats passing by! Now, it was hopeless to just wait there so they wanted to do something to pass the time; to have an orgy in the middle of the night!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Fatty, are you giving us an IQ question, or are you just trying to show off your perverted-ness?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! At least listen to what I have to say!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFinish it then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. Hmm. Here is the problem. But they cannot just do it since they might spread STD! So, everyone started to find some rubber! But here\u2019s the real problem! Both of them wanted to have a two-way so, here\u2019s the question for you guys! What could they do to make sure everyone stays safe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty Han!\u201d Han Yin Xue and Wei Yan Er screamed at Fatty Han through their teeth. Sun Xin Yu on the other side was only focused on attacking the boss with no visible changes to her expression.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang and Hundred Shots on the other hand were not at all offended by such indecent topics. In fact, they were actually taking the problem seriously, racking their brains.</p><br/><p>After some time, Zhang Yang laughed. He said, \u201cI know the answer!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey idiot! If you ever think of saying anything to corrupt my Yan Er, I\u2019ll personally smash your face in!\u201d warned Han Yin Xue.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed even louder. He then said, \u201cAlright, how do I put this delicately\u2026Ah hah! Gloves! Man A puts on glove number 1 and then puts number 2 gloves over glove number 1! He will then erhm\u2026hold hands with Girl A. After that, he will take off glove number 1 and hold Girl B\u2019s hands. Man B will then put on glove number 2 and hold Girl B\u2019s hand. After putting on glove number 1 and holds Girl A\u2019s hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah there stud! Looks like my Little Yang here has the potential to be a cheating bastard!\u201d Fatty Han laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Enough with gloves, focus on the boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Laxus tried to hit Zhang Yang with his powerful attack but Zhang Yang utilized his that only needed 2 seconds to cooldown to completely turn himself invulnerable to the boss. Even after changing into his wolf form, Laxus was unable to endure the party\u2019s immense firepower and fell defeated after a short while.</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew\u2026In my own humble opinion, I think that so far, of all the bosses we\u2019ve encountered in Hardcore Mode, this was the easiest!\u201d said Hundred Shots.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang smiled without commenting. The only reason he could say that was because of Zhang Yang\u2019s unparalleled skills as a tank and a Guardian. If anyone else could replace him, and have more a than 5 second cooldown time for his , Hundred Shots would quickly change his mind..</p><br/><p>\u201cTime for the spoils!\u201d Wei Yan Er walked up and opened the corpse.</p><br/><p>[Gardener\u2019s Proposal Ring] (Gray-Silver, Ring)</p><br/><p>Vitality: +15</p><br/><p>Intelligence: +15</p><br/><p>Use: Increase Magic critical by 2%</p><br/><p>Level requirement: 30</p><br/><p>Everyone exchanged looks.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much of a slut could this Winny be?!\u201d Fatty Han sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe could have everyone in this garden falling for her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you. Not even the TV series in Taiwan about family drama could be as complicated as this! Winny could even be eligible for the mainland\u2019s *ahem* romantic action movie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAttention to all bosses in the Garden! Please put on safety GLOVES when SHAKING hands with Jenny. . and put a few more on over it just in case! You don\u2019t want to contract any HANDS disease!\u201d</p><br/><p>The three guys joked around and laughed heartily. Even guys could gossip sometimes. However, their jokes were wasted on Han Yin Xue as she rolled her eyes, while Sun Xin Yu remained stoic and unfazed.</p><br/><p>The ring automatically fell into Han Yin Xue\u2019s hands. She put it on and gained a slight increase in stats.</p><br/><p>[Smithing Recipe: Garden Scissors]</p><br/><p>Use: Teaches you how to make a [Garden Scissors]</p><br/><p>Requirement: Amateur Smithing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this\u2026bad? Or good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind that first. Just roll the dice and use it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The only players in the party who had learned Smithing were Wei Yan Er and Zhang Yang. Both of them rolled and Wei Yan Er obtained the item. She quickly patted it lovingly.</p><br/><p>[Garden Scissors] (Special Item)</p><br/><p>Item description: Allows an extra 1% success rate to harvest an additional herb during harvesting.</p><br/><p>Requirement: Herbalism.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026this is good. Sort of. Additional herbs are like additional minerals, they are considered to be rare items. Farmers would love them. Little brat, you should start making a bunch of this item and sell it. You might not earn a fortune but at least you can raise your mastery level with this recipe. Talk about killing 2 birds with 1 stone!\u201d said Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>Wei Yan Er did not look like she heard him. She did love the concept of getting rich, but she had no patience for it. She would have died of boredom if she was somehow forced to sit down, making items for days like Zhang Yang did.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get a move on!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe\u2026I have another IQ test for you lots!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>--------------------------------</p><br/><p>1WAI- In the conversation, Zhang Yang used English language in his speech. WAI = Why.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

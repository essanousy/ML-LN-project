Was it called S level for nothing? There were only very few people in the entirety of China who could finish this quest! Well, if the quest was positioned somewhere further down the progress of the game, there could have been more people completing this quest as many would already have gotten used to the controls of the game, thereby having the skills, intuition, controls, and attack plan to make it possible! This early in the game, nobody would truly be skilled!</p><br/><p>Hundred Shots was bound to be one of the famous players from China! He was the top among the Top 10 Hunters! However, his strength would lie on the little red pet dragon. When the dragon would have popped out, he would rule the world! Even if he was slightly lacking in individual skill, his dragon more than made up for it!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang mulled over it for a while and replied, \u201cJust try your best and give it a few more rounds. The Level 30 skill is extremely important! Try your best to get the S level difficulty reward!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Hundred Shots was a man who cared about his self-worth. He clearly understood that Zhang Yang was a man of talent and kill. He wanted to stay beside him through thick and thin. Even if he could never be as strong as Zhang Yang, the least he could do was to avoid being dead weight.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang had never played as a Hunter before, so there was no way he could provide any advice on the Hunter questline. Zhang Yang could only ask for him to have a deeper understanding of his class skills. The developers would not simply design the game to have players equipped with a particular set of skills at a particular moment of the game for nothing! The quests have been tailored specially to accommodate the use of everything they had been given. The raw materials were laid out on the workbench, one only had to use them wisely!</p><br/><p>This class quest was to test each player\u2019s knowledge on their own class skills!</p><br/><p>Fatty Han, Han Yin Xue, and Wei Yan Er were still busy grinding their level up to Level 30. Zhang Yang left them be, there was no benefit to gain from pestering them about the quest. He then went on to craft more potions, ready to be sent out to the 7 main cities, where more gold would end up in his hands still.</p><br/><p>Beep!</p><br/><p>The messenger rang and Zhang Yang quickly answered the call. There was no need to worry about the the person at the other end of the line, for only those who were added into his friend list could contact him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo! Zhan Yu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang was startled, he did not expect a phone call from this person out of his list of acquaintances. \u201cYo! Crimson Fire guild master!\u201d The person over the phone was the guild master of Lost Paradise, someone he had partied with back at Bangar Crypt.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh\u2026Back then, I would have never thought that this person who ran dungeons with me would become the man who would defeat so many super guilds in this China Server! There are only a few people in this world that I admire. I must tell you that my bar was set at quite a high standard. You sir, surpassed that and beyond!\u201d Crimson Fire\u2019s tone sounded a little too boastful.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed. \u201cHaha! You said it. I\u2019m so happy that I could just float away now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf only I\u2019d known sooner, I would have rather given up my position as a guild master to have you in my guild!\u201d His tone had changed, layered with regret.</p><br/><p>When Crimson Fire first met Zhang Yang, he had already set his eyes on him. But he could have never expected Zhang Yang to be at this level! Initially, he wanted to pull him in and have him as part of his guild, however he believed that keeping the authority of guild master in his hand was more important.</p><br/><p>But now, regret was not even close enough to describe how he felt!</p><br/><p>What was the purpose of a Professional Guild? Was not it for name, glory, and money!?</p><br/><p>With all that said, he could have given up on his positon as the guild master and hid behind the scene. Since the sponsors were in direct contact with him, he would still be the boss of the guild as long as the guild maintained its rank!</p><br/><p>If the guild name were to spread out further, the sponsorship fees would also increase! If they could match the level of super guilds, being a millionaire was not just a dream anymore!</p><br/><p>But now that he had missed that golden opportunity, how could he not regret?!</p><br/><p>Ah\u2026the original guild master of Lone Desert Smoke was far smarter than he was. She was willing to give up the position of the guild master to Zhang Yang and trade that position for a huge amount of money! Smart! No, genius!</p><br/><p>However, what that Crimson Fire did not know was that Wei Yan Er had passed the guild master position to Zhang Yang on a whim. Yes! She felt it was troublesome! If Crimson Fire had known this, would he go bang his head on a wall?</p><br/><p>\u201cErhm? Why would the guild master of Crimson Fire grace me with his presence? Is there anything I can do to help you?\u201d Zhang Yang never liked to beat around the bush, he thought it was only troublesome to do so. He would rather have a conversation with someone as straightforward as Wei Yan Er.</p><br/><p>Crimson Fire gathered his thoughts and said, \u201cI represent Lost Paradise, seeking an alliance with Lone Desert Smoke! Perhaps we could help each other out in the future! This is the purpose of my call!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang thought of it for a while and said, \u201cThis is a good thing. Okay! I agree! May we help each other out! We are now a family!\u201d</p><br/><p>After some light banter, Crimson Fire hung up, saying that he had to bring his team to raid a dungeon.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, Fatty Han, Wei Yan Er, and Han Yin Xue had reached Level 30. Zhang Yang instructed them to undergo the S level difficulty class quest. Hundred Shots had been trying his best since morning until the afternoon with no luck. He said that he had died a few hundred times!</p><br/><p>After 3pm, Sun Xin Yu logged in and went to grind alone. She did not take long and managed to reach Level 30 as well!</p><br/><p>Curious, Zhang Yang asked her. \u201cAre you finally free now? How is it that you could log in at such an early hour?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWork shift!\u201d Sun Xin Yu replied coldly.</p><br/><p>Hmph! Ice Queen! I hope that you\u2019ll have a chatterbox of a husband who annoys the hell out of you!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang acknowledged her reply with a simple exclamation, \u201cOh!\u201d. But his curiosity was not yet satiated and he pressed on. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been online for long, how could you level up so damn fast?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Xin Yu silently posted an item description on the chat window.</p><br/><p>[Heaven\u2019s Pearl] (Special Item)</p><br/><p>Item description: Grants you an extra 50% experience point from monsters or quests.</p><br/><p>Bound.</p><br/><p>F*ck! How could such a godly item exist?! No wonder she had been leveling at such fast pace, spending so little time! However, it was no longer a mystery on how she could remain at the top of the Level Ranking Board, guildless as she was!</p><br/><p>Guild members would have experience point bonuses as the guild levelled up. A Level 1 guild would have a 10% experience point bonus, Level 2 guilds double that amount at 20%, and it went on up to a 100% bonus points at Level 10! However, Guild Upgrade Orders from Level 5 onwards were freakishly tough to farm! In his previous life, the strongest guild in the entire game was only at Level 7!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d Zhang Yang asked. Such a valuable item would ultimately have the lowest drop rate ever! She could be holding the only one in the entirety of China! With Sun Xin Yu\u2019s solitary nature, she would not have shared the news with anyone else. No wonder Zhang Yang had never heard of this item before in his previous life!</p><br/><p>\u201cReward from a hidden quest!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Zhang Yang sighed heavily. Hidden quest. It was no wonder. She was holding the only one in the entire China! No one else would have had the chance to obtain it anymore!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do my class quest now. Do not bother me or\u2026 I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d snapped Sun Xin Yu coldly before she left the conversation without another word.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang was bored, since everyone was doing their respective class quests and should not be disturbed as well. Zhang Yang was always smart enough to not talk in the party channel. He continued to make potions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWah! This is frustrating!\u201d Fatty Han roared \u201cWTF! I just equipped my hard-earned Gray-Silver equipment! And now the system won\u2019t allow me to use them?! F*ck! One attack was only 100 damage! How long am I supposed to continue to fight? 1 year?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou stupid fat pig! I failed my quest because of your sudden screaming!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin\u2026you startled me\u2026I died as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone failed their quest ever since the dummy Fatty Han started a ruckus in the party channel.</p><br/><p>\u201cPervy Fatty! If you ever disturb us again, I\u2019ll rip your balls off!\u201d Wei Yan Er scolded.</p><br/><p>Fatty Han suddenly tightened his legs closer and quietly obeyed. His happiness was only just blossoming. The erectile problem should not exist now, it should only be a problem when he would be 50 years old!</p><br/><p>After all that happened, everyone was smart enough to mute their chatting system to avoid being distracted.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang knew that Fatty Han\u2019s capabilities was no match with the S level difficulty. He sighed and sent a private message to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey Fatty, try and change the difficulty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWTF? Are you looking down at me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely correct!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! You sure know me well brother! Alright, I\u2019ll confess. I attempted the quest 16 times already and the best I could do was with 97% of the boss HP still remaining! Little Yang! What do you think? What difficulty level should I do?\u201d One of Fatty Han\u2019s greatest attitude was that he had never been dishonest to himself nor anyone else. If he was bad, he would not try to hide it. He would not try to keep his shortcomings in the dark for the sake of his pride.</p><br/><p>\u201cTry C!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a slightly simpler one?\u201d Fatty Han asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cB is easier!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk!\u201d Fatty Han took the bait and went on to met his respective class instructor.</p><br/><p>After a while, he had managed to complete the quest. A level B difficulty was not easy, but since Fatty Han had been following Zhang Yang to many raids, he was skilled enough to handle a level B difficulty.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yang! I\u2019ve gained a new skill!\u201d Fatty Han posted the skill description to Zhang Yang, like it was a trophy of some kind.</p><br/><p>[Beast Link]: Obtained the power of a wild beast! 25% of all received damage will be shared to your pet! Increases your ranged attack damage by 50%. Last for 10 seconds.</p><br/><p>Cooldown time: 3 minutes.</p><br/><p>As expected of a level B difficulty reward, it was pathetic! If he were to complete the S level difficulty, he would have the skill power raised to 75% shared damage and a 100% increase in attack power!</p><br/><p>However, there were only a handful of players who could defeat a S level difficulty, Zhang Yang did not chastise him for it. On the other hand, he had high expectations from Sun Xin Yu. Someone like her could possibly beat the S difficulty quest! She was the future number 1 Thief after all. No one could beat her in the underlying knowledge of Thieves! If she could not clear the S level difficulty quest, no other thieves would.</p><br/><p>To Zhang Yang surprise, the third person to complete the class quest was Han Xin Yue!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m beat! I finally healed the freaking donkey!\u201d She complained.</p><br/><p>That was\u2026quick?</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang could not help but frown. \u201cWhat difficulty did you picked?\u201d he asked suspiciously.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you ask me to pick the S level difficulty? Did I pick the wrong one?\u201d She replied.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang was surprised. He immediately straightened up. \u201cSo, you\u2019re saying that you completed the S level difficulty quest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStupid Zhang Yang! What am I? A kid? Of course I did! Hmph!\u201d Han Xin Yu snapped.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed it off.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhahaha. I was only asking. Oh right! What was your quest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were two NPCs fighting each other. My job was to make sure one of them does not die, and that he kills the other NPC, that's\u200b it!\u201d Han Xin Yue said it so flippantly as if it was the most common thing in the world.</p><br/><p>As expected of the team healer! No, Super Healer! No! Not even that! She was the Goddess of Healing herself! She should just hang her gigantic cups and let the world healers worship them! Those were the best in the world!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang sighed in awe. He had always known that Han Yin Xue was a strong healer in the team. But to think that she would even reach to this level on her own was beyond his imagination! Looks like he struck the jackpot!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat skill did you get for your reward?\u201d Zhang Yang asked.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

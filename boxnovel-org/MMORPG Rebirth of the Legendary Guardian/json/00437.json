In your face, noobie tank! How does it feel to be trampled over! Hahaha! This is</p><br/><p>the payback for your bullying ways!\" the little brat laughed like how an audience laughed at a</p><br/><p>clown.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang remained unfazed. Based on Han Ying Xue and everyone else\u2019s progress, he had</p><br/><p>deduced that the Glory points found in chest varied from 1 points to 20 points! It was not</p><br/><p>completely random either. If the chest was found nearby an area with normal tiered monsters, it</p><br/><p>will produce Glory points ranging from 1 to 10 points. Most of them had not even spawned any</p><br/><p>Glory points! On the other hand, if the chest was found in an area with elite monsters, the Glory</p><br/><p>points found inside would be between 11 points to 20 points. These types of chests would more</p><br/><p>likely spawn Glory points.</p><br/><p>Since the start, his luck had not been that good, since he had only been able to find normal</p><br/><p>monsters. However, Zhang Yang had faith that his luck would turn for the better.</p><br/><p>\u2018Server Announcement: Light flashes to all corners of the realm. Rainman has found an Ancient</p><br/><p>Treasure Chest and obtained a powerful equipment: Star Dragon Boots!\u2019</p><br/><p>[Star Dragon Boots] (Violet-Platinum, Heavy Armor)</p><br/><p>Defense: +80</p><br/><p>Vitality: +806</p><br/><p>Strength: +540</p><br/><p>Dexterity: +230</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 80</p><br/><p>The server channel was filled with the announcement notification. The system notification had</p><br/><p>even posted the item properties, allowing every player in China to be able to read and check on</p><br/><p>the item.</p><br/><p>Across the entire server, players from all around different cities got heated up, for the item tier</p><br/><p>was Violet-Platinum! The best and strongest equipment tier in the game, so far! Now that one</p><br/><p>player had obtained the item, everyone got fired up. For the item could be obtained from a chest,</p><br/><p>and not just from a boss!</p><br/><p>From Zhang Yang\u2019s perspective, he did not care about the item. He had bigger problems at</p><br/><p>hand. Just how big is this Realm of the Sacred Glory? All he had been able to see was the never-</p><br/><p>ending scenery of mountains and grassy plains. This event takes all players from all servers of</p><br/><p>the game! The numbers could easily reach 100 million, yet all Zhang Yang had encountered</p><br/><p>were monsters, and not a single player! Just how large did the developers make the map up to</p><br/><p>be?</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang could not comprehend the sheer vastness of the map, and decided to go with the</p><br/><p>flow. After a certain number of chests, Zhang Yang finally managed to open one and score his</p><br/><p>first Glory point. The points did not require player to pick, open, or do practically anything at all.</p><br/><p>As long as players opened the chest, the points would automatically be added to the poll and be</p><br/><p>displayed at the side of the player\u2019s head\u2019s up display user interface.</p><br/><p>1 point\u20262 points\u202620\u202650\u2026</p><br/><p>As slow as Zhang Yang\u2019s progress was, it was entirely controlled by the system random number</p><br/><p>generator system. There was really nothing Zhang Yang could do to boost the numbers. Based</p><br/><p>on Zhang Yang\u2019s current equipment build, he had not needed to take any breaks and could go on</p><br/><p>forever in killing monsters and opening chests. Right now, to maximize the effort of earning</p><br/><p>more Glory points, Zhang Yang had placed the monster killing as his second priority and had set</p><br/><p>his main goal into finding more chests instead.</p><br/><p>He rode the bear everywhere, and if there were no chests among the group of monsters he</p><br/><p>encountered, Zhang Yang would not stop and continued to run towards the next chest. If the</p><br/><p>monsters could not chase after him, Zhang Yang would not bother to turn around. The time</p><br/><p>allocated for him to be in this \"realm\" is limited. Even though the monster did give extra</p><br/><p>experience points, they wouldn\u2019t matter if he could not earn enough Glory points in the first</p><br/><p>place.</p><br/><p>After continuously collecting items from chests, Zhang Yang had finally filled up most of this</p><br/><p>inventory space. Although he had 190 slots in his inventory, most of the slots were filled up with</p><br/><p>many kinds of different potions and their different transmutation grades. In the end, Zhang Yang</p><br/><p>had to resort to discarding lower tiered items in order to make way for better items.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You have opened a Glory Treasure Chest!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You have obtained Level 4 Dexterity Gemstone x1!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You have obtained 16 Glory Points!\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang was stunned at the word [Level 4 Dexterity Gemstone] and quickly examined his</p><br/><p>inventory. There, sitting quietly at the corner of Zhang Yang\u2019s saturated inventory, was the item.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang took it out and felt the glossy surface of the gemstone. Like other gemstones, it was</p><br/><p>extremely smooth on the surface, and fit just right in the palm of his hand.</p><br/><p>[Level 4 Dexterity Gemstone] (Usable)</p><br/><p>Use: Place this Gemstone in a Level 4 Socket or higher, to grant 50 Dexterity points to an</p><br/><p>equipment. Socketing has a 40% chance of failure.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang smiled happily. It was a jackpot. Gemstones that were level 3 and below could be</p><br/><p>bought from a Gemstone store. However, Level 4 Gemstones and higher could only be obtained</p><br/><p>from monsters, chests, or Hardcore Mode Dungeon Speed record reward. Still, if one had the</p><br/><p>wallet of Donald Trump, one could easily fuse Level 3 Gemstones into Level 4 Gemstones.</p><br/><p>However, that percentage chance and money would only be burning a hole in pockets!</p><br/><p>In most games, including \u2018God\u2019s Miracle\u2019, players could invest a fortune and be able to \"win\"</p><br/><p>the game easily. Those who insisted in not spending any cash in the game would have to rely on</p><br/><p>talent and effort. Either money or effort could bring a player to victory, and if players had</p><br/><p>neither, gaming would be extremely tough for them. There were games that would give players a</p><br/><p>huge advantage for investing money, while other games had little to no benefits for cash players.</p><br/><p>\u2018God\u2019s Miracle\u2019 was both pay-to- win, and play-to- win. It was balanced in both ways; put in</p><br/><p>enough effort, you can earn enough money in the game to re-invest in it again to earn more.</p><br/><p>After that, Zhang Yang had opened more chests and had obtained a [Level 4 Vitality Gemstone],</p><br/><p>[Intelligence Gemstone], and [Spirit Gemstone]. None of them were in bulk. Zhang Yang had</p><br/><p>only managed to haul two counts of [Spirit Gemstone] and one count of the aforementioned</p><br/><p>Gemstones. Worst off, he had not obtained any [Strength Gemstones]! Since Vitality was</p><br/><p>considered to be the most universal attribute in all 5 major attributes, the [Level 4 Vitality</p><br/><p>Gemstone] granted a bonus 100 Vitality points, double that of others.</p><br/><p>\"Yo! Boss, how much is your current Glory points?\" asked Endless Starlight out of the blue.</p><br/><p>\"129 points.\" Zhang Yang casually replied.</p><br/><p>\"D*mn! That\u2019s a lot! You have more than I do!\"</p><br/><p>\"Can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m handsome, that\u2019s why!\"</p><br/><p>\"Please! 129 points? That\u2019s far from what I have!\" the little brat interjected in the party chat. \"I</p><br/><p>already have 153!\u2019</p><br/><p>\"Haha! You\u2019re saying that you\u2019re beautiful?\" said Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>\"Nyehehehe! At least you have good eye sight!\"</p><br/><p>Without realizing it, Zhang Yang had already spent more than 2 hours in the realm. Only then,</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang had spotted the first player in the map. The opponent was not a China player.</p><br/><p>Instead, he had a tag behind his name saying: \"North America\".</p><br/><p>Even though the other player was only Level 78, Zhang Yang had still jumped atop his mount</p><br/><p>and killed the poor player in a few hits. In the game, the enmity between players across the</p><br/><p>continent and server would forever be hostile. That was why, Zhang Yang would kill anything</p><br/><p>that did not bear a red flag, even if he was Level 78, or Level 1!</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You have obtained 1 Honor Point!\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang obtained Honor points after killing the player. Honor points were collectible points</p><br/><p>that could be earned when a player kills another player of a different server. Points collected</p><br/><p>could be used to exchange items and equipment that would be bound to a player. It was another</p><br/><p>method if obtaining equipment if one could not kill a dungeon boss. Honor points would only be</p><br/><p>given if the player killed is from another region. Players from the same region, for example,</p><br/><p>China\u2019s Emerald City and White Jade Castle cannot earn points by killing each other. Normally,</p><br/><p>players can earn 1 Honor points by killing NPCs, players equal or lower than the player\u2019s level.</p><br/><p>Players could earn more points by killing more important NPCs like army generals or Kings or a</p><br/><p>ruler from another kingdom. In this case, the King would grant up to 10,000 Honor points! The</p><br/><p>problem was, it is not easy to just jump into the vast army and target their king. Unlike chess, the</p><br/><p>Kings in the game were one of the strongest entities.</p><br/><p>Slowly yet surely, Zhang Yang had gathered more Glory points and had reached above than 300</p><br/><p>points. With no sense of security since the game did not provide a means to check one\u2019s current</p><br/><p>position in the ranking list, the only way Zhang Yang could convince himself that he is in the</p><br/><p>ranking list was to open more and more chest. By the time the system was close to revealing the</p><br/><p>rank, Zhang Yang had the urge to ask his friends.</p><br/><p>\"Hey guys? How much points do you guys have?\"</p><br/><p>\"421!\"</p><br/><p>\"583!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone reported their collected points and to put in comparison, Han Ying Xue, the ever so</p><br/><p>lucky lady had collected 682 points with Fatty Han at the lowest with only 398.</p><br/><p>\"Aww. Fatty bro. I don\u2019t understand, why do you have such luck!\"</p><br/><p>\"Nyahahaha. I\u2019d say, remember to wash your hands every time you\u2019re done with the loo!\"</p><br/><p>\"Sadly, Fatty bro might be kicked out!\"</p><br/><p>Amid the jokes around, by the time the clock struck 12 noon, every player\u2019s character was frozen</p><br/><p>in place.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! The system is currently calculating the system rank. Please wait\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Server announcement: Current number of players in Realm of the Sacred Glory: 687,349,832.</p><br/><p>Players with Glory points of 400 and less will be eliminated from the Realm of the Sacred Glory.</p><br/><p>Player elimination will start in 30 seconds. Please be ready.\u2019</p><br/><p>Without much delay, the system announced the result.</p><br/><p>\"ARGH! What a waste! I was only 2 points behind! 2 motherf*cking points!\" cried Fatty Han</p><br/><p>disgruntledly. Cry as he may, the system ruthlessly kicked players out without a second thought.</p><br/><p>After much discussion and inquiry, it was found out that almost 90% of Lone Desert Smoke</p><br/><p>guild members had been kicked out of the map.</p><br/><p>The longer you spend inside the Realm of the Sacred Glory, the more benefits you could reap</p><br/><p>from it. It would serve as a great chance to improve the status of the guild. Yet, after finding out</p><br/><p>that 90% of the members of the guild had been kicked out, it would not help much, but only a</p><br/><p>tiny fraction of that.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang asked Snow Seeker and even Greensleeves Prince, and found that their guilds had</p><br/><p>suffered from similar losses. Both guilds had 90% of their guild members kicked out of the</p><br/><p>Realm.</p><br/><p>The second portal opened and the second round of the \"Treasure Hunt\" started. This time, many</p><br/><p>players who had not participated were first to arrive. Since they had not joined the first round,</p><br/><p>they had lost a great deal of time to find and gather Glory points. Unless they had the best of</p><br/><p>luck, they would not have much time to compensate the 12 hours lost from the previous round.</p><br/><p>This round, Zhang Yang was extremely lucky. The Glory points that he had obtained from most</p><br/><p>of the chest were all 10 and above. He had even surpassed Han Ying Xue! Even though the real-</p><br/><p>time ranking list was hidden away from players, Zhang Yang had found out that he was the</p><br/><p>highest in the guild.</p><br/><p>After the second round, the elimination condition was set to 1,000 Glory points and below. The</p><br/><p>number of players left to join the third round was only around 7,000,000, which was not even</p><br/><p>enough to fill one major city!</p><br/><p>From the third round onwards, the ranking list was released to the players. At the same time, the</p><br/><p>system had made an announcement, eliminating 90% of all the players inside the realm. Those</p><br/><p>who were listed in the ranking list had to push themselves to the limit, to position their names at</p><br/><p>the top of the list, in order to prevent elimination. With the threat of elimination hanging over</p><br/><p>their necks, players who were listed lower in the list had to force themselves to run amok in</p><br/><p>panic to search for chests.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang had the experience. Now, instead of just blindly searching, he completely ignored</p><br/><p>fighting the monsters until he could find another chest. If the monsters still chased after him, he</p><br/><p>would kill them all in one wave. With his battle mount and him combined strength, monsters</p><br/><p>stood no chance. Only strong tanks like One Sword Stroke and Endless Starlight might be able to</p><br/><p>follow his method.</p><br/><p>After the third, fourth, and the fifth round of elimination, only 10 players, including Zhang Yang</p><br/><p>was left in the realm. The only player from Lone Desert Smoke to remain in the field was Zhang</p><br/><p>Yang alone!</p><br/><p>Initially, the little brat had a chance to enter the final 10, however, she had encountered a</p><br/><p>European player and had been in a fierce fight. They had spent more than 2 hours just to have a</p><br/><p>go at each other and in the end, both of them were eliminated.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

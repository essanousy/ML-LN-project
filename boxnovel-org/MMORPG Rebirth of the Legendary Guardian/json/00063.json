However, the problem in this case was the spawn rate. Weak Zombies were simply too scarce. They spent too much time hunting for them one at a time. It was lucky that the game had a shared party kill system. As long as the party members did not stray too far away from each other, any Weak Zombie that Zhang Yang killed will also be counted as a kill for the rest of the team. The same went for anyone else. Still, they had to spend an hour to be able to kill a total of 20 Weak Zombies.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis pisses me off!\u201d Drizzler was a temperamental girl. She could not endure any form of slow progress that required patience. \u201cArgh! I don\u2019t care how sad or pitiful the girl is. If she gives out another quest that requires me to run around again, I\u2019d smack her upside down!\u201d</p><br/><p>10 minutes later.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaa\u2026haa\u2026\u201d Drizzler broke down. \u201cArgh\u2026why couldn\u2019t I steel my resolve\u2026waa waa\u2026I just can\u2019t help it! Look at her! She is so sad! Now I am sad!\u201d Drizzler failed at her attempt to be stern.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! It can\u2019t be helped! Let\u2019s continue on!\u201d</p><br/><p>[A Test of Strength (3)] (Difficulty level: C)</p><br/><p>Quest description: Emmy requires you to further prove your strength! Kill 50 Obese Ghouls to prove it. You can find this monster in the Desolated Ghostly Flatlands north of the village.</p><br/><p>Progress: Killed Obese Ghoul 0/50</p><br/><p>Luckily the third quest was also a kill quest. Even though the kill count increased, the time taken to complete this quest was much faster than the previous one! Unlike the low spawn rate of Weak Zombies or the low drop rate of the [Bone Finger], the Obese Ghouls\u2019 spawn rate was so high that they managed to finish the quest in no time.</p><br/><p>\u201cI swear that this time! I will just dump this quest if Emmy issues another quest like this! Hmph! I will definitely walk the talk!\u201d said Drizzler on their way back to the NPC.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang snickered. \u201cDrizzler, you\u2019re a pot calling the kettle black!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Black? I\u2019m not racist!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo Drizzler. It\u2019s means that you\u2019re the epitome of irony.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNoob tank! I curse you to love guys instead of girls!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah there! Little brat! You really hate me don\u2019t you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey see me rollin\u2019 they hatin\u2019\u2026\u201d Fatty Han started to sing the song that was viral on the internet.</p><br/><p>When they arrived at the village, they killed themselves again to talk with Emmy.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brothers, elder sisters. Emmy has faith in your strength! You indeed have the strength to help us!\u201d said the girl with her reddish eyes. \u201cAbout 7 days ago, a Necromancer visited our village. With just a wave of his hand, he casted a greenish cloud of poison and engulfed the entire village, killing every single one of us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brothers, elder sisters, this Necromancer is evil! Not only has he taken our bodies, he even dragged our souls! Emmy\u2019s parents, grandparents, and all of the villagers; he has taken the souls of everyone! Please, Emmy begs you! Please save them! Please save their souls!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her sob was the only sound in the silent village.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-Would you *hick* help Emmy?\u201d</p><br/><p>With her puppy eyes, she begged the party.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoo\u2026\u201d Drizzler cried like a baby. Her cries were at first soft and appropriate, even, but eventually turned downright outrageous. \u201cWaaah\u2026that\u2019s so sad! She\u2019s so sad! Waaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmmy has to warn you! The Necromancer is very strong! You will have to make necessary preparations. You will need to gather ingredients to make an antidote for the Necromancer\u2019s poison! Without it, you won\u2019t stand a chance against him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Emmy has a quest for you: To Craft an Antidote. Will you accept it?\u2019</p><br/><p>[To Craft an Antidote] (Difficultly level: A)</p><br/><p>Quest description: To resist the Necromancer\u2019s poison, you would have to craft an antidote to dispel the poison mist he releases! Moon Orchids can be found in the Mossy Forest. Zombie Mushrooms can be found in the Desolated Ghostly Flatlands. The Frog King can be found in the Misty Swamp.</p><br/><p>Progress: Collected Moon Orchid 0/10 Zombie Mushroom 0/10 Frog King\u2019s Blood 0/1</p><br/><p>After putting in some thought, Zhang Yang decided to split the team to search for the ingredients.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Snow and the brat, you guys go collect the Moon Orchid at the Mossy Forest. Fatty, Hundred Shot, and myself will go to the Desolated Ghostly Flatlands for the Zombie Mushrooms. Please rendezvous at this spot once everyone had gathered the ingredient. We will take on the Frog King together!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone began heading out in their assigned direction but Fatty Han had some reservations. He insisted that he should be in the same party as Little Snow and Drizzler. After a little struggle, he was forcefully kicked back to Zhang Yang\u2019s side by the girls. Reluctantly, Fatty Han rejoined and headed to the Desolated Ghostly Flatland.</p><br/><p>The Desolated Ghostly Flatland was a training ground for players above Level 20. As many of the monsters here were higher than Level 25, their aggro range was much wider. Zhang Yang and the other 2 Hunters quickly found themselves caught up in huge mobs after just a few steps.</p><br/><p>Zombie Mushrooms could be found growing in the earth, hidden and buried on the side of a copse. The mushrooms were dark in color and if you did not pay attention, you could easily walk pass them! The 3 of them made very slow progress as they were preoccupied in battles most of the time. On the other side of the village, Drizzler had an equally hard time finding the Moon Orchid. She had been complaining continuously in the party channel.</p><br/><p>After wasting a whole 2 hours of killing and plucking, they successfully gathered 50 of each ingredient. Once they completed their gathering, they met back at the village. After a quick stat rep, they headed to the Misty Swamp, to fight the highly anticipated Frog King!</p><br/><p>The Misty Swamp was located at the other side of the Mossy Forest, which was considered to be a Level 20 to 30 training ground. Since most casual players were still at around Level 15, this training ground was completely empty. With the absence of any being, this place was made to be more cool and creepy. Bubbles formed constantly within the mud of the swamp, releasing an extremely foul smell when the black-gooey globes burst.</p><br/><p>\u201cUrgh\u2026it smells\u2026\u201d Drizzler voice was muffled as both Little Snow and she covered their mouths and pinched their noses. Her cheeks were puffed up and she looked like she was going to be sick at any moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to the main setting window and open the Realism tab. There, you can adjust the Smell Setting to your liking. You could even turn it off if you want to. That way, you can remove the stinking smell!\u201d Zhang Yang turned around after giving the advice. He had bigger things to worry about. Right now, Zhang Yang was stressed out. The entire swamp is so big, where is the Frog King exactly? Even if he was a man from the future that came back with valuable information, he was still a human; and an imperfect one at that!</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like I have no choice. I\u2019ll sweep the area a la old fashion!\u201d Zhang Yang sighed heavily and walked deeper into the swamp. Usually, the boss would spawn at an area\u2019s highest peak, or the center of the area, or even at the deepest floor. The mini-map would have an indicator that represented the quest monster. However, it would only appear in the map when you\u2019re at a close proximity.</p><br/><p>There was a pathway in the swamp, but the pathway was small and narrow. You could slip and fall into the mud and receive a certain amount of damage. The monsters in this area were mostly hidden in the mud. It would only jump put and attack when a player entered its aggro range.</p><br/><p>Some of the monsters available here were Steel-Skinned Frogs, Greyback Crocodile, and also the Dark Piranha. Every single monster here was in no shortage in terms of revolting, repulsive and disgusting appearances. Little Snow and Drizzler were constantly complaining about the designing ability of the developers.</p><br/><p>As they fought their way further into the swamp, they arrived at a huge muddy plain. In the center of the thick fog, they could see a large object crouched over, it\u2019s back silhouetted like a tiny hill.</p><br/><p>Everyone was alerted of its presence and they checked their mini map to make sure. They found it! A yellow blinking dot appeared!</p><br/><p>\u201cFound it!\u201d</p><br/><p>They slowly approached the object and as they were close enough, they could clearly identify it.</p><br/><p>There, sitting in the center of the muddy plain, with its glowing pair of dark gleaming eyes, was a 10 meter tall blood red giant frog. Its presence gave off a mystical magical evil aura! The gigantic frog opened its mouth and croaked as loud as thunder!</p><br/><p>[Venomous Frog King] (Green-Copper)</p><br/><p>Level: 25</p><br/><p>HP: 150k</p><br/><p>\u201cHah! It is a boss!\u201d Fatty Han was delighted. \u201cWe can get equipment!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang did not share the same excitement as Fatty Han. He was on full alert.</p><br/><p>Even though this boss did not seem to be any harder than a dungeon boss, he did not possess enough information about this boss to safely fight it! A wild boss was not the same as a dungeon boss. If a dungeon boss was raided as often as possible, players would have extensive information about its skill or ability and they would be able to form a perfect strategy to fight it. However, this was not the case for wild bosses. The rate of encountering a wild boss was so low that the information about it was extremely scarce!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang had never encountered this boss before in his previous life, which was why he did not know a single thing about this boss\u2019s skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to go in blind for now. Let\u2019s give it a shot!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang pulled out his sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go! Prepare for battle!\u201d</p><br/><p>With only two steps forward, Zhang Yang had entered the boss\u2019 aggro range, triggering the boss to croak loudly and turned its enormous body towards Zhang Yang. The boss jumped and tackled Zhang Yang, while at the same moment, Zhang Yang activated . Both of their attacks met in the air and both of them fell down. Completely unaffected by Zhang Yang\u2019s stun effect, it opened its wide mouth and attacked Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dodge!\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang quickly turned to face the Frog King and landed an attack on it.</p><br/><p>\u2018-334!\u2019</p><br/><p>When the Frog King received Zhang Yang\u2019s attack, it croaked loudly and opened its mouth wide. A foul-smelled liquid came flying out and hit Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You have received the effect of Foul Poison (1 stack). Receiving 200 Nature Damage every 3 seconds for 15 seconds!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShit! It\u2019s strong!\u201d Zhang Yang had never expected the poison to be so powerful. It inflicted a strong DoT damage with just one stack! Zhang Yang could not imagine what would have happened to him if he received more stacks of the effect!</p><br/><p>The rest of the party quickly started their attack while Little Snow instantly casted a and chanted a healing spell.</p><br/><p>Just within a few hits, the Frog King spat another wad of poison, stacking another layer of DoT on Zhang Yang. In just half a minute, Zhang Yang had 5 layers of DoT effect, taking away 800 damage in just one tick.</p><br/><p>Luckily the DoT effect was capped at 5 stacks. If it was unlimited stack, Zhang Yang could literally die in just a few seconds.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Such an easy boss! Just a little while more before my finishing strike!\u201d Fatty Han laughed menacingly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Venomous Frog King has used !\u201d</p><br/><p>A dark reddish liquid spewed everywhere, hitting every one. Upon contact, their body glowed in a deep red color. Beneath their feet, there was a circle sized red mist measuring approximately 1 meter in diameter. A debuff icon appeared on everyone\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>[Contagious Poison]: You have been poisoned. Receiving 100 Nature Damage every 3 seconds for 15 seconds! This poison will spread and infect others. Damage is increased by 300% for every infection.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang understood the gravity of the situation and quickly called out. \u201cSpread out! Don\u2019t group together! Little brat! Go and fight behind the boss! Keep at least 2 meters away from me!\u201d</p><br/><p>His call was a little too late. Since Little Snow, Hundred Shots, and Fatty Han are ranged characters, they were all standing close to each other. When the landed on them, their poison infected each other, totaling up to 3 times infection and 900% increased damage.</p><br/><p>They had received 1000 damage every 3 seconds!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang and Drizzler had infected each other, receiving 2 times infections.</p><br/><p>Little Snow then frantically casted , followed by , , and regular healing spell. However, as everyone was losing HP at a tremendous speed, she could not keep up with the healing and died.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Slim and Handsome had died!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Hundred Shots had died!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Little Snow had died!\u2019</p><br/><p>Once the healer was down, Zhang Yang and Drizzler could not escape their imminent doom. They struggled to hang on for a few more seconds but eventually died after that.</p><br/><p>With no players left to attack it, the Frog King resetted, hopping back to its original spot and croaked. Whether it was a victorious warcry or an automated NPC behavioral pattern, no one would ever know.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

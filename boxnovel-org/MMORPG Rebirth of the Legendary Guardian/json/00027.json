You and your party have killed Black Claw. Obtained 24,050 EXP (50 points Party Bonus)!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWah, its finally over!\u201d Screams of joy filled the air, Sky Shaman smiled proudly as he saw 9 of his party members celebrating after defeating the first boss. Sky Shaman then switched to the guild channel and announced, \u201cHardcore Mode. First boss, Black Claw. Defeated!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah!\u201d the guild channel was filled with cheering.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of the master! The official China\u2019s number 1 tank! It hasn\u2019t even been a day and you have already conquered the first boss of Hardcore Mode!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. Our guild Sky High is really the strongest!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose guys from The Dominators must be crying by now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuildmaster bro, bring me along when you enter Hard Mode please! I\u2019m still wearing a lot of White-Wood equipment!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone in the guild was discussing and chatting passionately, and Sky Shaman could not help but smile proudly. He asked casually, \u201cHow are The Dominators doing over that side?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTheir elite team was wiped not longer than 5 minutes ago according to their members. They are still stuck at the first boss!\u201d said a Hunter with a longbow hanging on his back. A tag on his head stating, \u2018World Pursuer, Sky High\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well, we\u2019re one step ahead of them!\u201d Sky Shaman let out a smile. \u201cHowever, we mustn\u2019t let our guard down just yet! The Dominators has always been our archrival, which means they are strong! We must never stop improving ourselves! We must get the second and last boss to obtain the global announcement for our First Clear achievement and let everyone know that our guild, Sky High, is the strongest in every single game there is!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will get the First Clear server announcement for the China server! But we will not stop there! We must also get the World\u2019s Top 8 server announcement too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are the strongest!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurrah!\u201d</p><br/><p>4 of the team members were touched by Sky Shaman\u2019s speech, their faces flushed with excitement!</p><br/><p>\u201cServer Announcement: The party \u2018Lost Paradise\u2019 has successfully conquered the Bangar Crypt (Hardcore Mode), obtaining the First Clear server announcement (China Server)! Their names will be eternally etched in the Hardcore Mode First Clear Achievement Board!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cServer Announcement: Player Crimson Fire (Party Leader) has obtained the reward for being the first to clear (China Server) Bangar Crypt (Hardcore Mode)! Obtained system reward of 10 gold pieces, 1 Skill Point, and all races\u2019 reputation points increased by 500 points!</p><br/><p>\u201cServer Announcement: Player Zhan Yu (Party Member) has obtained the reward for being the first to clear (China Server) Bangar Crypt (Hardcore Mode)! Obtained system reward of 10 gold pieces, 1 Skill Point, and all races\u2019 reputation points increased by 500 points!</p><br/><p>\u201cServer announcement\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The server announcement channel began to flood with announcements.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!? Impossible!\u201d Sky Shaman\u2019s faced changed instantly. His legs went limp, almost to the point where he could fall down at any time.</p><br/><p>In his face! Right in his red, shameful face!</p><br/><p>At that moment, the entire guild channel turned dead silent.</p><br/><p>Once the Achievement Board was open, Lost Paradise\u2019s party name could be clearly seen.</p><br/><p>[Hardcore Mode First Clear Achievement] (China Server)</p><br/><p>1. Bangar Crypt</p><br/><p>First Clear Party: Lost Paradise.</p><br/><p>Party Leader: Crimson Fire, Bandit, Lost Paradise.</p><br/><p>Party Members: Zhan Yu, Guardian, No Affiliation.</p><br/><p>Ocean Despair, Sacred Knight, No Affiliation.</p><br/><p>Phantom Day, Berserker, Lost Paradise.</p><br/><p>Defiant Monk, Sniper, Lone Desert Smoke</p><br/><p>Hundred Shots, Beastmaster, No Affiliation.</p><br/><p>Slim and Handsome, Beastmaster, No Affiliation.</p><br/><p>Snowy Death, Bandit, No Affiliation.</p><br/><p>Flame Emperor, Pyromancer, Lost Paradise.</p><br/><p>Silky Snow, Priest, Lost Paradise.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuildmaster\u2026\u201d The 9 party member\u2019s face turned bitter as they looked at Sky Shaman. The First Clear achievement for Hardcore Mode had been claimed and therefore all of them lost their will to continue.</p><br/><p>As a guildmaster of a top-tier guild, Sky Shaman had a natural ability to judge and analyze a situation calmly. He began his analysis and said, \u201cThis party has 4 members from Lost Paradise. Even their party name is Lost Paradise. However, they have 5 non-affiliated members and a Hunter that belongs to another guild. If I guessed it right, this should be a pub party!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPub party? Master, can pubs even raid Hardcore Mode?\u201d asked the party members. If party that was comprised mostly of pubs could successfully conquer the Hardcore Mode, then what were the top-tier guilds\u2019 elite teams doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at the composition of the party. There is only one tank!\u201d Sky Shaman narrowed his sight, revealing a surprised and disbelieving expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s real! There is only one Guardian. The other Warriors are of the Berserker and Sacred Knight specializations!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sky Shaman took a deep breath and exhaled. He was a Guardian himself. He knew the boss\u2019 difficulty in the Hardcore Mode better than anyone else. Even the most recent Black Claw that they had just defeated could only be done because he and the other tank had been cooperating in other games, forming an unspoken bond between them. Only then were they able to solve the issue of the stacking that would normally cause entire parties to fail.</p><br/><p>But that party only had one Guardian. How did he endure the throughout the battle and survived?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not wrong, the secret to their success lies in that party\u2019s tank! Pursuer, try your best to obtain information on each member of this party, especially the Guardian, Zhan Yu!\u201d Sky Shaman\u2019s expression cleared and said, \u201cDisband the party. We have lost Bangar Crypt, but in the next dungeon, we will fight to regain our honor! In these coming days, I want all of you to keep to a strict training schedule! Even if you were able to, you are not to allow your names to be listed in the Level Ranking Board. I\u2019m giving all of you 7 days. After 7 days, all of you must reach Level 20. We will be the first guild to claim Marzerway\u2019s Lair!\u201d</p><br/><p>Somewhere else - The Dominators\u2019 raiding team.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, our brother in Sky High said that their elite team has defeated the first boss!\u201d said Circular Piglet hurriedly. It was not a strange thing, as both Sky High and The Dominators were rivals. They had always been at each other\u2019s throats in almost any other MMOs. They had always been fighting endlessly to be China\u2019s best guild. And now, their skirmishes had also brought them to \u2018God\u2019s Miracle\u201d.</p><br/><p>Humble Gentleman was calm. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t be so agitated. Being one step ahead doesn\u2019t assure a guaranteed victory. It\u2019s still going to be a battle to determine who would have the last laugh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey!\u201d Circular Piglet shyly scratched his head, \u201cIt is still not a good feeling to lose to them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t feel good losing to them, then get your sh*t together, you stupid swine! If it wasn\u2019t because of your careless mistake, we wouldn\u2019t have been completed wiped in the last fight now, would we?\u201d lectured Humbly Gentleman as he laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAw, come on boss. Don\u2019t remind me of my past mistakes. I\u2019d already apologized for that a hundred times. I thought there was an earthquake, and that\u2019s why I disconnected!\u201d explained Circular Piglet.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd? Was it really an earthquake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 it was my pet cat. It jumped on top of my head!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou stupid little pig. Remember! You\u2019re our tank. You\u2019re the wall that protects us! Before you are allowed to fall, you must always prevent the boss from attacking us at all costs! Understood?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm. If there really was an earthquake, you better stay strong. Do not worry about a tiny earthquake. If push comes to shove, I\u2019ll personally dig you out from your house!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was laughing at Humble Gentleman\u2019s joke. The atmosphere lightened up and no one felt depressed for losing the fight.</p><br/><p>\u201cServer Announcement: The party \u2018Lost Paradise\u2019 has successfully conquered the Bangar Crypt (Hardcore Mode), obtaining the First Clear server announcement (China Server)! Their names will be eternally etched in the Hardcore Mode First Clear Achievement Board!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cServer announcement\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The atmosphere turned silent!</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, who are these people? They actually managed to conquer Hardcore Mode!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it Sky High?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. These people do not belong to Sky High\u2019s elite team. Just look at the Achievement Board\u2026 Holy cow! Lost Paradise? From which hole did this low-tier guild dig out of?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince when was a low-tier guild this strong?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dominators guild channel was suddenly bursting with talks and discussion.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss\u2026\u201d Circular Piglet showed a bitter face. As if they had lost something that they did not even know, the members shared the same bitter expression. They were full of desire, trying to get their hands on the First Clear server announcement. But just when they were about to start their battle, the announcement was taken away from them. What else could they feel? To make matters worse, they lost to an unknown, low-tier guild!</p><br/><p>Shame! Such a huge shame!</p><br/><p>Humble Gentleman took a deep breath, laughing as he said, \u201cWell, at least it wasn\u2019t anyone from Sky High right? Think about it from their perspective. They thought they had the upper hand against us. Who knew they were only scooping water with a straw basket! They\u2019re surely feeling much more despair!\u201d</p><br/><p>Circular Piglet and the rest of them laughed, some of them sounded forced but at least it was better than the worst case scenario.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo a little background check on those people. Especially that warrior called Zhan Yu. To be able to endure Hardcore Mode bosses is no easy feat. He must be a pro among pros! Heh. To think that a person like this remains unaffiliated with any guild! Zhang Lan, go and make contact with him! Get him into our guild! Oh yeah, try and get the rest of the unaffiliated players from that party to join us as well. If they could survive that mode, they would naturally prove to be quite extraordinary themselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Similar reactions and conversations occurred simultaneously amongst the top-tier guilds throughout the entire China server.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Zhang Yang and the rest of the party were indulging in their own version of excitement.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You have obtained the title, Crypt Slaughterer!\u2019</p><br/><p>The titles themselves were useless, as they do not possess any addition to the Attributes nor provide any special effects. However, to have a rare title hanging over your head could attract quite some attention. The Crypt Slaughterer title could only be obtained by players who obtained the First Clear achievement. Naturally, it is extremely rare!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang turned off and disabled the friend request and stranger private messaging function to avoid being disturbed endlessly. After the excitement wore off, he would turn it back on again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe really did it!\u201d If the ever-calm Crimson Fire was filled with excitement, the others were already bursting from it.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang ran over to the back of Dadarerda\u2019s throne. He took out the pickaxe and started mining a glowing golden vein.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You have used on Plain Copper Vein. You have obtained Plain Copper Ore x3, Moonstone x2. Your Mining skill has increased by 2 points!\u201d</p><br/><p>This Plain Copper Vein will only spawn here in Hardcore Mode, after the death of Dadarerda!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang eyes glowed. Plain Copper Ore itself was already a rare vein and the Moonstone was part of the possible loot from mining the Plain Copper Vein. This is a rarity among rarities. Truly priceless!</p><br/><p>\u201cWah Zhan Yu bro. You\u2019re too mean. You could have at least left me one of those veins to mine! At least I could increase my skills!\u201d said Phantom Days as he walked over, laughing as he spoke. Fortunately, he did not see the items Zhang Yang had excavated, otherwise there would be a hard time for Zhang Yang to talk his way out.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed and shifted his attention to Fatty Han. \u201cFatty, time to loot the corpse and get our equipment!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

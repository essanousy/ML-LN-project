Yeah!\u201d A bunch of wolves started to cheer.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang shook his head and said, \u201cEven if she does put it on, you guys won\u2019t have a chance to see it. Can\u2019t you guys see that she is wearing a dress?\u201d</p><br/><p>The animals were disappointed when they heard it.</p><br/><p>Fatty Han straightened his collars and said, \u201cWell then, Fatty Bro must continue to work harder, I\u2019ll definitely loot a cloth armor top from the next boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, settle down. Let\u2019s move on to the last boss!\u201d Zhang Yang swung his sword around.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhan Yu! Now that I have a new weapon, my damage output will definitely not lose to you!\u201d Phantom Day said confidently.</p><br/><p>Weapons played a major role in increasing damage output. Phantom Day was using a Level 5 Black-Steel two-handed sword obtained from a Class Quest. Now that he had swapped it with a Level 10 Green-Copper two-handed spear, his attack power had increased significantly, as did his confidence!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang smiled a little and said, \u201cOkay! Let\u2019s fight for it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The party went forward and cleared the minions, finally arriving at the final boss after going through a small passageway.</p><br/><p>Before engaging, Phantom Day checked the damage statistics and felt down once again. Even though his damage output had surpassed Fatty Han, he was still immensely behind Zhang Yang, their difference a total landslide.</p><br/><p>If it compared damage done on single targets, Phantom Day would catch up and quite possibly even surpass Zhang Yang after equipping himself with the new weapon. However, facing waves of minions which led to there being multiple targets, Phantom Day who was without any AoE1 skills would still lose to Zhang Yang because of his .</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never thought that we could actually come this far!\u201d Crimson Fire exclaimed as they stood together facing the final boss. To think that 2 hours ago, he was still dying repeatedly at Hard Mode\u2019s first boss yet now here he stood before the final boss of Hardcore Mode.</p><br/><p>The passion to recruit Zhang Yang burned even stronger. Of course, he also wanted Fatty Han whose damage output was incredibly high. The best case scenario would be recruiting them both. Crimson Fire sent a private message to Silky Snow saying, \u201cHow are you doing? Do you think you could get a hold on Zhan Yu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat guy seems like he won\u2019t buy anything I try!\u201d Silky Snow replied quickly.</p><br/><p>Crimson Fire replied, \u201cI believe in you! You\u2019re our Lost Paradise\u2019s ultimate babe! As long as you put in more effort, even the strongest of steel will melt into cotton fluff.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, I\u2019ll need to be a honeypot again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad. This is just a game anyway, you don\u2019t even have to do the real deed! Give him a little bait to entice him, isn\u2019t that the best trick up your sleeve?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, let me put out my disclaimer first. I\u2019m all for baiting Zhan Yu, he\u2019s hot anyway. But that fatty is an eyesore, don\u2019t even try to ask me to do anything!\u201d said Silky Snow.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure. Do your best, you must bring Zhan Yu into our guild! You\u2019ve also seen what he can do! If he joined us, our Lost Paradise will surely be among the strongest guilds in \u2018God\u2019s Miracle\u2019! And when that happens, our sponsorship will increase by at least 10 folds!\u201d Crimson Fire was worried that Silky Snow would not give her best so he had quickly explained the stakes involved.</p><br/><p>\u201cI got it! He\u2019s sure to fall for me with just a flick of my fingers!\u201d said Silky Snow confidently.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThe final boss is a problematic one!\u201d Zhang Yang stopped at the entrance of the boss\u2019 field and hesitated. \u201cThis boss has two skills. There\u2019s one that spews fire which causes around 500 damage. Most players would be killed with just one strike! The other skill with the fire pits has its duration increased to 120 seconds. After 2 minutes into the battle, there will literally be no spots to stand on. The damage by the pits are around 200 points, you\u2019ll die quickly if you remain in there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dadarerda in Hardcore Mode had been dubbed one of the most frustrating bosses ever by players in his previous life! Due to the many fire pits in addition to the boss\u2019 flame spits, there would technically be nowhere to evade it. Death was certain, be it from or !</p><br/><p>The First Kill of this boss had only been achieved by a party which had depended on their level and equipment when its players had achieved an average of Level 30. That was how overwhelming the two skills were!</p><br/><p>However, somebody had discovered later on that there was a terrain bug in Hardcore Mode boss\u2019 field. The boss would not cast fire pits on that specific spot. With this, there was finally a possibility to defeat this boss provided one had reached a certain level of skill.</p><br/><p>Once the bug tactic was leaked, the boss became much easier to kill. The developers did not issue any penalty nor attempt to fix the terrain bug. Instead, they had recognized this tactic as a battle strategy. With regards to this issue, the developers had explained: When the boss was designed, they had \u2018slightly\u2019 underestimated the effect of , causing the boss to be overly strong. Since there were players who had discovered the bug tactic, even if it had violated the game\u2019s original intention, they would have to let bygone be bygones.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang knew very well that without the bug, the party\u2019s level and equipment would have never been enough to nuke the boss within 2 minutes! If they had not been able to do that, then they could only be burnt to their deaths by the fire pits!</p><br/><p>However, he could not think of an acceptable reason to reveal the method! \u201cI read it on the internet!\u201d seemed to be quite acceptable but how could it be possible to have found every single detail online!</p><br/><p>He then decided to have the party to first try it out normally before revealing the bug tactic.</p><br/><p>The party had killed two bosses in a row, thus all of them were bearing much confidence and were eager to take on this boss. They did not perceive the boss to be as difficult as they had thought of before.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang shook his head, thinking of how he would be nuked for once.</p><br/><p>\u201cSame old plan, kill the star-marked first followed by the sun-marked!\u201d Said Zhang Yang as he tagged the two monsters with the marks and dashed over with his sword.</p><br/><p>!</p><br/><p>\u2018-71!\u2019 Normal attack.</p><br/><p>\u2018-167!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018146!\u2019 .</p><br/><p>Dadarerda and its two guards rushed towards Zhang Yang growling. Within a short while, the field was filled with sounds of sword clashing.</p><br/><p>Everyone had nailed their teamwork, attacking the star-marked monster without waiting for Zhang Yang\u2019s instructions.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Dadarerda used . Lasts for 120 seconds!\u2019</p><br/><p>Dadarerda spread its arms. With a flash of red light, 10 blazing pits appeared and spread all over the field.</p><br/><p>The party swiftly moved, avoiding the pits and continuing their attacks on the star-marked target.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! The party you are in has killed a Royal Guard! Obtained 650 EXP (50 points Party Bonus)!\u2019</p><br/><p>The star-marked monster was nuked by the party in an instant.</p><br/><p>Dadarerda growled and a progress bar appeared on its head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Dadarerda has used !\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cPrepare to evade!\u201d said Zhang Yang as he pulled the sun-marked monster around Dadarerda.</p><br/><p>When the boss\u2019 had ended, the sun-marked monster only had less than 25% HP remaining \u2013 the team\u2019s damage power had indeed increased after Phantom Day had equipped a new weapon.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Dadarerda used . Lasts for 120 seconds!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! The party you are in has killed a Royal Guard! Obtained 650 EXP (50 points Party Bonus)!\u2019</p><br/><p>The party then focused their attacks on the boss once both guards had been defeated. With the boss\u2019 high HP of 84,000 though, their progress to bring it down was extremely slow.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Dadarerda used . Lasts for 120 seconds!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Dadarerda used . Lasts for 120 seconds!\u2019</p><br/><p>In just 1 minute, the entire field had a total of 60 s. When the boss had casted again, the entire party was a mess but since they had experience from both Normal and Hard Mode, they had somewhat managed to endure the chaos.</p><br/><p>By the time the number of s had reached 80, the number of surviving players started to drop and when the number of s reached 100, everyone had died except for Zhang Yang! Eventually, there were 120 s and the field was a sea of fire for as far as the eyes could see; nowhere was safe.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s skyrocketed confidence had plummeted back to their original state. How would one evade a sea of fire?</p><br/><p>If there were no boss, Zhang Yang might still be able to find his way out of the s. However, he had to dodge the boss\u2019 attacks and evade the s beneath his steps simultaneously. Even Zhang Yang could not pull off such a feat!</p><br/><p>Of course Zhang Yang had not intended to solo kill the Hardcore Mode boss, what he had wanted to do was to \u2018reasonably\u2019 stumble upon the terrain bug!</p><br/><p>He led the boss to move around with him and withdrew to a crack that could fit exactly one person! He stood at the crack and continued attacking the boss.</p><br/><p>Even though he was not damaged by , he could not evade properly as he was stuck in the crack and he died after receiving numerous attacks from the boss.</p><br/><p>The party, with their blind faith on Zhang Yang, had expected to witness another great counterattack of his solo fight with the boss. Seeing that he had actually failed and died, they were at a loss.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang released his body as he laughed, \u201cDid you guys really think that I could defeat the boss alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Reviving themselves, the party gathered again at the boss\u2019 field.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhan Yu, how about we call it a day?\u201d Even though Crimson Fire, too, had wanted to defeat the boss, as a guildmaster his judgement of a situation would certainly be better than everyone else! This boss was obviously still out of their league!</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree. Look at the sea of fire, there\u2019s literally no place for us to hide! The developers must not have wanted anyone to clear this boss!\u201d said Phantom Day as he nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>The others still had their faith in Zhang Yang but after Phantom Day\u2019s analysis, they could not help but agree.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother expert, it\u2019s already amazing that we could even set foot on this stage! Clearing one less boss only means fewer equipment. We\u2019ll defeat it together after getting stronger!\u201d said Snowy Death.</p><br/><p>The few of them had only wanted to raid Normal Mode at the beginning. After tagging along with Zhang Yang, they had actually managed to conquer Hard Mode and even cleared 2 bosses in Hardcore Mode! What more was there for them to ask for!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed and said, \u201cWhen I was pulling the boss around the place just now, I\u2019ve found a place where there isn\u2019t any fire pits. I think we can make our stand there and fight back!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

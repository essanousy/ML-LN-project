Zhang Yang felt grateful that he could learn a particular skill when he reached Level 30. was an active skill that reduced 75% of all incoming attacks for 10 seconds. Before that, he could only fight hoping lady luck was on his side!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang stopped thinking and shouted, \u201cLittle Snow, revive me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Snow suddenly had an epiphany. \u201cWow, I never knew the experience points could be so much when there\u2019s so few people standing! Hehehe\u2026 Maybe next time when the boss is almost down, I\u2019ll let you guys just die off again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey, hey. Isn\u2019t that a little too extreme?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Little Snow threw a playful wink at Zhang Yang as she chanted the reviving spell.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe deadliest housewife ever!\u201d Zhang Yang shook his head, disappointed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Drizzler retaliated just as she revived. Zhang Yang walked over to Drizzler and patted her timid little head. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t concern you, little brat. You\u2019re still very far away from being a housewife!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Snow, on the other hand, smiled sexily. \u201cHey, hey! This elder cousin is not a housewife!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sigh, she\u2019s not even close to being a pretty lady but how could she have the nerve to behave like a supermodel?!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang did not want to waste more time and quickly commanded, \u201cOpen the corpse!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh hah! Mine!\u201d Drizzler ran over and grabbed the chance to open the corpse.</p><br/><p>Fatty Han sadly lost all his chances to open the corpse ever since Drizzler and her cousin joined the party. This little brat collects all the gold coins first like she always do, and only then would she get the equipment.</p><br/><p>[Fiery Long Bow] (Green-Copper, Ranged Weapon)</p><br/><p>Weapon attack: 99-117</p><br/><p>Attack interval: 2.7 seconds</p><br/><p>DPS: 40</p><br/><p>Equip effect: Forged from the finest of flames, every attack will have a 5% chance to inflict additional 50-70 fire damage.</p><br/><p>Level requirement: 20</p><br/><p>\u201cGood hands, Drizzler! Very good indeed!\u201d Zhang Yang laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s an excellent piece of bow!\u201d Drizzler was still a young little girl; immature and playful. She got happy and excited after being praised.</p><br/><p>Hundred Shots, 79 points.</p><br/><p>Fatty Han, 77 points.</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty, I ain\u2019t holding back now!\u201d Hundred Shots swapped for the new equipment as soon as he obtained the weapon. Hundred Shots felt it was disgraceful to be lowest in damage output that tarnished his pride. He did not want people to think that he was dragging the team down!</p><br/><p>Fatty Han smiled and waved his hand, \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it! We\u2019re friends after all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang, being startled, forced himself to speak. \u201cSo far, our party composition doesn\u2019t make sense. If there\u2019s a Knight, Thief, or Spellcaster equipment, we\u2019d have no choice but to auction it out! We\u2019ll have to quickly set up another team, prioritizing class to not waste anymore equipment! With his 10-man party as a base, we can take on the Professional League. We can even take on the 10-man dungeon, or perhaps even the 20-man!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Burning Chest Plate] (Green-Copper, Leather Armor)</p><br/><p>Defense: +4</p><br/><p>Vitality: +22</p><br/><p>Strength: +4</p><br/><p>Dexterity: +14</p><br/><p>Level requirement: 20</p><br/><p>\u201cA Hunter\u2019s equipment again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty, you\u2019d better take this one. I\u2019ve already taken the bow!\u201d Hundred Shots smiled.</p><br/><p>Fatty Han took the equipment happily. A character\u2019s damage depended highly on the weapon; Hundred Shots\u2019 damage power increased to a certain degree after he obtained the new weapon. Fatty Han on the other hand needed a new armor as his HP was the lowest in the party.</p><br/><p>Drizzler just began to scold the boss\u2019 dead body, \u201cTch! Stingy boss. Talk so much but so little equipment. Ptui! I spit on your corpse!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa! Drizzler, the boss might remember this and get back at you the next time we fight it!\u201d Zhang Yang tried to frighten her, and it worked. What if they were to fight this boss again tomorrow and the boss called her \u201cflat\u201d a second time? What would she do then?!</p><br/><p>When everything has settled down, the door behind the dead boss\u2019 body opened automatically, revealing the pathway that led them to the last boss, Air Spirit Ains. Naturally, they cleared the minions along the way and reached the end. </p><br/><p>[Enraged Air Elemental] (Elite)</p><br/><p>Level: 23</p><br/><p>HP: 50,000</p><br/><p>Almost all elemental monsters had the same appearance, the only difference was their color. Water was blue, Earth was brown, Fire was red, and Air was white. The monsters on the pathway were little, having only three to four monsters. However, their numbers matched evenly with their HP; one monster\u2019s HP was just as high as the boss\u2019!</p><br/><p>\u201cListen, this kind of monster is often called as Tank Slayer. They\u2019re very strong!\u201d Zhang Yang unsheathed his sword. \u201cOk, here I go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang used and initiated the fight.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dodge!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Dodge!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Dodge!\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang moved around like a fish in the water. He evaded all the monster\u2019s attacks with ease; not a single attack landed on him. Seeing Zhang Yang not taking any damage, she pouted her lips and complained, \u201cHey! Why did you say they were Tank Slayers? They look like nothing but easy kills!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhang Yang decided to prank Drizzler and smiled evilly, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try and use .\u201d</p><br/><p>Drizzler wanted to prove him wrong so badly that she did not give a second thought. She used .</p><br/><p>\u2018-783!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-832!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Drizzler has died!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201c@#$%! You sneaky little noob tank! I swear we will never get along ever!\u201d Drizzler exploded in the party channel.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! I would say that you\u2019re an ant who thinks it can carry an elephant, but you\u2019ll only know it once you\u2019ve tried it!\u201d Zhang Yang justified his actions while at the same time slashing the monster.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard! You\u2019ll pay for this!\u201d Drizzler was both puffing with anger and sniffling in tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin! When the monster is left with 5% HP, let the noob tank die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, okay!\u201d Little Snow played along.</p><br/><p>Very soon, the monster\u2019s HP dropped down to 5%, and Little Snow stopped her healing on Zhang Yang and hummed a random song. However, a Guardian would not have any trouble dodging and nullifying attacks when faced with a physical attack monster. Besides, the monster was just an Elite; its attack were not as fast nor as deadly as a boss, making it extremely easy for Zhang Yang to evade them. The monster fell before he could even lose all his HP.</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft\u2026\u201d Zhang Yang held back his laughter. \u201cR-Revive her!\u201d he laughed.</p><br/><p>Drizzler got back up to her feet. She was obviously angry; flares were coming out from her nostril and she stared at Zhang Yang with such wide eyes that you could tell the iris apart from the sclera.</p><br/><p>As they continued to move on the pathway, they encountered more minions. They were strong, but Zhang Yang\u2019s party was not weak either. As troublesome as it may have seemed, the pathway had been cleared and they arrived at the boss\u2019 chamber 30 minutes later.</p><br/><p>[Air Spirit Ains] (Green-Copper)</p><br/><p>Level: 24</p><br/><p>HP: 144K</p><br/><p>The boss stood more than 20 meters tall. On its right hand, it was holding a heavy spear even taller than itself; it was weird it could still float so easily above ground. The battle would just be the same as the previous one; only the boss with no minions.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem!\u201d Zhang Yang cleared his throat loudly, signaling that it was time for his speech.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis boss is a physical attack type, and they are powerful! Its first skill is . This skill will be casted on the player with the highest aggro. One attack will deal about 1,500 damage, so Little Snow here will have to always make sure my HP has to exceed 1,200 HP. I will also try to reserve for this as the skill would only trouble the tank and healer.\u201d Zhang Yang paused. \u201cEveryone alright so far?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember this, the second and third skill is very important to everyone. As soon as the battle starts, the boss will cast out 10 gas bombs. These bombs are homing projectiles and explode upon contact, causing 1,200 magic damage to everyone. Now, the good thing is that these bombs are not so fast, so maneuvering away would be easy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIts third skill is probably the most bothersome one ever, . These summoned clouds will chase you at an incredible speed. Now, the clouds itself do not attack but once it\u2019s made contact with anyone, it will inflict a 10-second stun effect, proving enough time for the previous bombs to chase up to you!</p><br/><p>These clouds can be destroyed! They\u2019re about 5,000 HP; easily removed. That\u2019s why once the boss releases the little clouds, Fatty Han and Hundred Shots will have to shoot them down. You guys have to make sure they don\u2019t touch anyone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis battle is about speed and movement. You can\u2019t win this match solely by slouching and hitting the boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho! This is interesting. Let\u2019s give it a go!\u201d Drizzler was breathing heavily with excitement, eager to fight the boss.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s fight and get used to the tactics!\u201d The five of them walked into the battlefield together.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere I go!\u201d Zhang Yang initiated the battle with .</p><br/><p>\u201cTo see you standing here in this battle proves that all of you have the potential! But your fight ends here, for I will crush you personally!\u201d Air Spirit Ains swung its spear and furiously thrust it at Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dodged!\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang spread out. The boss\u2019 attack was fast, but as long as it was not a skill attack, he could still continue to evade the attacks.</p><br/><p>After equipping the new bow, Hundred Shots attacking power reached to that of Drizzler, surpassing even Fatty Han\u2019s attack power! Aside from Little Snow the Healer, everyone\u2019s attacking power was considered above average. In less than 10 minutes, the boss has lost 10% HP!</p><br/><p>\u201cDetestable pest! Die!\u201d Air Spirit Ains let out a loud growl, releasing ten of 1 meter wide white-colored gas sphere from his body. It slowly floated across the battlefield and started chasing everyone.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Air Spirit Ains has unleashed !\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHere come the bombs, guys! Mind your steps!\u201d Zhang Yang pulled the boss and started to shift his position away from the incoming .</p><br/><p>\u201cPuny mortal! I will crush you!\u201d A red light glimmered across the boss\u2019 body. It then raised its spear.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Air Spirit Ains has used !\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang\u2019s athletic was immediately triggered, activating in crucial moments.</p><br/><p>\u2018!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-117!\u2019 reflected damage.</p><br/><p>\u2018-234!\u2019 .</p><br/><p>\u201cNicely done!\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss\u2019 skill had a preemptive movement that indicated the attack. Even so, it only provided a tenth of a second\u2019s time for the player to activate to nullify the attack. This ability to grasp the short time to react is not for everyone! The four of them cheered in admiration.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys, be alert here! Don\u2019t just stand there and stare!\u201d Zhang Yang hurriedly reminded the team when he saw them gazing at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cStinking little pests! Let\u2019s have some fun!\u201d Air Spirit Ains stuck up his butt and let out several fist-sized clouds. These clumps of fart gases floated slowly up into the air and suddenly flew to Drizzler at a shocking speed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Air Spirit Ains has used !\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cEww\u2026\u201d Everyone but Zhang Yang frowned in disgust.</p><br/><p>This boss was really just putrid.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

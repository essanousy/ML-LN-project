You do not know how much I admire you!\u201d Snowy Death shouted in the party channel.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang said, \u201cDon\u2019t release your bodies yet. I'll be looting the corpse so that all of you can revive at the dungeon entrance after that to save time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d the crowd agreed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly Spirits Abracadabra, please give me the shield recipe!\u201d Zhang Yang rubbed his hands together and went towards the boss\u2019 corpse.</p><br/><p>[Resurrection] (Skill Book)</p><br/><p>Use: You will learn .</p><br/><p>Class Requirement: Sacred Knight, Priest.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow brother, you have the Lucky Hand!\u201d Phantom Day yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave a talk with the Sacred Knight, we must get our hands on this skill book!\u201d Crimson Fire quickly sent a private message to Silky Snow. would be extremely useful in dungeon raids, greatly reducing the time consumed to revive oneself and therefore boosting the efficiency of dungeon raids!</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Silky Snow replied and sent a private message to Ocean Despair, \u201cOcean, can you let me have this skill book first? I can pay you. How about 100 gold coins?\u201d</p><br/><p>After a while, Ocean Despair replied, \u201cI want to learn this skill too, let\u2019s roll together and see our luck!\u201d</p><br/><p>Silky Snow was in the middle of persuading Ocean Despair when Zhang Yang said, \u201cBoth healers roll for it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Silky Snow thought about it and decided to roll first. If her roll was higher then she could save herself the trouble of persuading a hard headed person. Even if she had rolled a lower number, it was still not too late to strike a deal with Ocean Despair.</p><br/><p>The rest of the party had passed, leaving both healers to roll.</p><br/><p>Silky Snow, 86 points.</p><br/><p>Ocean Despair, 91 points.</p><br/><p>The skill book immediately went into Ocean Despair\u2019s inventory. Without hesitation, he immediately patted the skill book on his body and gained the skill. Silky Snow had still wanted to private message him, but who could have guessed that Ocean Despair had acted so quickly?</p><br/><p>\u201cOcean, you can use your new skill to save them now. I\u2019ll continue to loot the corpse!\u201d Zhang Yang laughed and said.</p><br/><p>With a hum from Ocean Despair, he began chanting to resurrect the party members.</p><br/><p>[Smithing Recipe: Earthen Round Shield] (Smithing Recipe)</p><br/><p>Use: You will learn to smith Earthen Round Shield.</p><br/><p>Requirement: Beginner Smithing Skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Zhang Yang\u2019s eyes radiated and said, \u201cEveryone, I won\u2019t be courteous now!\u201d</p><br/><p>They had a deal previously, that if a smithing recipe dropped, it would be given to Zhang Yang. The entire party had passed on rolling and Zhang Yang patted the recipe on his body at once. A golden light flashed, adding Earthen Round Shield to the initially empty smithing list.</p><br/><p>[Earthen Round Shield] (Green-Copper, Shield)</p><br/><p>Defense: +40</p><br/><p>Vitality: +20</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 10</p><br/><p>Holy cow! The shield alone had provided 200 HP and 40 defense points. Even if the boss had high attack, it could reduce an ample amount of physical damage, significantly boosting one\u2019s survivability! Furthermore, most players only had White-Wood equipment now and they were definitely going to be unable to break past this 40 points of defense!</p><br/><p>\u201cBig bro Zhan Yu, post the shield description, let us witness its power too!\u201d Phantom Day could not help but ask when he saw Zhang Yang\u2019s foolish grin.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang smiled and posted the shield\u2019s description to the party channel.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, such high defense! I object! Objection! High dexterity and low strength classes like us Thieves would definitely be unable to break your defense with just normal attacks!\u201d Snowy Death was shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Zhan Yu, please smith a few more for us if you have enough materials. Our guild will buy them from you!\u201d Crimson Fire sent a private message to Zhang Yang. He could imagine that with tanks equipping this shield, their survivability would definitely be raised to another level!</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d His main purpose in obtaining this recipe was to sell the shields for money anyway, so Zhang Yang had agreed readily, \u201c500 gold coins each!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, you have no mercy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, your guild is so wealthy that a mere 500 gold coins is nothing for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Crimson Fire hesitated a while before saying, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll book one for now. Mail it to me via cash on delivery when you\u2019re done!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, pleased to be working with you, big boss!\u201d Zhang Yang laughed. The primary materials to smith this shield were [Iron Bar] and [Rare Copper Bar]. [Iron Bar] could made from [Iron Ore] which was worthless, while [Plain Copper Bar] came from [Plain Copper Ore] where a spawn point was available at the third boss. Each time Hardcore Mode Bangar Crypt was cleared, he could collect 2 to 4 Plain Copper Ores. Basically, he was doing a zero capital business!</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yang, hurry up and loot the corpse, I can\u2019t wait any longer!\u201d Fatty Han expressed his impatience.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed and extended his arm to loot again.</p><br/><p>[Shiny Silver Pendant] (Green-Copper, Necklace)</p><br/><p>Physical: +3</p><br/><p>Intelligent: +2</p><br/><p>Equipped Effect: Target receives an additional buff of each time a healing spell is casted. Shield disappears after absorbing 20 points damage or after 30 seconds. Shield effect cannot be stacked.</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 10</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! Even though the attributes are nothing much, there\u2019s a special effect!\u201d Phantom Day exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll necklaces and rings have special effects. That\u2019s why the drop rates are so low!\u201d Zhang Yang nodded and said, \u201cHealers, roll for it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ocean Despair and Silky Snow helped themselves and rolled, Ocean Despair winning the roll at the end.</p><br/><p>[Shadow Collar] (Green-Copper, Necklace)</p><br/><p>Vitality: +3</p><br/><p>Strength: +1</p><br/><p>Dexterity: +1</p><br/><p>Equipped Effect: Each attack on the target will inflict 1 stack of . When 3 stacks of are achieved, 20 points shadow damage will be inflicted onto the target.</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 10</p><br/><p>\u201cAll physical attack classes can roll for it. Let\u2019s roll together, no need to give it up to anyone. Let\u2019s see our luck!\u201d Zhang Yang said laughing as he rolled first.</p><br/><p>Those who had initially wanted to give up their rolls changed their decisions and tried their luck after hearing what Zhang Yang had said. Even if they could not get it, it was still for the fun of it.</p><br/><p>As a result, Zhang Yang overshadowed everyone with a mere 76-point roll.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, what sh*tty luck you guys have!\u201d Zhang Yang shook his head and equipped the necklace.</p><br/><p>[Archer\u2019s Ring] (Green-Copper, Ring)</p><br/><p>Vitality: +2</p><br/><p>Dexterity: +3</p><br/><p>Equipped Effect: Ranged attacks have a fixed rate of activating effect. Effect increases attack speed by10% for 10 seconds. This effect cannot be stacked.</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 10</p><br/><p>\u201cHunters, roll for it!\u201d Zhang Yang selected to pass.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah!\u201d Defiant Monk was very lucky to have rolled 100 points, instantly winning Hundred Shots and Fatty Han.</p><br/><p>[Amber Ring] (Green-Copper, Ring)</p><br/><p>Vitality: +3</p><br/><p>Strength: +1</p><br/><p>Equipped Effect: Each successful dodge of attack have a fixed rate of increasing 20 points Strength for 10 seconds. This effect cannot be stacked.</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 10</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, why is the trigger condition by dodging and not attacking?\u201d Phantom Day was angry. This effect would be useful in PK or solo grinding but for dungeon raids, he would have no chances of evading attacks as a damage dealer!</p><br/><p>\u201cFine if you don\u2019t want it!\u201d Zhang Yang laughed as he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho says I don\u2019t want it! Come on, let\u2019s roll!\u201d Phantom Day said quickly and tapped the roll button.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang was aware that he had gotten more than enough and decided to pass. The result was Crimson Fire winning the roll.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, guildmaster, you a thief class need dexterity, not strength! Don\u2019t snatch it from me!\u201d Phantom Day cried.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, more nonsense and I\u2019ll throw you out!\u201d Crimson Fire laughed as he said. Phantom Day immediately went speechless.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang looted again but there were only gold coins left. However, they had hauled 4 equipment, a skill book, and a recipe, it could already be considered as a jumbo loot!</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! You have received 10 silver coins after distribution!\u201d</p><br/><p>After every item was distributed, Momorermo\u2019s corpse too had disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, all done. Everyone can now go back to the capital and complete the quest. There should still be a Black-Steel equipment reward!\u201d Zhang Yang took a Teleportation Reagent from his inventory and asked Fatty Han, \u201cFatty, you have Teleportation Reagent?</p><br/><p>\u201cTeleportation Reagent? What is that?\u201d Fatty Han returned Zhang Yang a lost sheep expression.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang shook his head and traded a Teleportation Reagent over and said, \u201cThis will teleport you to the nearest friendly town, saves you the journey!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s such a thing?\u201d Fatty Han quickly confirmed the trade, \u201cLittle Yang, don\u2019t be so stingy, give me a few more!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, this thing costs 1 gold coin each! It\u2019s expensive!\u201d Despite his complaint, Zhang Yang had still traded a few more reagents with Fatty Han. He still had 20 plus gold coins anyway and Crimson Fire had still owed him 10 thousand more!</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Zhan Yu, why not reserve your dungeon entry tomorrow for our guild? I\u2019ll hire you, what do you think of 1000 gold coins per Hardcore Mode raid? And if the equipment looted are of use to you, you\u2019ll have the highest priority!\u201d Crimson Fire sent a private message to Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang pondered, leading dungeon raids would undoubtedly be a good way to earn a fortune. Not only could he get equipment, he could also earn lots of gold coins! It would only be for now though. When he had finally established his own guild, he would not need to work for others anymore!</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, tomorrow morning at 9 am. We\u2019ll gather at the dungeon entrance!\u201d Zhang Yang quickly sent back a private message, \u201cBut I want to reserve an attacker spot for Fatty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDeal! See you tomorrow!\u201d Crimson Fire agreed readily.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, please approve as friend!\u201d said Snowy Death as he sent a friend request.</p><br/><p>Snowy Death had acted as a prompt for the rest of the party and they too had sent friend requests to Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang smiled and approved each friend request. Ripping Teleportation Reagent, a magic circle glowing with a white light appeared under his feet. With that, he quit the party and said, \u201cGoodbye everyone, see you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, bye!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSee you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Teleportation Reagent was overly expensive, the others were not willing to spend it. Other than Fatty Han who had also torn one of the reagents, the rest of the party members went by foot.</p><br/><p>10 seconds later, the magic circle was formed completely and a white light enveloped Zhang Yang. With a flash, the white light dissipated and Zhang Yang had appeared in the portal of White Jade Castle.</p><br/><p>Another white light flashed and Fatty Han too had appeared next to Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yang, since when did you become so powerful?\u201d Fatty Han had been Zhang Yang\u2019s buddy but his outstanding performance made him felt like Zhang Yang was a complete stranger.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince when was I not outstanding?\u201d Zhang Yang laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d Fatty Han booed but did not ask further. Regardless of what had happened, Zhang Yang would always be his brother and that was enough for him!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

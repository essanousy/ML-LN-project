We\u2019ve all experienced it now, surely we\u2019ll last longer!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang gave a slight smile and said, \u201cLet me try!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTry your ass! Do you think you\u2019re God, that you can solo kill a boss?\u201d Prideful Precepts scolded. \u201cI\u2019ll kowtow to you thrice and call you grandfather every single time I see you if you could solo kill it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! I\u2019m not that blessed to be your grandfather, I don\u2019t want to die of being infuriated by you!\u201d Zhang Yang avoided the boss\u2019 attacks agilely while delivering substantial damage to it. Technically, his damaging power was the highest in the team anyway. If he were to do it alone, it would only prolong the battle duration by 2 to 3 times more.</p><br/><p>\u201cNoob tank! Don\u2019t waste any more of our time okay?\u201d Floral Shorts joined in. \u201cEach minute you take to fight it while 9 of us lay here is equivalent to 9 minutes wasted. You can\u2019t possibly compensate us for the time lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Don\u2019t assume you represent all of us!\u201d yelled Snowy Death. \u201cI have full confidence in our Guardian. I don\u2019t mind laying here for a while! If you\u2019re afraid of wasting time, you can always resurrect yourself immediately!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also have no problems laying here for a little while more!\u201d Hundred Shots, too, had expressed his support for Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cBunch of motherf*ckers!\u201d Kindling Chest Hair could only cuss lowly.</p><br/><p>Even though the Pride Quad kept throwing insults, none of them had released their bodies! In \u2018God\u2019s Miracle\u2019, if you had released your body before a dungeon raid ended, you would not be able to resurrect to rejoin the dungeon as well and you would also be forgoing your ability to participate in the roll for battle loot.</p><br/><p>Whatever had been going on in their minds, even though the Pride Quad had no faith in Zhang Yang\u2019s ability to solo kill the boss, none of them had released their bodies, fearing the possibility of an upset! That said, even if they had released their bodies, they could not reenter the dungeon, so they might as well lay back and watch!</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Dadarerda used . Lasts for 60 seconds!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Dadarerda used . Lasts for 60 seconds!\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, the field had achieved the maximum number of fire pits. With 60 on the field, it was a sight to behold! The field was fully enveloped in bright, fiery light! The pits had covered almost half of the entire landscape in such a huge cave!</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Dadarerba used !\u201d</p><br/><p>Dadarerda began to spit fire again.</p><br/><p>After had reached its maximum number of uses in the field, became the biggest threat, forcing the player to move around. The current field filled with lava pits would have been the worst scenario for the players!</p><br/><p>Only one-third of Zhang Yang\u2019s athleticism was required to cope with the current situation. This was just a joke for him. If this situation had required his full capabilities, how could he aim to clear Difficult and Hardcore Mode later on?</p><br/><p>Dadarerba\u2019s HP dropped consistently, decreasing from 91% to 66% after 3 minutes!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang\u2019s HP had remained a solid 100%, moving at a comfortable pace in his evasion of the boss\u2019 attacks. He then swung his sword, chopping away at the boss\u2019 HP.</p><br/><p>\u201cPro! A real pro!\u201d Everyone stared in disbelief.</p><br/><p>Though they had already known of Zhang Yang\u2019s exceptional skills, nobody had any idea how high his standard was! With the scene in front of them then, they clearly understood a pro\u2019s realm!</p><br/><p>Solo kill a boss!</p><br/><p>This dude could totally solo kill a boss!</p><br/><p>No! Not only this boss, he could completely raid this entire Normal Mode Bangar Crypt dungeon on his own! The only difference would be that a party would take approximately 1 hour while he would have taken 3 hours!</p><br/><p>Was this dude even human?</p><br/><p>Flame Emperor immediately searched for a name on his Friend List and sent a private message and said, \u201cGuild Leader, I have something to tell you!\u201d</p><br/><p>A reply came back soon after, \u201cIs it important? I\u2019m in the middle of Difficult Mode Bangar Crypt party raid!\u201d</p><br/><p>Flame Emperor turned on the recorder and filmed Zhang Yang fighting the boss. He then sent the recording over and said, \u201cLeader, this is of utmost importance! You must see the video I\u2019d just sent you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you little rascal. You wouldn\u2019t be sending me another porno right?\u201d The other side replied instantly, either he had killed the boss or they were completely wiped out.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuild Leader\u2026\u201d Flame Emperor expressed his innocence.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d The player on the other end turned on his voice chat, his surprised tone could clearly be heard, \u201cHey! Quiet for a second, I\u2019m talking to Flame here!\u201d He paused for a moment and asked, \u201cFlame, what\u2019s the man\u2019s IGN?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZhan Yu!\u201d Flame Emperor turned off the party channel and began voice chatting with his leader.</p><br/><p>\u201cExtraordinary! He never got hit once. There are so many pits on the ground yet never once did he step on them! Pro, an absolute pro! Even if this was only Normal Mode, it\u2019s still very impressive! When we did it previously, we actually got wiped out twice by this third boss and had only managed to clear it on the third try!\u201d The person on the other end of the line kept quiet for a while and said, \u201cThis player, he\u2019s not in a guild?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have called you!\u201d Flame Emperor replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cTry to approach him later, ask him if he\u2019s interested to join our Lost Paradise, I\u2019ll loosen the conditions a little! Hmm, give him an Officer position and a spot in our guild\u2019s first explorers team!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I got it! Oh right! Leader, he told us that he\u2019ll clear Difficult Mode with us later. Would you like to join us?\u201d said Flame Emperor.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026 I\u2019ve yet to clear the first boss here so I haven\u2019t used any of my entrance counts. Basically, I could still join you guys! Right, isn\u2019t your party full already?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are 4 shitty Pride members here, we\u2019ll kick them out after clearing Normal Mode!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, reserve 4 spots for us from Zhan Yu. I\u2019ll bring Sky and the rest to join you guys! Hold up about recruiting him, let me talk to him personally when I\u2019ve come over!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure!\u201d Flame Emperor agreed simply.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Dadarerda\u2019s HP had dropped to 21% yet Zhang Yang still had his HP untouched! At this point, no one had any doubts, Zhang Yang could totally solo kill the boss!</p><br/><p>\u201c15%!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c10%!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c7%!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c4%!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c3%!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c2%!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c1%!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! The party you are in has killed Dadarerda! Obtained 42,050 EXP (50 points Party Bonus)!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang had obtained all the EXP since dead characters could not be awarded with any EXP. This had exponentially increased his EXP bar so much that one could visually witness the surge.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe did it! He really did it!\u201d The other 9 players mumbled to themselves as if they were dreaming.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo resurrect yourselves! I\u2019ll wait for you guys to loot the corpse!\u201d Zhang Yang said grinning.</p><br/><p>Prideful Precepts though, had interpreted Zhang Yang\u2019s intention with a crooked point of view and said, \u201cLoot now! We\u2019ll resurrect after equipment distribution. We can just revive at the entrance, no need to run all the way here!\u201d</p><br/><p>If drops were looted amidst resurrection, players outside of the dungeon would not be able to roll for the loot.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang smiled and crouched to touch the corpse.</p><br/><p>[Heavy Hammer] (Black-Steel, One-handed Hammer)</p><br/><p>Magic Attack: 8 \u2013 12</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 5</p><br/><p>[Lord\u2019s Hat] (Black-Steel, Leather Armor)</p><br/><p>Defense: +2</p><br/><p>Vitality: +3</p><br/><p>Dexterity: +1</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 5</p><br/><p>[Linen Pants] (Black-Steel, Cloth Armor)</p><br/><p>Defense: +1</p><br/><p>Vitality: +2</p><br/><p>Intelligence: +1</p><br/><p>Spirit: +1</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 5</p><br/><p>The party began rolling and Ocean Despair had managed to get the Heavy Hammer, while Snowy Death had obtained Lord\u2019s Hat, and finally Flame Emperor had gotten Linen Pants. None of the Pride Quad had obtained anything!</p><br/><p>This obviously made everyone happy, smiles etched on their faces except the Pride members whose expressions were awful. They then released their bodies and resurrected themselves at the spawn point.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, we shall challenge Difficult Mode after reviving. If anyone has anything else to do, you can leave!\u201d said Zhang Yang casually. He actually had not much care for Difficult Mode\u2019s equipment but this party\u2019s current equipment was too basic. It would be extremely tough for them in Hardcore Mode if they did not loot some proper equipment from Difficult Mode.</p><br/><p>The Pride Quad\u2019s eyes lighted up thinking about Level 10 Black-Steel equipment dropped in Difficult Mode! In comparison, Normal Mode\u2019s drops had been complete trash!</p><br/><p>The party was quiet, no one had any indication of leaving.</p><br/><p>\u201cPride members, you guys can leave yourselves!\u201d Zhang Yang said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do we have to leave?\u201d Kindling Chest Hair immediately shouted. Zhang Yang was obviously a pro player. As long as they followed him around, they would definitely have access to good equipment!</p><br/><p>\u201cNo reason, I just don\u2019t like your faces!\u201d Zhang Yang kicked them all out without further ado.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Add us back now or else I\u2019ll kill you every time I see you! I\u2019ll make sure to kill you back to Level 0!\u201d Prideful Precepts had sent Zhang Yang a private message instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, we\u2019ve done you a favor by taking you in back then. You can\u2019t just kick us out like that right?\u201d Floral Shorts tried to guilt trip Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang did not waste any effort talking to them, immediately blacklisting the Pride Quad. From now on, he would not be receiving any more private messages from them.</p><br/><p>He opened the Character Search Window and tried searching for \u201cSlim and Handsome\u201d to see if Fatty Han had connected. Coincidentally, the result had shown that his character was online. Zhang Yang hurriedly sent a private message saying, \u201cFatty Shit, I\u2019m Zhang Yang!\u201d Attached along with the message was a friend request.</p><br/><p>Instantly, the request was approved and Fatty Han sent back a reply, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve just slept for about 2 hours and you\u2019ve already reached Level 10?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang scoffed and said, \u201cEnough chit chat, go complete the pre-requisite quest for Bangar Crypt dungeon quickly! Big brother here will bring you to raid Difficult Mode!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yang, you\u2019d better not forget that you were born 2 months later than your Fatty Big Bro!\u201d Fatty Han refuted and said, \u201cAlright! I\u2019ll go do the quest now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPro, now that we\u2019re short of 4 players, I have some guild members who would like to join, let me invite them over, is that alright?\u201d Flame Emperor asked in a private message to Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang thought for a while and said, \u201cI have a friend joining, he\u2019s doing the pre-requisite quest now so you can only invite 3 players!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure!\u201d Flame Emperor gladly replied.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang passed over the Party Leader position to Flame Emperor and without much delay, he had added 3 players into the party.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Player Crimson Fire has joined the party!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Player Phantom Day has joined the party!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Player Silky Snow has joined the party!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

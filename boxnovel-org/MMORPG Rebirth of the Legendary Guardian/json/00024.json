They had not lost anyone as of yet! If it had been another party, they would have been disoriented by the chaotic situation, and would have repeatedly wiped out for several times now!</p><br/><p>\u201cDespicable mortals! Babarerba has underestimated you, Babarerba will be serious now!\u201d As its HP fell to 25%, Babarerba began its third summon, \u201cCome forth demon from the depth of the abyss\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The hexagram magic circle flashed again, and a sensual woman appeared beside Babarerba. It had two long horns on the top of its head and a long tail behind its back. It\u2019s hand was holding a whip, and its legs were a pair of hoofs!</p><br/><p>Its outfit was exceptionally skimpy, its upper body was only covered by a small leopard-skinned bra, revealing most of its skin while its lower body was cladded in a lace mini skirt. Truly a seductive feast for one\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>[Alice, Babarerba\u2019s Demon Puppet] (Elite)</p><br/><p>Level: 13</p><br/><p>HP: 6,000</p><br/><p>Succubus, a demon ranked higher than the imp and floating demon but considering the fact that it was brought in as a summoned puppet in this dungeon, it did not have any specific skill set.</p><br/><p>\u201cSlap!\u201d Alice struck with its whip, its hips swaying as she posed lewdly, \u201cMm\u2026 My dear master, you\u2019ve summoned Alice, do you wish to do something naughty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck me, is this for real?\u201d Fatty Han wiped his saliva, \u201cLittle Yang, can I get her as a pet? Just seeing her beside me every day will definitely boost my mood a hundred fold!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed and said, \u201cChange your class to Priest or Spellcaster and you might have a chance to get the Summoner Inheritance when the Inheritance Patch is launched. You\u2019d then be able to summon a variety of demons, including this succubus!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty Han looked longingly at Alice with heart-shaped eyes and finally said unwillingly, \u201cFine! I\u2019ll remain a Hunter, a class with a confirmed future!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZhan Yu, my blue pot is out!\u201d said Silky Snow.</p><br/><p>Ocean Despair followed, \u201cI can probably heal another 2 more times!\u201d</p><br/><p>Truthfully, it had been lucky that the 2 of them had held up till now! In a dungeon raid, a tank would usually receive most of the healing. However, since Zhang Yang had an exceptionally high damage evasion capability, he basically had not drained any of the healers\u2019 MP. That was why these two could manage to hold on till now! Otherwise, if they were to heal another tank with their current equipment configuration, they would have depleted their MP much earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cHealers ran out of blue pots. Everyone get ready with your own red pots, don\u2019t be stingy on those! Move even faster if you\u2019re cursed with , don\u2019t wait for my reminder!\u201d said Zhang Yang in the party channel.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoger!\u201d</p><br/><p>The players attacked with all their might since the healers had completely exhausted their blue pots. The boss would never stop casting just because they had no more blue pots. If the fight dragged on, they would all be annihilated!</p><br/><p>22%, 19%, 16%!</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Snowy Death has died!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Defiant Monk has died!\u2019</p><br/><p>The boss had casted again. Since Snowy Death and Defiant Monk only had 200 HP left and their red pots were still on cooldown, they died from the curse after taking just 2 steps despite reacting in time.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep up with the attacks!\u201d Zhang Yang\u2019s sword slashed. He was evading 4 monsters\u2019 attacks while dealing significant damage at the same time, \u201cSilky, Ocean! Come to the melee range!\u201d</p><br/><p>Silky Snow and Ocean Despair were confused yet they did not hesitate and immediately ran to the boss\u2019 side. They had nothing to do anyway, so they took out their weapons and began attacking the boss, dealing a stream of \u2018-1\u2019 attacks.</p><br/><p>14%, 11%, 9%!</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Silky Snow has died!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Flame Emperor has died!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cPhantom Day and Crimson Fire are the main DPS. And they\u2019re the only two players at melee position. If no one came to fill the space up, they will definitely be nuked!\u201d Zhang Yang casually explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, Little Yang, how could you be so sly! You sacrificed our lovely Silky just like that?\u201d Fatty Han complained in Silky Snow\u2019s stead while checking out her body lying on the floor, cussing in his heart that her skirt could have been lifted higher so he could peek more clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy that I could at least be of use till the end!\u201d Silky Snow sent a smiley face in the party channel.</p><br/><p>Fatty Han teased immediately, \u201cLovely Silky! I\u2019ve been in love with you all along! You\u2019ve better not have a change of heart and fall for Little Yang! Let Fatty Bro tell you, that guy could go 3 months without showering even once. You can smell his foul odor even from 3 kilometers away!\u201d</p><br/><p>Silky Snow smiled bashfully and ignored Fatty Han.</p><br/><p>7%, 6%, 4%!</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Crimson Fire has died!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Hundred Shots has died!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on, almost there!\u201d the fallen players cried, thinking if it would be a close call just like the battle against Black Claw.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang thought and said, \u201cOcean, you move to the ranged position!\u201d 3 of them were in melee position right now while Fatty Han was the only one in a ranged position. If there was no adjustment, Fatty Han would definitely die! Fatty Han was currently the second highest DPS output and Zhang Yang needed him to survive until the end. He could only depend on luck now to see who the boss would target!</p><br/><p>3%! 2%!</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Phantom Day has died!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Ocean Despair has died!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Everyone cheered when the boss had targeted Ocean Despair instead of Fatty Han, making Ocean Despair feel miserable. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I had offended any of you. Do you guys have to be so happy about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>1%!</p><br/><p>0%!</p><br/><p>With the last drop of HP drained, Babarerba fell with a shriek.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! The party you are in has killed Babarerba! Obtained 39,050 EXP (50 points Party Bonus)!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWe did it! We did it again!\u201d the party applauded endlessly. Before this, who would have thought that a pub party like theirs could take out 2 bosses in a row as though it was a piece of cake!</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, so much EXP!\u201d Fatty Han exclaimed.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang brandished his sword to continue dealing damage to the 3 remaining demons and said indifferently, \u201cIf you had died, I would have gained more EXP!\u201d He paused and said, \u201cEveryone don\u2019t release your bodies yet, there should be an achievement!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty Han ordered his pet to attack while drawing his bow and asked, \u201cLittle Yang, what achievement?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSome superficial shit, it\u2019s just to show off what you have accomplished without actually rewarding anything!\u201d Zhang Yang replied casually.</p><br/><p>Even though all 3 demon puppets had 6,000 HP each, they still did not last long under the combined attacks of Zhang Yang and Fatty Han. Quickly, they died one by one.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You have obtained the achievement, I Can 1V4!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this stuff?\u201d Fatty Han said.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang explained, \u201cThis Achievement System is usually available in Hardcore Mode dungeons and it\u2019s usually used to encourage a more difficult killing method. For example, we\u2019ve completely ignored the summoned puppets and only targeted the boss. The system has identified this as a harder method and rewarded us with this achievement title!\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did everyone understand. However, what they knew better was the fact that they could not have gotten their hands on this achievement if it were not for Zhang Yang\u2019s capabilities! Why couldn\u2019t their equipment be better to allow them to kill the boss normally?</p><br/><p>\u201cRevive yourselves!\u201d</p><br/><p>8 of them released their bodies. While running back they asked, \u201cZhan Yu, are there any other achievements outside of the dungeons?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are, and many more so. You probably couldn\u2019t obtain all of them even after playing for 10 years!\u201d Zhang Yang organized his thoughts and said, \u201cFor example, if you get killed by the same person for 100 times, you\u2019ll get an achievement called \u2018I Hate You\u2019! If you get killed 1,000 times by the same person, you\u2019ll get \u2018I Hate You to the Core\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When everyone had returned from resurrection, Zhang Yang told Fatty Han, \u201cGo loot the corpse!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty Han had been waiting impatiently, this was the moment he had been waiting for after such a long battle with the boss!</p><br/><p>\u201cBehold! Fatty Bro\u2019s big Lucky Hand!\u201d Fatty Han extended his fat hand towards the boss\u2019 corpse.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Han, wash that hand first!\u201d Snowy Death shouted.</p><br/><p>[Lightning Spear] (Green-Copper, Two-handed Spear)</p><br/><p>Weapon Attack: 85 \u2013 113</p><br/><p>Attack Interval: 3.8 seconds</p><br/><p>DPS: 26</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 10</p><br/><p>\u201cG-good stuff!\u201d Phantom Day began to drool, his eyes radiating desire.</p><br/><p>Aside from him, the rest of the party had automatically passed. The equipment went straight into Phantom Day\u2019s inventory.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you everyone, thank you!\u201d Phantom Day equipped the spear at once, bowing in appreciation to everyone, \u201cEspecially Big Bro Zhan Yu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty Han got angry and said, \u201cPhantom Day, I was the one who\u2019d looted the corpse! Why didn\u2019t you thank me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you Fatty Bro!\u201d Phantom Day was slaphappy with euphoria, quickly bowing to Fatty and causing everyone to laugh.</p><br/><p>[Heavy Boots] (Green-Copper, Heavy Armor)</p><br/><p>Defense: +6</p><br/><p>Vitality: +5</p><br/><p>Strength: +4</p><br/><p>Dexterity: +1</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 10</p><br/><p>\u2018Sha\u2019, the moment the Roll-the-Dice window appeared, 9 of them passed, giving Zhang Yang an unconditional win on the equipment dropped.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you everyone!\u201d Zhang Yang courteously thanked the party and equipped the boots. His character\u2019s attributes increased immediately.</p><br/><p>HP: 520, Strength: 70, Armor: 31, Attack Damage: 86 \u2013 94.</p><br/><p>[Babarerba\u2019s Secretly Stashed Succubus Mini Skirt] (Green-Copper, Cloth Armor)</p><br/><p>Armor: +2</p><br/><p>Vitality: +10</p><br/><p>Intelligent: +7</p><br/><p>Spirit: +3</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 10</p><br/><p>Once this equipment came up, everyone was dumbfounded. All of them had clearly remembered it to be the same mini skirt the succubus had been wearing just now. If a female player were to wear it\u2026 that would definitely cause nosebleeds!</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, that boss was too depraved! Despicable!\u201d Fatty Han claimed, full of righteousness. Despite saying that, his eyes went back and forth between the skirt and Silky Snow, not bothering to hide his own lustful intentions!</p><br/><p>\u201cTogether. we request this equipment to be given to Silky babe!\u201d Snowy Death yelled.</p><br/><p>Only 2 players were able to equip cloth armor \u2013 Silky Snow and Flame Emperor. As long as Flame Emperor passed, the equipment would belong to Silky Snow.</p><br/><p>Flame Emperor laughed and unhesitatingly chose to pass. Since they were both from the same guild, it would belong to the same stash no matter who had it. Moreover, he was a male character. Wearing a skirt would be too much for the eyes to take in. He would have never dared to wear something like that, unless it were Celestial equipment.</p><br/><p>Silky Snow\u2019s face flushed with embarrassment.</p><br/><p>Translator Note</p><br/><p>1 Pub party is a gaming community lingo for public party. These are parties formed by recruiting players in public, and their efficiency can be quite inconsistent, since more experienced players would normally choose to venture into dungeons or quests with pre-made parties with their guild members or own social circles. For achievement-related objectives like First Clear and Speedruns, players would generally choose to avoid pub parties due to their unreliability.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Here we come!</p><br/><p>Translator: Editor:</p><br/><p>After clearing both Front Wing and the Middle Wing dungeons, Zhang Yang and his party gathered in front of the last dungeon.</p><br/><p>After 5 minutes or so, the second team led by Hundred Shots came out, followed by Fatty Han\u2019s team, and the last team was Ironhill\u2019s. In this small dungeon, the performance of the tank will determine the success of the team. That is why even though Ironhill\u2019s team had a strong supporter like Little Snow, it would be useless since their team\u2019s tank was not strong enough.</p><br/><p>\u201cI assume by now everyone fully understands the boss\u2019 mechanics.\u201d Zhang Yang asked. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, go and complete the quest and let\u2019s go to the Main Wing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWoohoo! Equipment!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst Clear!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s morale was high as they marched into the Main Wing with high spirits.</p><br/><p>The dungeon was set in a palace, and Zhang Yang with his party were standing in the center of a huge courtyard. Ahead of them was the palace\u2019s Main Wing and it was there Marzerway resided!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang cleared his throat, signaling the starting of his speech.</p><br/><p>\u201c*Ahem* I\u2019ll now explain the strategy to fight. This boss has a total of 5 stages. At the first stage, he will take the form of the Water Spirit and had all of the Water Spirit boss\u2019 skill. In this stage, it is important to interrupt its skill casting. Hundred Shots, Comet Tears and Big Ben, you guys are the first team to fire the first volley of , the second volley team will be Fatty Han, Iron Heart and Burnt Snow. One more thing, always be on alert to evade the !\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second stage\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang paused immediately and smiled. \u201cYou know what? Let\u2019s just focus on practicing at the first stage!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk! Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>The party went forward until they could finally see Marzerway\u2019s own body.</p><br/><p>From the looks of it, he seemed like a middle-aged man no older than thirty. A deep purplish red robe adorned his slim and tall body, having a sort of an appearance of a well-studied philosopher, and he held a long wooden staff on his left hand. With the way he portrayed himself, he did not give off the vibe of a mass-murderer.</p><br/><p>[Marzerway the Fallen]</p><br/><p>Level: 25</p><br/><p>HP: 1,000,000</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam 1 move to the North! Team 2 take the East! Team 3, South! Team 4, attack from the West! Once you have arrived at your position, we will begin the attack!\u201d said Zhang Yang as he dashed toward the boss.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpudent fools, you dare to disturb my rest! Weaklings that seek death, I shall grant you your wish! Hmm\u2026 hmm\u2026With the power of water alone, I shall cleanse you off this earth!\u201d Marzerway started its attack.</p><br/><p>Once Zhang Yang and Marzerway\u2019s distance were close enough, Zhang Yang activated , followed by a normal attack and .</p><br/><p>\u2018-332!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Immune!\u2019</p><br/><p>With that alone, Zhang Yang gained important information, learning that it had immunity against along with having 100 Defense value.</p><br/><p>Still, Marzerway\u2019s aggro was on Zhang Yang, and he raised his staff to smack him.</p><br/><p>As a magic-based boss, Marzerway\u2019s attack speed was slow enough that Zhang Yang could evade it whenever he wanted to! But he did not, and instead took a full hit to understand how strong the boss\u2019 physical attack was. As Sun Tzu explained in his Art of War, \u2018know your enemy and yourself and you\u2019ll win a hundred war\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u2018-448!\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang took damage without any resistance. He never had thought that a magic based boss would have such high physical attack. Marzerway was truly strong!</p><br/><p>With that, Zhang Yang gained 30 Rage.</p><br/><p>\u2018!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-141!\u2019 damage.</p><br/><p>\u2018-714!\u2019 .</p><br/><p>To counter a high defense boss, Zhang Yang first prioritized stacking to maximize the party\u2019s damage output.</p><br/><p>Once the boss\u2019 defense was reduced by 50%, the party began to deal higher damage.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeak little humans, I will freeze you \u2018til the depth of your soul!\u201d Marzerway stopped his physical attacks and started to cast a spell.</p><br/><p>Pew!</p><br/><p>After 3 second casting, Marzerway fired an ice arrow and hit Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>\u2018-1200!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell! Why would his attacks be much stronger than the 5-man dungeon boss Water Spirit?!\u201d After fighting the element spirits for several days, Little Snow had a better understanding to all skill damages as a healer.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. This is a 20-man dungeon, of course the attack will be higher!\u201d said Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>Even though this boss was much stronger than the Hardcore bosses, Zhang Yang was able to fight with lesser stress as the team had 4 healers. The healing load was shared among them and it lessened the burden on Little Snow.</p><br/><p>99%, 98%, 97%...</p><br/><p>The boss\u2019 HP was just too much. Even with 20 players attacking constantly, the HP reduction rate was the slowest he had ever seen!</p><br/><p>\u201cSlumber in eternal winter!\u201d Marzerway cried out as he spread out his arms, casting 8 visible rings of ice onto the battle field.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Marzerway has used !\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cPay attention to the floor! Move away if there\u2019s an ice ring!\u201d Zhang Yang could only scream to remind the party, not having all day to supervise one by one.</p><br/><p>3 seconds after the skill had been activated, 8 icy orbs formed.</p><br/><p>\u2018-2500!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-2500!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Four Hairs has died!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Player Golden Big Ben has died!\u2019</p><br/><p>Crap! Two down!</p><br/><p>Holding in his anger, Zhang Yang asked. \u201cHow did you two die?! Didn\u2019t I tell you all to be careful of the rings?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, boss. I was completely immersed in attacking!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang shook his head angrily. He wanted to unleash his rage but he suppressed the urge. It was not the time be playing the blame game; the teamwork might just be affected.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang took a deep breath and said, \u201cJust be careful next time. One more careless mistake and you\u2019ll have your guild contributions deducted!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Both dead players accepted Zhang Yang\u2019s reproach but whether their apologies were sincere or if it was just for the sake of it, nobody knew but them.</p><br/><p>Sigh\u2026 to think that Zhang Yang had assigned Big Ben to the \u201cinterruption\u201d team.</p><br/><p>\u201cDefiant Monk, you\u2019re now assigned to the \u201cInterruption\u201d team, go and get together with Hundred Shots!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRoger that!\u201d Defiant Monk listened obediently to Zhang Yang since they got along some time ago.</p><br/><p>So far, the only classes that had interruption skills were Spellcasters, Hunters, and Thieves. Hunters required Focus while Thieves required Stamina. Both classes cost system had a maximum of 100 points and they could recover 10 points every second. Casting the interruption skill or the both required 25 Focus for Hunters and 25 Stamina for Thieves. They would need to make sure they had sufficient Focus to make sure the cycle did not stop.</p><br/><p>A Spellcaster\u2019s interruption skill required Mana. As long there was sufficient Mana and the skill was not in cooldown, you could stop a channeling spell by casting it before the spell could be completed. By far, a Spellcaster was the most suitable to be the \u201cinterrupter\u201d.</p><br/><p>There were 4 Spellcasters in the party. Zhang Yang assigned 2 to Hundred Shots and the other 2 to Fatty Han. Now that they lost a member, Zhang Yang had to assign Defiant Monk as replacement.</p><br/><p>But was it really necessary to have three players simultaneously casting three \u201cinterruption\u201d spells?</p><br/><p>One, to avoid a possible chance of missing; and two, the casting speed was much faster than the Water Spirit boss. One man alone could miss out the chance to stop the spell.</p><br/><p>As the fight continued on, Marzerway has casted twice. Zhang Yang kept reminding the team so that no one else would get hit by any of the spell.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmmph! A bunch of noisy little pests! I\u2019ll drown you all in a hail storm!\u201d</p><br/><p>Marzerway raised its staff up high and started to chant a spell. Hundred Shots quickly called out as he casted a .</p><br/><p>\u201cInterrupt together!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the assigned players were Defiant Monk and Comet Tears, and only Defiant Monk activated his ; the Spellcaster was still casting a !</p><br/><p>Luckily, hit its target, stopping the from being casted.</p><br/><p>\u201cComet Tears, why didn\u2019t you cast !?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Spellcaster quietly muttered. \u201cI wanted to finish my before I cast an interruption spell. But since you guys had already casted your skill, I didn\u2019t think mine was necessary.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hundred Shots stared at him angrily and scolded. \u201cDo not make the same mistake ever again! Just because you wanted to attack, you could have caused the entire team to be killed! As a member of a party, you must bear the responsibility of a team member! You cannot just go around and act on your own accord!\u201d</p><br/><p>Comet Tears appeared to be in despair after that rebuke.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, what\u2019s done is done. No use crying over a spilt milk. Cheer up. There\u2019s more interruptions coming later!\u201d Hundred Shots turned soft.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang was genuinely surprised to see that Hundred Shots could also be stern! If he were to give him some lessons, there was a chance that Hundred Shots could be a good leader!</p><br/><p>After the small commotion, the interruption team became fairly serious and performed extraordinary. They never allowed Marzerway to successfully cast a single time!</p><br/><p>90%...85%...80%!</p><br/><p>Even with Zhang Yang\u2019s repeated remainder, there were still careless players that died by the . A total of 3 players had died and one of them was a healer. They had now lost 5 members!</p><br/><p>After a while, Marzerway roared. \u201cI have underestimated you all! Heed my call, O God of the Earthly Spirit! Become one with me and crush these proudly beings!\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss has entered the second stage!</p><br/><p>Pak!</p><br/><p>Marzerway turned into a physical attack monster. He swung his staff and Zhang Yang had star circling on top of his head! Zhang Yang was hit by and had been stunned! Marzerway\u2019s physical attack suddenly increased, and he then focused only on Zhang Yang and dealt a series of heavy attacks.</p><br/><p>\u2018-704!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018+402!\u2019 Little Snow .</p><br/><p>\u2018+80!\u2019 Face Floored .</p><br/><p>\u2018-735!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-747!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018+240!\u2019 Face Floored .</p><br/><p>\u2018+207!\u2019 Vanilla Ice Cream .</p><br/><p>\u2018-711!\u2019</p><br/><p>In just 2 seconds, Marzerway attacked 4 times, totaling up to 3,000 over damage! Luckily, his team had 3 other healers that instantly healed him over the attacks and saved him from death!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang quickly activated the second he recovered from the stun effect, providing an opening for the healers to do their job.</p><br/><p>\u201cAttackers would only need to focus on evading the spikes on the floor! Little Snow, just like the last time, when the boss stuns me, use on me!\u201d Zhang Yang cried out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second stage is very simple! The boss is just like a wooden pole!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

When the two of them made contact, a star symbol appeared on the boss head, indicating a successful stun. Even though the stun lasted only a few milliseconds, it was still a successful stun!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d Zhang Yang swung his sword and sliced the boss, taking away \u2018-339\u2019 damage.</p><br/><p>\u201cArgh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss cried in pain. Bright piercing light started to burst out from the boss\u2019 body, blinding those who would look at it.</p><br/><p>Fatty Han and the rest of the party quickly turned around. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening!?\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Zhang Yang still be alive? On the other hand, the boss seemed to be having a bad time! The four of them started to feel happy and surprised in the same time. Could they be a God Killer? A God Killer! According to the official website, to fight a boss of this scale, you would need to gather several hundred thousand to even millions of players! The war would also last for several days and nights! If they could defeat a Celestial boss with just the 5 of them, it would be the greatest achievement any human could ever receive!</p><br/><p>The flash of light shone and went off quickly, and when Fatty Han could have a good look at Zhang Yang, he noticed something odd\u2026</p><br/><p>The boss was gone. In its place, there stood a tiny dwarf that did not even reach 1 meter of height. In its hand, it was still holding a magic staff that was so much taller than it was. Everyone quickly checked on its system information.</p><br/><p>[Guranda the Chameleon] (Green-Copper)</p><br/><p>Level: 25</p><br/><p>HP: 250,000</p><br/><p>Fatty Han wavered and he cried. \u201cLittle Yang! Where is the boss?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you see him standing right in front of me?\u201d Zhang Yang lifted his sword and pointed the dwarf.</p><br/><p>The little dwarf opened its tiny mouth and started to insult Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamned Mortal! You\u2019d dare to raise your sword at me! I will crush you! I will smash you!\u201d It raised its staff high and directed it at Zhang Yang\u2019s direction and casted something. A debuff icon appeared on his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You have received the effect of . Receive 300 Shadow damage every 3 seconds for 30 seconds!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird. Wasn\u2019t he a Celestial-tier?\u201d said Fatty Han.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fake.\u201d Zhang Yang answered him quickly. Zhang Yang quickly noticed something was odd the moment the boss appeared. Mardevich was the strongest of the 7 Spectre Magus Lords who resided in the Malevolent Tower located in the Spectre\u2019s Sacred Land. How could it be sealed in a place like this!</p><br/><p>Based on his reasoning, he immediately concluded that this boss was an imposter! With his attack, he had confirmed his suspicion and proved his hypothesis was true! A true Celestial-tier boss would be completely immune to the stun effect! Even the Gray-Silver boss Unduin had the immunity effect!</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Cheeky little dwarf! You dare to cheat me! The old great Han! Is it death that you seek!?\u201d Fatty Han drew his bow furiously and attacked. \u201cLittle Fat! F*ck him up good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar!\u201d Litte Fat the bear growled, dragging its little white butt and charged onward.</p><br/><p>The rest of the team shared the same feelings as Fatty Han; they were furiously angered and attacked to punish the dwarf.</p><br/><p>\u201cBunch of little rascals! I\u2019ll kill you all!\u201d Guranda raised its staff and pointed it at Zhang Yang again. This time, it started to cast a spell and a progress bar appeared on its head.</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty! Try and interrupt the spell!\u201d Zhang Yang did not know this boss\u2019 abilities nor capabilities. It would be better if he could interrupt the spell and prevent the unknown attack.</p><br/><p>Fatty Han quickly casted a .</p><br/><p>\u2018Immune!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cShit! It\u2019s useless!\u201d Fatty Han cried out loud and continued his attacks.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Guranda the Chameleon has used !\u2019</p><br/><p>Five ray of lights appeared and beamed at everyone, casting a debuff on everyone.</p><br/><p>[Plague]: You will receive the Plague and be infected with various diseases. All your attacks will be reduced by 5%. You will receive 150 Shadow damage every 3 seconds for 24 seconds. Effect is stackable, removable.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Snow! Dispel all of the debuff!\u201d Zhang Yang quickly ordered. One stack of was not much to be afraid of, but when the effect stacked up to 20 layers, you could basically just stop attacking since there would be 0 damage.</p><br/><p>Little Snow nodded and quickly casted to remove the debuff. In five seconds, everyone was cleansed.</p><br/><p>[Dispel]: Remove a debuff on an ally or remove a buff on the enemy. Cooldown time: 1 second.</p><br/><p>\u201cPuny Mortal! You have angered me! Eat my wrath!\u201d Guranda swung its massive staff towards Zhang Yang. Its physical attack was not as strong since it was a magic caster type. Zhang Yang felt annoyed at the fact that he would not gain any Rage for avoiding its attack. Zhang Yang would rather not waste time dealing with its physical attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaise from the ashes O\u2019 heroes of the past! Serve me!\u201d Guranda chanted a spell and waved its staff. The ground shook and 10 dark pits appeared on the field. White skeleton hands grabbed onto the ledge and crawled out of the pits. One by one, the Skeletons stood above the pits as it closed and disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill them all!\u201d Guranda bellowed.</p><br/><p>FOOM!</p><br/><p>Dark flames emerged from the dark eye sockets of those Skeletons and emitted a strong killing intent. The monsters shook their arms and out came a bone-shape sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like where this is going\u2026\u201d said Fatty Han.</p><br/><p>\u201cKIIKIKIIIKIII\u201d The Skeletons screeched loudly and charged towards the party.</p><br/><p>[Skeleton Warrior] (Elite)</p><br/><p>Level: 20</p><br/><p>HP: 10,000</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang quickly stomped the ground and used to lure as much monsters as possible. Once he got a hold on the monsters that were charging on him and Drizzler, he quickly chained his attack with and attacked the Skeleton Warriors that were heading towards Little Snow.</p><br/><p>\u201cIgnore the minions! Don\u2019t attack them, I haven\u2019t gotten enough aggro yet! Focus on attacking the boss! Fatty, Hundred Shots! Come closer to my side!\u201d Zhang Yang commanded.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang was unable to attack all the monsters at once since both the party and monsters were scattered everywhere. But with everyone gathered together, it made it easier for Zhang Yang to establish a proper crowd control.</p><br/><p>\u2018-698!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-742!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-1480!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Slash! Zhang Yang used and managed to strongly generate aggro for the monsters.</p><br/><p>\u201cUse your AoE skills!\u201d said Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>Fatty Han and the team had their skills ready and waiting. When Zhang Yang gave the green light, they unleashed hell from above. Hunters used and Drizzler used . Instantly, the party\u2019s attack power rose tremendously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is awesome! HAHAHAHA! Really awesome! I can\u2019t get enough of this! Hmm\u2026 Oh\u2026 AH\u2026\u201d Drizzler was on cloud nine as she screamed weirdly among the group of monsters. Even so, her scream was overly erotic that it would immediately lead others to think something indecent. It was so weird, even Hundred Shots and Zhang Yang both smiled as they understood the situation. Fatty Han on the other hand was already smiling like a pervert.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough! Drizzler! Stop making that noise!\u201d Embarrassed, Little Snow quickly tried to stop her cousin. Drizzler\u2019s face was flushed in red but she was not aware that her cries were creating an awkward situation. \u201cB-But it\u2019s really just so addictive AH\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Eventually, no one cared about her anymore and continued to attack. The summoned minion were quickly killed off by the team\u2019s AoE skills while the boss was reduced down to 67%.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible! A mere mortal! I was actually hurt by a mere mortal!\u201d Guranda started to look serious. \u201cLooks like I have to stop playing with my victims!\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss stopped its attacks and started to chant something in an unknown language. A black light engulfed the boss rendering all attacks from Zhang Yang\u2019s party useless.</p><br/><p>\u2018Immune!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Immune!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Immune!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHold your fire! The boss is about to evolve to the second stage!\u201d</p><br/><p>After a few seconds, the light dispersed, revealing a humungous Bone Tiger with sharp spikey bones that protruded out like a spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly crap! This boss has the Shape Shifting ability?\u201d Fatty Han dropped his jaw in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cLuckily he didn\u2019t turn into a sexy Sailormoon or it would be hilarious!\u201d Zhang Yang laughed as he continued to swing his sword to attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrrrr\u2026\u201d The Bone Tiger growled and jumped at Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck me! The boss actually turned from magic to physical attack!\u201d Zhang Yang let his guard down and let the boss attacked him with its huge fangs.</p><br/><p>\u2018-405!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-417!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Bite that fellow! Haha! Good tiger!\u201d Drizzler cheered.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Little brat, I have no quarrel with you! Why would you say something like that?!\u201d Zhang Yang said while he laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Fatty\u2019s mouth is his negative points! As for you, your bad side is your intentions!\u201d Drizzler complained.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my\u2026\u201d Fatty Han covered his mouth like a woman in shock. He then talked like an old lady. \u201cOh little Drizzler! Since when did you learn to talk like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrr\u2026\u201d After turning into a beast, Guranda had completely lost his ability to speak.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a black light gleamed across the tiger\u2019s body and all of the bone spikes protruded further, like it was ready to fire off.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang\u2019s heart skipped a beat and quickly yelled. \u201cEveryone get behind me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Guranda has used Lasts for 10 seconds!\u2019</p><br/><p>Shush! Shush! Shush!</p><br/><p>Arrow-like spikes continuously flew out from the boss\u2019 back and into the sky. The arrows formed a huge circle, as it gathered more and more arrows to become bigger. Up to a moment, all the arrows were unleashed down to the ground, like a rain of arrows.</p><br/><p>\u2018-191!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-194!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-189!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018...\u2019</p><br/><p>Everyone was unable to avoid the attack as it came down from the sky instead of the front as Zhang Yang hoped. Everyone suffered around 200 damage every second. Luckily, Little Snow was proficient enough to flash cast as many healing spells and other recovery skills as she could. She withheld the for the person with the lowest HP in case she could not heal in time.</p><br/><p>After 10 seconds, everyone in the party lost close to 2,000 HP. If it was not because of Little Snow\u2019s powerful healing power, everyone would have died. Instead, they were left alive with 300 or so remaining HP. Zhang Yang had strong defense, massive HP, and amazing dodging skills; his remaining HP was at least 1,500.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Snow, I need you heal everyone to full health in case of another attack like that! Everyone else, attack faster please! We need to get him back to his original form to prevent more ultimate skills!\u201d said Zhang Yang as he attacked faster and faster.</p><br/><p>Everyone else joined his frenzy and attacked the boss as well. 60%, 55%, 50%... eventually the boss\u2019 HP dropped down to 33%. It was then a similar black light engulfed the boss that rendered all attacks to be immune.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder what it would become this time?\u201d said Fatty Han with his eyes wide open.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! DAMN YOU ALL TO HELL! I WILL KILL YOU! KILL YOU, I MUST!\u201d An extremely thundering voice could be heard and the boss revealed its true form. A huge 7 meters long giant crimson scorpion.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

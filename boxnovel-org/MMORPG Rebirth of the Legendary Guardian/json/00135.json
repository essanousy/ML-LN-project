After getting through the latest Chalvos\u2019 , the whole team broke out in cheers, with victory in sight!</p><br/><p>2%!</p><br/><p>1%!</p><br/><p>There was a sudden change! Chalvos\u2019 body released a red aura, his grayish white colour body turning into bloody red colour.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Chalvos is enraged! All damage increases by 200%!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d Zhang Yang scolded, this Chalvos had such a violent death throe! He was planning to drag Zhang Yang along!</p><br/><p>Fortunately\u2026 was ready once again!</p><br/><p> activated!</p><br/><p>\u2018-1728!\u2019 A huge damage text floated above Zhang Yang\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>All around, every member who stood within 30 meters away from Chalvos instantly died as \u2018-9000\u2019 damage texts popped up on their heads.</p><br/><p>Fragrant Baby and Little Petal responded quickly, activating simultaneously like synchronized divers. Two semi-transparent, golden hued barriers surrounded them. They were now immune to all sorts of damage and debuffs but their healing effect was now reduced by 50%!</p><br/><p>\u2018+502!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018+512!\u2019</p><br/><p>The next damage dealing team in line immediately moved up, replacing the dead team.</p><br/><p>However, the range of Chalvos\u2019 was 35 meters. They needed to run 5 meters in to strike Chalvos. Hunters with high Dexterity attributes could make it less than a second but Spellcasters needed at least one to two seconds to make it. They also they required a casting time in order to deal any damage, and if they came in at the wrong time, they would be killed before dealing any damage!</p><br/><p>After Chalvos performed another cycle of AoE attack, the second group of damage dealing team were all annihilated once again while the first group of damage dealing team had only just resurrected and were recuperating. The group prior to that had just reached the end of the damage dealing queue. Snow Seeker hurriedly commanded the freshly killed team to start heading to the fight immediately. There was no point in recuperating any longer. With Chalvos killing them all with a single hit, there would be no difference between 1 HP and full HP anymore!</p><br/><p>During this time, Chalvos still retained 29,000 HP!</p><br/><p>Three seconds later, the latest attackers had reduced Chalvos\u2019 HP to 20,000 but were also wiped out in the process!</p><br/><p>Fragrant Baby and Little Petal died after their effect ended.</p><br/><p>The fight went on, and Chalvos was barely alive, at 9,000 HP</p><br/><p>However, there were no attackers around! They had been killed faster than they could return to the fight, with the closest team 15 seconds away.</p><br/><p>Snow Seeker anxiously yelled, \u201cAll healers come forward and use spells to attack!\u201d Because it was pointless to keep the healers at this moment, it was better than nothing if they could cause even 100 points of damage!</p><br/><p>The field instantly became a very gory scene, with Sacred Knights and Priests moving forward one after another. They could only use a or a before they died screaming.</p><br/><p>Chalvos still had 3000HP remaining.</p><br/><p>\u2018 ended!\u2019</p><br/><p>[Servant: Clear Lotus] was summoned and Zhang Yang activated .</p><br/><p>\u2018Immune!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-9000!\u2019</p><br/><p>Although Zhang Yang had evaded the pillar itself, the still came for him and Clear Lotus was needed to take that damage. As soon as she died, the invincibility quickly ended.</p><br/><p>But Zhang Yang had just bought himself another 3 seconds to strike the boss!</p><br/><p>\u2018-1575! \u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-845! Normal Attack.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018-821! !\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! The party you are in has killed Chalvos! Obtained 416,717 EXP (50 points Party Bonus)!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Bang!\u2019</p><br/><p>Chalvos the giant\u2019s corpse crashed onto the ground and the battle had come to an end!</p><br/><p>Hu! Zhang Yang\u2019s heart nearly leaped out from his chest, that was way too close!</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have killed Chalvos the giant!\u201d Less than ten survivors cheered in excitement.</p><br/><p>After a while, everyone had regrouped, the huge lady army fully assembled again.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere was truly joyous, with all the girls were dancing and hugging each other, and Zhang Yang was dragged into the crowd, pelted with kisses and assaulted with hugs. His anti-harassment system alarm went off like sirens! At this point, \u2018God\u2019s Miracle\u2019 had programmed it with equality in mind, so that both female and male players were protected by the anti-harassment system!</p><br/><p>This gang of perverted girls!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang could not help but cry. He has not kissed anyone since his rebirth, and here he was, having his first, second, third and hundredth kiss robbed from him!</p><br/><p>However, this event was indeed a good cause for such excitement! It may have only taken seven or eight minutes, but every second was as tense as anything else could ever be. A single careless mistake could have killed off their entire team! The lady army of Crimson Rage really couldn\u2019t restrain themselves, having been stomped on by Chalvos the giant for an entire day previously!</p><br/><p>Perfumed Water looked at Zhang Yang, smiled and said: \u201cHow is it, our sisters are really lively aren\u2019t they! Would you like to join us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed loudly and said: \u201cCrimson Rage welcomes male players as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it is someone else, of course not! But you Zhan Yu, I can make an exception for you and give you a title as the head of eunuchs!\u201d After defeating Chalvos, even Snow Seeker visibly loosened up, joking with Zhang Yang casually.</p><br/><p>Faced with these cruel and violent ladies, Zhang Yang hurriedly said, \u201cAlright, alright, let\u2019s loot from the giant! I can hardly wait for my loot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch!\u201d Thorny Rose pursed her lips and said, \u201cLook at those sneaky eyes of yours, we are women, we always keep our word unlike you guys who cheat on women and always hide your true intentions!\u201d</p><br/><p>This woman must have been dumped by men more than hundred times. It was the only way her resentment could be explained! Zhang Yang was slightly annoyed at how she ruined the mood. \u201cGuild master Snow, I do not want anything else, I simply want this woman as my servant!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thorny Rose stood up proudly, proclaiming, \u201cYou damn liar, can you even afford me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Snow Seeker, however said with a deadpan expression, \u201cZhan Yu could indeed afford you! Did you think about how he sold plenty of [Beginner Anti-Shadow Potions] on previous days? He could have at least earned 10,000,000 to 20,000,000!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Snow, how can you help the outsider?!\u201d Thorny Rose shrieked, hugging Snow Seeker, causing her bosom to squish against Snow Seeker\u2019s own plump bosom. The scene would have given any other men a nosebleed!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang did not share Fatty Han\u2019s dream to have many girlfriends and set up a huge harem. But this did not mean that he could not admire pretty girls throughout his life. Faced with this hot-blooded scene, he definitely could not act like a gentleman, who would politely look away, but instead crossed his hands and stared directly at them.</p><br/><p>Thorny Rose had thought of making a fool out of Zhang Yang, but she never thought that Zhang Yang would look at them so blatantly, so she was greatly disappointed and released Snow Seeker, rolling her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Snow, loot Chalvos\u2019 corpse. We worked so hard to defeat Chalvos, it just has to reward us fairly!\u201d All the girls said together.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay, don\u2019t yell at me. I\u2019ll go deaf from all of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Snow, the technology is developed nowadays, hymens could be replaced, your eardrums are no big deal!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang felt cold sweat streaming down his head, these women were dangerous!</p><br/><p>Finally, Snow Seeker looted Chalvos\u2019 corpse. Because she used Leader\u2019s Distribution Mode, she had to post each of the loots one by one.</p><br/><p>[Salamander Battle Armor] (Green-Copper, Armor)</p><br/><p>Defense: +10</p><br/><p>Strength: +48</p><br/><p>Vitality: +24</p><br/><p>Dexterity: +8</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 40</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, guild master Zhan Yu, why don\u2019t you take this equipment? It\u2019s for Level 40s and is definitely the first equipment of it\u2019s type in this game!\u201d Snow Seeker smiled and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cPass! Pass!\u201d Zhang Yang hurriedly said.</p><br/><p>[Stone Skin Boots] (Green-Copper, Leather Armor)</p><br/><p>Defense: +6</p><br/><p>Strength: +40</p><br/><p>Vitality: +8</p><br/><p>Dexterity: +32</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 40</p><br/><p>\u201cGuild master Zhan Yu, what do you think of equipment?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Chalvos Nose Ring] (Green-Copper, Necklace)</p><br/><p>Strength: +10</p><br/><p>Dexterity: +10</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 40</p><br/><p>\u201cGuild master Zhan Yu, what do you think of equipment?\u201d</p><br/><p>Snow Seeker incessantly posted seven to eight pieces of Green-Copper equipment together with their attributes continuously.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Snow, you are really bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the girls were laughing hysterically.</p><br/><p>Finally, Snow Seeker entered her businesswoman-like demeanor and posted a few pieces of decent equipment.</p><br/><p>[Bloody Chestplate] (Gray-Silver, Armor)</p><br/><p>Defense: +20</p><br/><p>Strength: +96</p><br/><p>Vitality: +48</p><br/><p>Dexterity: +16</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 40</p><br/><p>[Heavy Stone Shield] (Gray-Silver, Shield)</p><br/><p>Defense: +400</p><br/><p>Strength: +160</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 40</p><br/><p>Only these two pieces of equipment were applicable for Zhang Yang, but due to the new version\u2019s update, special effects and sockets would only revealed after being identified by an Item Binder, so he could not know all the attributes of the equipment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all? Are you serious?! Equipment is not the most important loot from open world boss, but valuable skill books are!\u201d Zhang Yang looked at Snow Seeker.</p><br/><p>Snow Seeker could not help but shook her head and said, \u201cCan\u2019t you just be dumb for once?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed, \u201cIf I was dumb even for this instance, then I shall suffer a big loss!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always something to be won from losing, I\u2019m sure some famous author actually said that before, right?\u201d Snow Seeker smiled and said.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, she did as he said.</p><br/><p>[Skill Book: Slice and Dice]</p><br/><p>Use: You will grant .</p><br/><p>Class Requirement: Thief</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 30</p><br/><p>[Skill Book: Deep Wound]</p><br/><p>Use: You will grant </p><br/><p>Class Requirement: Warrior and Knight</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 30</p><br/><p>[Servant: Mountain Giant] (Copper-Tier Servant)</p><br/><p>Use: Summons a Mountain Giant to fight for you and lasts for 5 minutes. You can only summon a servant at the same time. If you summon any other servants then all servants will undergo the same cool down timer. Cool down time: 60 minutes.</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 40</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Zhang Yang asked.</p><br/><p>Snow Seeker smiled forcedly and said, \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing else!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang nodded his head and said, \u201cThen I want the [Skill Book: Deep Wound]!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZhan Yu, you have enough power already, give this [Skill Book: Deep Wound] to our Little Apricot!\u201d Perfumed Water said and pushed Little Apricot to the front. Little Apricot was a pretty girl with sweet lips and slim long legs, \u201cAh, well. How about Little Apricot giving you a kiss for it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope, nope! No kisses. I just want that skill book!\u201d Zhang Yang said hurriedly.</p><br/><p>Perfumed Water shook her head and said: \u201cSigh, you hurt our Little Apricot\u2019s heart!\u201d</p><br/><p>Snow Seeker saw that Zhang Yang had already made up his mind, and so, she gave the [Skill Book: Deep Wound] to him and kept the rest of the loot into her inventory. How they distributed the loots among themselves was none of Zhang Yang\u2019s business.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuild master Zhan Yu, happy working with you!\u201d Snow Seeker reached out her tiny hands towards Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang did a handshake with Snow Seeker, smiled and said: \u201cIf there are any good tasks like that in future, you are more than welcome to find me! I also hope that Lone Desert Smoke and Crimson Rage could form an offensive and defensive alliance and together become famous in \u2018God\u2019s Miracle\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, we also thought of forming an alliance with Lone Desert Smoke!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I\u2019ll take my leave first!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBye bye!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang left the team and tore off [Teleportation Scroll] before the eyes of violent and cruel lady army, he was promptly teleported back to White Jade Castle.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

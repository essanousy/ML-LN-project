With a massive slash of its sharp claws, the tiger dealt huge damage on Zhang Yang\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u201c-1552!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You have received (5 stacks). Receive 1500 HP damage every 3 seconds for 15 seconds!\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang could not help but flick his middle finger at lady luck. The current 4 stacks of was just about to expire but he had received a fresh, new that could refresh the skill\u2019s effect! He never had thought that the tiger would have a skill similar to a Thief\u2019s to immediately teleport behind someone\u2019s back. Not only had the been refreshed to 15 seconds, he now had 5 stacks of ! He now had to take additional, unnecessary damage for the next 15 seconds!</p><br/><p>Even though the Saber-Tooth Skeleton Tiger was strong, it was vastly outclassed by the party\u2019s DPS! So far, Fatty Han and the gang had each exceeded 1000 DPS. Daffodil Daydream was slightly behind at around 800 DPS. The overall DPS strength was enough to kill the tiger with 100,000 HP in just 20 seconds!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry! Tai Tai! I will heal your wounds!\u201d Shimalue Gutan cried out all of a sudden and chanted a healing spell and healed the tiger by 25,000 HP.</p><br/><p>The spell casting duration was so fast that it only took half a second for her to finish the spell. Those that had interruption skills could not even react in time. Before they even realized it, the spell was already complete and they could only stare at the boss healing the monster that was already at the brink of death.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the tiger was inflicted with the debuff that would reduce healing effect by 75%. If that wasn\u2019t the case, the healing spell would have completely healed the tiger back to full health.</p><br/><p>\u201cNoob tank! You\u2019re too slow! Why didn\u2019t you stop her spell when you have an interruption skill! Hmph! You\u2019ve lost my respect!\u201d said Wei Yan Er. She always did try her best to poke fun at him.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed and shot back, \u201cI wasn\u2019t the only one here who was unable to interrupt her spell. Why aren\u2019t you scolding the others?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re the only one that has a stupid face!\u201d said Wei Yan Er with full honesty.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t die! Tai Tai!\u201d Even when the boss attempted to heal the tiger again, the team\u2019s combined attack simply overruled her efforts. It was like tossing the contents of a cup of water into a raging inferno. The tiger\u2019s HP was drained down in almost no time at all. Shimalue Gutan could only shriek at the top of her lungs.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomehow, I pity this queen. Her husband was cheating with her son\u2019s wife and she only has her pets to accompany her!\u201d said Daffodil mournfully, her eyes already showing signs of tears.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang scoffed. \u201cIn that case, let\u2019s spare her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026No. We kill. Living is much more painful for her!\u201d said Daffodil as she made up her mind. \u201cWe are giving her a mercy killing, not just for equipment and whimsical desires!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone laughed instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cTai Tai\u2026\u201d Shimalue Gutan cried and chanted another healing spell.</p><br/><p>!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang was ready for it this time. He quickly bashed her with his shield.</p><br/><p>The spell was instantly interrupted and she had received for 3 seconds. had rendered her unable to cast any spells for 3 seconds.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You and the party members around have killed Tai Tai! Obtained 12,550 Experience Points. (50 points party bonus)!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cNOOOO\u2026.!\u201d cried Shimalue Gutan.</p><br/><p>The boss suddenly glowed red. She had gone berserk.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamned intruders! I will crush your skull with my bare hands and throw your mangled copses into the abyss! May you forever burn in the raging flames of hell! Wu Wu! Gu Gu! Kill them! Avenge Tai Tai!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Shimalue Gutan has gained (1 stack). All attacks and healing effects will be increase by 33%!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Wu Wu has gained (1 stack). All attacks and healing effects will be increase by 33%!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Gu Gu has gained (1 stack). All attacks and healing effects will be increase by 33%!\u2019</p><br/><p>An increment by 33% in damage had made the boss stronger by a noticeable amount. The had its damage increased to 2600 or more, with Zhang Yang\u2019s damage reduction lowering that amount down to 2000.</p><br/><p>\u201cPick up the pace!\u201d Zhang Yang screamed.</p><br/><p>The boss was not the only one that had suddenly ingested an overdose of steroids and went all crazy! Han Ying Xue had to take care of two tanks, which made her roll her sleeves up, taking things seriously.</p><br/><p>The party then shifted their targets to the bird monster Gu Gu and managed to bring it down to critical health in a short time.</p><br/><p>\u201cGu Gu!\u201d Shimalue Gutan cried in anguish as she started to chant a healing spell. However, Zhang Yang was quicker and bashed her with , stopping her healing.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You and the party members around have killed Gu Gu! Obtained 12,550 Experience Points. (50 points party bonus)!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cARGHH\u2026!\u201d The boss screeched in such a high pitch that everyone had to cover their ears. She stood with her hind hooves and screamed at no one in particular, dramatically rearing her head about like the tragic heroine of an opera.</p><br/><p>\u201cI WILL KILL YOU ALL! I WILL KILL! KILL!\u201d Bellowed the boss.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Shimalue Gutan has gained (2 stack). All attacks and healing will be increase by 67%!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Wu Wu has gained (2 stack). All attacks and healing will be increase by 67%!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201c-2672!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c-2004!\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss fired a , while the wolf concurrently spat out a . Both attacks struck Zhang Yang at the same time, causing him to have only around 1000 HP left!</p><br/><p>What power!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang frantically cried, \u201cStarlight! Provoke Wu Wu and get him off me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOK!\u201d</p><br/><p>Endless Starlight quickly complied and cast , dragging Wu Wu away from Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>Half a minute later, Wu Wu turned into a pillar of light and falls defeated.</p><br/><p>\u201cWU WU!!!\u201d Shimalue Gutan was enraged beyond compare. Her dark, charcoal hair started to spread out and floated up mystically. Her eyes glowed with intense green, emerald flames.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Shimalue Gutan has gained (3 stack). All attacks and healing will be increased by 100%!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! We\u2019re cruel!\u201d Fatty Han cried crocodile tears. \u201cWhen her husband had found a new toy to play with, she had managed to find herself a few loyal companions! Yet, we just killed them! Aiyaya\u2026Looks like this poor woman had to depend on cucumbers to accompany her during the dark, lonesome nights!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty\u2026You know\u2026If you don\u2019t speak up, no one would think that you\u2019re a mute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty Han turned around and saw the 4 ladies staring at him with eyes that could swallow him whole. Fatty Han turned his gaze away sheepishly. \u201cEh\u2026ladies, I know that you have the hots for the big Fatty. But please, control your passion! You have to know that you\u2019re all Little Yang\u2019s main dishes, and that there\u2019s a saying: \u201ca brother wife is off limit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The ladies were furious enough as it is, but when Fatty Han added fuel to the fire, it brought their fury round by a full circle, dissuading them as they felt that there was no point directing their wrath at Fatty Han.</p><br/><p>\u201c-3212!\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss cast and blasted Zhang Yang with powerful, enhanced damage. Even though he could stop the boss from healing, but he still had to take the head on!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c+2015!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c+402!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Ying Xue\u2019s and ticked at the same time and healed almost half of his HP. However, it was still insufficient in coping with the loss of his HP!</p><br/><p>Only half a minute passed, and Zhang Yang had to depend on to recover from his dangerously low HP back to full health. The boss\u2019 damage had exceeded the healing that Han Ying Xue could provide, therefore Zhang Yang had to depend on himself to deal with the excessive damage he received.</p><br/><p>Health potion, , Lover\u2019s Sword , , , , he had to use everything he had to survive! Zhang Yang had planned the skill cycle out and prioritized the ones with the lowest cool down times to maximize the effect.</p><br/><p>The good thing was that even if Shimalue Gutan\u2019s attack was strong, her HP did not match up to the strength of her attacks. She did not have any large AoE multi-target skill as well. After lasting for another 2 minutes or so, she shrieked and fell defeated.</p><br/><p>Haaa! Phew\u2026</p><br/><p>Everyone drew in a deep breath and let out a long breath of relief. The fight with this boss did not take long, but the boss\u2019 attack was so strong that many of them had held their breaths, witnessing Zhang Yang being close to death for many times. They could only relax and let down their guard only when the boss was down.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s finally over. Man! I was freaking out there!\u201d said Endless Starlight as he wiped his forehead; even when there was no sweat.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang could not help but sigh. The period of the Gray-Silver equipment was once known as the weak period. It was even applicable to the boss as well! Shimalue Gutan was one such example, her strong attack could easily kill a tank with one or two hits! However, she was a glass cannon who lacked durability! When players started to put on Yellow-Gold gears with damage reduction set skills, there would be lesser cases of instant kills.</p><br/><p>Han Ying Xue was so completely worn out that she laid her head on Wei Yan Er lap. While stroking her cousin sister\u2019s silky hair, she stared angrily at Zhang Yang and cried. \u201cNoob tank! Look at what you\u2019ve done! You\u2019ve completely drained my cousin sister out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWOOOOAHHH!\u201d Zhang Yang, Hundred Shots, Fatty Han, and Endless Starlight broke out in surprised laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brat! Don\u2019t say something like that\u2026\u201d Even a person as flirtatious as Han Ying Xue would feel some shame when Wei Yan Er said something that could be interpreted very differently in such manner.</p><br/><p>Turning around, Wei Yan Er was confused, but when no one cared to explain her fault she snapped, \u201cYou guys are bullies! Hmph! I\u2019m not talking to you guys anymore!\u201d She got up to her feet and went to the boss for the loots.</p><br/><p>[Blaze War Hammer] (Gray-Silver, One handed Hammer)</p><br/><p>Weapon Attack: 403 \u2013 461</p><br/><p>Attack Interval: 2.7 seconds.</p><br/><p>DPS: 160</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 40</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah! This is good sh*t!\u201d Endless Starlight cried as he inspected the item. His current weapon was still a level 30 Green-Copper tier with only 60 DPS. He would definitely experience a huge difference if he were to equip this item!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang saw his reaction and smiled gently. \u201cTake it!\u201d Zhang Yang gave up his roll.</p><br/><p>Endless Starlight wavered a little and said, \u201cH-How could I\u2026I mean\u2026your weapon is just a level 30 Gray-Silver tier. The hammer is much better!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang shook his head sadly. \u201cWhen you reached level 40, you were still here. What you didn\u2019t know was that you could get a level 40 skill from the Class Instructor. At level 40, a Defender could learn a skill called . It could increase all damage by 5% only when a hammer-type equipment is worn! That is why a Hammer is a specialized weapon for Defenders!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Yan Er nodded her head and said, \u201cThat right! I have already learned the skill . All attacks are increased by 5% when I\u2019m equipping an axe weapon! That is why, no one is to take away my axe! Any two-handed axes that ever appear in the boss loots are all mine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Endless Starlight smiled gratefully and accepted the hammer. With this, his attack and ability to pull aggro would be greatly increased. All of this was thanks to Zhang Yang! His respect for him has only grown stronger! He knew that the original party members did not need him to join. He knew that he would make little difference to them!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

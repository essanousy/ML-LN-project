Underneath her thin uniform, he could feel her two round buns clasped in his hands! It\u2019s no wonder people say that the colder a woman is, the more sensitive her body would be; and she is the perfect example! Zhang Yang loosen his grip on her, rolled over and stood up. As the policewoman did the same, her cheeks blushed like red roses quite visibly. She was beautiful and cute, yet glamorous at the same time!</p><br/><p>The surrounding crowd gave out a sudden call, and Zhang Yang took this chance to flee from the scene with his tail between his legs. He knew he made a grave mistake and if he continued standing there, he would be branded a pervert and be arrested! Watching him run away, the policewomen stomped the ground with anger and dread, causing her bosoms to bounce with every step. She turned and returned to the police station with the 3 members of the scamming family.</p><br/><p>Along the way, Zhang Yang grabbed a few snacks to eat before he got home. The time was slightly past 9:30am, and he quickly put on his gaming helmet and logged in.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yang, what took you so long to get up? Could it be\u2026 did you have some fun last night?! Listen to me, you can\u2019t go around and pick them up from the streets! They\u2019re some nasty stuff, bro! Give me a few days, and I\u2019ll come over and bring you to this awesome place called \u2018Girl\u2019s Town\u2019! The girls over there are at the same level as superstars!\u201d Zhang Yang was immediately greeted by Fatty Han\u2019s private message. As usual, he never bothered to change his lustful and perverted behavior. Ignoring his usual habit, Zhang Yang sent a party invitation along with his reply, \u201cUh huh, right\u2026 like I\u2019ll believe you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Snow, Drizzler, as well as Hundred Shots were recruited as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late, guys. Had a little hiccup just now. Let\u2019s gather at the North side of the city!\u201d</p><br/><p>Drizzler began to complain, \u201cStupid uncle! If I\u2019d known you were going to be late, I would\u2019ve slept longer!\u201d Zhang Yang felt a little ticked off. He only smiled bitterly and said, \u201cWhy \u2018uncle\u2019? I\u2019m not even that much older than you are.\u201d Albeit childish, Zhang Yang did not really fancy being called an old uncle nor a young brat.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you over your 20\u2019s?\u201d Drizzler asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh\u2026 yeah. I\u2019m 22 now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on! I\u2019m only 17. What else would I call someone who\u2019s five years older than I am?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty Han then interjected, \u201cF*ck! If you called someone five years older than you \u2018an uncle\u2019, that means you\u2019d be calling someone ten years older as \u2018gramps\u2019!</p><br/><p>Drizzler\u2019s expression began to change into a \u2018murderous when provoked\u2019 look, \u201cHey Fatty, what\u2019re you trying to say? Do you think you could take advantage of me since I\u2019m only 17?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fearful, Fatty Han immediately tried to change the subject, \u201cAhahha\u2026 nice weather we\u2019re having today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Time flew past as they all gathered. Zhang Yang brought them to complete the dungeon pre-requisite quest, which was fairly simple. All they needed to do was to kill a bunch of monsters, find the NPC near the dungeon entrance and gain access to the lair.</p><br/><p>To save time, the party rented mounts from the Gryphon Keeper and few to the White Shine Forest. This was one of the many transport services in the game that helped players who were mount-less to reach their destination in a much shorter time, instead of having to spend more time running over.</p><br/><p>\u201cFlying in the air is awesome!\u201d Drizzler stretched out her arms to feel the air. \u201cIt feels like I\u2019m a Sword Shaman! Whoosh! Thousand Mile Soaring Blade! Sigh\u2026 It would be nice if this game could change into the Xian Xia style, then we could all learn the Sword\u2019s way and fly on our own!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang giggled. \u201cThis is an international gaming community! They won\u2019t change the game that way since it\u2019s a little too Eastern! It\u2019s not suitable for the international market!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, what a waste! They westernized the game just to earn profits! Cunning bastards!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. Let\u2019s get going. Snow Spite City is just through the forest!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang went ahead to clear a path for the party through the forest. Once they were out, they saw human-like structures in front of them. The city was only a short distance away. In there, they saw all kinds of elemental spirits wandering around the city. What was once a human city became a paradise for the Fire, Water, Wind, and Earth elementals.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang flipped through the quest description and notified the team, \u201cGuys, we need to take out ten of each elemental spirits to complete the quest!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo! Go! Go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone in the party had overpowered equipment against the monsters. Killing them and completing the quest was a breeze. They soon arrived at the dungeon entrance.</p><br/><p>Marzerway\u2019s Lair was situated in this abandoned man-made palace in Snow Sprite City. There were three sub-dungeons namely Front Wing, Mid Wing and the Main Wing and the palace was the entrance to the dungeon. The Front and Mid Wing had two bosses each while the Main Wing held Marzerway, a 20 player party-fight boss.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d Zhang Yang and his party were surprised to see that they were not alone there. In fact, there were 30 players; six parties with five players each. They were all from different guilds, namely The Dominators, Sky High, and Crimson Rage. Every one of them had reached Level 20! They were all technically qualified to enlist themselves in the Level Ranking Board, but none of them did it and Zhang Yang understood their decision. They were furiously competing with each other and neither one of them wanted to expose their true strength. Even though they gave up their pride, they never gave up their determination. In the end, they all fought hard and leveled up, arriving at this Level 20 dungeon entrance at the same time as the others.</p><br/><p>Noticing Zhang Yang\u2019s party walking towards them, they were taken aback. How could anyone else be able or even try to raid this dungeon?!</p><br/><p>Humbly Gentleman of The Dominators scanned the party and saw that Zhang Yang\u2019s name was hidden. \u201cYou are Zhan Yu, I presume?\u201d Such keen eyes, as expected of a guild master! Zhang Yang could only give a light smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you all going to raid that dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIT\u2019S YOU!\u201d Zhang Yang heard a loud voice that sounded like someone screamed through their teeth. There came a beautiful woman with arms on her waist and bosoms big enough to attract any eyes. Right, she was the woman I exchanged my [Refined Iron Ore] with regular [Iron Ore]. Her name was Thorny Rose.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, hi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sneaky bastard! I was doomed because of you!\u201d Thorny Rose\u2019s face was flushed with crimson rage. Fatty Han, noticing her anger, quickly interjected.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, young maiden. Has this little brat wronged you? Did he knock you up and refused to claim responsibility?! Damn you, Little Yang! How could you do this?! How could you just use this young girl and discard her like that?! Urgh, I\u2019m so jealous!\u201d</p><br/><p>With just that, the atmosphere suddenly became a lot heavier. Everyone began to exchange looks towards Zhang Yang and Thorny Rose. They looked like they knew what was going on in their mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dirty uncle! I\u2019m 100% certain now that you\u2019re a big horny pervert!\u201d Drizzler exclaimed as she shared the same thoughts as others. Thorny Rose tried to explain otherwise.</p><br/><p>\u201cN-no! It\u2019s not that! This sly fox cheated me over 100 [Iron Ore]! He caused Mei Mei to be late for more than half a day to submit her quest!\u201d</p><br/><p>So that was the truth! With that revealed, the crowd began to lose their interest. It seemed that the exciting lie was more entertaining than the boring truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cRose! Stop fooling around!\u201d</p><br/><p>A woman walked over, carrying with her a sense of dignified nobility, calming the raging Thorny Rose. She then took her time to observe Zhang Yang. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of your name. I\u2019d never thought that today would be the day I finally met the famous Zhan Yu, the legendary Guardian. It\u2019s an honor!\u201d</p><br/><p>Crimson Rage\u2019s guild master; Snow Seeker. In the future, she would be ranked fourth in China Server\u2019s top ten Spellcasters. She would also be the player representative for the \u201cRed\u201d party, an S-class competition team. Zhang Yang would not dare to ignore someone like her.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, guild master Snow, the honor is mine! I, too, have heard of your noble name! Luck truly is on my side!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough of these fake words! We\u2019ve all gathered here today to fight for that \u2018First Clear\u2019 achievement! Stop making those welcoming faces as if they were your own!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cold words, coming from the mouth of Sky Shaman, the guild master of Sky High. Snow Seeker averted her gaze and smiled warmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe, the Crimson Rage are all just maidens. We do not have such wildly ambitions. In fact, we\u2019re just here to try on the Hard Mode!\u201d Nobody believed her. They knew her words were as fake as the nature in-game.</p><br/><p>Humbly was in his own sea of thoughts when he suddenly voiced out, \u201cHow about we have a bet? To see who would be the first to claim two of the \u2018First Clear\u2019 achievement for Hardcore Mode?\u201d Sky Shaman felt confident about winning the challenge.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! A challenge invites progress! Well said! How about it, guild master Snow, Zhan Yu? Let\u2019s compete!\u201d</p><br/><p>Snow Seeker only lightly smiled as she replied, \u201cWe would always welcome a clean and fair fight. I only fear that someone might not obey the rules of the game and uses some underhanded tactic to win the bet!\u201d Hearing her words, Humbly Gentleman and Sky Shaman\u2019s smiles faded a little.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang could not help but wonder. What happened between those three guilds that left them having a grudge against each other? After thinking about it again, he left it alone as it was none of his business.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we participated, what would get out of it?\u201d Zhang Yang inquired.</p><br/><p>Sky Shaman, with words full of confidence, gave a hefty suggested reward. \u201cHaha! Everyone will bet on 10,000 gold pieces! The loser will have to pay 10,000 gold pieces each to the winner! Two dungeons, two rounds. How about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Snow Seeker expressed her objection to the idea, \u201cI\u2019ve said it before, Crimson Rage would only take on Hard Mode. Consider us forfeiting the bet! We will now take our leave and start on the dungeon. We\u2019ll be going now, then!\u201d</p><br/><p>Snow Seeker waved goodbye and led the party into the dungeon. No one outside the party would know the mode of the dungeon that they were raiding, but everyone knew this: the pre-requisite quest must be completed to gain access to the Front and Middle Wing. Parties must raid both to be able to enter the Main Wing, and the requirement did not specify what mode they would choose.</p><br/><p>\u201cGentleman, Zhan Yu! How about it? Shall we place our bets?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Humbly Gentleman and Sky Shaman stared at each other, emitting a strong enmity between the two. This was how the two guilds treated each other; with a strong sense of hostility. Zhang Yang, on the other hand, laughed out loud. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll just go on and follow Gentleman! It\u2019s a \u2018yes\u2019 from me as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Now that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about!\u201d Sky Shaman then clapped his hands to get his team\u2019s attention. \u201cAre you listening, brothers? We\u2019re competing with Zhan Yu and The Dominators, to fight for the \u2018First Clear\u2019 achievement! What do you guys think? Could we lose to them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHell no!\u201d The players from Sky High roared out in unison, and their morale was instantly boosted.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, let\u2019s go!\u201d Sky Shaman waved his arm, leading his army to disappear into the dungeon.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, I\u2019d better be going now!\u201d Humbly Gentleman winked at Zhang Yang. \u201cBrother Zhan Yu, after today, let\u2019s find some time together to chat! I\u2019ll take my leave now then!\u201d And with that, The Dominators disappeared into the dungeon too.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys, we\u2019d better quickly complete the quest now and enter the dungeon, or we\u2019d have to put out 10,000 gold pieces!\u201d</p><br/><p>Drizzler shamelessly responded, \u201cHmph! That\u2019s what you have decided, not us! If you lose, you\u2019d better pay them from your own pocket. But if we win, we must share the booty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little brat! Is money the only thing on your mind?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

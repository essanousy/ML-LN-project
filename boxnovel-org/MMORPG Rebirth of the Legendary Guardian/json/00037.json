Poor Aphelia! May your soul rest in peace among the gods!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAgain! Yours!\u201d Zhang Yang sighed heavily. It was not that he wanted the equipment but more so because he did not want Little Snow saying that he wanted to court her!</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, Little Snow giggled happily, carrying an \u2018I knew it\u2019 expression.</p><br/><p>Hmph, drama queen!</p><br/><p>Another loot! Zhang Yang did not believe that it would only drop Priest\u2019s equipment!</p><br/><p>[Boots of Agility] (Green-Copper, Cloth Armor)</p><br/><p>Defense: +2</p><br/><p>Vitality: +10</p><br/><p>Intelligence: +6</p><br/><p>Spirit: +4</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 20</p><br/><p>F*ck my life! Zhang Yang felt speechless.</p><br/><p>Again, again!</p><br/><p>[Resurrection] (Skill Book)</p><br/><p>Use: You will learn .</p><br/><p>Class: Priest, Knight.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang shed a manly tear. All 4 items were for Priests!</p><br/><p>Little Snow\u2019s eyes had turned into crescents from smiling, mumbling, \u201cIndeed, kindness is always rewarded!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang looted the corpse again. He had finally gotten something that was not for Priests!</p><br/><p>[Golden Venomous Python King\u2019s Gall]: Quest Item!</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You have obtained 15 silver coins!\u2019</p><br/><p>With the last item looted, the boss\u2019 corpse disappeared instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still the chest!\u201d Zhang Yang rubbed his palms and rushed towards the Gray-Silver Chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! A treasure chest!\u201d Little Snow's eyes radiated with interest. \u201cLet me open it! Let me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since they were in the same party, it did not matter who had opened the chest. Zhang Yang moved aside.</p><br/><p>Little Snow threw herself on the chest and rested her cheek on the lid of the chest as her hands caressed the chest. Her indulgent expression scaring Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>A fortune-loving and narcissistic elder sister who was terrible at directions!</p><br/><p>After some time, Little Snow had finally opened the chest with great reluctance under Zhang Yang\u2019s urge. The unwillingness written on her face was as if Zhang Yang had murdered her father.</p><br/><p>10%, 20%\u2026 100%! The chest opened and Little Snow stuffed her hand inside.</p><br/><p>[Silver-Scaled Sword] (Gray-Silver, One-handed Sword)</p><br/><p>Weapon Attack: 197 \u2013 219</p><br/><p>Attack Interval: 2.6 seconds</p><br/><p>DPS: 80</p><br/><p>Equipped Effect: Increases \u2019s rate by 1%.</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 20</p><br/><p>Jackpot! This [Silver-Scaled Sword] would really put his current [Refined Iron Sword]'s 16 \u2013 24 Weapon Attack to shame! Since Yellow-Gold equipment could only be obtained from Level 50 bosses, he could use this sword until he had reached that level!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang looked at Little Snow and thought to himself, \u201cIs this yin and yang1 \u2013 they\u2019re complementing each other as he had looted her equipment while she looted his?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! Such a pretty sword!\u201d Little Snow picked up the [Silver-Scaled Sword]. Before rolling, anyone who was eligible to roll for the loot could pick up the equipment but was unable to equip it nor store it in their inventory.</p><br/><p>It was obvious that men and women had completely different perspectives. What Zhang Yang had cared about was [Silver-Scaled Sword]'s supreme functionality while Little Snow had only cared about its appearance.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang rolled 42 points while Little Snow passed without hesitation. The strongest one-handed sword at the current stage of the game then went into Zhang Yang\u2019s inventory.</p><br/><p>It was a shame that he had 2 more levels to go before he could equip it.</p><br/><p>[Recipe: Beginner Anti-Shadow Potion] (Alchemy Recipe)</p><br/><p>Use: You will learn to craft Beginner Anti-Shadow Potion.</p><br/><p>Requirement: Beginner Alchemy Skill</p><br/><p>Seriously\u2026 it came out! This thing's drop rate was not even one in ten thousand. In his previous life, even when the game had reached its mid-late stage, players who could craft this potion only numbered a handful!</p><br/><p>[Silver-Scaled Sword], Alchemy Recipe\u2026 these were extremely rare drops yet she had looted them both in one instance, what great Lucky Hands! Zhang Yang\u2019s own 2 points of Luck was crap in comparison to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Snow, this is something that I need, can you give it to me?\u201d This was a matter concerning his fortune, so Zhang Yang had to quickly speak up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will consider it if you call me \u2018elder sister\u2019!\u201d Little Snow was more than delighted.</p><br/><p>The lady did look like she was older but Zhang Yang\u2019s mental age was almost 30 years old, so it was extremely hard for him to utter the words \u2018elder sister\u2019!</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? You won\u2019t say it? Well then, I\u2019m going to roll now!\u201d teased Little Snow.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Snow, you\u2019re more like Mischievous Snow!\u201d Zhang Yang sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! That\u2019s why it\u2019s fun! Hey, are you saying it or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sis \u2013 ter\u201d Zhang Yang said gritting his teeth. He added another word under his breath, \u201cWitch!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood boy! Come, let big sis here give you a candy!\u201d Little Snow grinned, her eyes forming crescents.</p><br/><p>After Zhang Yang kept the recipe, he thought to himself, \u201cWait till I make a huge fortune with this recipe and make you cry your heart out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Snow looted once more and the last item popped out.</p><br/><p>[Treasure Map Piece (1)] (Gray-Silver)</p><br/><p>Use: Put together all 3 [Treasure Map Piece]s and obtain a [Complete Treasure Map].</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang checked his inventory. Right now, he had piece (1) and piece (3). This piece would be a recurring one so he unhesitatingly passed. He was extremely contented with the [Silver-Scaled Sword] and the recipe.</p><br/><p>After Little Snow obtained the map piece, the chest dissipated slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, let\u2019s get out of here!\u201d said Zhang Yang as he went into the empty tree trunk. Little Snow hurriedly followed behind.</p><br/><p>As he moved forward, Zhang Yang had suddenly realized that the little blinking dot that had represented Little Snow on the mini-map had disappeared.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang quickly asked in the party channel, \u201cLittle Snow, where are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know!\u201d Little Snow replied, \u201cIt\u2019s dark everywhere!\u201d</p><br/><p>This woman could get lost even when she was following him. She was really something!</p><br/><p>\u201cStay there, I\u2019m coming!\u201d Zhang Yang could only say feebly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOK. But hurry, it\u2019s so dark here and the water is so cold. It doesn\u2019t feel nice at all!\u201d complained Little Snow.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Alright! I\u2019m coming now!\u201d</p><br/><p>The blinking dot had finally reappeared in his mini-map after some few hundred meters of swimming. Zhang Yang swam over to her and said, \u201cFollow me closely!\u201d</p><br/><p>She replied, \u201cI can\u2019t even see you, how am I supposed to follow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you read the map?\u201d Zhang Yang might have thought too highly of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cNope, I can\u2019t understand it. Gives me a headache!\u201d Little Snow replied.</p><br/><p>This was how a directionally-challenged idiot came about.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang sighed and extended his hand, \u201cThen grab on to my hand!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOK!\u201d</p><br/><p>Holding on to the idiot\u2019s hand, Zhang Yang led Little Snow out of the water. After 20 minutes of swimming, they finally saw daylight, both of them emerging from the bushes.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy hands are soft, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Little Snow asked out of the blue.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, they\u2019re alright!\u201d Zhang Yang casually replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long do you plan on holding them?\u201d Little Snow\u2019s tone was laced with a feeling of the calm before a storm.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang looked. Oh, he had forgotten to let go after holding her hands for so long.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, my bad! My bad!\u201d Zhang Yang let her hands go and took a step back to express his innocence.</p><br/><p>Little Snow looked at him haughtily and said, \u201cRascal, be careful next time! I\u2019m not someone you can easily take advantage of!\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking of arguing, Zhang Yang was not afraid of her. Before he had confirmed his relationship with Lin Yu, he still had his fair share of dating women. He just wanted to avoid causing trouble as he would rather not have any affairs with the opposite sex. With a light smile, Zhang Yang said, \u201cI\u2019ll be on my way to complete a quest. See you next time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang left the party and headed towards Deckard. He lifted and waved his left hand to bid farewell.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch! Rascal!\u201d Little Snow murmured and opened the voice messenger.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello! Cousin, are you calling me to pick you up cause you\u2019re lost again?\u201d A crisp voice of a young girl came through, \u201cHow many times would this be? Come on cousin, stop making a fool out of yourself! You\u2019re a Cambridge graduate, how can you have less sense of direction than me, a high schooler?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! I majored in Business Administration and not Tourism or Geology or even Archeology. Can\u2019t I get lost?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCous, you\u2019ve gotten lost too many a time, don\u2019t you think? Fine, fine, fine! I\u2019m done arguing with you. Where are you? I\u2019ll come and pick you up!\u201d The girl on the other side of the line gave in.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho asked you to pick me up? I\u2019m not lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Then why did you call me? I was in the middle of grinding!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI met that Zhan Yu just now! Hm, he\u2019s strong indeed! Stronger than you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWaaaa, I\u2019m a Berserker. Why would you compare me to him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019m just comparing!\u201d Little Snow stretched lazily and said, \u201cHe\u2019s indeed someone worth recruiting!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, go pull him in! Hehe, you have big boobs. Didn\u2019t they say that guys like big boobs? He\u2019s sure to be enticed by you!\u201d the girl on the other side of the line laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little brat, your boobs are as flat as a sunny side up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHan Ying Xue, I\u2019m warning you! No comments about my breasts!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch! Sunny-side-up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Milk cow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Returning to Deckard, Zhang Yang passed the [Golden Venomous Python King\u2019s Gall] over and the head physician\u2019s eyes were wide open, \u201cThis is really the Python King\u2019s Gall! I can feel it! This soft sac contains such poisonous venom! It\u2019s shocking! Adventurer, I thank you from the bottom of my heart!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You have completed the quest: The Last Python Gall. Obtained 10,000 EXP!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You have learned the skill !\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Your skill has leveled up to Specialist!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You have obtained the title: Physician\u2019s Friend!\u2019</p><br/><p>A chain of notification rang at his ears, sounding absolutely melodious!</p><br/><p>He opened the window and saw that he had already learnt 5 types of bandages: [Linen Bandage], [Coarse Cloth Bandage], [Cotton Bandage], [Silk Bandage], and [Magic-Woven Bandage]. However, [Cotton Cloth] could only be found from looting humanoid monsters. As of now, he could only farm for [Coarse Cloth].</p><br/><p>[Coarse Cloth Bandage]: Recovers 500 HP over 10 seconds, channeling needed. Any damage or movement will cancel channeling duration.</p><br/><p>Cooldown: 1 minute.</p><br/><p>With the title Physician\u2019s Friend, effect would be doubled, healing 1,000 HP over 10 seconds. That would almost completely refill Zhang Yang\u2019s HP.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang took out a Teleportation Reagent and tore it. A magic circle formed under his feet and he arrived at White Jade Castle 10 seconds later.</p><br/><p>Translator Notes:</p><br/><p>1 y\u012bny\u00e1ng \u2013 Chinese philosophical theory where two seemingly opposite forces may complement each other.

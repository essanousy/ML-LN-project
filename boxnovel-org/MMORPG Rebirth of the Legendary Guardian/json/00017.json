After killing five waves of minions, they reached the second boss.</p><br/><p>A 3-man tall, green-skinned gnome was sitting in front of a large metal door napping, a sharp spear in its arms. The atmosphere was completely silent, as no other minions were around.</p><br/><p>[Babarerba the Sleepyhead] (Black-Steel Boss)</p><br/><p>Level: 13</p><br/><p>HP: 39,000</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do we fight it?\u201d the party\u2019s sight had settled on Zhang Yang. Unknowingly, he had become the party\u2019s core.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang recalled and said, \u201cThis boss has only 2 skills: first, , it will cast a water curse on a random melee player who is not holding the most aggro and cast a fire curse on a random ranged player. These two cursed players will keep losing HP but once both of them are together, the curse will be removed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, we can all fight in melee range distance. This way, there is no need to move everywhere, no?\u201d Hundred Shots had thought of an idea.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed, \u201cIf everyone did melee attacks, the boss will only cast the water curse. Two players will then keep losing HP and there\u2019ll be no way to dispel it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d the crowd nodded uniformly.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang began distributing responsibilities, \u201cLater when we start the fight, ranged players stand together, remember to stand at least 10 meters away from the boss, that\u2019d be around this line. I will position the boss later, ranged attackers do not cross this line or else the boss will consider it as melee range distance. Melee players attack from the left side, whoever gets cursed should run to the center. Respond as quickly as possible, otherwise it\u2019ll be a burden to the healers. After the curse is removed, return immediately to your original positions!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang continued, \u201cThe boss\u2019 second skill is to summon a puppet to aid him in battle at every 25% HP loss. The puppet\u2019s HP is low, and should be around 3,000 HP in Normal Mode but its damage is sky-high! That is why we must nuke it the moment the puppet is summoned! You guys don\u2019t have to worry about aggro, I\u2019ll be the first to pull it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone instinctively looked at Kindling Chest Hair. Usually the main tank would pull the boss\u2019 aggro while the off-tank would pull the minions\u2019. Things would then work out flawlessly. Obviously, Kindling Chest Hair was completely undependable. If he were to pull minions, those minions could end up flying everywhere!</p><br/><p>Kindling Chest Hair was annoyed to the point of rage by the team\u2019s stare, \u201cWhat are you looking at?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPay attention. Even when the puppet is summoned, the boss will still cast , so always remember to run to the center to dispel the curse!\u201d Zhang Yang reminded.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d the crowd nodded again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Start the fight!\u201d Zhang Yang waved his sword and did a towards the boss.</p><br/><p>\u201c-78!\u201d Normal attack.</p><br/><p>\u201c-138!\u201d .</p><br/><p>Babarerba recovered quickly and with a deafening shriek, it had thrusted towards Zhang Yang with its spear.</p><br/><p>\u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c-34!\u201d reflected damage.</p><br/><p>\u201c-99!\u201d .</p><br/><p>\u201c-55!\u201d Normal attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cAttack now!\u201d Zhang Yang commanded in the party channel.</p><br/><p>The crowd moved onwards, melee fighters stood together, ranged fighters gathered on their end as well.</p><br/><p>In just a matter of time, Babarerba had casted .</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Player Snowy Death has been affected by , losing 70 HP per second. Effect will remain until player\u2019s death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Player Hundred Shots has been affected by , losing 70 HP per second. Effect will remain until player\u2019s death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without waiting for Zhang Yang\u2019s reminder, these two players had come out of their formation and headed towards each other. They got together quickly and split up instantly, returning to their positions and resumed their attack on the boss. The healers had also healed them, quickly restoring their HP.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell done! That\u2019s it!\u201d Zhang Yang complimented as encouragement.</p><br/><p>About 15 seconds later, Babarerba casted yet another , its targets this time were Floral Shorts and Ocean Despair.</p><br/><p>Ocean Despair had quickly gone to the center but Floral Shorts remained attacking the boss.</p><br/><p>\u201cFloral Shorts, quickly head to the center!\u201d Zhang Yang frowned as he yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cRun faster noob Knight, I\u2019m still attacking here!\u201d said Floral Shorts without a care.</p><br/><p>\u201cBloody idiot!\u201d Ocean Despair ran towards Floral Shorts in an instant. The moment the two of them were near each other, the spell was removed. Since Floral Shorts did not cooperate fully, they had taken a bit more time, causing them to lose over 200 HP. That was two-thirds worth of their HP value!</p><br/><p>Ocean Despair then ran back to his position and self-casted 3 times of . Only then did he manage to recover his lost HP, his expression vicious.</p><br/><p>Babarerba\u2019s HP had been lowered to the 75% mark soon after.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamned intruders, all of you must die!\u201d Babarerba raised its spear and began to chant a spell, \u201cCome forth demon from the depth of the abyss, bring evil with you into this realm!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Babarerba has summoned Demon Puppet Tasair!\u201d</p><br/><p>A hexagram magic circle appeared underneath Babarerba\u2019s feet. As a dim light flickered, a red demon only half a man\u2019s height had appeared by its side, the demon\u2019s long tail extended from its hip. It had sharp teeth, and deep green-colored eyes.</p><br/><p>[Tasair, Babarerba\u2019s Demon Puppet] (Elite)</p><br/><p>Level: 13</p><br/><p>HP: 3,000</p><br/><p>This was a minor demon, also known as an \u2018imp\u2019, the lowest ranked among the demons.</p><br/><p>\u201cTasair needs a sacrifice!\u201d The demon shrieked and set its sight on Prideful Babysitter, leaping towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang dashed towards Tasair and landed a slash on it with his sword.</p><br/><p>\u201c-62!\u201d Normal attack.</p><br/><p>\u201c-142!\u201d .</p><br/><p>\u201cTarget the imp! Nuke it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tasair recovered from the stun and leaped towards Zhang Yang to attack him.</p><br/><p>\u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c-39!\u201d reflected damage.</p><br/><p>\u201c-98!\u201d .</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang lured Tasair towards Babarerba and when both the monsters were together, he crouched, evading both their attacks, and returned to his original position.</p><br/><p>Tasair\u2019s HP was very low and it was immediately killed under the crowd\u2019s combined attacks. After that, the party refocused their attacks on Babarerba.</p><br/><p>It did not take long for Babarerba\u2019s HP to hit the 50% mark.</p><br/><p>\u201cIntruders! Your attacks have hurt Babarerba! Babarerba is angry now!\u201d Babarerba raised its spear again and began his chant, \u201cCome forth demon from the depth of the abyss, bring evil with you into this realm!\u201d</p><br/><p>A hexagram magic circle appeared once again underneath Babarerba\u2019s feet. This time, a blue fat demon appeared by his side. It had no legs, but there was a black malicious cloud floating under it. There were faces with only eyes on both the front and back of the demon.</p><br/><p>[Gluttony, Babarerba\u2019s Demon Puppet] (Elite)</p><br/><p>Level: 13</p><br/><p>HP: 3,000</p><br/><p>This floating demon, due to its blue-colored body and fat shape, was also called \u201cBlue Fatty\u201d by the players. This demon was one rank higher than the previous one but both monsters\u2019 attacks and HP were similar here in the Normal Mode dungeon raid, only differing in their appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnbaratumargutton!\u201d Gluttony let out a weird low noise and floated towards Snowy Death.</p><br/><p>\u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang immediately took over and did a blow, \u201c-59\u201d damage text floating from the top of Gluttony\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c-39!\u201d reflected damage.</p><br/><p>\u201c-98!\u201d .</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Player Kindling Chest Hair has been affected by , losing 70 HP per second. Effect will remain until player\u2019s death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Player Prideful Precepts has been affected by , losing 70 HP per second. Effect will remain until player\u2019s death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Babarerba had taken the chance to cast during the chaos.</p><br/><p>\u201cMove quickly!\u201d Zhang Yang frowned as he reminded them.</p><br/><p>Kindling Chest Hair went on clashing with the boss like he had not heard a thing\u2026</p><br/><p>Prideful Precepts remained unmoving, shooting Frost Arrows...</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck me, you two better start moving now. Your fucking HP is dropping too fast, I can\u2019t keep up!\u201d Ocean Despair shouted angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cBullshit, I\u2019m attacking! Healing is supposed to be you healers\u2019 job! Why else do we need you to raid the dungeon with huh?!\u201d Prideful Precepts answered arrogantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine! Fine! Do it your way. I\u2019m not going to heal anymore!\u201d Ocean Despair stopped his actions.</p><br/><p>Prideful Babysitter was desperately healing but even if he were to heal one-to-one, he would not be able to keep going. What else could he do when there were two? He then said, \u201cPrecepts, Hairy, you two better get going now, I really can\u2019t keep this up anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did the two of them stop what they were doing unwillingly, looked around and then ran towards each other.</p><br/><p>After a few steps, Prideful Precepts\u2019 HP had dropped to rock-bottom, Prideful Babysitter was nearly done casting his healing spell but Prideful Magus had then died from .</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Player Prideful Magus has died!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSh*tty noob Knight! F*ck you!\u201d Prideful Magus cussed, \u201cHow the f*ck are you a healer? What the f*ck were you doing not healing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I ever f*cking heal you dogs with even another single drop of HP, I really am a shitty noob Knight!\u201d Ocean Despair scolded back.</p><br/><p>Without , Kindling Chest Hair could not dispel the . He was barely alive from his vast vitality, as he shouted, \u201cShut the f*ck up and start healing me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ocean Despair did absolutely nothing, determined to turn against everyone in Pride.</p><br/><p>Prideful Babysitter had been healing Kindling Chest Hair constantly but how could he heal in time, especially when he was alone? Kindling Chest Hair\u2019s HP loss was much faster than his healing speed. Within seconds, Kindling Chest Hair died as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Player Kindling Chest Hair has died!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou f*cking noob Knight! F*ck your entire family!\u201d Kindling Chest Hair too cussed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Player Prideful Magus was expelled from the party!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Player Kindling Chest Hair was expelled from the party!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang smiled faintly as two notifications rang out, \u201cToo noisy, it\u2019s disturbing the fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>Floral Shorts had wanted to rebuke but he held back and said, \u201cOK, just add them back when the battle is over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gluttony was killed promptly, and the battle\u2019s rhythm returned to its normal pace.</p><br/><p>Countering was actually not difficult, they were in Normal Mode after all. With the absence of both of Pride\u2019s barbarians, the party\u2019s efficiency had significantly increased with each player running towards each other almost instantly once they were cursed. The pace lasted until well after Babarerba summoned its third demon, as they finished killing the boss rather quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! The party you are in has killed Babarerba! Obtained 4,924 EXP (50 points Party Bonus)!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

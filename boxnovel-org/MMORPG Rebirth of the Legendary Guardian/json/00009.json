The third one though, took him a whole hour.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat luck!\u201d Zhang Yang examined his hands as he walked back to the village.</p><br/><p>He checked his EXP gauge and realized it had already reached 73%, not far from advancing to the next level. After all, he had been going beyond his level and grinding on Level 10 monsters. The EXP obtained were noticeably much more.</p><br/><p>Returning to Farion to submit the quest, the man had rewarded him a handsome amount of 5,000 EXP and said, \u201cYoung warrior, you\u2019ve completed the task I entrusted you with, again and again, leaving me an impression that you do have slight talent! Alright, this is the last material needed \u2013 The Frost Giant\u2019s Soul! Different Frost Giants would have different power in their souls and of course, different strength levels. You may select the difficulty to challenge according to your own capability and courage!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! You may choose one of the following difficulty levels to complete for this quest. The higher the difficulty level, the better the reward! Please choose: Extremely Difficult, Hard, Average, Easy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExtremely Difficult!\u201d Zhang Yang decided without hesitation. Obviously, the chance of obtaining \u2018Perfect\u2019 score would only be available in this level of difficulty.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, a bold selection! I hope that you\u2019re as what you\u2019ve chosen to face, greenhorn!\u201d Farion passed Zhang Yang a sparkling crystal-like rock. \u201cTake this Frost Stone and place it in the center of the magic circle in the basement. The circle will be activated automatically and it will summon the Frost Giant!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! You have accepted the quest: Materials to Craft a Blade (III)!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! You have obtained the item, Frost Stone!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Materials to Craft a Blade (III)] (Difficulty Level: S)</p><br/><p>Quest Description: To obtain the last material, you must use the Frost Stone to summon the Frost Giant, defeat it, collect its soul and pass it to Farion. This quest must be completed alone. The quest will fail automatically once a second player gains aggro from the Frost Giant.</p><br/><p>Progress: Collect Frost Giant\u2019s Soul 0/1</p><br/><p>S-Level quest, it looked like the time to obtain the ultimate reward had finally arrived!</p><br/><p>The basement was situated underneath the Village Hall. Zhang Yang spent 5 to 6 minutes to reach the base walking through a winding path. He had wondered about the purpose of this basement previously when he first played the game. He had finally gotten his answer now.</p><br/><p>The basement was lit with torches all around and was very spacious. Right in the center was an intricately drawn magic circle. Zhang Yang took out the Frost Stone from his inventory and mounted it to the empty hollow within the circle.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Endless white light emanated from the ground, dazzling and captivating! A low voice then echoed in the basement.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2026Who summons Malatog! Malatog was slumbering. Whoever awakes Malatog must receive a frosty punishment!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHong!\u201d</p><br/><p>A giant with a height of 6 to 7 men appeared in the middle of the magic circle. Its entire body was a sky-blue color and it exuded penetrating chilliness, dropping the basement\u2019s temperature by several degrees within seconds!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou \u2013 a mere mortal, dares to disturb Malatog\u2019s sweet dream! Malatog will crush you!\u201d The blue giant immediately noticed Zhang Yang and threw its fist towards him.</p><br/><p>[Malatog] (Elite)</p><br/><p>Level : 10</p><br/><p>HP : 5000</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang stepped back and used on it. In an instant, a starry effect appeared above Malatog\u2019s head indicating it had been stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201c-18!\u201d</p><br/><p>He swung his sword only to inflict a pitiful 18-point damage! Such strong defense!</p><br/><p>It was a shame that the effects of the Experimental Poison had long since disappeared and as the poison could only be bought once per player, Zhang Yang would have to rely on himself to slowly defeat it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDespicable ant, you\u2019ve angered Malatog!\u201d Malatog lifted his fist and threw it at Zhang Yang again in rage.</p><br/><p>\u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c-17!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a thick-skinned creature!\u201d Zhang Yang murmured, raising his shield as he activated .</p><br/><p>\u201c-54!\u201d</p><br/><p>Malatog let out a cry of pain and anger after receiving the blow. It then raised its big foot and took a step forward, wanting to stomp on Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201c-19!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c-19!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the resulting damage from one normal attack followed by a was not much at all, it had instead made Malatog even angrier.</p><br/><p>Battling someone as agile as Zhang Yang, it would seem like Malatog was playing a game of Whack-a-Mole. Even though he had the advantage with his outstanding strength, he could hardly land a hit on Zhang Yang but instead kept receiving damage.</p><br/><p>\u201c90%! 80%! 70%! 60% 50%!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPuny mortal! Taste the Frost God\u2019s rage!\u201d Malatog suddenly crouched and slammed the ground with both his fists. Immediately, countless spear-like ice spikes pierced up through the ground.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang had never encountered such a monster, so naturally he would not have known what kind of attacks it would use. Even though he was already cautious the moment it spoke, because he would never have known what to expect, how was he supposed to figure out his strategy to counter?!</p><br/><p>In an instance, Zhang Yang had maximized his athletic skill to the best he could, skillfully dodging each icicle with grace.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! You have been attacked by an icicle. You have lost 30 HP!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! You have been attacked by an icicle. You have lost 30 HP!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The system notification had rang 5 times consecutively in his ears. Even though Zhang Yang had pushed his speed to the limit, he was still unable to be at his best due to the character\u2019s own agility constraint. As a result of it, he had received damage from 5 icicles and had his HP reduced tremendously.</p><br/><p>And this was Zhang Yang. If it had been someone else, they would have been completely annihilated by this monster\u2019s special skill.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang only had a total HP of 190 and it had been instantly reduced to 40. He tapped a bottle of Beginner Healing Potion. A \u201c+100\u201d green text floated across his head and his HP bar instantly went up again.</p><br/><p>The Red Pot had a 30-second cooldown time, so it was fortunate that the move by Malatog did not appear frequently, otherwise the cooldown period would have been too long.</p><br/><p>\u201cMalatog will smash your bones to smithereens!\u201d the Frost Giant stood up again and everything returned to how it was.</p><br/><p>\u201c40%! 30%! 20%! 10%!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang began to feel anxious. There would be a chance for a monster to turn \u2018berserk\u2019 when its HP had fallen to 10%. Once they had entered the state, their attack activation rate would drastically increase, and that would be the most dangerous part of a battle. Even if Zhang Yang was highly skilled, he would not have been able to withstand 3 to 4 continuous waves of a boss\u2019 special attack.</p><br/><p>Luckily, it did not turn red!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang let out a sigh of relief and thought to himself. This quest could only be completed by a single player. The monster\u2019s skill was already capable of killing a player instantly, if it had entered Berserk state, how would it be possible to clear?</p><br/><p>\u201c3%! 2%! 1%!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDespicable mortal! Malatog will return! Malatog will\u2026!\u201d As the last drop of HP vanished, Malatog was finally defeated. Its gigantic body fell with a thundering thud.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu!\u201d Zhang Yang exhaled a puff of air. He finally completed it!</p><br/><p>The magic circle reactivated and the Frost Giant\u2019s corpse began to shrink until it finally became a small blue marble the size of a regular fist.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this is the Frost Giant\u2019s Soul?\u201d Zhang Yang picked up the marble as he scanned the entire room. \u201cF*cking hell! How come there aren\u2019t any drops when I\u2019ve just killed a freaking boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang returned from the basement annoyed and handed over the marble to Farion.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung man, you\u2019ve proven your strength and ability. I have to admit, you would be an amazing Warrior in the future!\u201d Farion waved his hand invitingly and said, \u201cCome with me. Now that all the materials have been gathered, I will craft you an indestructible blade!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! You\u2019ve completed the quest : Materials to Craft a Blade (III). Gained 10,000EXP!\u201d</p><br/><p>Still, he had yet to receive the ultimate reward. Zhang Yang patiently followed Farion to the village\u2019s Blacksmith Shop.</p><br/><p>Farion and the owner greeted each other and he took out all sorts of materials. \u201cDang! Dang! Dang!\u201d Farion lifted the metal hammer and began to smith.</p><br/><p>Fortunately since this was a game, everything progressed very quickly. Within half a minute, a shiny sharp sword had appeared in Farion\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake this, young warrior. Let it be your most loyal companion and drink up your enemies\u2019 blood!\u201d Furion tossed the sword to Zhang Yang and retrieved a red-colored book, \u201cThis is filled with skills I\u2019ve learned in battles. Now, I shall give it to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! You have obtained the item Refined Iron Sword!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! You have obtained the skill book \u2018Horizontal Sweep\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! You have completed the Hidden Class Quest: Farion\u2019s Request. Quest Score: Perfect! Gained 20,000 EXP!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! You have obtained the reward: 1 SP!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Congratulations on achieving Level 8. All attributes +1 and obtained 5 free AP!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Congratulations! You are the first player to complete a hidden quest and to obtain a \u2018Perfect\u2019 score. This achievement will be recorded in the Hall of Fame! Do you wish to announce your name so that the world can praise your mightiness?\u201d</p><br/><p>Announcing it again? Zhang Yang gave it some thought but eventually still decided on \u201cReject\u201d.</p><br/><p>In an instant, the neglected quiet world channel was once again filled with the server announcement\u2019s red text!</p><br/><p>\u201cServer announcement: Player (Name Hidden) is the first to have successfully completed a hidden quest and obtained a \u2018Perfect\u2019 score (China Server). This achievement will be recorded in the Hall of Fame! Please celebrate and cheer for him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cServer announcement: Player (Name Hidden) is the first to have successfully completed a hidden quest and obtained a \u2018Perfect\u2019 score (China Server), obtaining 10 Gold Coins from the System Rewards!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cServer announcement: Player (Name Hidden) is the first to have successfully completed a hidden quest and obtained a \u2018Perfect\u2019 score (China Server). 500 Reputation Points across all races in the league are awarded!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! You\u2019ve received an extra reward: Luck +1!\u201d</p><br/><p>Within a day, the server had flashed red twice, causing commotion among the players in the entire China region once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is just crazy! He actually completed a hidden quest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGod! He even got a \u2018Perfect\u2019 score! I saw a statement on the official website saying the difficulty setting in achieving a \u2018Perfect\u2019 score could only be completed by one in a million!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder what the rewards are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFucking shit server, why have I not encountered a hidden quest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFace problem!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCharacter problem!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWash your hands after taking a dump!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, just throwing it out there. Which hand do you use to wipe your ass after taking a shit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeft hand!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight hand!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight hand!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI use toilet paper! You guys have a weird fetish!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like that, the conversation took a rather interesting yet different turn very quickly.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang opened his inventory to check the rewards from this quest.</p><br/><p>[Refined Iron Sword] (Black-Steel, One-Handed Sword)</p><br/><p>Weapon Attack: 16 \u2013 24</p><br/><p>Attack Interval: 2 seconds</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 10</p><br/><p>-- At present, most players were still grinding tirelessly to obtain rewarded weapons from completing the Level 5 Class Quest while Zhang Yang had already obtained a Level 10 Black \u2013Steel rarity weapon! If word got out, those players who had been grinding relentlessly would definitely be devastated!</p><br/><p>[Horizontal Sweep] (Skill Book)</p><br/><p>Use: Grants the skill \u201cHorizontal Sweep\u201d</p><br/><p>Bound.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang was a little furious. He had obviously gotten a \u2018Perfect\u2019 score yet his reward was similar to those of \u2018Average\u2019 score? This was ridiculous! Zhang Yang tapped the skill book against his body and a new skill appeared in his skill window after giving out a bright light.</p><br/><p>[Horizontal Sweep]: Attacks all nearby enemies, dealing 200% melee damage to every target. Cost: 20 Rage. Cooldown time: 10 seconds. Requirement: Melee Weapon.</p><br/><p>200% melee damage?!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang\u2019s eyes glinted. He clearly remembered the which the mining fanatic had gotten could only deal 100% melee damage!</p><br/><p>Oh perfect! Now this reward would have been the right match for \u2018Perfect\u2019 score!</p><br/><p>Hooray!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

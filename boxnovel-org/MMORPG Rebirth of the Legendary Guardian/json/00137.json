His face was full of agony and his pair of coffee-brown eyeballs were emitting an evil aura that provoked evil thoughts just by the sight of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cSha Sha Sha\u2026 I, Terpot Ryhar will be back, for sure!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sith spoke out in a low and husky voice before\u2026 \u2018thud\u2019, collapsing onto the ground facing up at the sky.</p><br/><p>Oh f*ck, an evil spiritual possession had just happened!</p><br/><p>Gong\u2026</p><br/><p>The door was knocked open, with about 10 dwarf guards charging in. Every one of them were staring at Zhang Yang with their angry eyes, pointing their wielded weapons towards Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sly human bastard, how dare you use trickery to enter our castle with the purpose to ruin our kind?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>The rage was fiery among the crowd, with everyone gritting their teeth together, seemingly wanting to crush and burn Zhang Yang into ashes.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang quickly raised his both hands up and said, \u201cThis was not my doing!\u201d It seemed like he had triggered a new quest.</p><br/><p>\u201cHalt!\u201d an impressive and dignified voice came from afar, and every dwarf in the room obediently put away the weapons. They opened out a path in between them, paying their respects to a red hair dwarf with a red beard; The Great Smith Markan.</p><br/><p>\u201cA very strong evil force!\u201d Markan stopped by Sith\u2019s side, examined him thoroughly and said, \u201cSith\u2019s soul is being engulfed by an evil force as we speak, his body is also turning into one of the undead in a slow manner!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing such words, the Dwarves were even more enraged, pulling their weapons out again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe, this young man has a pure and noble soul, he would never be capable of such things!\u201d Markan tried to back Zhang Yang up.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Sir Markan, why did something happened to Sith the moment he came? Besides, only two of them were in the room!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, it must be him setting Sith up with his poisonous hands!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fiend, release Sith of your witchcraft at once!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang sighed and said, \u201cThe evil sorcerer who corrupted Barga\u2019s soul has infused his evil force into the Bow of the Fallen Moon, I think. He was just simply waiting for me to pass the bow to Sith, letting the evil forces infest onto Sith\u2019s body, leading to this transformation!\u201d</p><br/><p>Markan picked the Bow of the Fallen Moon up from Sith\u2019s hand, looked at it for a good while and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, for it is real, the relic still contains a sense of evil force in it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang spread out both of his hands and said. \u201cNow, that proves me to be innocent, right?\u201d As of just now, he tried to use a teleporting scroll, but the system hinted him that the item was temporary unavailable!</p><br/><p>Markan pondered for a moment, then he said, \u201cEven if this was not your intention in the first place, but it was definitely because of the thing you brought, Sith has to suffer this way! So, you must save him, get him back!\u201d</p><br/><p>The old fellow was such a sly. What was sent back was one of the relics of the Dwarves, but now he intend to cover it up rashly with the word \u2018the thing you brought\u2019 to omit the credits by bringing up the matter about wounding one of his! So, there would always be old sly people, even among simple Dwarves!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang said, \u201cBut I am not a Priest, nor a Sacred Knight, I have nothing to disperse evil spell!\u201d</p><br/><p>Markan pondered for a while again, and said, \u201cDeep in the mountains of Sivar Hills, there is a Fountain of Soul. Drinking the water from the fountain can disperse any evil spells! Young warrior, acquire the water from the Fountain of Soul to me, I beg of you, to save Sith!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You accepted a quest: Fountain of Soul! The quest cannot be deleted, before the quest is completed, you will be affected by the effect of the \u2018Dwarf's Warning\u2019!\u2019</p><br/><p>[Dwarf's Warning]: You are burdened with a dwarf\u2019s life, go save him quickly! In this period of time, you are forbidden to use any teleportation equipment, entering any main cities will result in banishment!</p><br/><p>This was just too ruthless!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang opened up his quest list to check on the description of the quest.</p><br/><p>[Fountain of Soul] (Quest: S-rank)</p><br/><p>Description: Acquire the Fountain of Soul, return back to save Sith The Smith - The Mead!</p><br/><p>Completion: Acquired Fountain of Soul 0/1</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Fountain of Soul is a relic of the Centaur Tribe, a fine rare one. It is not easy to acquire the Fountain of Soul from their hands! Centaurs are cruel and aggressive tribe, young warrior, you must be extra careful on this!\u201d Markan continued to say.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang tried to ask, \u201cMaster Markan, to be able to treat and cure Sith as soon as possible, can you spare some men for me to the way to acquire the fountain?\u201d</p><br/><p>Marken shook his head, then he spoke, \u201cThe relationship between the Centaur and the Dwarves have been tense over the time, and if our men happen to enter their territory, that would only mean war, and things will eventually get of hand!\u201d</p><br/><p>Player, to be tossed around; it was fated so!</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly go and return, I will have a priest to slow down the irruption of the evil force into Sith with best effort, but time is of short!\u201d Markan waved his hands, commanding the Dwarves to give way for Zhang Yang to take leave.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang left the Hammer Heart Castle. He summoned his Skeletal War Horse and advanced deep into the mountain forest.</p><br/><p>Carrying the effect of the \u2018Dwarf\u2019s Warning\u2019 on him while having the limitation to never return to any main cities, he could only choose to complete the mission at hand.</p><br/><p>Riding on a horse alone in the mountain forest, with only knowledge on the quest saying that the sacred fountain was deep within the mountains, without any specific coordinates given, he could only explore the mountain forest aimlessly like a headless fly, turning around at every corner within his sight.</p><br/><p>After for about an hour, no fountain was sighted; only a large number of monsters were attracted instead. Since he was unoccupied at the moment, Zhang Yang kept his battle horse aside by a mountain wall and cleared out all the monsters on his ass. By doing so, he acquired a large amount of experience points and two additional black-steel equipment pieces.</p><br/><p>Looking at the time, it was already 1 in the afternoon. So, Zhang Yang hustled down from the server for lunch.</p><br/><p>After a cup of hot tea and a moment of good rest, Zhang Yang reconnected onto the server and continued his search for the sacred fountain.</p><br/><p>Another half an hour or more has passed, and Zhang Yang had finally passed through the forest, but what he saw in front of him was a scene of big battle.</p><br/><p>Over 20 players or more were besieging a huge grizzly bear, about 7 melee combatants, 5 hunters, 8 mages, and 4 healers in additional. It was obvious that they were in the same guild, wearing the title \u2018Pride\u2019 above their heads.</p><br/><p>Although the besieged grizzly bear was a boss, but its HP was almost depleted out, with only 20% remaining at the looks of it.</p><br/><p>[Frantic Bear King] (Green-Copper, Beast)</p><br/><p>Level: 34</p><br/><p>HP: 120,000</p><br/><p>Among the people of \u2018Pride\u2019 guild, there was one player who did not engage in the battle. Instead, he had both of his hands behind his back, looking like a superior that gave commands to the crowd.</p><br/><p>[Player: Floating Fire Ball] (Pyromancer)</p><br/><p>Level: 30</p><br/><p>HP: 3,600</p><br/><p>Mana: 2,100</p><br/><p>For a moment there, Zhang Yang could not help himself but to let a murderous sight escape through his eyes!</p><br/><p>To secure his place in the first of the ranking list, this guy actually sent his underlings to murder those players before him! Fatty Han was pushed back a level because of him, furthermore, he also hired that trash 44 Bandits to assassinate Zhang Yang. But regretfully instead, 44 Bandits was brutally f*cked in the ass by Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang had long wanted to give him the dose of his own medicine, but since Floating Fire Ball was extremely afraid of dying, he would bring a large number of players along with him every time he went out for training, and the locations he went would also stay confidential. Zhang Yang did put all his focus on the dungeons and making money in his first phase in the game, with no time at all to free up his hands for taking him on.</p><br/><p>Now this coincidence was just convenient!</p><br/><p>Riding strategically on his horse, Zhang Yang charged towards Floating Fire Ball under high speed.</p><br/><p>Thud thud thud, the Skeletal War Horse had an unusual speed when it came to running, so when Floating Fire Ball heard the sound and turned over to see, Zhang Yang was just less than 10 meters away from him!</p><br/><p>Charge!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang instantly dispatched himself off the horse, rushed over like a lightning bolt.</p><br/><p>Floating Fire Ball was struck into a state of unconsciousness.</p><br/><p>With the summoning of his servant [Clear Lotus], Zhang Yang struck out his sword, slashing it at Floating Fire Ball, at the same instant, triggering his , causing his rage point to rush up to 67 points in just an instant!</p><br/><p>\u2018778!\u2019 Regular attack.</p><br/><p>\u20181,680!\u2019 .</p><br/><p>\u2018812!\u2019 .</p><br/><p>At the same time, [Clear Lotus] also dealt a series of damages on Floating Fire Ball from behind with her continuous strike from her dagger.</p><br/><p>\u2018-273!\u2019, \u2018-66!\u2019, \u2018-430!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cArgh!\u201d Those instant explosive high valued damages on Floating Fire Ball gave him no time to react at all, instantly got him killed in the state of his unconsciousness!</p><br/><p>Crying out in misery, he dropped a piece of silver shiny equipment and turned into a soul ready to report himself to the graveyard.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang had quick eyes and agile hands, reaching out his hands for a scoop and obtained the equipment into his hand. But it was just a Level 20 Gray-Silver set\u2019s Mage Chestplate!</p><br/><p>At this moment, only the other members of the \u2018Pride\u2019 guild managed to react to the situation. Other than a tank keeping the boss occupied and another mage healing the tank, all other members were aiming their assaults toward Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>Floating Fire Ball was furiously barking in the team channel as well, \u201cF*ck this sh*t, kill him for me! Kill him! It wasn\u2019t easy for me to reach Level 30 with 89% experience point, now I\u2019m being pushed back by this f*cker all the way back to 0% experience points! He also wasted my equipment set clothes that I bought for 3,000 gold!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a cold grin on his face and a stomp onto the ground, he activated his skill , instantly slowing 6 of the charging melee combatants. With a wave in the [Lover\u2019s Sword] in his hand, he performed a , instantly dealing 6 \u20181,500+\u2019 high damages, hitting off at least half of the HP bar of six players respectively!</p><br/><p>The servant [Clear Lotus], on the other hand, used to appear at the back of the priest who was healing the tank from aside, and started her ferocious attack onto the healer.</p><br/><p>Pak! Pak! Pak!</p><br/><p>A ranged mage and a hunter attacked heavily over, inconsistent numerical symbols such as \u2018-600\u2019, \u2018-200\u2019 that instantly floated up on the body of Zhang Yang. The high damage value was coming from the attack of the mage, and because hunter\u2019s attacks were physical, and they were reduced by the protective armor, therefore giving lesser damage values.</p><br/><p>So, that concluded that mages were the worst enemies of the roughened skin and thickened flesh, the Guardians!</p><br/><p>8 mages launched a volley assault together with another 5 Hunters that caused about 5,500 of damage, which nearly emptied out Zhang Yang\u2019s HP bar within seconds!</p><br/><p>! !</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang was so light on his feet, he had already rushed into the long-ranged camp of the \u2018Pride\u2019 guild, instantly beginning his epic slaughtering!</p><br/><p>With the in effect, the amount of HP Zhang Yang was losing mattered so little that he ignored it, and under the healing of , his health bar recovered back to full swiftly!</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the servant [Clear Lotus] had already handled the priest!</p><br/><p>One should know, the servant [Clear Lotus] was Silver-grade, her attack was on par with a Level 36 player wearing Level 30 Green-Copper equipment set. Meanwhile, the priest was only Level 29 wearing a full Level 20 Green-Copper equipment set, with a HP bar that did not exceed 2,400. So, how could he take all the ravages from [Clear Lotus]? He could only hold up for 8 to 9 seconds, and it would be the end for him after.</p><br/><p>Once the priest died, the tank could not hold up longer than a few more seconds! The boss instantly switched his aggro onto the mages of the \u2018Pride\u2019, with a loud roar of \u201cAow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the boss knew how to charge! With a strike on a mage, a wave of its paw, the boss swung and created a series of blur, and it was a range attributed attack! Immediately, the HP bars of the mage and a hunter around him were knocked off by approximately 1,500 points.</p><br/><p>The members of the \u2018Pride\u2019 were miserably screaming, for they did not know for a moment whether to get rid of the boss with little HP left or to attack Zhang Yang who had just restored his HP bar back to full.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

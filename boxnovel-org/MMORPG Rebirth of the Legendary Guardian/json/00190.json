With four arms and four swords, a Lamia\u2019s flurry of slashes would amount up to 4,000 damage points if she was attacking a non-tank player! But if she slashed a tank, the damage would be dispersed and the damage from each sword attack would be reduced by the tanks\u2019 defense value. Zhang Yang had his 450 damage absorption attribute, so he received only two digits worth of damage from Lamia\u2019s attack!</p><br/><p>Every tank was drooling when they saw Zhang Yang taking so little damage. If everyone had the same equipment as he did, these monsters would be a piece of cake for them!</p><br/><p>Besides Zhang Yang, everyone else was fighting at their best efforts as all of these were the elite monsters! These elite monsters had high HP, high defense and high attack, so it was not easy for the players to kill them. Rays of light appeared one after another on the battlefield as more players were sent back to White Jade Castle!</p><br/><p>180,000, 140,000, 100,000, 80,000\u2026 The number of players drastically reduced!</p><br/><p>The surviving players were the skillful players with good equipment. As a whole, the players were like a sharp sword covered in dust, and having the \u2018dust\u2019 removed, their attack capability immediately shot up! Although the number of players was dropping, it seemed to have hit a hard bracket that separated the truly elite from the average. The rate of deaths was slowing down.</p><br/><p>60,000, 40,000, 20,000, 10,000!</p><br/><p>Out of 2,000,000 players, they were left with only 5,000 players. The ninth wave monsters had finally been eliminated completely! These 5,000 players were the players with top equipment in White Jade Castle. Naturally, this meant that they were also minority that stood at the top of the pyramid hierarchy!</p><br/><p>Not only have they survived this much, they have also accumulated vast amounts of experience points and gained several levels! They usually required about seven days to gain a level after Level 50, but now those surviving players had gained at least one level. This battle had rewarded them handsomely with experience points, if nothing else!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang\u2019s level increased had to 52 and it was now only 28% away from Level 53!</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! The boss of the ninth wave monsters, Demon Snake Queen, Mimina has joined the battle!\u2019</p><br/><p>The ninth boss had appeared and she was different from the previous eight bosses which were with gigantic body size. This Demon snake queen as large as the regular Lamiae, but she had a thicker and longer snake-like body. Every time she moved her body a little, her 40 meters long and huge body would be revealed!</p><br/><p>She had six arms and held a sword in each hand, she was a Yellow-Gold boss!</p><br/><p>[Demon Snake Queen, Mimina] (Yellow-Gold, Demon)</p><br/><p>Level: 59</p><br/><p>HP: 20,000,000</p><br/><p>Defense: 1,000</p><br/><p>\u201cA Yellow-Gold boss really did appear!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone gazed at Mimina hungrily, they truly wanted the drops!</p><br/><p>Except for Zhang Yang and the gang, this was the first time the players actually encountered Yellow-Gold boss. Once they thought of the quality of Yellow-Gold equipment that was much more powerful than Gray-Silver, all somehow found new strength coursing in their veins!</p><br/><p>\u201cKill!\u201d Somebody shouted first, triggering the 5,000 survivors to rush at Mimina, their depressed mood greatly uplifted!</p><br/><p>\u201cNoob tank, let's go hurry up!\u201d Wei Yan Er had already summoned her Hell's stead and was shifting impatiently. Despite Zhang Yang and his gang\u2019s past experience with Yellow-Gold bosses, they were still greatly enticed.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang smiled and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to rush, they\u2019ll take a while to kill Mimina! Daffodil Daydream, sum up how much people, tanks and healers we left!\u201d</p><br/><p>After a while, Daffodil Daydream answered, \u201cWe have a total of 827 people, and we have 89 tanks, 118 healers and 620 attackers!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang nodded his head and said, \u201cHundred Shots, put everybody into a team!\u201d</p><br/><p>30 Seconds later, Lone Desert Smoke\u2019s remaining players were all formed into a huge team, the elites of the elite, the wheat separated from the chaff!</p><br/><p>\u201cZhan Yu, hurry up, kite the boss!\u201d Suddenly Snow Seeker sent a message in open channel.</p><br/><p>Sky Shaman quickly followed up, \u201cDamn it, Mimina\u2019s defense is so high, even after applying five stacks of , she still has 500 defense. Besides, her level is too high, I can only cause about 200 damage points to her with physical attacks while causes only 100 damage points, I cannot grab hold of the aggro!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? You\u2019re barely even trying, you were waiting for Mimina to kill the people who were OT! She\u2019s attacking you now because there\u2019s nothing else for her to hit!\u201d Crimson Fire complained.</p><br/><p>Mimina\u2019s defense was high, but she was relatively weaker to magic attacks. Spellcasters did not cause much damage to Mimina due to their differences in levels, but they still fared considerably better compared to the melee attackers. Spellcasters were in danger of going OT as they were gaining more aggro than the available tanks.</p><br/><p>Besides, Spellcasters did not have , unlike Hunters and Thieves. The moment Mimina targets them, they would be killed instantly as her six swords make quick work of them!</p><br/><p>Mimina had already killed several attackers, with 300 spellcasters making up most of the deaths!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed and replied on the open channel, \u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d He switched to party chat, \u201cTeam one, follow me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang led 50 people towards Mimina.</p><br/><p>All of the players who surrounded Mimina stood aside and opened up a way for Zhang Yang when they saw him coming. Why were they so polite? Obviously it was because they could not establish the aggro. With all the Spellcasters dead, healers would hold the highest aggro. If all the healers died, they would fail the expedition!</p><br/><p>\u2018!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018!\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang dashed towards Mimina and immediately hacked at her with his axe.</p><br/><p>\u2018-1,801!\u2019</p><br/><p>Because they had applied five stacks of on Mimina and Zhang Yang had , his attacks toward Mimina would not be reduced by her defense value! Besides, Zhang Yang was only seven levels behind Mimina. As long as the level difference did not exceed ten levels, Zhang Yang\u2019s attacks would not be penalized.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, he is so powerful!\u201d Sky Shaman could not help but swear. He could never accept the fact that a tank could deal so much damage, compared to his \u2018200\u2019 worth of damage points!</p><br/><p>\u2018-3,571!\u2019</p><br/><p>When Zhang Yang used , Sky Shaman almost cried out in front of everyone, complaining that Zhang Yang must be using cheats!</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, stop attacking, let me get a solid hold of the aggro!\u201d Zhang Yang shouted loudly.</p><br/><p>At this moment, nobody wanted to be killed by Mimina, all of them stopped attacking and patiently waited for Zhang Yang to establish aggro. Only Hunters could continue attacking as they had . The skill\u2019s cool down duration was short, unlike the variations that Thieves had -- requiring five whole minutes!</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Zhang Yang and his people continued attacking and healing as they started attacking alongside their leader. If anyone of them got to OT Mimina, Zhang Yang would have failed as a tank!</p><br/><p>Mimina was immune to , but Zhang Yang used only 15 seconds to establish Mimina\u2019s aggro! Mimina turned away from Sky Shaman and started Zhang Yang wildly.</p><br/><p>Sky Shaman\u2019s face was full of tears, he was afterall, one of the top tanks in White Jade Castle. It filled him with shame that Zhang Yang had acquired sufficient aggro in merely 15 seconds, while it had taken him a whole minute to do the same.</p><br/><p>Mimina did the Yellow-Gold boss title justice, each attack of her swords caused about 2,000 damage points and she always attacked with her six arms which would absolutely destroy any non-tank attackers at current the current phase of the game. Mimina had dealt more than 7,000 damage points to Sky Shaman but when she attacked Zhang Yang, the damage was reduced to 5,000!</p><br/><p>If Mimina\u2019s damage output was calculated as a single hit, then a single attack would cause up to 12,000 points of damage. By then, Zhang Yang\u2019s 450 damage absorption would have been pointless. But since he faced multiple, lower single attacks from the opponent, the damage absorption effect truly shone!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys can start!\u201d Zhang Yang sent a message in the open channel.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, those players who stopped attack just now, they started to attack zealously, causing plenty of damage to Mimina! This was the first time they met Yellow-Gold boss! Their excitement was just as it was for Wei Yan Er, Hundred Shots and the gang when they first met Evil Necromancer Zac!</p><br/><p>However, open world bosses would ranged skills and would be much harder to bring down!</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Mimina used !\u2019</p><br/><p>Mimina moved her body and used her long tail like a whip, lashing out at the enemies at her rear. Instantly, a bunch of \u20186,000\u2019 damage texts appeared on players\u2019 head and killed at least 100 players. Suddenly, there was a conical void at her back, where players had been snuffed out. It was 40 meters in radius, cleanly marking the spots where she had massacred the players. It was currently occupied by not more than seven players. These included five tanks, Wei Yan Er and Sun Xin Yu.</p><br/><p>Although Wei Yan Er and Sun Xin Yu were not tanks, they were equipped with Level 40 Gray-Silver equipment, a few Level 50 Gray-Silver and Yellow-Gold equipment. Along with Zhang Yang\u2019s , their HPs already exceeded 7,000, which enabled them to survive the !</p><br/><p>Suddenly everyone was shocked, the space behind Mimina was quickly vacated, everyone keeping close watch of her long tail. They quickly moved to the front, having no desire of taking another again!</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, was not only used at the rear of Mimina. She was actually capable of flicking her long tail all around her. After a while, Mimina used once again, striking the area in front of her and killing another 100 players! Their maneuvering had brought no change!</p><br/><p>Everybody was stunned at this point as they did not know if anywhere around her was safe! But the guild masters insisted that they kept up their attacks, so they had no choice but to funnel themselves into the empty spots, filled with dread as players who once stood there had been instantly killed!</p><br/><p>60%, 40%, 20%. Because of Mimina\u2019s high defense value, long HP and high level, most of the attackers had been wiped out. Ten minutes later, Mimina was doggedly hanging on with 10% HP!</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! The tenth wave of monsters fall from the sky, the battle is nearing its end!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the system notification rang and the tenth wave of attacks was coming soon!</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly, kill Mimina!\u201d Everyone yelled.</p><br/><p>If Mimina was reinforced with the tenth wave of monsters, the players would stand no chance whatsoever!</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>One after another, burning meteorites fell from the sky, crashing onto every single spot of the battlefield, leaving deep, vast craters. Out of those craters, gigantic rock monsters, with bodies covered in green flames climbed out, roaring with their arms spread open like Alpha Silverback Gorillas!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

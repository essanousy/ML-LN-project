Drizzler calmed her down immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Snow, please be a gentlewoman! Be a gentlewoman!\u201d</p><br/><p>While making the medicine, Zhang Yang looked up and had a glance of her \u201cassets\u201d. In his mind, he had a thought that time is like a woman\u2019s cleavage; it will appear once squeezed! We against the time, so we have to hurry. We\u2019re going to need to squeeze out more like Little Snow\u2019s cleavage to have enough!</p><br/><p>Little Snow caught Zhang Yang looking, and she chuckled while saying, \u201cIs it that nice to look at?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 perfectly rounded, crystal clear and very attractive!\u201d Zhang Yang replied with compliments.</p><br/><p>\u201cPervert!\u201d Drizzler despised Zhang Yang for saying such things, but she enviously gazed at Little Snow\u2019s bosoms too.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed and said, \u201cI was talking about her eyes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, idiot! Don\u2019t try to change the topic! Hurry up and share the profits with me! I looted that Alchemy recipe; the \u2018Great Lucky Hands\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Snow and Drizzler knew that the [Beginner Anti-Shadow Potion] was massively sold in the market these few days were the ones made by Zhang Yang. Being a money grubber and having recalled that she gave the recipe to him, Little Snow felt a deep sense of grief.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, here\u2019s a reward from me, then!\u201d Zhang Yang traded 54 silver coins to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn you, Zhan Yu! Are you trying to challenge me?!\u201d Little Snow hummed. She scammed him of 54 gold coins before; what a stingy guy!</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, Zhan Yu really picked up a goldmine this time!\u201d Hundred Shots smiled broadly. From his expression, he showed how happy he was for Zhang Yang without any sense of jealousy in mind.</p><br/><p>Drizzler could not help but to ask, \u201cNoob tank, how much gold coins have you actually earned?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang did not want to hide from them and gave his honest answer. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t selling well for the past few days, but it started selling out two days ago and after deducting the profit sharing and commissions, I could earn 300,000 gold coins in a day!\u201d With the majority of normal players rushing to Level 20, Zhang Yang\u2019s asset greatly rose to 6 million in just these three days.</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to my calculations, before most players could even achieve Level 30, this idiot here could earn nearly 40 million!\u201d Little Snow was quite shocked as it was not a small amount for her; even more so having earned it within a month!</p><br/><p>At this point, even Fatty Han could not help to speak out despite being quite the quiet one in front of a crowd, \u201cLovely Little Snow, why don\u2019t you follow our Little Yang and be the wife of a multimillionaire?\u201d</p><br/><p>But Fatty Han earned some from it as well. With Zhang Yang having seven \u201cdistributor\u201d friends and Fatty being his best friend, how could Zhang Yang not share the profit with him? Half of the overall amount of medicine were sold in White Jade Castle and the other half in the other seven main cities, and they shared 10 percent of the profit. Fatty earned the most as he had a net profit of nearly 50,000 gold coins within these three days, equaling to 300,000 to 400,000 dollars!</p><br/><p>\u201cTch!\u201d Drizzler immediately pursed her lips with utter disdain. \u201c40 million is just a small amount. My cousin\u2019s assets are-\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDrizzler!\u201d Little Snow chided loudly before Drilzler continued talking loudly.</p><br/><p>Though they did not get to know how much her assets were worth, they could guess from Drizzler\u2019s tone that it would definitely be more than 40 million; far more than 40 million!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang\u2019s curiosity increased and wondered, didn\u2019t I meet another person like Lin Yu with hundreds of millions worth of assets, being a daughter of a rich family as well?</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot Zhan Yu, the profit sharing is not necessary now but you have to treat me a meal!\u201d Little Snow was still unwilling to forgive him.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood! Treat us a meal!\u201d Drizzler\u2019s eyes shone.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang was left helpless. These cousins could be filthy rich, but they\u2019re still trying to swindle money out of me? Aren\u2019t these money-grubbers being a little too stingy?</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, where shall we eat?\u201d Zhang Yang just simply promised them. Even though the money was important, he realized that adequate relaxation was necessary, not to overwork himself. There would definitely be more business opportunities in \u2018God\u2019s Miracle\u2019 in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlue Sky Pub!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang frowned. \u201cPub?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? What\u2019s the problem with that place?\u201d Little Snow\u2019s beautiful eyes widened.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing. I just never thought you ladies would like going to pubs!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe!\u201d Drizzler smiled and interrupted. \u201cActually, I\u2019m the one who wants to witness a pub! But we heard that a pub is not safe at times, so we want you, the strong young man, to bring us there!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid that I could be a bad guy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter a few days of observation, Little Snow and I decided that you\u2019re reliable, and not despicable and rotten to the core like some Fatty!\u201d Drizzler blurted out, completely disregarding if Fatty was even there or not.</p><br/><p>Fatty Han suddenly cried out, throwing himself to Zhang Yang\u2019s leg and said, \u201cLittle Yang, you\u2019re the one who led me astray! When we were four years old, you brought me into those female bathing rooms and my boner was as hard as a rock looking at those aunties! My God!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hundred Shots shot his arrow aside, laughed maniacally and said, \u201cFatty, I never thought that you\u2019d have such a tragic life experience!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty Shit, I warn you! You\u2019re not allowed to talk dirty in front of Drizzler anymore!\u201d Little Snow was very serious about this.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang shook his head. \u201cChildren nowadays have been corrupted by bad examples on the internet even before we do. What things are there that they do not understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, he\u2019s still not allowed to talk dirty!\u201d Little Snow said arrogantly.</p><br/><p>Drizzler stood behind Little Snow and responded, \u201cYes, that\u2019s right and you guys should not pollute a clean and pure soul!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ve been feeling that something\u2019s not right here!\u201d Zhang Yang suddenly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there something not right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many of us are here actually?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFive!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWrong, it\u2019s six!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang and the four of them looked at the sixth person simultaneously; Frost Night. This cool woman kept her mouth shut, being stern and not bothered about their talking or joking around. However, she was not distrusted by them and cruelly killed the monsters which then scattered to pieces.</p><br/><p>\u201cNoob tank. She\u2019s really not an NPC?\u201d Drizzler gazed in awe at Frost Night\u2019s back, because she herself could die if she did not speak for a long time!</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s not, and she\u2019s just a little cool, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, she still looks like an NPC, regardless. Other than that, she could be a robot! Beep boop. I am robot No. 6870. Requesting orders.\u201d Drizzler imitated the tone of a robot and spoke word for word.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed, turned around and said, \u201cRobot No. 68\\0, come massage your master\u2019s back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to hell!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, what time are we going to the pub?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go after killing Marzerway!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToo bad I can\u2019t join since I can\u2019t come over from Yanjing!\u201d Hundred Shots regrettably said.</p><br/><p>Fatty Han tapped on Hundred Shots\u2019 shoulder, \u201cHaha! Hundred Shots, you already have a wife and son and you still want to court a lonely young woman in a pub? Harmony is important!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the midst of talking and laughing, they carried forward the fight. Zhang Yang continued to make the medicine while the rest were left to kill the monsters. He would only stop making medicine if he had to perform his role as a tank when facing a boss. They were fortunate enough after successfully after defeating all four stages of bosses to get a [Transform Hat] and a scroll!</p><br/><p>[Magic Scroll: Weakness (Level 1)]</p><br/><p>Use: Use [Weakness (Level 1)] on target, causing the target\u2019s damage and healing effects to be reduced by 10% and lasts for 60 seconds. This effect cannot be stacked together with any other similar type of effects. The bigger the gap between your level and target\u2019s level, the higher the failure rate of this magic effect.</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 20</p><br/><p>This is a good item! Zhang Yang praised the item in his heart and kept it into his inventory.</p><br/><p>After killing Shurian, the team looted a [Chaos Gem] and Zhang Yang successfully obtained it with 99 points from the dice roll. After using the gem, his inventory space was extended by 50 slots, slightly relieving his worry for inventory spaces.</p><br/><p>\u2018Server announcement: Sword and Fire Mercenary successfully broke the new ranking of Fastest Marzerway\u2019s Lair, Front Wing (Hardcore mode) Clearance. This glorious achievement will be recorded in the Fastest Hardcore Clearance Ranking Board (China Server) and please congratulate them!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Server announcement: Player Dominating Blade (Party Leader) broke the new ranking of Fastest Marzerway\u2019s Lair, Front Wing (Hardcore mode) Clearance. Obtained 10 gold coins, 1 piece of [Level 2 Gemstone] and 250 Reputation Points across all races in the league are awarded from the system reward!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Server announcement: Player 44 Bandit (Party Member) broke the new ranking\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>At that moment, the world channel was once again filled nonstop with the server announcement\u2019s red texts!</p><br/><p>Drizzler stuck her tongue out and said, \u201cSword and Fire Mercenary, they\u2019re so powerful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hundred Shots looked to Zhang Yang, \u201cTheir result was 17 minutes and 34 seconds! What do you think about their speed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang gently frowned. The duration set by the system for the Fastest Hardcore Mode Clearance was 220 minutes. Even if the \u201cTrash\u201d mercenaries shortened the duration record by 2 minutes, under the limited situations, it was still commendable if anyone could take it down even a second further!</p><br/><p>They were indeed the famous team in the previous life! They almost took up all the 5-man and 10-man dungeons\u2019 First Clear Achievement. If it were not for having insufficient manpower, they would have taken up the 20-man and 50-man dungeons\u2019 First Clear Achievement as well! In this life, Zhang Yang foresaw this predicament and grabbed all the current First Clear Achievement for the dungeons, which led the elite team to begin raiding the dungeons for the Fastest Clear Achievement!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still okay!\u201d Zhang Yang nodded his head and said, \u201cIf we\u2019ve prepared sufficiently and adjusted our class\u2019 positions wisely, I bet we can make it under 15 minutes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Server announcement: Sword and Fire Mercenary successfully broke the new ranking of Fastest Marzerway\u2019s Lair, Middle Wing (Hardcore mode) Clearance. This glorious achievement will be recorded in the Fastest Hardcore Clearance Ranking Board (China Server) and please congratulate them!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Server announcement: Player Floating Up (Party Leader) broke the new ranking of Fastest Marzerway\u2019s Lair, Middle Wing (Hardcore mode) Clearance. Obtained 10 Gold Coins, 1 piece of [Level 2 Gemstone] and 250 Reputation points across all races in the league are awarded from the system reward!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>In another few minutes, the world channel began to fill up once again with the server announcement\u2019s red texts!</p><br/><p>\u201cNow they\u2019re the opponents!\u201d Hundred Shots gasped in shock.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang frowned once more. Lone Desert Smoke was definitely stronger than Sword and Fire Mercenary in terms of capability for the 5-man team, but they had ten members who were able to fight, and Lone Desert Smoke could not be stronger than them in terms of teamwork strength! Aside from that, Zhang Yang only had six members including Frost Night and still lacked four more members that were able to fight!</p><br/><p>Another two Level 30 dungeons were 10-man dungeons and the current situations was against their odds! Besides, the bosses in those dungeons were different from Marzerway, not being able to be killed by any particular items or medicines only and the players would need to kill the boss \u201cfairly\u201d!</p><br/><p>The competitive pressure suddenly grew!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

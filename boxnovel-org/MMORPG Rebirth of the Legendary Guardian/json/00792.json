It\u2019s time for a change of pace,\" said Zhang Yang after all the assassin were killed.</p><br/><p>\"Huh? Why? Aren\u2019t we doing just fine here?\" said Wei Yan Er, a little disgruntled.</p><br/><p>\"Could you just\u2026urgh\u2026never mind. The players that had just attacked us were obviously rather noob. Even though we can\u2019t see their profile information, they obviously belonged to some random unheard-of guild. The person who sent them to us had no intention to kill us. They wanted to inflict psychological stress on us. In fact, it would. Right now, we will always be on the alert and that will be a little distracting.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ahh. I see now. Quite sneaky, aren\u2019t they.\"</p><br/><p>If anyone would have to kill Zhang Yang\u2019s party, they might have to engage their entire guild to do so. Unless they could bring in One Sword Stroke to fight toe to toe with Zhang Yang, there was no way they could kill him, much less when he is in his party! It would be impossible to do so, much less calling One Sword Stroke. Every professional player was extremely busy with leveling, and they would not have time to even take a bath! At most, they could hire some random players not to kill, but to stall them.</p><br/><p>Although it will be extremely hard, if Zhang Yang were killed incidentally, that would be bad for him.</p><br/><p>Now that everyone in the party had understood the severity of the scenario, Zhang Yang took the lead and change to a different place to grind. Everyone followed Zhang Yang on their flying mounts and made their way to a new place in no time at all. The entire mountain range was so vast that if the same group of assassins wanted to find them, it would be a matter of days.</p><br/><p>After vigorous grinding, Zhang Yang made it to Level 199. It was just one more Level, several more days to reach the Level 200 threshold! Following closely behind him were his party members at Level 198. All and all, no one was able to chase after Zhang Yang. Not even Sun Xin Yu, with the 50% bonus experience points Unique item. However, out of the top 10 players in the Level Ranking Board, Zhang Yang\u2019s party had only claimed 5 spots. The top three were Zhang Yang, Sun Xin Yu, and another outsider. Eventually, Zhang Yang realized that it would be impossible for the entire party to claim all the top 10 positions on the ranking board. It\u2019s like a tiny hangnail in the corner of your finger that you just could not ignore!</p><br/><p>\"Guys. It\u2019s our last spur. Besides eating and answering nature\u2019s call, no one is allowed to log out! We\u2019re aiming for the top 10 players in the world!\"</p><br/><p>\"HELL YEAH!\"</p><br/><p>\"But what about some me time?\"</p><br/><p>\"What me time?\"</p><br/><p>\"Me time. As in, me sandwiched between my babe\u2019s hoohah.\"</p><br/><p>\"Save it for later.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone laughed and agreed to do what Zhang Yang ordered. They would not want to stop at just top 10, instead, everyone wanted to try their best and aim for the top three! Zhang Yang and his party was not the only one. In fact, all professional players from all over the world were aiming for the same position and would die trying. Everyone had been training for more than 2 months now, just a little more and they would win. Why give up now!?</p><br/><p>As such, the current Level Ranking Board had significant changes at any time of any day. The player ranked fourth will be third during the day, and then drop to the fifth during the night. Even though Lone Desert Smoke had suffered a strong blow to the head during the scandal involving Zhang Yang and 4,000 women, the core members of Lone Desert Smoke were not greatly affected by it. In fact, everyone was giving all they had just to fight for the best! Have a look at the Level Ranking Board and everyone would agree that Lone Desert Smoke was in fact, doing extremely well. In the top 10 list, 5 of Lone Desert Smoke members were in it! Imagine the strength of the guild when players of the world, of 8 regions, of multiple main cities and millions of guilds, yet Lone Desert Smoke managed to squeeze in 5 of their members into the top 10 list.</p><br/><p>As the pressure increased, eventually, the fight between players had escalated to a chaotic condition. Countless of War Chariots roamed around the high leveled maps to search and destroy high-leveled players.</p><br/><p>As such, Zhang Yang had chosen to ignore the attackers and resorted to grinding in dungeons instead. It was not that Zhang Yang and his party could not kill the buggers. It would take up too much of their time! Besides, even though the monsters in the dungeon could not provide much experience points compared to the open-world, it was, at the very least, safe and secure.</p><br/><p>50%...80%...90%...</p><br/><p>All that\u2019s left for Zhang Yang was just that bit more to reach Level 200.</p><br/><p>\"Noobie tank! How much left till Level 200?\"</p><br/><p>\"Around 5%. I think I can reach Level 200 in three more days.\" Zhang Yang smiled like an idiot. They had been camping in the same dungeon for more than 10 days and was a little nauseating, killing the same old Spectre monsters over and over again!</p><br/><p>\"Urgh\u2026When this is all over, I\u2019ll take a week off and just enjoy my life!\" said Wei Yan Er with dried, bloodshot eyes. Even though she loved fighting monsters, it had been quite repulsive for even her. It was the same sensation as eating tofu alone for 3 months\u2019 straight.</p><br/><p>Instinctively, Zhang Yang rubbed his back pocket where his wallet used to be and realized that he was in the game. He jerked at Wei Yan Er\u2019s sudden outburst and said, \"Hey. Mind you. My cards are my cards! I wouldn\u2019t mind Han Ying Xue or Sun Xin Yu slashing all they want. But you\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Nyehehehe.\" Wei Yan Er stick her tongue out and said, \"Oh right! I almost forgot. Sister Yu Rou is really pregnant now, isn\u2019t she?\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh? Pregnant?\" Everyone was immediately triggered by the word \"pregnant\". Zhang Yang sighed heavily and went ahead to pull her eyelids out as hard as he could.</p><br/><p>\"How many times must I tell you! You just drop that kind of bombshell out in public!\" cried Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>\"Owieeeee!\" Wei Yan Er freed herself and ran behind Han Ying Xue.</p><br/><p>The news of Lou Yu Rou\u2019s pregnancy was only known to those who lived in the mansion with Zhang Yang. Not even Fatty Han knew about it.</p><br/><p>\"Wah! Little Yang! Did you really knocked up a superstar!?\" said Fatty Han with admiration. His eyes were practically sparkling. \"Awesome! You have my respect!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone knew the scandal of Zhang Yang was fake, but they had no idea that Zhang Yang was actually sleeping with a superstar! As such, everyone could not resist but started to bombarded Zhang Yang with millions of questions.</p><br/><p>F*ck it.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang merely continued slaying monsters and ignored the rest of the party. \"Please focus on one thing at a time. We are still racing for the top 10 level ranks!\"</p><br/><p>Lou Yu Rou had been pregnant for more than 2 months now. Although her womb had not grown too huge to be visible, the little girl would always find the chance to chat with Lou Yu Rou. She was, after all, her idol. Sometimes, when Lou Yu Rou is taking a nap at the lounge, Wei Yan Er would sneak up to her and gently cup her ears to her tummy and even talked to the little babe growing healthily inside her womb. She would talk to the baby as if the babe could really listen to her complaints about Zhang Yang. Yes. Mostly about Zhang Yang. Sometimes, Zhang Yang might believe that the little girl could be a good auntie to his children. Just sometimes. He only hoped that her dumbness would not be too contagious.</p><br/><p>Leveling from Level 199 to Level 200 was extremely tough. At then, most of the top 10 position in the Level Ranking Board were Level 199 players, with Zhang Yang holding strong on the first place. At the second place, was Sun Xin Yu with 78% experience points, and Hourglass Figure was at the third place with 78% experience points as well. Both of them were only 17% short of Zhang Yang. Right then, Zhang Yang was confident that if everyone goes smoothly, the champion would be him!</p><br/><p>Most of the players in the top 10 position knew that the only difference for them was the experience points gauge percentage. Anyone can overtake anyone at anytime. While players of Levels 198 or 197 were still trying to sabotage each other\u2019s training session, the Level 199 players were investing all their time and effort to reach the top.</p><br/><p>96%...97%...98%...99%...</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang sighed and stopped for a rest as he finished the dungeon run. \"Looks like after one more round, I\u2019d be Level 200!\"</p><br/><p>The first to reach Level 200 will not only obtain the system reward, but also meet the Level Requirement to finally equipping Celestial tier equipment. Zhang Yang had never thought of achieving such a feat in his past life, yet right then, he was only one step away from the glorious achievement. At most, after 30 minutes or so, he would be the first players in the entire game to reach Level 200 and also the first player to put on the first Celestial tier equipment!</p><br/><p>Everyone was excited for him. Imagine being in the same party and guild with the first player to reach the pinnacle.</p><br/><p>\"Haha! In just a few more minutes, those guys behind will be crying for their mommas!\" said Fatty Han as they were almost done with the dungeon. Fatty Han had only reached Level 199 just recently, and had no hopes of being in the top 10.</p><br/><p>\"I hope that the server would suddenly breaks down at that moment\u2026\" said Endless Starlight.</p><br/><p>\"Hey! Don\u2019t jinx it!\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang smirked. \"Three more\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang felt a sudden rush in his veins. Like a sudden burst of energy that runners feel when they see the finishing line. With one last swing, Zhang Yang killed the last monster and reached Level 200.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Congratulation! You have reached Level 200. Obtained 5 Attribute Points and 1 Skill Point!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Server Announcement: Player Zhan Yu is the first player to reach Level 200! As a result of his relentless vigor, he has acquired the skill \"Gates of Hell\" and 3 Luck attribute points! His name shall be carved into the Hall of Fame!\u2019</p><br/><p>[Gate of Hell]: Summons a Gate that leads to Hell itself. During the gate\u2019s activation time, any target that you had kill will be sacrificed to the Demon Lord. The souls that were sacrificed will summons one Elite tier Demon of the same strength and Level to assist you in battle. The effect will only apply within 100 meters around the Gate of Hell. Souls cannot be sacrificed if the target dies too far away from the Gate. Summoned Demons will only last for as long as 2 hours and will be sent back to wench it came. Summoned Demons can only be alive around 500 meters from the Gate. The Gate of Hell can be attacked and destroyed only through selective targeting. Will not be affected by splash damage of AoE skill. Gate of Hell will only active for 10 minutes before the door closes. Cooldown: 72 hours.</p><br/><p>Typically, skills with a long cooldown will have high potential. As such, the skill {Gate of Hell} shared the same cooldown as the Transformation skill!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang had the Book of Revelations which could freely used to strengthen two skills. Right then, he had {Block} and {Shield Wall} strengthened, but since the skill could be level up, he had used one of the slots on the Gate of Hell.</p><br/><p>[Gate of Hell (Enhanced)]: Summons a Gate that leads to Hell itself. During the gate\u2019s activation time, any target that you had kill will be sacrificed to the Demon Lord. The souls that were sacrificed will summons one Elite tier Demon of the same strength and Level to assist you in battle. The effect will only apply within 200 meters around the Gate of Hell. Souls cannot be sacrificed if the target dies too far away from the Gate. Summoned Demons will only last for as long as 4 hours and will be sent back to wench it came. Summoned Demons can only be alive around 1,000 meters from the Gate. The Gate of Hell can be attacked and destroyed only through selective targeting. Will not be affected by splash damage of AoE skill. Gate of Hell will only active for 20 minutes before the door closes. Cooldown: 72 hours.</p><br/><p>Despite having the same cooldown time after being strengthened, the skill had gained doubled duration and effective distance. Worthy trade deal? Hell yes!</p><br/><p>Such a powerful skill. The skill that was granted only to the first player that reached Level 200! Fufufu. Zhang Yang laughed by himself. At then, he felt a sudden greed to claim all the remaining 9 Skill Point either from First Clear Achievements or other means. At that point in time, his powers were so strong, how could he not become the man that dominates the entire server?!</p><br/><p>As such, when that day comes, the entire server might treat him as a boss to kill!</p><br/><p>Even though Sun Xin Yu had only a few experience points lesser than Zhang Yang, she was able to be the second player to reach Level 200 only after 7 to 8 days later. As a reward, she had obtained the skill [Frost Spike] and 2 Luck Attribute Points.</p><br/><p>[Frost Spike]: Encases you in a barrier of icy spikes. All targets that attack you will have a 50% chance of being frozen in ice for 3 seconds. During the Frozen state, the targets will be rendered stationary and cannot engage in any actions. After breaking free from the Frozen state, the targets will suffer from Frost Bite and will have 50% reduce movement speed for the next 10 seconds. Frost Spike had 20 counts. Each successful trigger will consume one count. The barrier will last for 10 minutes or until all trigger counts are used. Cooldown: 10 minutes.</p><br/><p>The skill might not be as powerful as {Gate of Hell} but it had a short cooldown and long active time. It was the perfect PvP arena counter skill! It will be exceptionally good during 1v1 fights! 20 counts\u2026not even Zhang Yang could handle that much\u2026who else could?</p><br/><p>Naturally, Invincibility and Mobility Potion can help to reduce the trigger count for a bit! That was only a few, not all! It would be impossible for anyone to completely waste all 20 trigger counts in the active duration of the potion.</p><br/><p>Sun Xin Yu was extremely lucky to have that PvP counter skill, for she is the ultimate Assassin. A natural born killer!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

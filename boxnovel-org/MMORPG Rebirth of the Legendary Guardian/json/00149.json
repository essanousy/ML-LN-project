He\u2019s been acting all crazy!\u201d muttered Endless Starlight.</p><br/><p>The boss had been constantly screaming \u201cBastard!\u201d, \u201cPathetic!\u201d, \u201cDreadful!\u201d, \u201cWretched!\u201d along with other kind of insults.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps he was in love with a handsome young centaur like himself and the society stopped them from being together! However, in search for true love, the young prince went through hell and back to be together with his lover! Once the king knew about this, he had the prince\u2019s lover killed to maintain his status! Thus, the angered prince cast a curse and sunk the entire castle down to ruins in order to be together with his lover forever!\u201d said Daffodil Daydream with a yearning face.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang and everyone else exchanged a look and came to a conclusion. \u201cFujoshi1!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fighting this boss would undoubtedly require a whole lot of patience and stamina, no matter what class you were! The attacking classes must always pay attention to the boss\u2019 status while Thieves and Berserkers would have to run away from the boss to evade the ! The tank would have to always be ready to cast his life preserving skills to prevent them from wasting their hard work if he were to die! The healer was the worst; having to constantly maintain the tank\u2019s HP! If the spell was slower, even by a micro second, the tank would die and would end up in a team wipe.</p><br/><p>40%, 30%, 20%...</p><br/><p>It was luck that the boss did not have any other skills aside from and , and the multi target blast wave he used when he was at 50% HP! However, just with two skills alone, Zhang Yang and the team had their hands full! Neither one of them dared to relax for even a second!</p><br/><p>15%, 10%, 5%!</p><br/><p>Finally, after what seemed to be a whole lifetime of attacking, the boss\u2019 HP was approaching to its end. The party got lively and cheered all the way.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let your guard down just yet! A dead boss is the safest boss!\u201d said Zhang Yang.</p><br/><p>3%, 2%, 1%, 0%!</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You and the party members around have killed Chateau Turk. Obtained 110,050 Experience Points. (50 points party bonus)!\u2019</p><br/><p>Phew!</p><br/><p>Everyone breathed a sigh of relief and plopped down on their butts! They were completely worn out!</p><br/><p>Shush! A white light flashed by and a figure stood at the top of the boss\u2019 body. It was Chateau Turk!</p><br/><p>Everyone was shock onto their feet!</p><br/><p>\u201cZ-z-z-z-z-zombie!\u201d cried Wei Yan Er.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrap! A dead boss is still not safe, yo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down!\u201d Zhang Yang cried out. \u201cLook at him properly. Don\u2019t you see that he is now just a Level 1 ghost?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone selected on him and was relieved when they had checked on his properties.</p><br/><p>[Soul of Chateau Turk] (Normal)</p><br/><p>Level: 1</p><br/><p>HP: 0/50</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang once faced a similar event in the Underground Tower, which was why he remained calm upon encountering Chateau Turk\u2019s soul.</p><br/><p>There was a yellow exclamation mark on top of his head, indicating a quest ready to be received.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It seems that you have defeated me, foreigners!\u201d This time, his tone was completely different than before. A majestic look and royalty aura emitted all over him even when he was just a ghostly figure.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang asked. \u201cMy lord prince, what had happened here? What caused this castle to fall?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chateau Turk\u2019s ghost remained silent for a while before he began to move his lips. \u201cI thought that I could have ended it all with the destruction of the castle. Never had I thought that I would be reincarnated by a Necromancer and had my soul trapped in a body full of anger, despair, and vengeance!\u201d</p><br/><p>He wavered a little before he spoke again. \u201cI have a request for you! I want you to kill two people!\u201d</p><br/><p>Was it the two people that caused this prince to turn into a mindless and raging spectre?</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang nodded and said, \u201cMy lord prince, who do you need us to kill?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chateau Turk went silent again for some time before talking again. \u201cMy father, Kinglose Turk and\u2026the princess, Annie Balrum!\u201d</p><br/><p>WTF!? Internal affair?</p><br/><p>The \u201cfujoshi\u201d inside Daffodil Daydream burned with a raging passion. She quickly asked, \u201cMy prince, they are both your close family! Why would you do so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chateau Turk\u2019s face turned sour, expressing anger and menace. He angrily waved his arms out and replied. \u201cThey are not worthy! That lowly b*itch! I treated her as my treasure! I provided her with anything that she could ask for! No matter what or how ridiculous her requests were, I tried my very best to satisfy her! But\u2026 but\u2026 she would dare to cheat on me! With my father!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe moment I had caught them in the act, my heart was broken into smithereens! How could it have happened?! How could she betray me? My father, of all people in the world! Why would he\u2026! GRAHHH!!! Ha\u2026 Ha\u2026. hahaha. In the end, I activated the Castle\u2019s restricted magic. This magic was to be used when all else have failed during an enemy invasion. To bring down the enemy along with the centaurs! The castle was then sunk deep into the earth, killing\u2026 everyone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will not become the laughing stock of the Centaur race! This shame! This humiliation shall be cleansed only through death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone stared with a blank look in their eyes when they found out that it was just a family dispute! Daffodil was the most disappointed among all. She actually hoped for the forbidden love drama to appear here!</p><br/><p>Chateau Turk looked to the crowd and said, \u201cNow that both of them have been reincarnated by the Necromancer, they even have the shame to live together! Adventurer! I ask for your help! Kill them for me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! Chateau Turk has a quest for you: Kill Them Both! Will you accept it?\u2019</p><br/><p>Since they would need to kill them either way, might as well take a quest for it!</p><br/><p>[Kill Them Both!] (Difficulty Level: A)</p><br/><p>Quest Description: Kill the King Kinglose Turk and the Princess Annie Balrum! These shameless creatures should not be alive! Send them down to hell!</p><br/><p>Progress: Kill King Kinglose Turk 0/1 Princess Annie Balrum 0/1</p><br/><p>\u201cTake this spear with you! In it, remains a fragment of my soul. I want to see them die right in front of my very eyes!\u201d said Chateau Turk menacingly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You have obtained the item \u201cChateau Turk\u2019s Spear\u201d\u2019</p><br/><p>[Chateau Turk\u2019s Spear] (Quest Item)</p><br/><p>Use: Summons Chateau Turk vengeance spirit to witness the death of The King Kinglose Turk and the Princess Annie Balrum! Who knows what would happen? He might lend a hand!</p><br/><p>Cool down time: 30 minutes.</p><br/><p>After accepting the quest and the item, Chateau Turk\u2019s ghostly figure disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brat! Time for our loots!\u201d said Zhang Yang as he gestured towards the boss.</p><br/><p>Wei Yan Er quickly ran around and reached out her timid hands.</p><br/><p>[Sharp Rotten Tooth] (Gray-Silver, Dagger)</p><br/><p>Weapon Attack: 274 \u2013 334</p><br/><p>Attack Interval: 1.9 seconds.</p><br/><p>DPS: 160</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 40</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah! 1.9 seconds attack interval! This is a good item! If you use this to attack from behind, I think you might deal more than 1,000 damage, no?\u201d Zhang Yang praised.</p><br/><p>There was only one Thief class player in the party, and that was Sun Xin Yu. The Ice Queen took the dagger and equipped it. She then applied poison on the blade and it gave off a greenish hue glimmer.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have some thought in my head for a while now that I could never understand.\u201d Fatty Han had been quiet for some time now. He opened his fat lips after he could no longer hold it in.</p><br/><p>Everyone turned around to look at him, expecting some sort of rubbish topic.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026The Centaur are all 4 legged, aren\u2019t they? So how could they\u2026do it? No matter how hard I could think, it just doesn\u2019t make sense!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Genuine Love] (Gray-Silver, Ring)</p><br/><p>Vitality: -20</p><br/><p>Intelligence: +60</p><br/><p>Note: Friend, you\u2019ve been blinded by the power of love! It\u2019s time for you to replenish your intelligence for a change!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow strange! It reduces your vitality and HP?\u201d asked Hundred Shots.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang scratched his chin a while and explained. \u201cIt actually a worth trade off. Rings usually have 2 attribute bonus. For example, Vitality +15 and Strength +15. A Level 40 Gray-Silver ring should have +20 both attribute. If you look closely at the attribute arrangement of the ring, it was an even trade! You must know that Vitality is the \u201ccheapest\u201d attribute among all. To trade off 40 Vitality for 40 Intelligence is worth double its value!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone understood the significance of the ring once Zhang Yang explained it. Still, if you could make sure you won\u2019t receive any damage, having 100 HP and 10,000, HP would make a difference! However, having extra 40 Intelligence points was worth 400 MP and 40 magic attack damage! This was definitely a strong damage and healing endurance upgrade!</p><br/><p>This magic type ring was rolled by Han Ying Xue and Daffodil. This time, Daffodil had a change of luck and obtained the ring at 89 points while Han Ying Xue had only rolled 67 points.</p><br/><p>[Skill Book: Crash Magic]</p><br/><p>Use: Teaches you .</p><br/><p>Class Requirement: Guardian, Defender</p><br/><p>Level Requirement: 30</p><br/><p>Before Zhang Yang could say anything, Endless Starlight gave up his roll for the item, saying, \u201cI would have rolled for the item if it was an equipment, since we\u2019re fighting a Level 40 boss that will drop a Gray-Silver Level 40 equipment. Based on the party strength, I\u2019m sure it would be a walk in the park! But a skill book is a whole different matter, it would only appear once in a lifetime. There\u2019s even a chance that it will not appear again!\u201d</p><br/><p>What Endless Starlight said was the cold bitter truth. Equipment were easily discarded after obtaining a stronger one. But a skill could be used from Level 1 to Level 300! A skill may seem to be useless at first but in certain situations, it could be used to obtain certain victory!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed. \u201cThank you, Starlight!\u201d Zhang Yang rolled and obtained the skill book. Zhang Yang immediately learned the skill.</p><br/><p>[Crash Magic]: Use your shield to strike the target. If the target was casting a spell, the spell will be interrupted and the target would not be able to cast any skill for the next 3 seconds!</p><br/><p>Requirement: Shield</p><br/><p>Cost: 10 Rage.</p><br/><p>Cool down time: 10 seconds.</p><br/><p>He had finally learned an interruption skill! Zhang Yang was happy. He would not have to fight as hard the next time he faced a magic type; especially elite magic type monsters!</p><br/><p>The team kept 10 or more Green-Copper equipment and moved on.</p><br/><p>After a long flight of stairs, the team fought many more Centaur Maids and arrived at the 3rd floor.</p><br/><p>Compared to the 1st and 2nd floor, the 3rd floor had fewer monster count. Zhang Yang scanned the area and had only observed many Spectre Saber Tooth Tigers patrolling around. Some of them had their skins impaired, while some other had exposed rotten, dried innards and white bones. All of their eyes were the same; glowing in green emerald color flame!</p><br/><p>[Saber-Tooth Skeleton Tiger] (Elite, Spectre)</p><br/><p>Level: 43</p><br/><p>HP: 86,000</p><br/><p>Majority of wild beast had the skill called . This skill was a form of DoT skill which would cause high damage per second if they were stacked. Zhang Yang did not know whether or not these zombie-like tigers had that skill. So, instead of going commando and taking on a bunch of these monsters, Zhang Yang and Endless Starlight went on and took one monster each to test it out.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You have received (stack 1). Receiving 100 damage every 3 seconds for 15 seconds!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You have received (stack 2). Receiving 200 damage every 3 seconds for 15 seconds!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding! You have received (stack 3). Receiving 300 damage every 3 seconds for 15 seconds!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>As expected, even after turning into a spectre, the tiger still retained the skill. To make matters worse, the skill did not have a stack limit! The initial damage was small but once the skill stacked to about 10 layers or so, any player could definitely feel its pain.</p><br/><p>If that was the case, the party could not lure a bunch of monsters to kill them all in one go! If they did, who was going to kill who?</p><br/><p>The party targeted the monsters that Zhang Yang and Endless Starlight had attack and killed it quickly, turning it into a pillar of light. The monster dropped a few pieces of [Tiger\u2019s Fang] and [Tiger\u2019s Bone].</p><br/><p>\u201cHundred Shots, take this Tiger\u2019s Bone and take it with whiskey! I hear that it can cure \u201cflabbiness\u201d!\u201d said Fatty Han as he handed over a large bone to Hundred Shots.</p><br/><p>Hundred Shot did not say anything but rolled his eyes at Fatty Han.</p><br/><p>Endless Starlight quickly interjected. \u201cHundred Shots bro is probably already a \u201cman\u201d! If he took anymore supplements, who knows, he might really be a father tomorrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, break it up guys! Or else, I\u2019ll ask Hundred Shots to shoot your ass inward!\u201d Zhang Yang gestured the team to move forward with him as the lead.</p><br/><p>Even though they could not multi-kill the monsters on this floor, they were making a rather quick progress since the number of monsters around here was just a few. By the time they had defeated the prince, it was already 10:00 at night. Now that they had progressed further into the floor, and covered approximately a quarter of the area, the time was already reaching past midnight.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang then quickly disbanded the party and ordered the team to continue tomorrow morning.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang recalled that it was almost time for students to return to school. And since, tomorrow was a Monday, Zhang Yang had to ask Wei Yan Er. \u201cLittle brat, looks like you really can\u2019t make it tomorrow huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Yan Er stuck out her tongue and blew a raspberry. \u201cJust wait and see!\u201d</p><br/><p>After the night, everyone logged in and gathered together at 9:00 in the morning. Surprisingly, Wei Yan Er was there.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang asked suspiciously. \u201cLittle brat! Did you skip school?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSkip school?\u201d Wei Yan Er patted her flat chest and said proudly: \"I took leave like an honest person!\"</p><br/><p>Han Ying Xue quickly interjected her. \u201cYan Er, lighter! Not so hard! If you pat any harder it might concave in!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHAN YING XUE!\u201d The little brat was triggered ever so easily. Like a cat\u2019s tail being stepped on suddenly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you even manage to apply a leave? Did you really say you wanted to play some games?\u201d Zhang Yang asked while resisting his laughter.</p><br/><p>Wei Yan Er looked at Zhang Yang with a hidden message \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot\u201d and said, \u201cMy cousin called the school principle and said that I had a fever! That settled it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang turned over and stared at Han Ying Xue, who was still wearing a smug on her face. \u201cWhat kind of cousin are you? Are you purposely trying to destroy the budding flower of the country? You\u2019d know that this little brat is already stupid! Why did you stopp her from actually learning?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Noob tank! Who says I\u2019m stupid!\u201d Wei Yan Er stomped the ground, throwing a fit.</p><br/><p>Han Ying Xue pout her lips and said, \u201cTch. What can you learn in school anyway? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re actually going to apply everything you\u2019ve learnt in school! Tell me, when have you ever used the triangular formulae, or even the force or acceleration\u2026 that kinda thing\u2026 something about periodic graph or table\u2026Widely taught but not of any importance! So tell me what\u2019s the use of learning it in the first place? Yan Er will one day take over her father\u2019s business! She only needs to learn what she needs to learn! To be frank, she went to school to learn about people and business relationship! That\u2019s the important lesson that could only be learned on the job!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Yan Er was grinning all the way and scoffed Zhang Yang provocatively.</p><br/><p>---</p><br/><p>1Fujoshi is a self-mockingly pejorative Japanese term for female fans of novels that feature romantic relationships between men (Yaoi).</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The papers were scattered everywhere. I was curious to see what was written on it.</p><br/><p>Luckily, the wind happened to blow through the window and flipped the pages that I couldn\u2019t touch.</p><br/><p>I laid on the ground and followed the wind\u2019s irregular tempo as I experienced the most troublesome reading of my entire life.</p><br/><p>It was\u2026.</p><br/><p>Mo Xiaotian\u2019s affair, Ye Lili\u2019s gambling debt, Chairman Jicheng\u2019s weekly church visits, and information regarding his subordinates shifting funds from the company.</p><br/><p>It was all their dirty laundry. And they were all fatal mistakes.</p><br/><p><i>Could it have been Suyang\u2019s plan all along to use this info to threaten them? Was that why he wanted me to focus on Xuduo since he couldn\u2019t discover any negative stuff to blackmail him with? </i></p><br/><p><i>Wow, I\u2019m so slow\u2026 I should\u2019ve known. Yet, I put my life in vain.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the attitude you use to beg for help?\u201d Mi Fan looked past Suyang and turned her attention on \u201cme\u201d. \u201cThis is something that could destroy me. Initially, I didn\u2019t want to give it to you because I don\u2019t want to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, we have another victim. I honestly hope this will come to an end.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Was Mi Fan aware of Suyang\u2019s intent from the beginning? Or were they working together as a team to expose the Chairman\u2019s family the whole time? </i></p><br/><p>I was so confused. My IQ was too low and I didn\u2019t understand what was going on. Who could explain the current situation to me?</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I trust you?\u201d Suyang stared at the information.</p><br/><p>Mi Fan dryly laughed. Sadness appeared on her icy face, \u201cIt\u2019s up to you whether you want to believe me or not. At the end of the day, I did what I was supposed to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit late to discover your conscience?\u201d Suyang sounded bitter.</p><br/><p>Mi Fan\u2019s hand was on the door handle. Because of Suyang\u2019s line, her hand paused.</p><br/><p>The room was uncomfortably silent. Who would\u2019ve thought that Mi Fan and Suyang could create such a nerve wrecking atmosphere? I nearly forgot to breathe.</p><br/><p><i>Oh yeah! Right now, It doesn\u2019t matter whether I could breathe or not! </i></p><br/><p>But breathing wasn\u2019t an issue.</p><br/><p>If I had known this was their relationship, I wouldn\u2019t have been concerned about the possibility of Mi Fan seducing Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? I just don\u2019t want the punk to come after me anymore. Each time he sees me, he looks like he wants to tear me apart. I might as well avoid him in jail for a bit. Aren\u2019t I quick witted?\u201d Mi Fan sourly smiled.</p><br/><p>At that moment, I felt a bit bad for her because she was revealing a weak side I had never seen before.</p><br/><p>Suyang pursed his lips and didn\u2019t respond. He turned around and tucked my blanket in. Mi Fan didn\u2019t wait for his reply and left without turning back.</p><br/><p>Although I was concerned about Suyang, I was more curious about where Mi Fan was going. So, I followed her.</p><br/><p>I realized how convenient it was to be a ghost. I didn\u2019t have to open any doors. I could go through walls and sit in vehicles without getting noticed.</p><br/><p>She had no clue that I was observing her from her passenger seat the whole time.</p><br/><p>Mi Fan\u2019s destination was Lu Zhengyang\u2019s workplace.</p><br/><p><i>My mouth was wide opened. I wanted to block her. Was she nuts? She had the guts to go see Lu Zhengyang? </i>After all, Lu Zhengyang had once attempted to pour sulfuric acid over her. I couldn\u2019t help but feel concerned.</p><br/><p>As expected, the moment Mi Fan entered the store, Lu Zhengyang\u2019s facial expression turned repulsive. A second ago, he was smiling at a customer. The next second, he directly took the customer\u2019s beer and splashed it over Mi Fan.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere froze.</p><br/><p>Everyone appeared stunned by Lu Zhengyang\u2019s action. However, Mi Fan reacted as if she had expected this treatment.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you appear in front of my face?\u201d Lu Zhengyang yelled. As long as Mi Fan was around, Lu Zhengyang\u2019s hatred bar was filled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to have a talk with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about between us. Unless you\u2019re going to die and then beg for forgiveness from my father. If he is willing to forgive you, then I\u2019ll forgive you!\u201d Lu Zhengyang sounded very spiteful.</p><br/><p>Mi Fan took out tissue from her bag as she calmly wiped the beer off her face. Then, she solemnly said to Lu Zhengyang, \u201cIt\u2019s as you wished. According to my calculations, my time of death should be approaching shortly. If you want to talk then, that\u2019s fine. I welcome you to come to my grave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Lu Zhengyang was confused by Mi Fan\u2019s words, \u201cYour time of death is approaching?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to talk now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRegardless, women like you are all frauds. Just get the f**k out!\u201d Lu Zhengyang turned around and stormed into the kitchen without looking back.</p><br/><p>Mi Fan lightly sighed. She didn\u2019t mind all the looks from everyone as she walked out of the store.</p><br/><p>At the end, she never told Lu Zhengyang what she wanted to say.</p><br/><p>Since she didn\u2019t fix herself, she looked like a sorry figure. Mi Fan was in a rush to head to another place. It was as if she was rushing to chase after a celebrity. She travelled without stopping to rest.</p><br/><p>Her ultimate destination was a cemetery on the outskirts of town.</p><br/><p><i>Who was she visiting? Was it Lu Wenxue? But based on what I could recall, Lu Wenxue\u2019s grave wasn\u2019t located here\u2026</i></p><br/><p>\u201cMom, I came to visit you. I haven\u2019t visited for a very long time. Do you miss me? Please forgive me. These days, work has been very busy. Also, I have a lot of stressful things to deal with.\u201d Mi Fan was kneeling in front of a woman\u2019s grave. \u201cBecause of me, another person is hurt\u2026. Mom, are you very disappointed in me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t want this to happen either. I don\u2019t know why things ended up like this\u2026. No! That\u2019s not true!\u201d Mi Fan shook her head as she rejected her own words, \u201cActually, I knew this would\u2019ve happen the moment I decided to take this path. I was mentally prepared to have people scold and despise me\u2026.. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did I become like this? Mom, do you remember? When I was little, I said I wanted to become a righteous reporter that will unmask evil.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 ever since a year ago, after that incident, my path has been offset, and I was unable to control the development ever since\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Mi Fan began to dig through her bag. After quite a long time, she ended emptying all the content to fish out a photo with her shaky hands. She displayed it in front of the grave and she began to whimper.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee? I have proof. At one point, I really wanted to be a good reporter. I r-really\u2026..wanted to be a good reporter\u2026.\u201d She cried.</p><br/><p>Mi Fan\u2019s voice was turning weaker and weaker, \u201cBut why? Why is reality so cruel? It\u2019s so cruel that I thoroughly killed my old self. The good reporter Mi Fan had long left this world. What remained was a person filled with self-interest; someone who allowed a large corporation to exploit her in exchange for status!\u201d</p><br/><p>By now, I somewhat understood why Mi Fan was in such a rush to see Lu Zhengyang and her mother. Since she gave Suyang the documents, Suyang was going to expose everything very shortly. When that happens, the Chairman\u2019s family will definitely know that Mi Fan had betrayed them. Then\u2026most likely, she will end up like my current state. It was understandable why Mi Fan felt like her days were limited.</p><br/><p>Worse of all, the person who shot me (Director Rui) was still on the run. Police and private detectives were unable to find any traces of him. That was the most scariest part of all\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cAs of now, I haven\u2019t once went to visit that man. Probably it\u2019s because of the overwhelming amount of guilt I have. I don\u2019t have the courage to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, if everything is exposed, does it mean I am qualified to see that person? Or is it really as the child had said -I must die in order to pay for my mistakes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, I came because I wanted to let you know that your daughter was once a good person. That\u2019s all\u2026.\u201d Mi Fan sighed. Then, she took the photo and placed it in front of her mother\u2019s grave with a rock on top of it. In my eyes, Mi Fan moved like she was dragging rocks with her feet. Each step was indescribably heavy.</p><br/><p>I bowed in front of Mi Fan\u2019s mother\u2019s grave. After all, I was secretly eavesdropping on Mi Fan\u2019s conversation for so long\u2026</p><br/><p>After Mi Fan left, I leaned closer to the grave to take a look at the photo. It was a picture of her before she was famous. Based on the background of the photo, it looked like a school\u2019s opening ceremony.</p><br/><p>She was in the picture with a student from the school.</p><br/><p>Based on Mi Fan\u2019s expression, she appeared to be very inexperienced and passionate about her career. Her face had the smile of joy.</p><br/><p>The child she had her arms around had a ribbon of first place over his neck. <i>Why does he look so familiar? Although he looked about 12-13 years of age, I felt like I had seen him somewhere before\u2026.</i></p><br/><p><i>Oh! I know who it is! </i></p><br/><p><i>It was Lu Zhengyang!</i></p><br/>\n</div>"}

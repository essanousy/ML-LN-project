From time to time, there would be a sour smell in the air. I wondered if people randomly threw their trash here.</p><br/><p>Despite the awful smell, it cut my journey in half. Thinking of this, it drove me to hold in my breath and carry on through the alley. I wanted to get through it as fast as I can.</p><br/><p>When I had gone through \u2154 of the path, I vaguely heard trifling noises behind my back. It sounded like footsteps, but they were lighter than footsteps. <i>Was it a mouse scuttering through the garbages?</i> I suddenly turned around, but I was faced with the pitch darkness. I couldn\u2019t see anything.</p><br/><p>I waved the flashlight of my phone, but there was nothing. However, my heart still felt very uneasy. Goose bumps were extending from my arm to my entire body, and my back wouldn\u2019t stop shivering.</p><br/><p>I hastened my pace and centralized all my sense organs. I noticed that if I accelerated my steps, the sounds behind me would grow louder. But if I slowed down, the sounds would become softer. Could someone really be following me?</p><br/><p>At this moment, the words of those uncles and aunties suddenly popped in my mind:</p><br/><p><i>\u201cHave you heard? Recently there has been a bad guy in our area!\u201d </i></p><br/><p><i>\u201cWhat bad guy?\u201d</i></p><br/><p><i>\u201cHe tends to target those walking who walks alone late at night. According to rumours, he is not satisfied with wallets and cellphones\u2026he even kills!\u201d </i></p><br/><p><i>\u201cLies! If someone like that existed, the cops would have caught him by now.\u201d </i></p><br/><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m not lying! It\u2019s even on the news. My granddaughter showed me. She told me to be careful and not to go out at night. You should also be more cautious. Tell your son and daughter-in-law to go home early! Every time I think there is a chance of being approached by the bad guy, my heart trembles from fright\u2026\u201d</i></p><br/><p>My legs began to shake. Out of all times, why was this dialogue popping in my mind now? I felt an urge to urinate; as if I was watching a horror film and it was really coming at a bad time. Plus, it wasn\u2019t night yet\u2026. I can\u2019t be that unlucky, right?</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t tell me I\u2019m getting a real test because I resented Shen Shaoqian for creating a fake situation!? Oh God, please forgive me! I know I tend to attract a lot of ghosts..but don\u2019t let all the bad stuff come to me as well!!?!?!</p><br/><p>I just started living in a 140 square metres apartment. Don\u2019t let me wake up from my dream so soon!</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t do anything. All of a sudden, the sound behind me got closer and closer. It sounded more and more daunting.</p><br/><p>I seized the little time that I had, and just as I felt the person was going to touch me, I violently turned around and used all my strength to throw my weapon, the watermelon, at him.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t strike a person, but I alarmed a few rats. One after another, they spurted across my feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! Oh oh oh!\u201d In order to avoid the rats, I stamped my feet like I was doing a tap dance. Although rats were scary, I felt much better after confirming there wasn\u2019t a person behind me.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it\u2026\u201d I muttered as I stared at my crushed watermelon. I will never take this route again! Wahhhh\u2026my watermelon\u2026</p><br/><p>I was sadden by the loss of my watermelon. I decided to continue through the alley since I could already see the bright exit up ahead.</p><br/><p>While I was fixedly staring towards the light, suddenly a black figure blocked me. He came from another side alley and stood in front of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou?!\u201d Before I had time to panic, the person had already forcefully grabbed my hair and shoved me up against the wall.</p><br/><p>The harsh impact caused me to see stars, and I lost all the strength in my hands and legs. My body fell against the wall and my cellphone slid down from my hands.</p><br/><p>I honestly couldn\u2019t clearly see the person who had attacked me. But based on his lack of hesitation and his merciless action, it was obvious that he came with ill intentions.</p><br/><p>I could feel the moist walls behind me. Something began to roll down from above my head. Was it blood?</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t sure. All I felt was pain. I was beginning to see overlapping images. One became two, two became four. I also felt like vomiting.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh boy, another day of business..\u201d The man\u2019s voice was very coarse. In addition, he had a slight regional accent. I used all my remaining strength to look up. My attacker was tightly bundled up. He was wearing a hat, a mask, and a pair of gloves. He leaned over and crouched down in front of me as he began to flip through the pockets of my jacket.</p><br/><p>I had no capabilities to resist. But deep down, I was hoping for a miracle. I was hoping Suyang was acting as the attacker. I wanted him to coldly tell me he was playing a role again.</p><br/><p>Even if I had been a victim twice, I would forgive him as long as it was a joke.</p><br/><p>When I saw what was behind the man, I truly began to freak out.</p><br/><p>In the past, I have seen clips of murderers on the news. There would always be ghosts with unsolved grievance behind them. This guy also had a few ghosts behind him. How many?</p><br/><p>My vision was very blurry. I wasn\u2019t certain if it were two or four.</p><br/><p>In short, they were lifelessly watching me.</p><br/><p>I felt a chill down my spine. Was this their way of inviting me to join them?</p><br/><p>Currently, I was silently praying that the thief will let me keep my life as I didn\u2019t resist and allowed him to take my money.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou broke ass!\u201d After flipping through my pockets, he couldn\u2019t find any money because I had already spent it all on groceries.</p><br/><p>The man picked up my cellphone and stuffed it in his pockets.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle. I didn\u2019t carry money on me today\u2026why don\u2019t you just take my cellphone and run? I can\u2019t see your face anyway. I won\u2019t call the cops.\u201d I was leaning against the wall as I weakly took deep breaths and actively tried to suppressed my urge to vomit.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung lady, today is your unlucky day for coming across me. Robbing is actually my side job. My real hobby is to kill!\u201d He sneered.</p><br/><p>Then, the man fished out a shining knife in front of me.</p><br/><p>Deep down, I hollered. Why was the knife so bright when I could barely see? It was so eye-catching! My level of dread was rapidly rising. I was imagining how painful it would be when he inserts the knife into my body\u2026</p><br/><p>Immediately, my heart began to shrink and pound at an outrageous speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of retribution? You\u2019re killing innocent lives?!\u201d I asked as I fixedly stared at the two ghosts behind him. Now, I was certain there were two. I wonder if they will save me? After all, we are somewhat part of the same team?</p><br/><p>We should form a victim alliance?</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung lady. To tell you the truth, this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve killed. I don\u2019t believe in ghosts or spirits. They couldn\u2019t fight me when they were alive. What makes you think they can do anything to me now that they\u2019re dead?\u201d</p><br/><p>I wonder how he would react if he knew his two victims\u2019 spirits were standing behind him. At the same time, he was correct. I\u2019ve encountered so many ghosts, but they were all super weak.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t speak, carry items or strike..</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, the people that you\u2019ve killed are standing behind you. I can see them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung lady, are you trying to tease me? It doesn\u2019t matter what you say. No ghosts or humans can save you now!\u201d</p><br/><p>True\u2026the two ghosts clearly had no intentions of saving me. I guess soon I will turn into a ghost and stand next to them. I slowly shut my eyes and waited for my life\u2019s final moment.</p><br/><p>Last time, Suyang and Shao Shenqian tricked me. This time, it was the real deal. I\u2019ve lost my bluntness from before.</p><br/><p>Farewell, 140 square metres apartment\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I had all my attention focused on the movements behind the door.</p><br/><p>*dong dong*. There was another two knocks. This time, I was positive that I wasn\u2019t hallucinating. Someone was really knocking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it\u2026\u201d I weakly responded as I slowly headed towards the door and pressed my body up against the wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Suyang.\u201d The person replied, \u201cLet me come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>I instantly felt a breath of relief and leaned my head against the door. \u201cDon\u2019t come in! Currently, I have no intentions of letting you enter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang knocked again. He used a very light and quick tone I haven\u2019t heard in a long time. \u201cCan we have a talk?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs your boss, I am commanding you to open the door!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rather than saying something sweet, Suyang was using his usual boss status to suppress me. I was enraged and aggressively jerked the door open. Most likely, Suyang had been leaning against my door the entire time. The moment I opened the door, he directly fell into my arms.</p><br/><p>All the words I wanted to say also fell apart. <i>What did I want to say again?</i></p><br/><p>Suyang dryly coughed twice. He held onto the door and stood up straight. \u201cWhere were you the entire day?</p><br/><p>\u201cUggh! Didn\u2019t I say not to come in?\u201d I pointed my finger at Suyang\u2019s fingertips. His fingertips were slightly violating my space. \u201cIf you have something to say, say it here, boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAllow me to come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you have nothing to say, I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d I pretended to close the door, but Suyang blocked me. Obviously, this was what I had predicted.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, I got hurt. So I want you to help me apply some medication.\u201d Suyang raised the medicine bottle in his hand and shook it in front of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurt? Where?\u201d Immediately, all the frustrations and anger I had inside melted away. I hastily dragged Suyang into my room and took the medicine bottle from his hand. I felt guilty and a bit responsible, \u201cWhy were you so clumsy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy back. Today, while I was trying to protect Mi Fan from the crazy child, I accidentally crashed into something. My waist is still in pain.\u201d Suyang explained as he grimaced in pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cTurn around. Let me see.\u201d I made Suyang\u2019s back faced me as I gradually lifted up his shirt. I couldn\u2019t help but suck in my breath.</p><br/><p>Oh God! There was a huge bruise on Suyang\u2019s fair skin. It stood out a lot. Within his bruise was clotted blood. I used my fingertips to stroke it a little and Suyang began to tremble.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it so serious?\u201d I frowned as my heart ached a bit for Suyang.</p><br/><p><i>If he didn\u2019t go see Mi Fan</i>\u2026..women were always like this. They liked to put the blame on other women; especially if it\u2019s women they weren\u2019t fond of.</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp me apply the medication.\u201d While I was zoning out, Suyang had quickly taken off his entire shirt.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Before I could stop Suyang, he had already thrown his shirt off to the side. His perfect back was displayed in front of me and my voice naturally became very timid, \u201cWhy did you take off the whole\u2026\u2026 there\u2019s not need\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Gulp* I lightly swallowed my saliva. My hands were shaking. It took a lot of effort before I was able to twist open the bottle. <i>Why was I shaking? Was I nervous? </i>I didn\u2019t even know where my eyes should be looking.</p><br/><p>There was another serious issue. <i>Am I supposed to directly pour the content on his back? Or use my hand to rub it lightly? </i></p><br/><p><i>Use hand? Use hand? Use my hand? </i></p><br/><p>At this moment, all sorts of strange thoughts popped up on my mind. Based solely on Suyang\u2019s back, I honestly couldn\u2019t understand how a person who didn\u2019t exercise for 365 days could maintain such a good body.</p><br/><p>It was as if his body was carved. There weren\u2019t any excess fat at all.</p><br/><p><i>Could this type of body be innate? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since I still hadn\u2019t made a move, Suyang asked me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Nothing! It\u2019s just that\u2026 how do you want me to help you apply it? Do you want me to rub on it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want you to massage the clotted blood area, to spread it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Ok! Spread out the clotted blood area. Got it!\u201d I clumsily poured the medical content onto my palm and wanted to smile so badly. I was trying my best to stop myself from giggling as my hand slowly approached Suyang\u2019s bruise. \u201cIt might hurt a little. You must tolerate it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment my palm came in contact with Suyang\u2019s back, I felt like I was getting shocked by electricity. I shrank back a little. Perhaps he was in pain, because he slightly trembled as well.</p><br/><p>Since Suyang couldn\u2019t see me, my heartbeat was slowly returning back to normal. I was afraid to hurt him, so I tried my best to soften my touch. I was lightly massaging his bruise.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoldfish.\u201d Suyang was calling me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I thought I had hurt him, so I was worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you trying to help me spread out the clotted blood or are you trying to tease me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop stroking my bruise so softly. It feels very weird.\u201d Suyang turned around and seized my hand. He made me forcefully push against his bruise. But I was the one yelping out instead. His strength was no joke. I could feel the pain from watching alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright\u2026.\u201d I followed Suyang\u2019s instructions and increased my strength on his bruise.</p><br/><p>Time continued to tick by. Deep down, I was hoping time would pause at this moment forever.</p><br/><p>After I was done with his treatment, I gently patted Suyang\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAlright. I\u2019m finished. I think it would be a better idea for you to sleep on your stomach tonight\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While I was talking to him, I noticed his forehead was covered with sweat. He must be in tremendous amounts of pain. But how could I expose him? So I pretended I didn\u2019t see.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow you know the price of foolishly acting like a hero to save a beauty, eh?\u201d I picked up Suyang\u2019s shirt from the ground and handed it to him. \u201cHurry and put your clothes back on. You\u2019re already injured. You don\u2019t want to catch a cold as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve cooled down? Not angry anymore?\u201d Suyang was putting on his shirt and grinning at me at the same time. <i>Was he trying to coax me? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cCool down? I\u2019m not mad?! I\u2019m totally fine\u2026\u201d There was a strong scent of medication on my hands and I wanted to wash it off. So I stood up.</p><br/><p>But as I was standing up, Suyang grabbed my arm and pressed me against the door.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

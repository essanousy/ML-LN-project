That\u2019s enough!\u201d Suyang yelled.</p><br/><p><i>I never knew the cause of Suyang\u2019s parents\u2019 death. I went as far as making Suyang join me in Japan</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, my heart was throbbing. <i>Suyang</i>\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter that incident, Xiao Su and I cut ties with the child. We returned to China and began a new life. In case history repeats itself, I always try my best to separate myself from Xiao Su. That is why we don\u2019t live together. Even if accidents were to occur, at least he wouldn\u2019t be affected\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma. Enough. What\u2019s the point of telling her this? Yixin isn\u2019t that child. She wouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s even more dangerous! Lin Yixin has the abilities but she doesn\u2019t know how to control it! The evil spirits can take advantage of her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, I felt very useless\u2026. Why was I here? I really wanted to disappear. It didn\u2019t matter where; as long as I could disappear.</p><br/><p>Now, I understood why Suyang was so afraid of ghosts. His parents died because of them. That incident must be a traumatic moment he\u2019ll never get over. I couldn\u2019t help but imagine how he felt when he found out I could see ghosts.</p><br/><p><i>Did it remind him of the past? If so, what was he thinking? Why did he choose not to tell me that part of his life?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cLin Yixin, I know you\u2019re a good child. I hope you\u2019ll reconsider and make the correct decision.\u201d Then, Grandmother Meng left very confidently. She was positive that I would do as she wanted.</p><br/><p><i>No! I can\u2019t handle this. I wanted to run away. I wanted to leave. </i></p><br/><p>Suyang seemed to have read my mind and snatched my hand. His voice was hoarse, \u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>I pushed Suyang\u2019s hand off me and held onto my buzzing head, \u201cI\u2019m going to get some fresh air. My mind is a mess right now. Please give me some time to process everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to think about it. Stay by my side. You are you. Nothing will happen\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure that nothing will happen? I can\u2019t even guarantee\u2026.deep down, I\u2019ve always known that my ability will cause you problems one day. Just like Grandmother Meng said, I cannot control it. I don\u2019t know how to get out of dangerous situations either. But I try to avoid thinking about it because I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll regress into what I used to be. I\u2019m just selfish for wanting you to stay with me a bit longer\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t it work out? There\u2019s no issues between us right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEver since you found out that I could see ghosts, you\u2019ve never thought back about the accident? I\u2019m like a reminder, right? Being with me will always remind you of your parents\u2019 death since their death was caused by a person who could see ghosts. The ghosts killed them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my problem. Not yours. I can deal with it myself.\u201d Suyang\u2019s determined pupils were trying to sway me. The moment I made eye contact with him, I felt hesitant.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it is my problem. As long as I appear in front of you, you\u2019ll be constantly reminded of your past. I\u2019ve never told you I had almost been possessed once. Likewise, you\u2019ve never told me about your past. It is because we\u2019re both afraid to lose each other\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince we\u2019re both afraid to lose each other, we should be together and face it together.\u201d Suyang grabbed onto my shoulders to emphasize his true heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang\u2026.give me some time to think about it. I-I.. can\u2019t face you right now. I feel so ashamed and sorry. Please let me get some fresh air.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Suyang didn\u2019t stop me. He gradually released my shoulders and said, \u201cYou will make the correct decision, right?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Correct decision? Grandmother Meng wanted me to make the correct decision. Suyang also wanted me to make the correct decision. But what is the correct decision? Should I do what Grandmother Meng want? Or Suyang? Or what I want? </i></p><br/><p>Honestly, I didn\u2019t even know what I wanted. A part of me didn\u2019t want to separate from Suyang at all. But another part of me was willing to leave him in order to keep him safe.</p><br/><p>My mind was having a battle with each other. It was like tug-a-war. Both sides wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><br/><p>Ultimately, I was torn in half as I fell onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Half of me stared at each other, \u201cAre you the correct decision?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>Everything happened too fast. I wandered on the streets alone. The argument I had with Suyang over food seemed like it happened a century ago. Now, it was only a distant memory.</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t sure how long I\u2019ve walked for or where I have gone. But by the time I snapped back to reality, I realized I didn\u2019t have a single spot to take a rest.</p><br/><p>\u201cYixin, it\u2019s really you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone was calling my name. I was currently sitting on the side of the road as I looked up. Shen Shaoqian\u2019s flashy car was in front of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you out here by yourself? Get on!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI came out for a breath of fresh air. Don\u2019t mind me.\u201d I decided to ignore him and got up to walk away.</p><br/><p>Shen Shaoqian got off his car and blocked me. He acted like a gentleman, \u201cIt\u2019s too late! How could I allow you to walk alone by yourself?! I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><br/><p>I flung Shen Shaoqian\u2019s arm away and frowned, \u201cNo! You go do whatever you were doing. I want to be alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>After I made that statement, I realized I was a bit rude. So, I quickly added, \u201cI\u2019m not in a good mood right now. I\u2019m not purposely trying to give you attitude. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be fine. Just go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! Get on the car. We can chat about it while we\u2019re inside, okay?\u201d Shen Shaoqian blocked me with his arms spread apart. \u201cI won\u2019t give up until you get on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing how persistent he was, I decided to listen to him. Most likely, Suyang called Shen Shaoqian and told him to keep an eye out for me. We kind of owe him for always being there.</p><br/><p>The car began to move. I didn\u2019t ask where we were going as I leaned against the seat to rest. Perhaps we were too silent, so Shen Shaoqian asked, \u201cDid you and Suyang have a fight?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to be so indirect about it. Suyang probably already told you, right?\u201d I stared at the outside scenery. Shen Shaoqian was driving really slowly. I opened the window and stuck my head out to feel the cool breeze. My heart was in chaos right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough we\u2019re close, he doesn\u2019t tell me everything, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d Shen Shaoqian wasn\u2019t driving towards the direction of the apartment, so I felt better.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe? I was going to come find you and Suyang to discuss about what to do this Christmas. It\u2019ll be Christmas in a month. We had so much fun in Japan, so I was wondering if you guys wanted to go on another trip. Perhaps we can go skiing in Switzerland.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m so curious. Don\u2019t you ever have to work?! You\u2019re always playing and goofing around.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a rich second generation! Plus, I have my own company. Obviously, I can do as I please.\u201d Shen Shaoqian proudly bragged.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen go wherever you want. I\u2019m not going to join you\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not? You don\u2019t want to go to Switzerland? Then pick something else. For example\u2026.\u201d Shen Shaoqian began to chatter nonstop. I guess he really wanted to go on a trip again.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, I was curious, \u201cWhen did you and Suyang meet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe met when we were children. We grew up together. Why are you asking?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>That means</i>\u2026. \u201cSo do you know what happened to Suyang during his time in Japan?\u201d</p><br/><p>The car suddenly came to an emergency stop. I looked up and noticed that there was only a 10cm difference between our car and the car in front of us. We almost crashed.</p><br/><p>Shen Shaoqian was shocked but quickly recovered and continued forward. \u201cI was so focused on our conversation, we almost crashed! Umm. When Suyang was in Japan, we weren\u2019t together. I was in China, so I don\u2019t know what happened to him. But when he returned with his grandmother, I found out his parents died in Japan.\u201d</p><br/><p>I frowned, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Suyang mention it to me before? I feel terrible. Suyang had such a painful time in Japan yet we went there for vacation\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make things up in your head! It happened so long ago! Suyang isn\u2019t the type to hold grudges.\u201d Shen Shaoqian replied.</p><br/><p><i>Really?</i> But Shen Shaoqian wasn\u2019t even there. So, there was no point in telling him about what happened. Furthermore, his tone didn\u2019t sound that confident.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo why were you two arguing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArguing? When did I say we were arguing?\u201d <i>Did it count as an argument? I wasn\u2019t sure. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhy else would you be wandering on the streets so late at night?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

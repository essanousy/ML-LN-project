But I couldn\u2019t recognize where we were. \u201cWhere are we going? Are you lost again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to go home, so I went for a spin. Would you like to go home now?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>I was surprised that Shen Shaoqian was actually attentive enough to notice. I was touched by his consideration. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s go home\u2026.\u201d I had to tell Suyang which side I was on. There was no point in dragging it. The longer I wait, the higher the chances I would sway.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d Shen Shaoqian began to mumbled, \u201cIt\u2019s too dark. I\u2019m kind of confused about where we are\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>As expected, he couldn\u2019t remain hot for more than three seconds. </i></p><br/><p>The area that Shen Shaoqian was heading towards was getting darker and darker. It was further and further away from the streetlights. I sighed and smacked him, \u201cHello!? You want to go into the woods? Hurry and turn back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t really care as I lowered my seat and closed my eyes to take a nap.</p><br/><p>By the time I had reopened my eyes, I noticed the car had stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong now?!\u201d Deep down, my patience was running thin.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2026.we ran out of gas!\u201d</p><br/><p>My eyes were opened in shock. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I stared around my surroundings but had no clue where we were. There weren\u2019t anyone around. No cars. There weren\u2019t even stars in the sky. <i>Where the heck were we?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do now? We\u2019re stuck here!\u201d I took out my cell phone and noticed there was no reception either. <i>F**k me</i>\u2026</p><br/><p><i>Were there ghosts around? It was such a spooky night. We were stuck in the middle of nowhere. What if a ghost comes out? Please no!!!! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cWe can only wait in the car and pray that someone will discover us. If not, then we\u2019ll go search for someone during the day.\u201d Shen Shaoqian didn\u2019t sound overly concerned.</p><br/><p><i>Dude, I have an emergency situation to deal with. </i>I was worried the longer I wait, the less confident I\u2019d be.</p><br/><p><i>Was it part of God\u2019s plan? Why must I have to bump into this useless Shen Shaoqian and enter his car? Now we\u2019re in the middle of nowhere</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Yixin, do you think ghosts exist in this world?\u201d Shen Shaoqian suddenly asked. I was caught off guard.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would I know\u2026 um\u2026 it depends on whether you believe they exist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think this is like a scene from a horror movie? What if something pops out and *wah*!\u201d Shen Shaoqian made a face to scare me.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you stupid?\u201d I smacked his brain. I was so calm that he seemed disappointed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo\u2026 most girls would leap into a guy\u2019s arm if they were spooked. Yet, you\u2026\u201d He shook his head.</p><br/><p>Then, he continued, \u201cOh yeah. I have a question I have been wanting to ask you. At the time, when you first met Suyang, I was also there!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you had moved to my apartment instead, would we have been together?\u201d</p><br/><p>I frowned. <i>What type of question was that?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not! Why are you asking this?\u201d</p><br/><p>I\u2019m just curious. If you and I had lived underneath the same roof, would things have turned out differently? Perhaps you would be my girlfriend now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat type of person do you think I am? I\u2019m not the casual type to fall in love with whoever that I live with\u2026.\u201d I muttered, \u201cWait\u2026 why are you asking me this? I\u2019m kind of scared. Are you Shen Shaoqian?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Shaoqian pinched his face, \u201cIt\u2019s my face, hair and voice. Replacement guaranteed if fake. Who else could I be if it\u2019s not me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re acting really weird today\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you break up with Suyang and be with me!?!\u201d Shen Shaoqian grabbed my hand and suddenly made a confession. \u201cI will treat you better than Suyang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke around!\u201d Shen Shaoqian happened to be holding onto my injured hand. I was in so much pain I could barely speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you today?! If you\u2019re going to be like this, I\u2019m going to walk back! I don\u2019t want to be with you in the same vehicle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat serious? I guess you have no feelings towards me\u2026\u201d Shen Shaoqian shook his head. Then he smiled, \u201cWell, I also like you as a friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Shaoqian was acting so strange. It was as if he was someone else. Shen Shaoqian scratched his messy hair and looked at his watch. Then, he looked kind of stress as he mumbled to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo plans to cheat? What should we do then\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cW-what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d <em>Something was definitely wrong with Shen Shaoqian. I secretly brushed my right hand for the right door handle. Even though it was pitch dark outside, I needed to leave immediately.</em></p><br/><p>But before I could feel the door handle, Shen Shaoqian grabbed my head with both hands and leaned over. Luckily, I managed to turn my head in time to avoid him. He was only able to kiss the corner of my mouth.</p><br/><p>Without thinking, I slapped Shen Shaoqian across the face as I wiped my mouth. \u201cAre you insane?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just today. Regardless of what you do, it wouldn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before I could comprehend the meaning of his words, Shen Shaoqian had already locked the doors and went over to my seat as he grabbed both my hands and put them above my head. His body was on top of mines.</p><br/><p>Since I had lowered my seat down, I actually made it super easy for him.</p><br/><p>I finally realized this person wanted to harm me. There was a glint of evil in his eyes, \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Shen Shaoqian!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! You\u2019re not Shen Shaoqian! Who are you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha!\u201d Suddenly, he began to laugh violently like a crazy person. \u201cYou\u2019ve finally figured it out? I thought my acting was very good. Whatever, it doesn\u2019t matter anymore. I was able to lure you here. Shen Shaoqian\u2019s job is done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d I stared at the deranged \u201cShen Shaoqian\u201d. <em>I didn\u2019t recall meeting a crazy Shen Shaoqian look-a-like anywhere</em>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a woman and man alone in a car. You are unable to move because of me. What do you think I want to do?\u201d Then, Shen Shaoqian leaned forward and rubbed his face against mines. I wanted to shift away but I couldn\u2019t move. He made me want to vomit.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang\u2019s woman. I really want to have a taste\u2026.\u201d He whispered into my ears. It made my entire body stiffen.</p><br/><p><i>Suyang? This person was related to Suyang? Could he be Shen Shaoqian\u2019s twin brother? Or someone who had possessed Shen Shaoqian\u2019s body?</i></p><br/><p>While my mind was bombarded by theories, this man had one hand over my hands while the other one was swimming all over my body. Luckily, it was late Autumn and I was wearing a lot. I couldn\u2019t really feel anything as he touched me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is Shen Shaoqian? What did you do to him? Who are you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShh\u2026.\u201d The man placed his finger against my lips, \u201cDo you think you\u2019re in a position to worry about others right now? So silly\u2026 You\u2019re so ridiculous that I cannot help thinking\u2026. How are you worthy of staying by Suyang\u2019s side?\u201d</p><br/><p>He forcefully lifted my chin like he wanted to break it. The next second, he was devouring my lips like a ferocious animal.</p><br/><p>\u201cN- no!\u201d I couldn\u2019t escape due to his strong grasp. It wasn\u2019t until he tasted blood that he stopped. He wiped off the blood like a devil and helped me wipe off mines as well.</p><br/><p>The person looked down at me and sneered, \u201cYou\u2019re quite average.\u201d</p><br/><p>All my humiliation and disgust gathered together and I couldn\u2019t control the tears that were rolling down my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cLong time no see. I guess you\u2019ve forgotten me entirely. Allow me to self introduce.\u201d The person paused and then began to laugh like an maniac. \u201cI\u2019m temporarily borrowing Shen Shaoqian\u2019s body. But I will soon become Lin Yixin. It\u2019s me, Anson.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice echoed continuously in my mind, \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

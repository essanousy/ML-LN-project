Touch was unavoidable.</p><br/><p>I lifted my head and realized Suyang\u2019s head was sticking out of the stall. I anxiously pointed at his head to indicate he had to lower it.</p><br/><p>Suyang understood and began to sit down on the toilet seat as he gave me an \u201cOK\u201d signal.</p><br/><p>Then, he pointed at my feet. The people outside could immediately see that it was a female pair of heels.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d I mouthed the words at him. If I made any movement, the heels were going to make a sound.</p><br/><p>But Suyang was much stronger than me at dealing with emergencies. He pulled me onto his lap and I sat on his thigh. My heels made two *da da* sound on the ground.</p><br/><p>I hurriedly lifted my feet up. Now, I was practically leaning on Suyang\u2019s body. Based on his painful expression, I could tell he was groaning silently.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was that sound?\u201d A person asked suspiciously. He began to head towards our direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there someone else? There\u2019s no one here, right?\u201d Someone knocked against our stall as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh..nothing. I just dropped something.\u201d Suyang calmly responded.</p><br/><p>The guy didn\u2019t ask any more questions as he began to do his own business.</p><br/><p>We managed to avoid getting caught, but right now, Suyang and I were sitting in a very sexual position. It was so awkward. From time to time, I would lift my head to look at him. My eyes would flicker and my heart rate would increase. <i>It was about to break through the limit!! </i></p><br/><p>As for Suyang, his leg was beginning to shake because I have been sitting on his thigh for too long.</p><br/><p>I felt kind of bad for him, so I tried to lessen his pain by shifting my weight somewhere else. But Suyang put his hands on my shoulder as he pursed his lips and shook his head. He didn\u2019t want me to move around.</p><br/><p>After there were no more sounds, Suyang pushed me off him and gently opened the stall.</p><br/><p>When he confirmed that there were no one else around, he quickly led me out of the washroom and exited the hotel. We were now in the garden outside.</p><br/><p><i>Alright, I\u2019ll admit it. While we were walking, the only thing that was on my mind was that Suyang was holding my hand. Suyang was holding my hand!!</i></p><br/><p>I was smiling bashfully behind him. I knew this blissful feeling was a sign that I was in love. The hand that he was holding felt all numb and tingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now on, stay here and wait for me. Don\u2019t go anywhere else. Just stay here. I\u2019ll be back. Then, we\u2019ll go home together. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>*Nod*. I obediently nodded. <i>How come this feels like a scene where the father is telling his child not to run off?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cRepeat what I said one more time. I\u2019m afraid you will forget, Goldfish.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, you want me to remain here. You will be back soon. And then we will head home together.\u201d I quietly repeated Suyang\u2019s words one more time. He nodded with satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cOk! So be obedient! See you soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>For every step Suyang took, he turned around ten times. I couldn\u2019t help but laugh and cry on the inside.<i> Do I really make him worry that much?</i></p><br/><p>After Suyang had given his order, I told myself I must remain strong. But soon, I realized the disadvantages of waiting outside.</p><br/><p>Since it was nighttime, there were a lot of bugs flying around me. In no time, I was being attacked left and right.</p><br/><p>Within a few minutes, five mosquitoes were already dead on my arm.</p><br/><p>I felt goosebumps from staring at their corpses.</p><br/><p><i>Should I go hide at a place where there was no mosquitoes? Or remain here while I wait for Suyang? </i></p><br/><p><i>Aii..so conflicted. </i></p><br/><p><i>Forget it. Since Suyang told me to wait for him here, I\u2019ll stay here</i>.</p><br/><p>Just as I made up my mind to fight with the mosquitoes until the very end, a familiar male voice appeared from the dark.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, we have met again.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Who was it?</i></p><br/><p>My ears twitched. <i>Was it because it was too dark? That voice sounded so creepy. </i>I couldn\u2019t help but feel a cold sensation on my back.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve forgotten about me? Because of you, that night, I rejected so many beautiful women. But you didn\u2019t call me\u2026\u2026I\u2019m so hurt. Yet, we\u2019ve met again. I guess we are fated?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>That night? Phone call? </i></p><br/><p>By the time I realized who it was, Director Rui\u2019s face had appeared within my sight of vision.</p><br/><p>Except now, I have no opportunity to escape\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you the pretty server from my hotel? Why are you here?\u201d Director Rui questioned with a frozen expression. He began to walk towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this also your hotel? I-I\u2019ve been transferred, manager.\u201d Currently, the only thing I could do was hope that Director Rui was a fool and that he would be tricked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you honestly take me for a fool?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Damn it. He saw through me\u2026. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re one of the flies around Mi Fan? I don\u2019t have time to deal with you. But again and again, you keep delivering yourself. So you can\u2019t blame me.\u201d Director Rui\u2019s face harden and looked a bit cruel.</p><br/><p>I was terrified. Although I wasn\u2019t exactly sure what Director Rui was going to do to me, deep down, I knew he was no Buddha.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-what do you mean?\u201d I remained still as I watched the distance between us shrink.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am disgusted by the buzzing sounds flies make around humans. What do I have to do to get rid of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Rui suddenly reached his hand out. I thought he wanted to slap me, so I raised my hand to covered my head as I backed away like a reflex.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d Director Rui softly whispered as he held onto my raised wrist. He laughed coolly, \u201cI am not going to use violence against you in public.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, his large hand went from my wrist to my hair as he twirled it around his fingers.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow should I deal with you? Should I kill you?\u201d It sounded like he was asking himself.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t believe Director Rui could smile as he said something so evilly. My intuition told me he wasn\u2019t joking. He might actually kill me and no one would find out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you saying a word?\u201d Director Rui pressed his two arms over my shoulders as he lowered his head to make eye contact with me. I could totally sense the aura of death, \u201cTell me, how should I deal with you? I find the flies around me so annoying\u2026..\u201d He drawled.</p><br/><p>By now, my head was in an utter mess. I couldn\u2019t think of anything. I wasn\u2019t sure what my next step should be. Currently, I was like meat on a platter. My only wish was that Suyang will not appear. I didn\u2019t want Director Rui to discover him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

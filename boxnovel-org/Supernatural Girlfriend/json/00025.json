Why did you come down to disturb me?\u201d Suyang reacted like I was a sinner, \u201cI know you\u2019re not of much use, but can you not cause trouble?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI purposely came down for you! There is flashing lightning and thundering outside. What if you get hit by lightning? Plus, even if you don\u2019t get struck, you will catch a cold after standing in the rain for so long!\u201d I felt wronged as all my emotions began to bubble up from within.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, I exploded. I shoved Suyang and shrieked, \u201cIf you want to get drenched so badly, then go! From now on, I won\u2019t give a shit even if you die outside!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, I ran straight into the elevator door. I planned to go up on my own.</p><br/><p>Just as the elevator door was about to close, an arm reached in and the elevator doors opened again. Suyang stood in front of me as droplets of water continued to drip on the ground. He gazed at me attentively as he entered the elevator and leaned against a corner. His voice couldn\u2019t be anymore quiet, \u201cWait for me\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>When my handsome bodyguard saw both of us drenched, he was astonished. Then, he waved at me, but I ignored him and walked straight into the apartment. I was still furious at Suyang, so I acted in a fit of pique and pretended like he didn\u2019t exist.</p><br/><p>This was the first time I had encountered a person who failed to cherish himself at all!</p><br/><p>As expected, after the storm, Suyang caught a cold.</p><br/><p>Suyang wiped his runny nose on tissues and left it all over the apartment. The bacteria followed him everywhere.</p><br/><p>In order to prevent myself from getting infected, I had to make all sorts of preparation to defend myself.</p><br/><p>Suyang spent the entire day on the computer; he was wearing a mask that only revealed his eyes. He was sneakily working on something. Later on, he thoughtfully turned towards my direction with his evil-looking eyes as he waved me over, \u201cGoldfish, come here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I walked towards Suyang but stood at least 2 metres apart from him as I was afraid he would give me his germs.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome closer, I have something to say to you.\u201d Due to the cold, Suyang\u2019s voice had turned very raspy and low. I wasn\u2019t used to it, but it did sound a lot manlier than his usual voice.</p><br/><p>I shook my head to show my refusal, \u201cYou can tell me from here. I can hear you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome over, I have private words.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is only two of us in the house! There is no difference between private words or normal conversations?!\u201d I rolled my eyes at Suyang as I threatened him, \u201cAre you going to tell me or not? If you\u2019re not going to say it, I\u2019m leaving!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Suyang took off his mask and pouted. His eyes revealed disappointment and sorrow. For some reason, I couldn\u2019t bear to see him upset so I sighed and kindly walked towards him. I lowered my waist to his level and placed my ear near him, \u201cWhat do you want to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I completely let my guard down, Suyang abruptly grabbed my head and held it in a fixed position. Then, he coughed in my face *cough cough cough cough*!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d While Suyang was coughing, I had my eyes closed as I held onto my breath. If he spread his germs to me, I\u2019m going to kill him!</p><br/><p>Ugh, I should have known he would never have good intentions\u2026</p><br/><p>With great difficulty, I broke out of Suyang\u2019s grasp as I stared at the keywords he had typed in search: How can I quickly get rid of a cold?</p><br/><p>The response beneath: Give the cold to someone else.</p><br/><p>Wow\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou annoying goblin! You\u2019re so blackhearted! You will suffer a terrible retribution!\u201d I seized a cushion from the couch and used all my strength to throw at it him. Then, I stormed back into my room.</p><br/><p>It turned out I was correct. Suyang\u2019s plan was useless. For the next few days, he was still the only one with the fever and running nose. Each time I walked by him, I would hum a joyful song and Suyang would give me a dirty look.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo apparently, those with lower IQs don\u2019t catch colds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re alive, the most important thing is your health!\u201d I shook my head at Suyang; deliberately wanting to anger him.</p><br/><p>Suyang rolled his eyes at me and then pointed at a folder on the coffee table, \u201cOpen it and take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Suyang had pranked me too many times, I refused to accept anything he gives me anymore; especially when it\u2019s inside a folder.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, you have to tell me what\u2019s inside\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour profile for school.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Suyang opened his mouth, my eyes and mouth grew big.</p><br/><p><i>School profile?! What the heck? I\u2019ve already graduated from University a few years ago. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already told you. My next project is related to love. I need a student role.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss! Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re using me as a white mouse again? You want me to be your experimental girlfriend?\u201d Deep down, I was really hoping he was joking. I opened up the folder and took a look at \u201cmy\u201d profile. After carefully analyzing it, aside from my sex, everything else was fabricated.</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally, an actress was supposed to take the role of Bai Silu and enter the school. But she ended up accepting a movie and breaking her contract with me. So I have no choice but to get you to replace Bai Silu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Suyang\u2019s words, I was very annoyed, \u201cSo are you saying you are using me because the other person ditched you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang could hear the annoyance in my tone so he added an extra explanation. \u201cWhen I prepared this role, you were not my assistant yet\u2026.so\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder you kept appearing near the Universities. Do you think anyone can get in nowadays? How can you enrol a person that doesn\u2019t exist in real life into an University?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA wise man has his methods.\u201d Suyang bragged.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what do you want me to do once I enter? If you really want to create a character, then you should be the student yourself. Why do you have to make me\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang slyly laughed, \u201cI have my own stuff to do. Just act your part well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you right now, I am selling my skills; not my body! Don\u2019t even think of creating a romantic relationship between me and a professor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you want to sell your body, no one would want to pay. Don\u2019t overestimate yourself\u2026\u201d Suyang acted like a soothing grandma as he patted my shoulders and coldly walked away.</p><br/><p>So, under Suyang\u2019s miraculous methods, he somehow managed to create a second opportunity for me to enter University.</p><br/><p>I sat in the classroom filled with noise as I observed the different groups of students chatting. They were all in their early twenties, but I was already in my mid twenties. *Sigh* Time waits for nobody!</p><br/><p>Last night, I had to memorize my entire profile. From the beginning to end, nothing was real. It required a lot of effort.</p><br/><p>I was accustomed to sitting at the spot that I used to sit back when I was in school. Then, I took out my cell phone and waited for Suyang to text me. Today, before I left the apartment, he acted like a stern grandpa and said he will message me my next steps.</p><br/><p>Minutes passed by but Suyang\u2019s text message never came. I was starting to think whether he expected me to react on the spot. Was this another prank?</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the professor for this lecture was female. At least I was safe for now.</p><br/><p>While I was focused on my cell phone, another female student suddenly appeared and quietly sat down next to me.</p><br/><p>She had jet black straight hair and pitiful looking eyes. Her skin was white, and there was a nobility aura surrounding her. In addition, she was quite stunning to look at.</p><br/><p>But I was too focused on my cell phone and didn\u2019t spend much time dwelling on her. I spent the entire class attentively watching my phone. I didn\u2019t receive anything; even the usual small advertisements weren\u2019t displaying.</p><br/><p>The lecture was over. I packed up my books and planned to leave. But the student beside me had no intentions of getting up. She was in my way. So I awkwardly said, \u201cSorry, can you move over? I have to go now\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t pay attention to me as she stared straight off into a distant place. Her attention was on the girl that was walking towards me.</p><br/><p>I also followed her eyes. It turned out\u2026</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t hide my shock. It took me half a second to snap out of it. The girl that was walking towards me had the exact same face as the girl sitting next to me.</p><br/><p>I switched back and forth and compared the two.</p><br/><p>They were the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Silu classmate, we have a class party today. You\u2019re new. Why don\u2019t you join us?!\u201d When the girl standing in front of me totally disregarded the girl sitting down, I understood.</p><br/><p>The girl sitting next to me during the lecture was not a person.</p><br/><p>She was a ghost.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

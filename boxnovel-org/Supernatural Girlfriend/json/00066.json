Don\u2019t be surprised. I can see you. I am here to help your son. So, I want to ask you something about your past\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>*buzz buzz* Before I could finish, my cellphone was ringing. The serious atmosphere was broken by the phone call. It was bad regardless I picked up or not. I apologized to Lu Wenxue \u201cSorry, give me a second. I need to pick up a call.\u201d</p><br/><p>I walked a few metres away.</p><br/><p>The phone displayed: My most beloved boss.</p><br/><p><i>My most beloved boss. Who\u2026.?</i></p><br/><p><i>Don\u2019t tell me it was Suyang? </i></p><br/><p><i>But this was in my phone contacts?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure who it was, so I politely picked up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you run off to?\u201d I could hear the annoyance from the other side.</p><br/><p>Based on the sluggish and stretched out sounds, I could tell it was Suyang.</p><br/><p>I glanced at Lu Wenxue. He was still waiting for me. \u201cI\u2019m out right now. It\u2019s very important. I gotta\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you dare to hang up on me, you\u2019re not getting your salary this month.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>How dare he use my precious salary to threaten me? </i>I was steaming mad. \u201cHow can you deduct my salary? This is considered illegal bullying of staff! I am protesting! I protest against unreasonable deduction of wages!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Lin. Please speak with your conscience. You\u2019re my assistant. I am using money to buy your 24 hours to help me. Yet, you\u2019re telling me you\u2019re busy doing something else during work hours? And you dare to accept my salary?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026.\u201d I was at a loss for words. In comparison to other assistants, I was kind of unreliable. But that\u2019s because Suyang wasn\u2019t usually that strict\u2026 <i>wasn\u2019t there a saying? If the upper beam isn\u2019t straight, the lower beam will be crooked?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cWell, no matter what, I\u2019m against deducting wages. There are 30 days in a month, 24 hours in a day. I don\u2019t have a single day off! Plus, earlier, you didn\u2019t have any specific orders. Just let me out for a bit\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026.I went to see a friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFriend? Obviously, you\u2019re lying. Did you go find Shaonu again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! No! No!\u201d Suyang figured it out so quickly! Ahhhh. I was so scared that I rushed to create a reason, \u201cI\u2019m really out to see a friend. Can we chat after I return? I really\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDenying only takes once. But three times or more goes to show you\u2019re doing something fishy.\u201d Suyang analyzed as if he was Sherlock Holmes. \u201cI\u2019m giving you thirty minutes to return. If not, your month salary is gone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before I could reply, Suyang hung up on me.</p><br/><p><i>Uggh! How rude! He used my salary to threaten me. It was something I valued the most! </i></p><br/><p>New moves weren\u2019t necessary as long as the old ones worked. Suyang\u2019s move was too cruel! He made it impossible for me not to comply.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm. Mr. Lu Wenxue. I have a sudden emergency that I must leave immediately. Tomorrow at 7pm. Please go to Qing Tan building A, 16th floor, 1804. I will be waiting for you there. Remember. Tomorrow, Qing Tan building! Building A, 16th floor, 1804!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was afraid he would forget, so I repeated it twice.</p><br/><p><i>Ghosts know how to look up addresses, right? </i></p><br/><p>Whatever. I had to return to Suyang as soon as I can. So I rushed back to the apartment.</p><br/><p>Half an hour?! Unless I could fly, I wouldn\u2019t be able to make it back in half an hour.</p><br/><p>As expected, by the time I had returned, it was already an hour later.</p><br/><p>The moment I entered, Suyang was sitting by the entrance. I was astonished.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have been waiting all along? Aren\u2019t you tired?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d Suyang was leaning on his chair with his legs spread out wide. Since he was right in front of me, my path was blocked. The way he was inspecting me was similar to how a police officer would interrogate a criminal.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss.\u201d I took off my shoes, \u201cYou\u2019re aware that you\u2019re exposing your most sensitive spot to me, right? Are you sure you aren\u2019t doing it on purpose?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I said those words, Suyang covered his \u201cimportant area\u201d. He backed away and asked again when he was at a safe distance, \u201cWhere did you go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already told you. I went to see a friend. How about you? You didn\u2019t go out? No date with Mi Fan today? Have you came across any significant information?\u201d</p><br/><p>I took off my shoes and entered the apartment as I headed to the fridge to take out a bottle of cold water.</p><br/><p>Suyang was closely following me from behind. He pressed his two hands on the fridge with me in between.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The instant I turned around, I realized our distance was super close. I couldn\u2019t help but jerk away. But I ended up slamming my foot against the fridge.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! So painful! So painful!\u201d I hastily lifted my injured foot and rubbed it. Since I had poor balance, I had one hand on Suyang\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>It was already red and swollen\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot\u2026.\u201d Suyang muttered.</p><br/><p>But I heard him, and I gave him a sharp killer glare and he didn\u2019t dare to say anything else.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome and sit down on the couch.\u201d Suyang guided me towards the couch as I held onto him and hopped my way over to sit down.</p><br/><p>I laid on the couch and moaned, \u201cOh. I\u2019m suffering from an injury\u2026. Boss, this is considered a workplace injury, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t a single employee agreement that would list a clause of compensating a goldfish for its brainless actions.\u201d As Suyang insulted me, he went over to the freezer and took out an ice bag and threw it at me. \u201cToday, you must have gone to find Shen Shaonu. Or else, you wouldn\u2019t be acting so guilty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! It\u2019s because you were standing too close to me, so I was caught off guard.\u201d</p><br/><p>I have decided to deny until the very end, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to continue getting so close to me, I\u2019m going to sue you for sexual harassment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe? Sexual harassing you?\u201d Suyang sneered as he laughed hysterically. Then, he lifted his head as if he was thinking of something. But he quickly shook it and resumed his outrageous laughter again.</p><br/><p>Based on his reaction, whatever he was thinking of was definitely nothing good.</p><br/><p>For some reason, I was annoyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know there\u2019s something called a safe distance between people? Especially when it comes to the opposite sex. There\u2019s a certain point you\u2019re definitely not supposed to cross!\u201d I yelled at Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?! Is that so? I wasn\u2019t aware.\u201d Suyang had a shameless expression on his face. He truly lived up in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Teacher Lin will now begin her class. Between 0 to 0.44 metres is considered an intimate distance. As an author, I can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t know this. It\u2019s because you suddenly invaded my personal space, that\u2019s why I injured my foot. It\u2019s not because I was feeling guilty!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was confusion written all over Suyang\u2019s face. <i>No. This will not do. I must teach him about life. </i></p><br/><p><i>If he\u2019s going to randomly get so close to any girl, based on his handsome looks, how many women will he lead on?!</i></p><br/><p><i>Especially now that I have a competition, Mi Fan. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cCome over here!\u201d I patted to the spot next to me. \u201cCome and sit down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the scheming expression on my face, Suyang had no indication of coming over.</p><br/><p>\u201cPsssh. Hurry and come over here!\u201d I patted next to the couch again; as if he was a dog. \u201cYou\u2019re a manly man and you\u2019re afraid I will do something to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Suyang\u2019s current expression was \u201cI\u2019m always on guard every second of the day when it comes to you.\u201d He was acting like an unmarried maiden as he carefully sat down next to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cCatch this!\u201d The moment Suyang sat down, I quickly threw the ice bag behind him; making him turn around to get it. Then, at the precise moment when he turned around, I placed my face as close as I could to the back of his head. That way, the moment he turned over, the distance between our faces would be 20cm.</p><br/><p>I was already prepared. <i>Little darling, I\u2019m going to teach you how frightening an intimate distance is! </i></p><br/><p><i>I\u2019m going to make you tremble, human! </i></p><br/><p><i>Muhaha! Take this! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you throw that\u2026\u201d Suyang had just turned around and noticed I was right in his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Suyang blinked his eyes and his face was turning red.</p><br/><p><i>Huh? How come I didn\u2019t get the anticipated \u201cahh?\u201d I was expecting?</i> I thought he was going to back up like crazy. Even though I was so close to him, he didn\u2019t have any indication of pulling back. In fact, he was bravely making eye contact with me.</p><br/><p><i>Uh oh, this wasn\u2019t good. We were too close. It was as if his five facial features were magnified. I must only stare at one spot. But where? His eyes? Nose? Or mouth? Ai ya, my mind was starting to turn dizzy. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at? Make eye contact!\u201d Suyang held onto my shoulders and pushed me further back. Now, the distance between us was an arm\u2019s length. I was able to clearly stare at his face.</p><br/><p><i>Talk about awkward\u2026.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, haha, you\u2019re so calm when it comes to things like this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat thing? Are you talking about how I figured out you were about to forcefully kiss me?\u201d The corner of Suyang\u2019s mouth curved into a smile. It was a sneaky smile that I couldn\u2019t decipher.</p><br/><p><i>He had misunderstood! He thought I wanted to kiss him! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cNo! Boss, you\u2019ve misunderstood! I had no intentions of kissing you. I just wanted to teach you what an intimate distance was\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were trying to create a sexual harassment scenario, eh? As a handsome young man that could be described a delicate flower and refined jade, I\u2019m actually concerned for my safety as I am living with a woman who\u2019s like a wolf and tiger!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

So I quickly altered my words, \u201cWere you and the police secretly monitoring me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Suyang responded. He poured a cup of water for himself and crossed his legs as he leaned back against the chair with a cheeky expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you guys know my plan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUse your goldfish brain. What is my relationship with Shen Shaoqian?\u201d Suyang hooked his finger through the centre of the frame and took the glasses off.</p><br/><p>There were no lenses to begin with.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe told me you wanted to borrow his surveillance camera glasses frame. I can\u2019t believe you were planning to risk your own life to capture the killer.\u201d Based on his tone, I couldn\u2019t tell if he felt helpless or he was trying to mock me.</p><br/><p>At the time, I had nicely requested Shen Shaoqian not to tell Suyang. Unexpectedly, he still did. I pouted my mouth and wouldn\u2019t look at Suyang straight in the eye.</p><br/><p>I must seem so stupid to him now\u2026</p><br/><p>My original plan was to record all of the homicidal maniac\u2019s criminal activities with my glasses.That way, when the police searched through my dead body, they would discover the secret of the glasses and have the necessary evidence in order to seize him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. You saw through my plan. And you saved my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since I had survived such a horrific incident, I was naturally quite casual about it. But Suyang\u2019s expression was not casual at all. His face was rock solid as he jabbed my brain. \u201cYou called that a plan? A paramecium is a hundred times smarter than you at dealing with its enemies!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Ah! Ah! So painful!\u201d I stopped Suyang as I glared at him, \u201cMy brain is injured! Can\u2019t you see the bandages around my head? How can you poke it!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSee what? I have to make you suffer a bit so you can evolve into a human with an intellectual mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang really enjoyed making me red in the face. He smiled and said in a satisfactory manner, \u201cI told you. When you get beat up, I will call the police for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he was joking, he actually did it.</p><br/><p>At the end of the day, Suyang saved my life. At that moment, I felt as if Suyang was shining in radiance.</p><br/><p>It seemed more and more probable..</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah! Sheyu!\u201d I suddenly remembered. Now that the homicidal maniac was dead, Sheyu\u2019s spirit should\u2019ve returned. I aggressively yanked the intravenous drip off my hand and surprised Suyang. He widened his legs and spread his arms to block my path. \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to see someone.\u201d I tried to push Suyang away. As it happened, a wave of dizziness hit me and I lost the strength in both my legs and tumbled backwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cCareful!\u201d Suyang hastily caught me and I was firmly wrapped in his embrace like a baby.</p><br/><p>Since we\u2019ve met, this was the first time we were so intimately close to each other. Thus, the feeling was magnified.</p><br/><p>As my back leaned against his chest, I could feel his heart beating. I inhaled a deep breath and I could smell the faint fresh lemon scent on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t even walk, and you want to go somewhere?\u201d Suyang\u2019s voice hovered above me. I raised my head and we made direct eye contact. By now, I couldn\u2019t hear anything that he was saying. My heart was beating like crazy. I\u2019ve been single for 25 years.</p><br/><p>Suyang also took my second maiden crush moment.</p><br/><p>The first time occurred in my dream. This time, it was reality.</p><br/><p>I continued acting like I was in a paralyzed state. I placed all my weight against Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak to me, Goldfish!\u201d Suyang had one hand supporting me and the other firmly smacking my face. \u201cGoldfish! Lin Yixin! Can you hear me? Your brain isn\u2019t damaged from the impact, right?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>What should I say? What am I supposed to say? He was watching me? Why was he watching me? Oh, I need to say something! The atmosphere was too acute. What should I do? He is so good looking. Was he always this handsome? How come he looked especially good today? </i></p><br/><p>I must look like a dwarf right now. Suddenly, I wanted to leave a good impression. I didn\u2019t want to lean on him like an useless person. Oh God, who can tell me what to do\u2026.?</p><br/><p>All my brain cells were awaken as they operated with flying speed. Then, the short circuit fumed with rage and discharged smoke..</p><br/><p>Suyang dragged me to the bed in a sitting position as he bent over in front of me and clapped his hands. \u201cGoldfish! Wake up! Come back!\u201d</p><br/><p>His loud voice brought me back from my inner world.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026..I. am. going. to. see. Sheyu. I. think. she. is. awake.\u201d For some reason, I sounded very robotic. My arms and legs were stiff as I headed towards the exit. Surprisingly, they obeyed my orders.</p><br/><p>As I left the room, I was quite disappointed with myself. At critical moments like these, I should be calm and collected. Yet, I acted like a fool and was a complete mess.</p><br/><p>The feeling could be described as someone scolding me, but I wasn\u2019t able to come up with an argument until after I had returned home. I regretted not speaking up to alleviate my situation when I could.</p><br/><p>After I escaped from Suyang\u2019s side, I took small quick steps towards Sheyu\u2019s ward.</p><br/><p>From a distance, I could hear a lot of noise coming from her ward. When I got close to the entrance, I could hear tears of joy from Sheyu\u2019s parents.</p><br/><p>I was quite confident that Sheyu was awake.</p><br/><p>I lightly knocked on the door as I poked my head in. Surprisingly, there were a lot of people inside. There were police officers, the doctor, and Sheyu\u2019s parents.</p><br/><p>Most importantly, Sheyu was awake and sitting on the bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSheyu! You\u2019re awake! I am so glad!\u201d I happily skipped over because I wanted to hold her hand. But Sheyu appeared bewildered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are\u2026?\u201d Sheyu had confusion written all over her face.</p><br/><p>My hand hovered in midair. Facing her blank expression, I lowered my head and wasn\u2019t sure where I should place my two hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you\u2026.?\u201d Sheyu weakly asked. The three words were softly spoken but they penetrated through my heart. Suddenly, everywhere seemed very dark, and I was standing at a corner with everyone\u2019s attention on me.</p><br/><p>Out of the bunch, Sheyu\u2019s gaze was the most intense. I felt as if their eyes were the light source. The line of sight was the equivalent to light rays as they shined on me.</p><br/><p>It was as if I was a convict being interrogated. I felt awkward, but I had nowhere to hide.</p><br/><p>\u201cSheyu, she is the girl you rescued last time. It\u2019s because of her that we finally caught the homicidal maniac.\u201d I heard someone introducing me to Sheyu.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026.uh, I want to thank you for saving me last time\u2026also, I\u2019m sorry you ended up getting harmed because of me.\u201d I took a step back to give myself a way out of this embarrassing situation.</p><br/><p><i>She honestly doesn\u2019t remember me?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cYou managed to catch the murderer who committed all sorts of crime. We, the police department, should be ashamed of ourselves!\u201d Sheyu smiled as she joked. But I couldn\u2019t smile at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t remember me?\u201d I was too stubborn. My heart truly wanted to know, and subconsciously it rolled off my tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Most likely, my voice was too low, Sheyu didn\u2019t hear me, and asked.</p><br/><p>I immediately shook my head, \u201cNothing. Nothing! I said, I hope you get well soon. You\u2019re a good police officer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, I bowed to everyone and rushed out of the suffocating room.</p><br/><p>Perhaps humans were selfish, I missed the spirit Sheyu. We used to be inseparable.</p><br/><p>She was the first person I considered a friend. She saved me, and I saved her. Yet, she had forgotten about me; whereas I still remember her. After all the things we\u2019ve been through, I felt like it was unfair to me.</p><br/><p>Originally, I left in high spirits, but I returned dispirited and downcast. I went in my cold and empty ward. Both my mind and body were exhausted. I climbed in bed and lied on my stomach as I supported my chin with my elbows and stared out the window. I watched the wavering branch as I began to ponder life.</p><br/><p>The leaves were randomly swishing around with a lack of tempo. It was just like how I felt on the inside -confused and irritated.</p><br/><p>I walked towards the window and opened it. The cold night air ruthlessly entered and I began to tremble from the cold. Yet, I had no intentions of closing it. Once in a while, getting blown by the wind was probably good for my opinionated brain.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll catch a cold like this.\u201d An arm suddenly appeared in front of me and pulled the window shut. The transparent window reflected Suyang\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still here?\u201d I gazed at the reflection as I softly said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late. You should return home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened? Earlier you were like a lively tiger. Why are you like a frosted eggplant now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to mock me, just stop. I\u2019m not in the mood to hear this stuff right now. Leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I know. I\u2019m not here to be sarcastic. I know this is not a good time, but I still have to say\u2026.\u201d Suyang stammered. He was acting all shy and awkward. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder. <i>Was he going to confess to me?</i></p><br/>\n</div>"}

It\u2019s not like you will lose a piece of meat.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Oh yeah! Don\u2019t you normally like to do the opposite of what I say? Go and fight me! Go against me! Use your malicious mouth and devilish heart to attack me!!! Hurry!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. I will go.\u201d Suyang clapped his hand and decide.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, God! I have finally completed my assignment. Thank you, Yixin.\u201d Shen Shaoqian grabbed my hand to show his appreciation.</p><br/><p>Hearing Suyang\u2019s answer, I felt like a leaking balloon. I sat down on the sofa in low spirits. After bitterly smiling, I wanted to punch Shen Shaoqian\u2019s handsome face a few times.</p><br/><p><i>Thank Socialism for saving you. From now on, live kindly!</i> (tl: I don\u2019t get it\u2026)</p><br/><p><i>Humph!</i></p><br/><p><i>I was so sad\u2026. Now I have finally experienced what \u201ccuriosity killed the cat\u201d meant! </i></p><br/><p>Today was one of the most depressing days of my life. In the morning, I watched Suyang get ready to go on a blind date with the reporter.</p><br/><p>When we had our fake date, he didn\u2019t even attempt to dress up! Humph!</p><br/><p>Suyang was fixing his hair as he said to me, \u201cI might not be home for dinner tonight. There\u2019s no need to wait for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk.\u201d My mind was all over the place as I recklessly pound the keys on my laptop.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, there are no more popsicles in the fridge. Make sure you buy them before I return. I want the mung bean flavour. Twenty of them. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Why do you have so much garbage to say today? Hurry and go! I will deal with the stuff at home. You don\u2019t have to worry about it!\u201d I roughly closed my laptop and yelled at Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you\u2026.so\u2026.\u201d It was rare for Suyang to recoil, \u201cI am leaving\u2026 why are you rushing me\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Suyang closed the door, I couldn\u2019t suppress my frustrations any longer. I took off my slipper and threw it onto the ground. \u201cAh!!! I\u2019m so annoyed! Ahhhhh!!\u201d</p><br/><p>After calming down, I took a deep breath and held onto the wall. I imitated Suyang\u2019s tone of voice from earlier, \u201cI might not be home for dinner tonight. There is no need to wait for me\u2026.humph! You think I\u2019m going to wait for you?! Don\u2019t overestimate yourself! While you\u2019re not home, I\u2019m going to eat everything. I won\u2019t even leave a tiny piece of pea for you! Don\u2019t come home for dinner. If you have game, don\u2019t come home to sleep!\u201d</p><br/><p>I reclined on the sofa again and opened my laptop.</p><br/><p>My keyboard was making kaka noises, and there were a bunch of nonsense characters displayed on the monitor. <i>Did my laptop crash?</i></p><br/><p><i>Uggh, even my laptop was against me. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cNo. You need to wake up, Lin Yixin. You cannot like Suyang! He is like the Sun in the sky. He isn\u2019t someone an ordinary person like yourself can have. It\u2019s better you give up early and be his honest assistant. Your current life is quite good. Don\u2019t be upset over something like this, understand? It\u2019s not like he\u2019s your boyfriend. You have no right to get angry or upset.\u201d I stared at my black screen laptop and reminded myself.</p><br/><p>But the more that I said, the more upset I felt. By the end of it, I dejectedly rolled off the sofa and laid on the ground.</p><br/><p>Suyang had already left for thirty minutes. They have probably met by now.</p><br/><p><i>What are they doing after they meet? Eating? Chatting? Watching a movie? </i></p><br/><p><i>If they are eating, what type of food are they eating? Could they be dining at a romantic western restaurant? Or perhaps having elegant Japanese cuisine? Or friendly Chinese food? </i></p><br/><p><i>It seemed like Suyang was quite interested in Mi Fan. They should be having a great time?! Suyang and Mi Fan\u2026. </i></p><br/><p>I shouldn\u2019t be thinking of this. But I couldn\u2019t control myself. I moaned about my imaginary illness as I continuously rolled across the floor.</p><br/><p>I rolled from the living room wall, all the way to the living room window. Back and forth.</p><br/><p>Another thirty minutes had passed \u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! He had already left for an hour! But he still hasn\u2019t returned!\u201d I bellowed. Although Suyang told me not to wait on him for dinner, deep down, I was secretly hoping that the door will open the very next second.</p><br/><p>Now, I somewhat understood how pets feel when they are left at home by themselves.</p><br/><p>*Di di di di* Someone was pressing the password by the door.</p><br/><p><i>Was Suyang back? </i>I hastily stood up and pretended none of this had happened. I randomly grabbed a book from the bookshelf and hopped onto the sofa as I opened it. I must give Suyang the misconception that I had been reading the entire time.</p><br/><p>After half a day later, the buzzer was still beeping, but the door hasn\u2019t opened.</p><br/><p>I thought it was strange, so I went to open the door.</p><br/><p>The moment I pulled the door open, I saw a girl bending down with a red notebook filled with different combinations. It appeared she was attempting to try all the combinations.</p><br/><p>When she saw me, she was stupefied.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d I spoke to her like an adult as I expressionlessly pointed at the notebook she was holding.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t Suyang\u2019s\u2026..sorry! Looks like I went to the wrong place\u2026.\u201d The young teenage girl muttered to herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are a thief?\u201d I didn\u2019t know where I had the guts to confront her so openly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no!\u201d The girl instantly waved her hands. Then, she looked at the number of the apartment and seemed to hesitate. However, she quickly gave me an explanation, \u201cI came to find someone. But I may have entered the wrong floor. Just in case, I want to know if this is Suyang\u2019s home?\u201d</p><br/><p>This girl looks like around seventeen or eighteen years of age. She was wearing a school uniform and had a name tag: Chengxin Female High, Shen Shaonu.</p><br/><p><i>A High school student? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Suyang\u2019s place. But you are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this is Suyang brother\u2019s place, then who are you?\u201d In literally a second, the girl\u2019s eyes flashed. She went from kind to hostile. In the blink of an eye, she turned from an angel to a devil.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! I know!\u201d Shaonu smacked her her, \u201cYou\u2019re the cleaning auntie, right? Suyang brother is so ridiculous. If he wanted someone to clean for him, he could\u2019ve simply ask me. Why waste money to hire a cleaning woman?\u201d As she was speaking, she was about to enter.</p><br/><p><i>Cleaning auntie?</i></p><br/><p><i>CLEANING AUNTIE?!?!</i></p><br/><p>The words collapsed on me like a rock. It was as if they had directly landed on my heart. I was injured everywhere\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cStop right there!\u201d I blocked the entrance with one hand. I refuse to let this punk inside, \u201cIs this your home? You think you can enter whenever you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAuntie, you\u2019re too conservative!\u201d Shaonu laughed at me, \u201cI know the owner of this place. If you don\u2019t believe me, give him a call.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou punk. The owner you\u2019re looking for isn\u2019t here right now. There\u2019s only another owner in here that doesn\u2019t know you. And that is me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAuntie, what are you trying to say? Could it be that you live here?\u201d Shaonu\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat is your relationship with Suyang brother?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

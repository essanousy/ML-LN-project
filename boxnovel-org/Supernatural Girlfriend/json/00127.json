This wasn\u2019t the first time that I had to remind myself I was Lin Yixin from now on.</p><br/><p>I had to go through a lot in order to get rid of the Anson that Suyang despised to become the Lin Yixin that he loved.</p><br/><p>We had been apart for over twenty years. Now, I could finally return to his side. When I saw Suyang anxiously waiting for me with open arms at the main entrance of the apartment building, I knew that the 20 year wait was worth it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d Suyang rushed over warily. He grabbed me and pressed my head against his chest.</p><br/><p><i>You have no idea how many times I had dreamt of this reunion. </i></p><br/><p>I slowly lifted my shaky arms and hugged him back. It was strange. Earlier, when I had switch souls with Lin Yixin, I wasn\u2019t the slightest bit nervous. But now, I couldn\u2019t stop trembling.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I made you worry.\u201d I blissfully breathed in all of Suyang\u2019s scent. I felt intoxicated.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave\u2026you decided?\u201d Suyang\u2019s voice was a bit shaky.</p><br/><p>I released him and passionately gazed into his eyes, \u201cI\u2019ve decided. I will not leave you. I\u2019m not going to leave this lifetime. I\u2019m never going to separate away from you.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Yes. I shall forever stay by his side as Lin Yixin!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my goldfish! I knew you would make the correct decision.\u201d Suyang smiled. Then, he lowered his head and planted a light kiss on my forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t return for the entire night. I nearly had a heart attack. How\u2019s your wrist now?\u201d Suyang was analyzing my injury like I was a precious valuable.</p><br/><p><i>Oh yeah, I was the one who shoved Lin Yixin. </i></p><br/><p>I knew that Grandmother Meng was going to confront Suyang and Lin Yixin last night. As a result, I had been concealing myself in their apartment as a spirit. When I heard that Suyang was going to take Lin Yixin out for dinner, I knew it was going to ruin my plan. So, I deliberately shoved her down the stairs to stop them from leaving the apartment.</p><br/><p>The wrist injury was nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine now. I think I\u2019m ok.\u201d I tried my best to suppress the surge of emotions within me. I tried to pretend I was calm as I pulled my hand back.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Let\u2019s go home first.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>H-home?</i> I\u2019ve been waiting for Suyang to say this word to me for far too long. It caught me off guard and took quite a moment for me to recover. Then, I nodded enthusiastically, \u201cYes. Let\u2019s go home!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I got to the entrance, Xiazhi tried to block me. I knew he was Xialing\u2019s older brother. Hence, before I left, I purposely told Yuxiang to keep a close eye on Xialing. I didn\u2019t want her to ruin my plan.</p><br/><p>As for Xiazhi, he was no threat. He was merely a ghost. There was nothing he could do. Plus, if I wanted to, I had the ability to make him disappear so that he wouldn\u2019t even be able to live as a ghost. However, Xialing would go insane and that was not something I would like to deal with right now.</p><br/><p>I gave Xiazhi a provoking smile while Suyang wasn\u2019t paying attention. I\u2019ve been hiding as a spirit in Suyang\u2019s apartment for a long time. By now, I have a sufficient understanding of their relationship. However, it truly surprised me that Lin Yixin had never once discovered me. She was definitely the most pathetic supernatural being I had ever met.</p><br/><p>But after today, she will be living as Anson in Japan. She will be taken in as a mentally unstable patient and forever imprisoned in a mental institution. Yuxiang will help me arrange everything. All I had to do was enjoy my reunion with Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you plan to say to Grandmother Meng?\u201d I asked Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will convince granny. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if you guys start arguing? Are you really sure it\u2019s alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmother Meng will be the first person I must get rid of after becoming Lin Yixin. She could communicate with spirits and was against our relationship; undoubtedly, she was my biggest obstacle.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care whether granny can accept it or not. But we\u2019re going to be together. I\u2019m going to stick by your side for the rest of my life!\u201d Suyang hugged me from behind as he placed his chin on my head.</p><br/><p>When we were younger, we were around the same height. But now, I was a head and a half shorter than him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t convince Grandmother Meng, I\u2019ll beg her. From now on, I will try my very best to keep our relationship!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang turned me around and pinched my face, \u201cOh?! Someone smartened up after getting blown by the cold wind for a night? When did my goldfish become so cute?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Was he implying that I\u2019m cuter than the original Lin Yixin? I\u2019m so happy! </i></p><br/><p>Suyang\u2019s expression suddenly became serious as he pulled me to the couch. While I was sitting, he crouched down in front of me and tightly seized my hand. \u201cYixin, to be honest, when you left last night, I was so scared. I was afraid you would listen to granny and leave me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could I ever leave you?\u201d I touched Suyang\u2019s face. Seeing him like this pained my heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never knew I could feel so scared and hopeless. You\u2019re the one who came into my life and allowed me to experience love. Did you know that I\u2019ve noticed you long ago? We lived in the same building and often took the same elevator up. But you never once lifted your head up to look at me. I was very curious about you and wanted to get to know you better.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>If Lin Yixin heard this, she would be so touched. But sadly, she\u2019ll never hear it again</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYixin, although we haven\u2019t spent all that much time together, we\u2019ve already experienced a lot. I can solemnly swear that I love you. I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re willing to stay with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang\u2019s touching words caused my tears to run.</p><br/><p>My emotions were conflicted. Although I was prepared to abandon Anson to become Lin Yixin, I still found it hard to bear when Suyang said all those sweet things towards Lin Yixin.</p><br/><p><i>When was I ever so sensitive? It\u2019s all Suyang\u2019s fault!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d Suyang gently helped me wiped away my tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve heard you say something so touching. You\u2019re not allowed to say it anymore. It\u2019ll make me cry!\u201d I placed my right index finger against Suyang\u2019s lips and pulled his shirt collar with my left. Then, I whispered, \u201cCome here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang obediently listened to my command and I wrapped my arms around his neck to plant a kiss on his lips.</p><br/><p>At first, it was very light. Slowly, Suyang responded to my kiss and I wanted more and more.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Suyang released my hand and took a step back. His eyes appeared confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Suyang\u2019s expression made me worry.<i> I was too hasty</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Suyang stared at me with his eyes opened wide. I was getting more and more nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just\u2026.\u201d As I was thinking of an explanation, Suyang picked me up horizontally and headed straight for the bedroom, \u201cToday, you\u2019re purposely trying to seduce me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before I could react, Suyang had already thrown me onto the bed. Then, he leaned over, \u201cI\u2019ve been holding it in for a very long time. You\u2019re ready?\u201d</p><br/><p><em>So he wants to</em>\u2026..my face instantly turned red. Originally, I thought it was going to take a long time before we get to this point, but who would\u2019ve thought that I would make such a huge progress on my first day in this body.</p><br/><p>Currently, the face in front of me was the face of the person I\u2019ve dreamt of day and night. Of course my response would be yes. I wrapped my arms around Suyang\u2019s neck and smiled, \u201cYou\u2019ve thought it through? I\u2019m warning you. If we do it, you have to be responsible for me. I\u2019m going to rely on you forever!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak too soon!\u201d Suyang pressed me against the bed, \u201cWe don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to rely on who yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Suyang sealed my lips with a hot and passionate kiss. Gradually, I began to have a hard time breathing. My hands were on Suyang\u2019s shirt. I wanted to unbuttoned all his buttons while I still could.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Suyang suddenly yelled.</p><br/><p>I was caught by surprise. While we were deep in the moment, I actually bit Suyang\u2019s lips too aggressively. Now, he was bleeding. I quickly rushed to apologize, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026 are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Suyang got up and asked, \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang took a look at the clock on the wall and smacked his head, \u201cIt\u2019s already 8? I have plans with Shaoqian today. Aiya, I have to leave now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave?\u201d I stared at Suyang and thought I heard wrong. <i>Why would he leave at such a crucial moment? And it was to go see Shen Shaoqian? </i></p><br/><p>I had possessed Shen Shaoqian\u2019s body yesterday. Most likely, he was still in a deep slumber at home!</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry! We had made plans quite some time ago. Be good and wait for me at home, ok? We\u2019ll continue when I get back\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the most ridiculous request I had ever heard. But since it was Suyang, my body naturally nodded for me although I wanted to protest.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know my goldfish is the best!\u201d Suyang rubbed my head like I was a pet. Then, he put on his jacket and rushed out the door.</p><br/><p>I was annoyed, but what could I do.</p><br/><p>At the same time, I was suspicious. <em>Why did he suddenly leave? Could he have discovered something? No way! I played my role so well. How could he tell?</em></p><br/><p>I must stop scaring myself!</p><br/><p>Speaking of which, Lin Yixin\u2019s body surprisingly works very well for me. Within a few hours, I could completely control it.</p><br/><p>I took a look around Suyang\u2019s room and couldn\u2019t help but chuckle. He was still the same guy from the past; an anime, comics and game lover!</p><br/><p>I brushed my fingers against all of his treasures. I used all my senses to feel them. When we were little, our favourite past time was to go read mangas at a bookstore. Back then, we would always stay too long and get kicked out by the owner.</p><br/><p>While I was reminiscing these wonderful memories, my cell phone began to ring. This cell phone was purposely arranged for Yuxiang. She was the only one who could call me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you guys departed?\u201d I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnson\u2026 I\u2026.\u201d Huaze Yuxiang\u2019s voice sounded somewhat hesitant. I had a very bad feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXialing escaped with Lin Yixin! What should we do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEscape?!\u201d If I wasn\u2019t a woman right now, I would\u2019ve crushed the phone in my hand. \u201cI clearly told you to keep a close eye on Xialing! It was only for a few hours and yet you couldn\u2019t even do that?\u201d I screeched.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026. I was careless. I didn\u2019t think Xialing would honestly betray us.\u201d</p><br/><p>I gritted my teeth, \u201cI don\u2019t care what method you use, but find them both! If you can\u2019t find them both, then don\u2019t ever appear in front of me again! Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Huaze Yuxiang responded frightfully and hung up.</p><br/><p><i>Lin Yixin was a lucky woman. She only had a few hours left, yet someone helped her escape? </i></p><br/><p><i>No, this was not the time to think about that. Instead, I must figure out where they would go now. </i></p><br/><p><em>The thing that Lin Yixin would want the most right now is to get her body back. Although Xialing has supernatural abilities, she is not powerful enough. She wouldn\u2019t be able to help her.</em><i>Based on the people she knows, the only one who could help her is\u2026</i></p><br/><p><i>Grandmother Meng!</i></p><br/><p>I icily laughed as I stretched my muscles and bones on the bed.</p><br/><p><i>Looks like my plan to get rid of Grandmother Meng will have to take place in advance.</i></p><br/>\n</div>"}

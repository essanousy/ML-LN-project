Lu Wenxue suddenly appeared in front of me. I was shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew he was coming, so I removed the ghost blocker seal.\u201d Grandmother Meng was resting as she suddenly opened her eyes, \u201cHe\u2019s here?\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, let\u2019s get started?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, I must seek his consent first.\u201d</p><br/><p>I went over to Lu Wenxue and explicitly told him what we were about to do, \u201cMr. Lu Wenxue, I know I am just a stranger to you. Perhaps you don\u2019t trust me, but I\u2019m sorry to tell you that I\u2019m the only person who could help you. I remember the first time I had seen you was the day that Zhengyang attempted to pour sulfuric acid on Mi Fan. That day, your heart must have ached, right? Since the case from a year ago, Zhengyang has never lived a day at ease. Each day, all he thinks about is revenge. I could understand how he feels. After all, his beloved father died because he was framed. I could understand all the extreme things he has been doing. But at this rate, one day, he will be a target. These people have very powerful backgrounds. We shouldn\u2019t put Zhengyang in this danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Wenxue solemnly listened to my words as he covered his face with his hands and began to gradually lower his head.</p><br/><p><i>Was he feeling guilty because of my words? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand! I am not trying to blame you. Because this doesn\u2019t have anything to do with you\u2026. Ah! No! It\u2019s not that it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with you\u2026. Except\u2026ai ya! I\u2019ll just explain the procedure we\u2019re about to do to you. What\u2019s going to happen is that I am going to allow your spirit to enter my body. Once our spirits are connected in the same body, I can get into your thoughts. Under these circumstances, as long as you are recalling your past, I will also be able to experience the same thing. But please take caution and not lie. Every single small detail could affect my judgment. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Wenxue nodded; indicating his consent.</p><br/><p>I turned around to lay down on the familiar seat. But suddenly, my memories of Xu Weishan jumped out and messed with my mind. I ended up landing on the ground with my bottom.</p><br/><p>Grandmother Meng was shocked. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d She was sharpening the knife in her hands.</p><br/><p>I rubbed my chaotic brain as I shook my head, \u201cNothing.. It\u2019s just that\u2026.nothing.\u201d Then I attentively stared at the knife that Grandmother Meng had in her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you using that to take my blood or murder me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I was a thousand times unwilling, I pushed away all those thoughts and laid down again, \u201cYou may begin now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if it was real or fake, but through Lu Wenxue, I was able to see the story from his perspective.</p><br/><p>Nowadays, people with undergraduate degrees could be found everywhere. So in terms of looking for employment, being a University graduate no longer has any advantages. However, in Lu Wenxue\u2019s era; approximately some time in the 1980s, being a University graduate undoubtedly brought honor to one\u2019s ancestors.</p><br/><p>Ever since he was little, Lu Wenxue had always been his parents\u2019 hollow of the palm. He was his entire family\u2019s hope. As expected, Lu Wenxue didn\u2019t let them down. He graduated in one of the top ten schools in the city. He brought glory to his hometown and married his childhood sweetheart.</p><br/><p>But one day, he made a decision that stunned everyone. He gave up a high salary job in a big city and took his child and wife to the countryside to teach.</p><br/><p>According to him, \u201cIn the past, he had completed a week of volunteer work at the mountain village. However, he realized they didn\u2019t even have a public school within the distance of many children. The boys would already be in the workforce in their early teens, while the girls would already be married. They were only children and hadn\u2019t experience life yet! At the time, he had encountered a girl who was only fifteen but already pregnant. Due to a miscarriage, she passed away. That child hadn\u2019t even experience anything yet\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is the life of others, what does it have to do with you? Just live your own life!\u201d Lu Wenxue\u2019s mother gritted her teeth as she lectured her son. At the same time, she was surprised her filial son would express such a strong desire when he had always been very submissive and obedient towards his family.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I want to go there to teach the children how to read and write. I want them to have better lives and greater opportunities. At least, give them some options and choices!\u201d</p><br/><p>*Pa* Lu Wenxue\u2019s father slapped his son across his face. As his father, he couldn\u2019t understand why his son would do such a thing and sabotage his own future.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, I\u2019m here to notify the two of you that I\u2019ve decided to move to the countryside.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was the last line Lu Wenxue said to his parents. In the second year, he used up all his personal savings and built a school at the place where he had done volunteer work in the past. He worked alongside with his wife. One of them was responsible for teaching, while the other one focused on management.</p><br/><p>Once, Lu Wenxue had asked his wife, \u201cDo you feel like our days are causing you a lot of suffering? After all, we have a child. This type of environment\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Lu Wenxue was determined to help other children who were in need, from time to time, he would have all sorts of concerns for his own family.</p><br/><p>There were countless of times where he had doubted himself and wondered whether he had made the correct choice or not. But each time, his wife would encourage and support him. She gave him the strength and desire to carry on.</p><br/><p>His wife shook her head, \u201cAs long as you\u2019re around, I\u2019m not suffering. Plus, our child has such a kind and giving father as a role model. I cannot ask for a better environment than this. Your actions are the best lessons. I want us to set a great example, so what is there to worry about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Wenxue was grateful to God for giving him such an amazing wife.</p><br/><p>As time passed, Lu Wenxue\u2019s school situation began to improve. Initially, it was only the two of them working. But gradually, they had grown into a staff of five and a hundred students.</p><br/><p>As for Lu Zhengyang, he also grew up and began to attend the school his father had built.</p><br/><p>The family of three lived simply and happily until Lu Wenxue\u2019s wife was diagnosed with cancer.</p><br/><p>At the time, Lu Zhengyang had just turned ten.</p><br/><p>Lu Wenxue\u2019s wife was dying as she weakly called Lu Zhengyang to her side. She gently wiped the tears off little Zhengyang\u2019s face as she said in a hoarse voice, \u201cZhengyang, mommy is going to be going to somewhere far away soon. In the future, it will only be Zhengyang and daddy. Zhengyang, you must take good care of your daddy, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMommy, where are you going? Can\u2019t you bring us along?\u201d Lu Zhengyang firmly tightened his grip on his mother\u2019s blanket.</p><br/><p>\u201cMommy is going to somewhere far that Zhengyang and daddy cannot go right now. But, mommy will be watching over you from where she is. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want mommy to leave! Mommy, don\u2019t go! Don\u2019t leave me and daddy\u2026.\u201d Lu Zhengyang began to violently sob by his mother\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Lu Zhengyang\u2019s mother was suffering tremendously. She coughed as she continued to talk, \u201c*cough cough*\u2026.Zhengyang, don\u2019t cry. If Zhengyang is crying, daddy will also cry. Zhengyang, promise mommy to stay by daddy\u2019s side and take good care of him, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>But at that moment, Lu Zhengyang was in no state to process any more words. All he did was bawled his eyes out.</p><br/><p>Three days later, Lu Zhengyang\u2019s mother left them forever. Practically, the entire town came to the funeral to offer condolences. Lu Zhengyang will never be able to forget the sad, sorrowful figure of his father from his childhood.</p><br/><p>Lu Zhengyang was a good child. He listened to his mother and naturally helped his father with a lot of tasks at home.</p><br/><p>From then on, the two of them relied upon each other for survival.</p><br/><p>After Lu Zhengyang had graduated the school at the age of fourteen, his father sent him far away to attend high school. Originally, Lu Zhengyang didn\u2019t want to leave his father\u2019s side, but the school they had only went up the Grade 8 level. He had no choice but to go elsewhere to continue his education. So, Lu Zhengyang took the bus and arrived at the city to attend high school.</p><br/><p>So now, Lu Wenxue was all alone.</p><br/><p>Actually, the most difficult thing about opening a school in the countryside was not the teaching component. It was convincing the parents to allow their children to go through education.</p><br/><p>Some parents refused due to the tuition fees. Or perhaps, they believe their children would be better off as farmers. There was no need to study.</p><br/><p>So, each day, Lu Wenxue would go from house to house to attempt and convince the parents to allow their children to attend school.</p><br/><p>But a lot of parents couldn\u2019t afford the tuition fees. At that moment, Lu Wenxue would always respond with, \u201cThe child\u2019s education is the priority. Don\u2019t worry about the tuition.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gradually, the school\u2019s expenses were no longer within the scope of Lu Wenxue\u2019s abilities.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

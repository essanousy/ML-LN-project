I left Yao Youfan\u2019s consciousness and returned back to the real world. For a long time, I remained standing where I was. I felt empty. I wasn\u2019t sure how I should tell Xu Chuqiao this news.</p><br/><p>Despite how much Xu Chuqiao hated and despised her, Yao Youfan never once mentioned her past to him. <i>She was trying to protect him. So how could I be the one to reveal this secret?</i></p><br/><p><i>But if I don\u2019t tell him, that means I\u2019ve failed my job. What should I do? </i></p><br/><p>I had no authority to choose. My job was to tell my clients what they wanted to know. I have to tell Xu Chuqiao the truth and not worry about the other stuff.</p><br/><p><i>Yes. I have to do my job! It has always been like that, right? </i></p><br/><p>I reminded myself and then quickly dashed out of the office.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you done?\u201d Suyang was crouching by the door. When he saw me, he stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid it go well? Your expression doesn\u2019t look very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Maybe it\u2019s because I only have a day left. Tomorrow, I won\u2019t be going into office. I need to finish writing everything and I\u2019m going to give him the report by the end of the day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about going into the office. I\u2019m still here. Until you submit your report, I\u2019m still the marketing manager. I\u2019ll be able to cover for you for tomorrow!\u201d Suyang gave me a reassuring pat on the back.</p><br/><p>*cough cough*. I didn\u2019t know whether I should smile or cry as I hugged him.</p><br/><p>The next day, I went to the house that Na Wei gave Yao Youfan while she was pregnant. I was able to locate it based on what I had seen through her memories. After doing some research, I found out that the house was still under Yao Youfan\u2019s name. However, the house had been vacant for a very long time. I used the method that Xialing taught me and easily opened the door.</p><br/><p>The moment I opened the door, the wind from outside blew all the dust in the room. I had to cover my mouth and nose.</p><br/><p>Although the whole house was dusty, all the furniture were at its original spot. They were all covered by an eerie white cloth. After giving birth to Xu Chuqiao, Yao Youfan probably never came back here again.</p><br/><p>Every step I took caused the dust to spin in the air. I took out a scarf from my bag to cover my mouth and nose. Then, I tiptoed towards the bedroom. My intuition told me that there was something there.</p><br/><p>I lightly pushed open the door. Dust was everywhere and everything appeared very hazy. After the dust calmed down, I walked inside the room and vaguely noticed someone sitting on the bed.</p><br/><p>It was a grey, bony old man.</p><br/><p>I froze in shock. I didn\u2019t know what to say. <i>Was it the person I\u2019ve been searching for all this time? Xu Sen\u2019s ghost?!? </i></p><br/><p>Xu Sen also seemed stunned by my arrival. He was more shocked when he realized I could see him.</p><br/><p>Now that I have mastered the spiritual techniques, I was able to communicate with ghosts. Although they couldn\u2019t speak, I could understand the message they transmitted through their energy waves.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you Mr. Xu Sen?\u201d I bravely walked over to face him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you? You can see me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m hired by your son Xu Chuqiao to investigate your will\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Sen\u2019s eyes turned even dimmer. Who would\u2019ve thought that the former person in control of the Xu clan corporation could look so defeated and pitiful?</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you\u2019ve found this place, you must already know the answer, right? Please don\u2019t tell Chuqiao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy job is to tell him what he wants to know.\u201d I coldly responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t want to know the truth. Wei, Youfan and I all tried our best to keep this secret. It\u2019s better that Chuqiao thinks Wei and I are his parents. He should live under this assumption. It\u2019s unnecessary for him to know the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you wanted, why didn\u2019t you leave him with any inheritance? If you had, he wouldn\u2019t be so suspicious now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Sen clenched his fists, \u201cThis is what we owe Youfan. We had promised to give our entire estate to her after our death. This wasn\u2019t only my decision. It was both me and Wei\u2019s decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour wife also wanted this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore Wei died, she left a letter for me. She wanted me to help her compensate Yaofan with everything we had.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut things have gotten to this point. Are you seriously going to watch your son hate his biological mother? If Xu Chuqiao\u2019s fury doesn\u2019t get extinguished, eventually another tragedy will occur. Why don\u2019t you just reveal the truth and let them reconcile?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLife isn\u2019t that simple.\u201d Xu Sen shook his head, \u201cChuqiao purely wants to know whether the will is real, right? Show him the item in the drawer and he\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>I followed Xu Sen\u2019s finger and opened the drawer. Inside, there was a box that was exquisitely designed. I opened the box and saw a folded piece of paper. I unfolded it; it was the letter that Wei had written to Xu Sen before she passed away.</p><br/><p><i>Oh Sen\u2026 I feel like I\u2019m still rather young, but the disease has already attacked my vitals. This must be God\u2019s punishment to me. God must be punishing me for being selfish. I harmed you and Youfan. As your wife, I want to make a final request. I\u2019ve always lived cautiously throughout my lifetime. I didn\u2019t compensate Youfan enough. So please help me compensate her as much as you can. I know Youfan is not a materialistic type of person. But aside from money, I don\u2019t know what else I could give her\u2026. I\u2019m going to leave this world before you. Please forgive me for being selfish until the very end. </i></p><br/><p><i>Love you, Wei.</i></p><br/><p>Through the letter, I could feel Wei\u2019s pain. She loved Xu Sen, Yao Youfan, and her son. But without intending to do so, she had harmed them all.</p><br/><p><i>With this letter, Xu Chuqiao wouldn\u2019t know everything but at least he would know the will was real. Perhaps he will understand why his dad gave Yao Youfan his entire estate? </i></p><br/><p><i>No! Currently, Xu Chuqiao is suspicious of my identity. If I give him this letter, he would probably think I teamed up with Yao Youfan to create fake evidence to fool him. </i></p><br/><p>While I was stressing, suddenly I heard the lock on the door turning.</p><br/><p><i>What\u2019s going on? Aside from me, someone else knows about this place?</i></p><br/><p>Before I could find a spot to hide, I could hear a strong voice echoing from the living room, \u201cI know you\u2019re here. Come out and let\u2019s have a chat.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>It was Yao Youfan? Why was she here?</i> I stared at Xu Sen. He looked stunned too. He probably had no idea either. But since I was already caught, I had no choice but to reveal myself.</p><br/><p>I gripped onto Wei\u2019s letter and stepped outside the bedroom. I calmly went to Yao Youfan and asked, \u201cHow did chairman know I was here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Youfan exclaimed, \u201cIt was you! Last night, I could already sense something odd about you. My intuition told me I had to come here to check this place to see if something was going on. I was correct\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>She was truly a business woman. I had underestimated Yao Youfan. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cChairman, your intuition is very good\u2026Suyang was the one who told you right? He told you I was here and my reason for working at the company.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be so direct, I\u2019ll be straight up as well. Don\u2019t assume you can meddle in our family affairs. If you touch my bottom line, you\u2019ll be in danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your bottom line?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch Xu Chuqiao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t touch him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe secret between the three of us will remain a secret.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChairman, I urge you to be honest with your son. At this rate, nothing good can come out of this. It\u2019s pointless of you to be so stubborn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want me to tell him he\u2019s my son? How can I say that to him? How would you react if you found out the mother you\u2019ve loved for thirty plus years was actually not your mother? In fact, your mother was actually the woman you loathed?? The only thing I can do is to tacitly admit that Xu Chuqiao is Na We\u2019s son; Xu family\u2019s legitimate son. As for me, I\u2019m only a shameless third party. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Yao Youfan\u2019s eyes landed on the paper in my hand, \u201cWhat do you have in your hand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis?\u201d I raised the letter, \u201cThis is Na Wei\u2019s letter. It is evidence that proves Xu Sen\u2019s will is real. I am quite sure you have seen it before. Earlier, I was debating whether I should give it to Xu Chuqiao. If I give it to him, he probably won\u2019t be against you anymore. By doing so, I\u2019m helping you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said, by giving this letter to Xu Chuqiao, I\u2019m helping you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Youfan didn\u2019t seem to have much of a reaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot only will I give him the letter, I\u2019ll also tell him the truth.\u201d I raised my voice as I gazed at Yao Youfan with no fear in my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d She was so mad that she couldn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p><i>That\u2019s right! This was the reaction I wanted. </i></p><br/><p>I put the letter inside my pocket and lifted my chin arrogantly, \u201cSuyang was on your side from the very beginning. He knew that Xu Chuqiao had sent me to investigate you, so you used Suyang to control me. What did he tell you? Did he tell you to follow his method and you\u2019ll get the result you wanted?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>I didn\u2019t expect to be used by the the person who meant the most to me.</i></p><br/><p><i>All those sweet words, smile, and warmth\u2026. It was conclusive proof that I was an idiot. Three years later, that person still had my heart. If he was in front of me now, I would rip it out in front of him. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Yao Youfan\u2019s eyes flickered. She was evidently feeling a bit uneasy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

On one casual day, she was walking around and happened to witnessed Wen Yihan getting chased by gangsters.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say anything!\u201d Wen Yihan yelled as he rushed by Gao Jialan and hid inside a metal bin. Since he was in such a rush, most likely he didn\u2019t recognize her. All he did was give her a harsh warning.</p><br/><p>Within five seconds, the group of gangsters had rushed forth. They immediately noticed Gao Jialan and grimly questioned her, \u201cHave you seen a guy ran by here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Gao Jialan responded.</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan\u2019s response caused a lot of anxiety in Wen Yihan. <i>This woman</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDear, that fellow is a bad guy. Could you tell me where he ran off to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2026.\u201d Gao Jialan randomly pointed towards a direction and responded earnestly, \u201cHe ran that way. He even ran through a red light!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d The gangsters followed the direction that Gao Jialan had pointed towards and continued their search.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve already crossed the streets. You better run now while you can.\u201d Gao Jialan solemnly told Wen Yihan.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m stuck. Help me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Since there were no one else around, Gao Jialan had no choice but to help Wen Yihan. She opened the lid and Wen Yihan realized that the woman was actually Gao Jialan.</p><br/><p>He was shocked, \u201cIt\u2019s you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan grabbed his hand and violently pulled Wen Yihan out. The metal bin fell over along with them.</p><br/><p>The loud commotion alerted the gangsters. One of them hollered, \u201cThey\u2019re over there!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMother f**ker!\u201d Wen Yihan swore under his breath. Then, he dragged Gao Jialan with him and broke into a run.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you bringing me along? I didn\u2019t offend them!?\u201d Gao Jialan was confused as she desperately ran.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you honestly think they will let you go for helping me? Get in, now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wen Yihan found another hiding spot as he urged Gao Jialan to squeezed into it.</p><br/><p>It was the corner of a very dim area. There was a damp and moldy smell in the air. The two of them hid behind the abandoned cabinet as they tried their best to suppress their rushed breathing and pricked up their ears to detect any outside movements.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get so close\u2026.\u201d Gao Jialan felt like her personal space was being invaded. But Wen Yihan immediately covered her mouth with his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cShh!\u201d His anxious expression warned her not to make any noise during this crucial moment.</p><br/><p>So, the two of them tried to avoid as much physical contact as possible while being stuffed in this hot, tight space. They were close enough to hear each other\u2019s heartbeats and breathing. Wen Yihan watched as Gao Jialan\u2019s sweat slowly rolled down her white neck.</p><br/><p>He had no idea that he was actually sweating more than her.</p><br/><p>There was a sweet fruit scent oozing out of Gao Jialan\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre they gone yet?\u201d Gao Jialan quietly whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a bit longer\u2026.\u201d Actually, Wen Yihan couldn\u2019t hear the gangsters anymore. However, he didn\u2019t tell Gao Jialan the truth. Instead, he appeared frightened and from time to time, he would deliberately inch closer towards Gao Jialan.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Gao Jialan felt very conflicted. \u201cThis is a very tight space. Could you stop squirming around?\u201d She snapped.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want comfort or your life?\u201d He retorted.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Gao Jialan didn\u2019t utter another sound. Now, she was angrily sulking in the cabinet. <i>Why did she end up like this? </i></p><br/><p>Wen Yihan thought her expression was very cute. So, he couldn\u2019t help but touch her pouty lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan was astonished and slightly scared by Wen Yihan\u2019s gesture. In her opinion, Wen Yihan was a troublemaker\u2026\u2026 she wasn\u2019t very fond of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so cute!\u201d Wen Yihan smiled. For the next thirty minutes, he gazed at her as if she was something precious. He barely moved at all.</p><br/><p>After thirty minutes had gone by, the two of them lacked too much oxygen to remain inside the stuffy cabinet. Their backs were killing them and they ran out of their hiding spot.</p><br/><p>They took huge gulps of the fresh air. At that moment, Gao Jialan thought that being able to breathe freely was one of life\u2019s greatest blessings.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Wen Yihan laid on the ground in the shape of a . He asked Gao Jialan as he gave her a smile yet not a smile (tl: I know this sounds really awkward. But it\u2019s a common saying in Chinese).</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Gao Jialan\u2019s voice was filled with resentment. \u201cWhy are you being chased by such dangerous people? If they caught us, what would they have done?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wen Yihan thought about it. Then, he lightly said, \u201cThey would kill me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKill you?!\u201d <i>So, basically, she walked on a tightrope around death? </i></p><br/><p>Gao Jialan was in a rather confused and panicky state. <i>Wen Yihan was still smiling. What the heck\u2026 </i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat bad deeds have you done?\u201d She hesitantly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNone.\u201d Wen Yihan shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why are they after you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of my father.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour father?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, if you must ask me what wrong I\u2019ve done, it would be the fact that I was born, I guess? That was a mistake to begin with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan remained silent. So, Wen Yihan continued, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand even if I told you. But thanks for helping me today. If you didn\u2019t lie for me, I would be dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince I helped you, could you promise me one thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Wen Yihan promised without thinking. Previously, he went through the class list and found out her name was Gao Jialan. This girl was quite interesting.</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan stared at Wen Yihan and gravely stated, \u201cFrom now on, can you pretend you don\u2019t know me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The smile gradually vanished from Wen Yihan\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cRegardless if we encounter each other at school or on the streets\u2026 just pretend you don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like you\u2019re a very dangerous person. I don\u2019t want to be part of your troubles. So, can you promise me?\u201d Gao Jialan was very serious. Wen Yihan felt his heart slowly turning cool again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d <i>If he answered like he cared, wouldn\u2019t he seem very pathetic?</i></p><br/><p>Wen Yihan stood up and patted the dust off his butt. He confidently uttered his final word, \u201cGoodbye.\u201d</p><br/><p>While watching Wen Yihan\u2019s departing figure, Gao Jialan knew her request was quite harsh. But she must not have anything to do with him if she wanted to live a peaceful life. She didn\u2019t expect him to understand. It would be best if he hated her instead. That way, they could live their separate lives and she would be fine with it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

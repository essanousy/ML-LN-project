Do you have to lose everything before you\u2019re willing to quit? Do you have a conscience?\u201d Xiaobei\u2019s foster mother shrieked at the husband of hers. He gambled on a daily basis.</p><br/><p>Each time, Xiaobei\u2019s foster father would only sigh and accept the lecture. Afterwards, he would quietly sneak out. He wouldn\u2019t dare to return until his wife had calmed down.</p><br/><p>But this time, his expression was a bit unusual.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, calm down, mom. Don\u2019t be so angry.\u201d Hong Xiaobei hugged her foster mother as she rubbed against her embrace and coyly comforted her, \u201cI am already in University. This is my first year, and my workload isn\u2019t too tight at the moment. I\u2019ve already found a part time job. After I get my wage, I\u2019ll be able to take on some of the financial load for the family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPassing this top ranked University entrance exam was no easy task. I want you to focus on your studies. Don\u2019t work a part time job. I don\u2019t want you to worry about adult responsibilities.\u201d Xiaobei\u2019s foster mother sighed. Her husband was useless, and that\u2019s why she was suffering. But she didn\u2019t want her child to suffer as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, mom\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Hong Xiaobei had more she wanted to say, but her mother cut her off, \u201cListen to me. As long as you study well and become successful in the future, mom will be satisfied.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiaobei\u2019s foster mother looked outside and then turned to the clock that was hanging on the wall, \u201cIt\u2019s almost dark. Go and find your father and tell him to come home!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAi! Okay!\u201d Hong Xiaobei smiled as she ran outside. Everyday, her mother would be worried about her father going out alone. She would always tell her to bring him home before sunset.</p><br/><p>She knew that her mother had a sharp tongue but a soft heart.</p><br/><p>But goodbye always have a tendency to arrive without a sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad? Dad?\u201d Today was different from all the other days. Regardless of where Hong Xiaobei looked, she couldn\u2019t find her father. There was only a little bit of sunlight left. The sky was turning dimmer and dimmer. Hong Xiaobei was beginning to have a dire premonition. She was imagining the worse case scenario. Perhaps the creditors had captured her father and then\u2026.</p><br/><p>As she was thinking, there were a bunch of people surrounding the river bank in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026.it can\u2019t be\u2026.it\u2019s not! It can\u2019t be\u2026.\u201d Hong Xiaobei mumbled. She warned herself not to overthink. However, she carried her half curious and half unstable heart over as she squeezed through the crowd and tore through all the whispering.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to that guy? How come he fell into the river?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean fell in? I saw him jump in on his own! Ai, poor man. He was probably going through a hard time so he decided to commit suicide.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hong Xiaobei finally broke through the crowd. The first thing she noticed was the person lying on the ground.</p><br/><p>The man who committed suicide was her father.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad! Dad!\u201d Hong Xiaobei screamed and sobbed at the same time. She fell down onto her knees and tears instantly streamed down her face. She didn\u2019t even realized her knees were gashed by the soil. She wailed as she begged. She begged her father to open his eyes to look at her, \u201cDad, wake up! Dad! It\u2019s me, Xiaobei! Please open your eyes and take a look at me!! Dad! Dad!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sadly, Xiaobei\u2019s foster father could no longer hear her screams. While the ambulance was on its way to the hospital, all of his organs had stopped working. He was declared dead.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Xiaobei\u2019s foster mother was at home preparing dinner for them to return. She finally picked up the phone after a long delay. Initially, she thought it was the creditors calling to demand payment. So the moment she picked up, she yelled, \u201cWhy do you guys keep pressuring us? You want to pressure us to death!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom\u2026.\u201d it was Xiaobei\u2019s tearful voice. She was so emotional that her voice was barely audible. \u201cMom, come to the h-hospital\u2026h-hurry\u2026! D-dad\u2026he\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>*Bang*</p><br/><p>By the time they met again, it was farewell.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy child\u2019s dad, how can you leave us like this? Now, your child is fatherless and I\u2019m a widow. How can you be so cruel\u2026?\u201d Xiaobei\u2019s foster mother wept next to the body. Her hopeless coarse cry could be heard from the entire building. Hong Xiaobei will never forget that moment for the rest of her life.</p><br/><p>They were already a low income family with a lot of debt. Now that her father had killed himself, it was a significant blow to them.</p><br/><p>Most importantly, she and her mother loved her father dearly. Yet, he had chosen to abandon them like this\u2026</p><br/><p>In the gloom alleyway, Hong Xiaobei felt like she was the most pitiful woman in this world as she withdrew herself into a corner and quietly wept.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a family. Even though we have debt, we\u2019re supposed to face it together. Dad, now that you\u2019ve abandoned me and mom, I\u2019ll never forgive you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hong Xiaobei wouldn\u2019t dare to say those words in front of her mother. She only said this while she was alone crying in the corner.</p><br/><p>After her father\u2019s death, Hong Xiaobei and her mother took on all the debt responsibility.</p><br/><p>They were forced to live more conscientiously.</p><br/><p>Hong Xiaobei worked at a fast food shop behind her mother\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?! Little Princess! Long time no see. I didn\u2019t expect to see you at this type of place!\u201d</p><br/><p>That day, while Hong Xiaobei was working her butt off, a handsome guy was sizing her up and down as he chatted with her, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXu Weishan, didn\u2019t you go to England after getting that full scholarship? I thought you were living the good life. When did you return back to the country?\u201d The guy placed his arm on the table as he asked out of astonishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, customer. You\u2019ve got the wrong person. My name is not Xu Weishan.\u201d Hong Xiaobei pointed to her name tag. \u201cMy name is Hong Xiaobei.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to act in front of me! Ha! I have information that can be used against you now!\u201d The guy took out his cell phone and began taking lots of pictures of her, \u201cHa! I\u2019m going to tell your parents you\u2019ve secretly returned from England. What are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hong Xiaobei thought she had encountered a pervert, so she kicked the guy out of the fast food restaurant out of anger.</p><br/><p>She held onto the mop and had her arms on her waist as she stood by the doorway. Hong Xiaobei looked at the guy\u2019s basketball uniform. It had his name embroidered on it. She heatedly stated, \u201cKevin, right? I\u2019m going to tell you again. You have the wrong person. I\u2019m not the person who knows you. Please leave immediately or I will call the cops now and say you\u2019re harassing me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo ahead! Call the police! When your parents come, let\u2019s see who gets in trouble!\u201d Kevin refuted. He believed Xiaobei was his childhood enemy, Xu Weishan. He could still recall how she used to bully him. This time, he could finally get revenge.</p><br/><p>Hong Xiaobei rolled her eyes. She didn\u2019t think there would be a day where she had to prove her own identity. She took out her identity card from her bag and flashed it in front of Kevin, \u201cThis is my ID. Name: Hong Xiaobei.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Kevin was speechless, Hong Xiaobei had put her ID away and returned back to work in the fast food restaurant.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I meet a ghost in the middle of the day?\u201d Kevin shook his head as he stared at Hong Xiaobei\u2019s rear view. He didn\u2019t believe his eyes. <i>Was it because he hadn\u2019t seen Xu Weishan in a very long time? He got her confused with someone else? </i></p><br/><p><i>That\u2019s awkward\u2026.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cCustomer, your delivery is here.\u201d Because of the debt, Hong Xiaobei worked from morning until night.</p><br/><p>Today, her job was to deliver food. So, Hong Xiaobei dialed from downstairs and spoke into the speakers while she waited for the customer to unlock the door.</p><br/><p>This was a luxurious apartment building. Hong Xiaobei couldn\u2019t help but accelerate her steps as she sighed and walked in. <i>This was where wealthy people lived, eh?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cCustomer, this is your order. Chicken for two, a bottle of coke, pizza\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Chuckle*. Hong Xiaobei was busy confirming her order, so she never looked up. But she lifted her head after hearing the sudden burst of laughter.</p><br/><p>It was the pervert from the last time! He was covering his mouth and trying to suppress his laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it you?\u201d Hong Xiaobei instantly had her guard up. Seeing him put her in a bad mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnter to talk.\u201d Kevin shifted his body over, indicating for her to go in.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. Just give me the money and I\u2019m going. I still have other deliveries.\u201d Hong Xiaobei coldly rejected.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the money is inside. If you don\u2019t come in, you can\u2019t get it\u2026.\u201d Then, Kevin took the delivery from Hong Xiaobei\u2019s hand. He pretended to close the door.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

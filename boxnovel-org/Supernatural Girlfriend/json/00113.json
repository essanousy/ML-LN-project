What did you guys talk about?\u201d Then, Suyang pinched my face. He wouldn\u2019t let me avoid his eyes, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare try to hide more things from me.\u201d</p><br/><p>I put my hands over Suyang and anxiously responded, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything. But can we chat upstairs?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, I shakily raised my hand and pointed randomly into space. I made my voice tremble, \u201cThere\u2019s\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Before I could finish, Suyang dashed back into the apartment like an arrow. By the time I reacted, he was already standing in front of the elevator waving at me, \u201cWhy are you still standing there?\u201d</p><br/><p>I stared at the nothingness around me. <i>Suyang was so easy to fool. He was such a chicken, yet he had a girlfriend who could see ghosts</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>Speaking of which, due to Gao Jialan, we never continued our chat about my abilities to see ghost.</p><br/><p>When we returned back to the apartment, I repeated everything Wen Yihan told me to Suyang. He was half shocked and half worried. After pondering for a long time, he wasn\u2019t sure what to do either.</p><br/><p>In no time, six days had gone by. These days, Suyang and I were constantly trying to find an opportunity to confirm with Gao Jialan. But, we kept losing it.</p><br/><p>Today was the final day before the deadline. Suyang and I came up with a plan last night. Today, he will randomly find a reason to leave the apartment so Gao Jialan and I could be home by ourselves to chat.</p><br/><p>So, early in the morning, Suyang used \u201cfishing\u201d as the reason why he had to leave. Before he left, I rolled my eyes at him. <i>He could\u2019ve just left silently. Wouldn\u2019t Gao Jialan be more suspicious when he used an excuse like that?</i></p><br/><p>Most likely, Gao Jialan had already sensed something. For the past few days, the moment I walked closer towards her, she would automatically go elsewhere. It was like she was purposely avoiding me.</p><br/><p>\u201cGao Jialan, I saw online that women who are around three months pregnant have a tendency to go through a lot of symptoms and effects. Are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Currently, I was massaging her shoulders and testing her at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. This is Yufan\u2019s child. I\u2019m fine no matter how difficult it is.\u201d She murmured.</p><br/><p>Since I was massaging her, Gao Jialan couldn\u2019t walk away even if she wanted to.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you lose your life?\u201d I blurted.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Gao Jialan\u2019s shoulder stiffened and she placed her hand over mines; indicating I could stop. Then, she turned to look at me. She was ready to talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe told you?\u201d Gao Jialan calmly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Wen Yihan told me everything. He gave me a week to think about it. How else did you think you and Suyang could have escaped so easily?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that foolish. Of course I knew there was a reason why we managed to escape so smoothly\u2026 I just didn\u2019t want to think about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I gazed into Gao Jialan\u2019s eyes, \u201cThese past few days, I\u2019ve thought deeply about it. I honestly think you should give up the child. You\u2019re still so young and have so much ahead of you\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you would say this to me\u2026 as a woman, how could you not understand my emotions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand that mothers would give up everything for their children. So, I\u2019m not forcing you. I\u2019m just hoping I could convince you to let the child go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan shook her head as she stared out the window and into a far distance. \u201cYou\u2019re still young. When you have your own child, you\u2019ll understand that mothers would never willingly abandon their children.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know I can see ghosts. Do you know why I saw Wen Yihan on Mid Autumn Festival?\u201d I briefly glanced at Wen Yufan; who was standing far away. \u201cWen Yufan was the one who led me to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan was acting like she couldn\u2019t hear me. She touched her tummy and continued, \u201cThis child is growing slowly in my body. Each day, I can sense a change\u2026regardless how small it may be\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWen Yufan is a ghost. He could\u2019ve easily led me to you. But he didn\u2019t do that. He deliberately wanted to bring me to see Wen Yihan. Why do you think he did that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy child and I are together as one. The moment I found out I was pregnant, I had the drive to carry on. Every night, I would envision his face. I would imagine him reaching his hand out to me and calling me \u201cmommy\u201d. I could see him attending elementary school\u2026. As for Yufan, I\u2019m not going to make any presumptuous guesses. I found out I was pregnant after he died\u2026so he never heard it from me. But I\u2019m glad he knows\u2026.at least I don\u2019t have to regret about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo regret? He knows you\u2019re willing to risk your life for the baby\u2026 and I swear to you that his expression isn\u2019t the joyful one you would imagine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan avoided my eyes as she stood up and said wearily, \u201cNo need to say anymore. Regardless of what you say, I refuse to give up this child.\u201d</p><br/><p>I sighed, \u201cYou already knew what I wanted to say prior to this\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan had her back against me and didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are already well aware that if Wen Yufan knew about the child, he would\u2019ve made the same choice as Wen Yihan. Yet, even so, you\u2019re still persistent on keeping him\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYixin, this child is the only connection between me and Yufan. I cannot live without him.\u201d Gao Jialan had her fists clenched as she snarled at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if I refuse to help you?\u201d I used my last card. \u201cToday is the last day of the deadline Wen Yihan gave me. Most likely, he is going to call any time now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will use my own method to save this child.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan was so stubborn that it pained my heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cWen Yufan, if only you could speak. Perhaps, you could convince her\u2026.\u201d I stared at Wen Yufan, \u201cWhat is the point of appearing when you can\u2019t do anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan followed my eyes and stared into space, \u201cYufan is here?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s over there.\u201d I pointed at Wen Yufan, \u201cHis expression looks awful. He\u2019s watching you right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu\u2026.Yufan.\u201d Gao Jialan gradually walked towards where I pointed and happened to stand right in front of Wen Yufan. \u201cPlease don\u2019t blame me. You\u2019re the one who understands me the most in this world. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll make sure to give birth to a healthy baby. I\u2019ll be healthy too. Then, I\u2019ll raise the child.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sunlight from the window made Wen Yufan appear more transparent than ever. It was like a sad beautiful love story between a human and a ghost.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t look like he understands you. His eyebrows are so knitted that it could practically squish a housefly to death.\u201d I icily tried to throw a huge blow at Gao Jialan.</p><br/><p><i>Since the soft method wasn\u2019t working, I decided to try the aggressive way. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cHis parents already went to reincarnate. Yet, Wen Yufan is still here. I\u2019m pretty sure I don\u2019t need to tell you the reason why. Do you honestly want him to remain a troubled lonely ghost that cannot let go of the past?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI respect his decision. He can leave or stay. I will accept it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan suddenly thought of something as she rushed to the bedroom. She opened the luggage and began packing everything she had.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d My mind was fuzzy.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say today is the final deadline? If you have no intentions of helping me, I must escape before Wen Yihan gets here.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Escape?</i> I snatched Gao Jialan\u2019s clothes. Each time she put down an item, I would take it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to help me, at least don\u2019t hinder me.\u201d Gao Jialan shoved me aside and continued to pack.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so stubborn?\u201d I was really irritated.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was born with this temper. Sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Gao Jialan say this, I actually somewhat calmed down. I sat on the bed and observed her pack anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re born with this temper. You\u2019re stubborn and selfish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan ignored me and continued packing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were like this in the past\u2026 you were like this in the orphanage\u2026in order to get all the other children to adore you, you abandoned me. You wanted to live a stable and safe life, so you abandoned Wen Yihan. Since you\u2019re so smart, you must have figured out we would be the ones to help you if you reached out. On the other hand, you\u2019ve always been the one to turn a blind eye towards those who need or want you. You always act unconcerned to let the matters rest. Now, you\u2019ve reached the ultimate version of selfishness. You\u2019re about to risk your life too. Is this retribution?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps\u2026 by the way, I\u2019m sorry for what happened in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late to apologize. I\u2019m fine now. Now you know why I disliked you so much at the beginning, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>As I continued, I ended up venting all the negative emotions I had suppressed all these years, \u201cYou always abandon those you could\u2019ve saved!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAside from apologizing, I don\u2019t know what else to say\u2026.\u201d Gao Jialan sighed. \u201cI won\u2019t trouble you any longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan was about to leave, but I blocked her. \u201cWhere are you going? Where can you go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can go\u2026.\u201d Gao Jialan looked lost for a second. But she quickly readjusted herself and squeezed out a smile, \u201cThere will always be a place somewhere for me and my child.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt utterly defeated by her; even my last attempt was no use.</p><br/><p><i>Then again, Wen Yihan and We Yufan couldn\u2019t change Gao Jialan either. So what made me believe I could\u2019ve convinced her?</i></p><br/>\n</div>"}

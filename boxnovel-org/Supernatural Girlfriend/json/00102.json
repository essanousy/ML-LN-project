Why was I feeling a sense of dread? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cAre we going very far?\u201d Deep down, I was feeling restless because I was worried Suyang would bury me or something. <i>Plus, these places naturally have more graves and ghosts\u2026.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Today, we\u2019re going to go on an adventure.\u201d Suyang calmly reply. His face revealed nothing.</p><br/><p>My heart was pounding. I gulped down my saliva and stretched out my neck. I nervously asked, \u201cAdventure? What adventure?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang had an unknown smile on his face as he unhurriedly stated, \u201cHave you heard of the case from 12 years ago? A man with mental disorders broke into a private hospital in the middle of the night and set the place on fire. As a result, 13 people died and 21 people were injured. Due to the incident, the hospital closed down. Now, it\u2019s just an abandoned building in the suburbs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom a f-fire\u2026.?\u201d My fists were tightly clenched. Based on my experiences, the ghosts who have died in fires definitely had the scariest appearances.</p><br/><p>Their bodies were black and burnt. Their clothes were ripped and torn. Not only that, their faces were covered in scars\u2026.simply imagining them gave me goosebumps.</p><br/><p>Suyang was testing me.</p><br/><p>I readjusted my mood. I must not demonstrate any weaknesses now. \u201cWhy are we going to that kind of place all of a sudden? Based on what I could recall, you\u2019re very afraid of ghosts. Aren\u2019t you worried we will encounter ghosts later on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, we\u2019re going to experience it to see if ghosts really exist. It has been too long since I\u2019ve gotten any inspiration. It is time for me to find a new trigger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have to be so extreme? It\u2019s an abandoned building. It already sounds scary enough. Plus, everything inside is probably burnt or destroyed\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>I was freaking out on the inside. Based on my abilities, I should be staying away from places like that. I didn\u2019t want to be near ghosts that have died unjustly. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cAre you scared?\u201d Suyang stopped the car on the side. His eyes were cold as he stared at me. I felt like he was trying to interrogate me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am just afraid that you\u2019ll be scared. I remember whenever I said the word \u2018ghost\u2019, you would freak out. If we really encounter something, what are you going to do then?\u201d I turned my head away and didn\u2019t want to face Suyang\u2019s accusing face.</p><br/><p>Since I wouldn\u2019t admit to anything, Suyang started the car again. Five minutes later, we arrived at the legendary cage of grieving spirits. There was no escape now. We were at the specialized hospital of Ling Shan.</p><br/><p><i>So scary!</i></p><br/><p>Although it was daytime, the appearance of the hospital alone was already frightening enough.</p><br/><p><i>But then again, the incident happened 12 years ago. Even if there were ghosts, they should be gone by now, right? </i>I tried to comfort myself.</p><br/><p>Suyang stopped the car at the parking lot. I was tightly holding onto my seatbelt and wouldn\u2019t exit the car.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you for the final time. That day, outside of the television station, who were you talking to?\u201d Suyang\u2019s expression was grave.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho was I speaking to? Aside from you and me, there were no one else! I was just talking to myself.\u201d I was trying to act clueless and stupid until the very end.</p><br/><p><i>I didn\u2019t know why I was still lying at this point. Perhaps\u2026. I was really afraid that Suyang would leave me. I didn\u2019t have the confidence that he would remain by my side if he knew I could see the things that scared him the very most. I wasn\u2019t sure if he would continue treating me the same way. </i></p><br/><p><i>I loved him. But I was so insecure. To me, the feeling was still quite hazy</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>After he heard my response, Suyang seemed to be deep in thought. His hands were around the steering wheel as he deeply sighed.</p><br/><p>It was as if he had made up his mind internally. Then, he unbuckled both our seatbelts and stated, \u201cAlright, since these are your final words, let\u2019s get off the car.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re r-really getting off?\u201d I had no choice, so I reluctantly got off.</p><br/><p><i>Eh? Aside from us, there was also another car in the parking lot. </i></p><br/><p><i>In addition, the car looked rather familiar\u2026 </i></p><br/><p><i>Wherever I go, I always see this brilliant blue Lamborghini\u2026</i></p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang! Lin Yixin!\u201d While I was trying to think of where I had seen this car before, Shen Shaoqian waved and yelled from the hospital entrance.</p><br/><p><i>Why is he here? </i></p><br/><p>I was curious and accidentally noticed Suyang\u2019s shaky hands\u2026.<i>he was sweating! So, he was actually freaking out! Wow, I\u2019m speechless. Why did he have to go so far\u2026</i></p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting so long for you guys! Let\u2019s go!\u201d Shen Shaoqian didn\u2019t seem nervous at all. He had a camera in his hands as he dangled around. \u201cI\u2019m a bit nervous. How about you guys?\u201d</p><br/><p>I rolled my eyes at him. <i>How was he nervous? He seemed so excited. </i></p><br/><p>Whereas for me, I could already sense a bad atmosphere. <i>What if I really see a scary ghost? If that happens, I wouldn\u2019t be able to hide it anymore. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d Suyang tried to act like he was indifferent, but the sweat running down his forehead and his shaky hands betrayed him.</p><br/><p><i>Keep acting! If worse comes to worse, we will both die from fright. We\u2019ll see how long you can keep this act up! </i></p><br/><p>Shen Shaoqian relentlessly beat me to making fun of Suyang. He pointed at him and laughed, \u201cLook at you! Your lips are turning pale. And you say you aren\u2019t scared? Ever since you were young, you had always been a chicken. Especially when it came to ghost stuff\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>I secretly peeked at Suyang. He was so anxious that he didn\u2019t even bother to argue with Shen Shaoqian.</p><br/><p><i>Neither of us wanted to lose, but in reality, neither of us had an advantage either. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cAre you two planning to back out last minute?\u201d Based on our reactions, Shen Shaoqian were forcefully pushing us forward. \u201cYou guys wanted to come, so no backing out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like that, we were standing at the hospital entrance.</p><br/><p><i>So scary! T</i>he light from outside did not shine into the hospital at all. It was as if the door separated the world of the living and the world of the dead.</p><br/><p>Shen Shaoqian was becoming more and more enthusiastic now. He was leading us, \u201cAlright. We will enter now. From now on, this camera will be recording down everything in this abandoned hospital. We will become history.\u201d</p><br/><p>I harshly smacked him, \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018become history\u2019? Can\u2019t you choose a better term?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Shaoqian innocently looked at me, \u201cI didn\u2019t choose the wrong term\u2026 haven\u2019t you heard? In the past, those who have tried recording here all ended up losing their minds\u2026. Afterwards, people were curious to know what they had seen. But when they looked through their recordings, there was nothing else except for pitch blackness\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d I gulped down my saliva. My heart was beating a few times faster than its usual rate.</p><br/><p>I began taking steps that were more tiny than the ladies from the ancient era. I grabbed onto Suyang\u2019s hand, but his hand was sweating like mad. Seeing this, I secretly wanted to chuckle.</p><br/><p>We were finally inside. We looked around but there was only pitch blackness. My heart was turning black along with it.</p><br/><p>On the contrary, Shen Shaoqian wasn\u2019t scared at all. The moment he entered, he headed straight towards the second floor. Suyang and I didn\u2019t follow, and he disappeared within our sights.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you gotten your inspiration yet? If so, let\u2019s leave!\u201d I quietly whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not leaving unless you tell me who you were talking to that day!\u201d Suyang stubbornly stated with determination. He wanted me to tell the truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI already told you, I was talking to myself! If you won\u2019t believe me, that\u2019s not my fault!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>This was not the time to tell the truth. Honestly, if I could, I would probably hide it from Suyang forever. </i></p><br/><p>As I have mentioned previously, based on his fear of ghosts, I had no confidence that he would like my supernatural abilities. This gamble wasn\u2019t one I dared to risk.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t follow Shaoqian, we are really going to lose him.\u201d Suyang released my hand and quickly walked upstairs.</p><br/><p><i>If Suyang the chicken was brave enough to do this, I must not lose to him!</i></p><br/><p>Thinking of this, I held onto the railing and slowly walked up the stairs.</p><br/><p>On my way, I tried to reassure myself. <i>You\u2019ll be fine! It\u2019ll be okay! Remember what ghosts are made of? They\u2019re just nothingness. Even though you can see them, they can\u2019t do anything to you! Just calm down\u2026. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine\u2026. </i></p><br/><p>There was no purpose for me to be here. I was just wandering around. Currently, my priority was to locate Shen Shaoqian and Suyang.</p><br/><p><i>To be honest, I was quite envious of them. Even if there were ghosts, neither of them could see them! </i></p><br/><p>While I was lost in thought, Suyang was also gone from my field of vision.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang.. Shen Shaoqian\u2026\u201d I lightly called amongst the ruins.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

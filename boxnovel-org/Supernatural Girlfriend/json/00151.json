Allow me to make it clearer. You told Suyang Xu Chuqiao had sent someone to investigate you. So, you wanted him to keep an eye out on me. But you had no idea that the person would be someone who he had dated before. Suyang told you he knows me. As long as you \u201caccidentally\u201d told me about your past and begged me after, I\u2019ll soften and decide to keep the secret hidden forever. You\u2019ll be able to get what you want and also use me to help you get rid of the misunderstanding between you and Xu Chuqiao. Na Wei\u2019s letter would be the key for helping you mend your relationship with your son, am I correct?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>It has been three years. Suyang wasn\u2019t the only one who could speculate. He can\u2019t manipulate me like he used to. </i></p><br/><p>Hearing my words, Yao Youfan sighed and touched her heart. She regretfully stated, \u201cYou\u2019re actually quite different from Suyang\u2019s description of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person he thought I was is gone. I\u2019m no longer the person I was three years ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what is your next step?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will tell my client that the will is real. I will tell him everything without missing a word. This is my job. I am devoted to my occupation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what happens if you go against me? It\u2019s not something you can handle.\u201d</p><br/><p>To me, Yao Youfan\u2019s words sounded very childish. This wasn\u2019t some gangster movie, \u201cYou\u2019re not the first person who\u2019ve tried to threaten me. People in my field are often threatened. Anyhow, I\u2019m going to leave now. If I were you, I would think of a countermeasure to deal with Xu Chuqiao\u2019s interrogation.\u201d</p><br/><p>I left the blank Yao Youfan where she was and left emotionlessly.</p><br/><p>When I left the house, I realized I was still wearing a scarf around my face\u2026.surprisingly I was able to put up such a powerful act with my ridiculous appearance.</p><br/><p>I roughly removed the scarf off my face and angrily stared at my mirror\u2019s reflection.</p><br/><p><i>Suyang! Humph\u2026 I had underestimated him. I almost fell into his trap again. For a moment, I actually considered hiding the truth for Yao Youfan. It would\u2019ve been what he wanted. </i>Knowing this, I felt a burning anger.</p><br/><p>I violently kicked an empty can by my feet. The sound of metal crashing against a wall rang in my ear.</p><br/><p><i>Could he have gotten back with me to help Yao Youfan? Suyang actually lied to me for her. Perhaps he wasn\u2019t what he said he was. Maybe he still hated me and wanted to get revenge.</i></p><br/><p>My mind was a mess. I didn\u2019t have any written evidence, but I took out the recording device from my pocket. It was running the whole time. I finally turned it off. Earlier, I turned it on the moment Yao Youfan entered the house.</p><br/><p>My hands were shaky. I completed my task, but my heart was suffering. I was experiencing the feeling of loss from three years ago. It was slowly devouring my flesh, blood, and spirit.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, I went to Xu Chuqiao\u2019s office and submitted my report to him. I told him the truth about the will and gave him the USB recording of my conversation with Yao Youfan. It didn\u2019t matter whether he believed me or not. I have completed my mission.</p><br/><p>Now, whatever that happens in the Xu family was no longer my issue. It was Xu Chuqiao who wanted to find out. He had to take responsibility for his decision. As for me, I had my own issues to deal with.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>It was nighttime. I silently sat on the couch as I waited for Suyang to return home. I didn\u2019t turn on any lights. Perhaps, my heart was only able to seek peace in the darkness.</p><br/><p>Earlier in the afternoon, I was furious when I had figured out the truth. But I\u2019ve calmed down a lot since then.</p><br/><p><i>I\u2019m much better! Much better now! It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine! </i>I comforted myself.</p><br/><p>After reflecting deeply, I decided to let this go.</p><br/><p><i>Wasn\u2019t it strange? I was betrayed by my lover\u2026 initially, I had wanted to pack everything and leave. But the moment I picked up the luggage, I realized the thought of losing Suyang again was more painful than the betrayal itself. </i></p><br/><p><i>Women. We are such emotional creatures. </i></p><br/><p>I could hear the password being pressed.</p><br/><p>But, the door didn\u2019t open. Instead, Suyang started to knock on the door. He probably knew what happened earlier today.</p><br/><p>Honestly, we were both stressed and didn\u2019t know how to face each other. But I\u2019ve already decided. I wasn\u2019t sure what Suyang had in mind though.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you this one chance\u2026 you better grasp it\u2026.\u201d I whispered. Then, I stood in front of the door. I didn\u2019t make any incentive to open the door. Instead, I yelled, \u201cCome in yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang sounded surprise, \u201cYou are ok if I enter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to enter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease give me a chance to explain myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>I sighed and leaned against the door. \u201cWhat do you want to explain? Yao Youfan or our issue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang was speaking to me from the other side of the door. It was actually effective because it sounded like he was very apologetic, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you sorry for? You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s wrong. I trusted you like a fool.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just wanted everyone to have their desired outcome. That\u2019s why\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you used me?\u201d I cut Suyang off, \u201cThe whole world could use me or lie to me and I could choose to forgive or hate the person. But Suyang, you can\u2019t lie to me. When it comes to you, I have no power.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang tapped the door with a rhythm, \u201cI wasn\u2019t using you. I just wanted to solve this issue in the best way possible. However, I realized my method was wrong and I\u2019ve hurt you.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Oh\u2026 my personality is too rushed! I can\u2019t hold it in anymore. Being separated by the door was giving me too much anxiety.</i></p><br/><p>I suddenly twisted the door knob. The moment I opened the door, I was faced with Suyang\u2019s distressed pupils. I quickly turned and avoided his gaze, \u201cEnter and talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang followed behind me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you lie to me? For the past few days, you were helping Yao Youfan all along, right? How can I decipher what you said was true or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it intentionally. Do you remember the day we met? I was called in by the chairman. She told me the new hiree was Xu Chuqiao\u2019s eyes. She wanted me to keep an eye on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cContinue.\u201d The whole time, my back was facing Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for everything else, you already know. But everything I\u2019ve said to you is the truth. I admit that I was trying to solve the problem by assuming you were still the same person you were three years ago. But three years have gone by, and I\u2019ve forgotten that we\u2019ve both changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>I bit my lips and trembled a little, \u201cYes, we\u2019ve changed. What do you think of the Lin Yixin now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do you think of the Suyang now?\u201d</p><br/><p>I spread out my hands, \u201cI was able to see through your plan. That means, I understand you. You were like this in the past. You didn\u2019t change much. If anything, I\u2019ve become more sensitive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying\u2026..\u201d Suyang stood in front of me and grabbed my hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cI only want to know one thing. Please think about it deeply before you reply. Suyang, do you actually love me or hate me? Everything is so blurred that I can\u2019t tell the difference. Like I\u2019ve said, the whole world could lie to me, but you can\u2019t. I can forgive the whole world, but I wouldn\u2019t want to forgive you.\u201d I gazed into Suyang\u2019s eyes. I\u2019ve never been more sincere and serious than this.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel the same way. You should understand that both love and hate are very intense and twisted emotions. I admit when I first saw you, I felt hatred. I recall the woman who left without saying a word. But the hatred only lasted for a second. Afterwards, aside from missing you every passing second, I was loving you. Sometimes, I feel like such a pathetic person. Why do I hang myself on your tree? But I cannot control myself. I think I really need you in my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Suyang was done speaking, I didn\u2019t say anything else. I leaned forward and pressed my lips against his. No more words were necessary. It was enough as long as he loved me.</p><br/><p>Love was powerful enough to dissolve all our unpleasant conflicts. <i>Some may say I am a stupid woman. But for Suyang, I am willing to be stupid. </i></p><br/><p>Suyang seemed surprised by my initiation. \u201cSo\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m only giving you this one chance because I love you.\u201d I told Suyang in his face.</p><br/><p>Suyang lifted me up and carried me into the bedroom.</p><br/><p>Just as he was at his peak of desire, I suddenly shoved me away. I gave him a cunning smile, \u201cToday, you\u2019re sleeping by yourself. I\u2019m going to sleep in the living room.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Suyang was stunned. It was as if his eyes were yelling, \u201cWe\u2019re at this stage and you\u2019re going to make me sleep alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>I patted Suyang\u2019s face, \u201cI forgive you for the Yao Youfan issue, but to prevent you from doing this again, I have to give you a light punishment. Be good. Goodnight!\u201d Then, I strutted out of the bedroom and laid on the couch.</p><br/><p>As expected, in less than three seconds, Suyang came over and whined, \u201cAre you really going to treat me like this? Didn\u2019t you say you love me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a man. You can\u2019t even handle such a small test? This is good training for you\u2026 go go go! Return to your room or I\u2019ll look down on you!\u201d I turned over and faced the couch.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m a man! That\u2019s why I can\u2019t handle this type of test! Can\u2019t you just pity me\u2026..\u201d Suyang kept trying to turn my face around. He kept rubbing his face against mines and made my hair poke against my skin.</p><br/><p>I kicked him off the couch and saw his depressed back view. I felt much better.</p><br/><p>I casually lifted my leg on the couch as I stared at Suyang\u2019s bedroom. I could imagine how much he was suffering. In less than five minutes, Suyang came out again and went to the bathroom.</p><br/><p>I could hear him taking a shower. I chuckled underneath the blanket.</p><br/><p>Soon, the sound of water stopped and I could hear the door opening. Suddenly, I felt the couch sinking a bit around my feet. I assumed Suyang had finished showering and sat down.</p><br/><p>The sound of television began to blast in the darkness. I lowered the blanket a bit and took a peek. The moment I saw the scene before me, I ducked back into my blanket.</p><br/><p><i>What the heck?! What type of person watches TV naked? </i></p><br/><p>Before I could process more, Suyang began tugging the blanket from my feet.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

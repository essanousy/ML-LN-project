He remained in silence as he stared off in space and drove very robotically.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey. What happened to you? Don\u2019t scare me?\u201d Generally, I already considered Suyang a bit odd. But now, he was acting even more strange.</p><br/><p><i>He wasn\u2019t one of the homicidal maniac\u2019s so-called \u201chidden worshippers\u201d right? Could he have been brainwashed and have some evil thoughts?</i></p><br/><p><i>Wouldn\u2019t that be very dangerous of him to drive? No, I was currently in danger?! </i>Thinking of this, I began to slightly freak out and tactfully remained quiet until we arrived home.</p><br/><p>It was as if Suyang had wind blowing under his feet. He ran to take the elevator without waiting for me. As a result, I had to wait for another one. By the time I entered the apartment, he was nowhere in sight aside from his tightly shut door.</p><br/><p>I was pacing back and forth in the living room for quite some time as I fretted from within. Eventually, I decided to press my face against his door to hear what he was doing.</p><br/><p>I lowered my body like a cat as I gently pressed my hands on the ground. I pricked up my ears and attentively tried to hear the activity in the room. What was it? There was a faint noise. It sounded somewhat like a person pounding on the keyboard.</p><br/><p>The more I thought about it, the more worried I became. I decided to give Shen Shaoqian a call.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! You\u2019re still alive?\u201d That was Shen Shaoqian\u2019s first line. I wasn\u2019t sure if I should be glad or disappointed. \u201cHow\u2019s your body?\u201d</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t in the mood to joke around as I temporarily hid in a corner and whispered, \u201cI brought Suyang to see the homicidal maniac. But now, he\u2019s acting really strange. On the way home, he wouldn\u2019t say a single word. And the moment he got home, he locked himself in the room. He\u2019ll be ok, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sheo Shaoqian chuckled. On the contrary, he seemed to be very relaxed about my concerns. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. He\u2019s like that. Just leave him alone. Pretend he doesn\u2019t exist and live your days. When the time is up, he will come out on his own. But, you should buy some chocolate and put it in the fridge\u2026or anything that\u2019s sweet and can replenish sugar levels.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s good enough?\u201d After hearing Shen Shaoqian\u2019s suggestion, I was very doubtful. But if that was what his best friend said, I will follow along.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive! Don\u2019t worry! By the way, I asked about your apartment yesterday. They told me it\u2019ll be completed in three days or so. You must be tired of living with Suyang, right? You\u2019ll be free soon. Just endure a bit longer! Add oil!\u201d Then, Shen Shaoqian briskly hung up the phone and left me all by myself in a disheveled state.</p><br/><p>My apartment will be completed in three days?</p><br/><p>That was supposed to be great news, but why wasn\u2019t I happy about it at all? Yes. It must be because I didn\u2019t want to part with this huge apartment.</p><br/><p>I gazed at Suyang\u2019s bedroom door. That must be the reason\u2026</p><br/><p>So, I listened to Shen Shaoqian and lived as if I was on my own. I acted like Suyang didn\u2019t exist.</p><br/><p>But once in awhile, I would be curious and look towards his room\u2019s direction. Deep down, I prayed he wasn\u2019t dead.</p><br/><p>Finally, after two days later, Suyang crawled out of his room.</p><br/><p>At the time, I was eating a bun and searching the web for a job. I noticed Suyang was still wearing the same clothes he had worn from the interview day.</p><br/><p>When he crawled out, his hair was a mess and his face was dirty.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou! You! You!\u201d The closer our proximity, the stronger the fermentation smell. It was disgusting. I held onto my nose as I drew back.</p><br/><p>\u201cSh\u2026sh\u2026.\u201d Suyang appeared mentally unstable as he shook his head and muttered to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d I crinkled my brows. I didn\u2019t dare to lessen my alertness while facing this abnormal version of Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cShui\u2026(water in Mandarin)\u201d Suyang raised his voice and repeated once more. This time, I could clearly hear him.</p><br/><p>I quickly ran to the fridge and grabbed a water bottle and threw it at him.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, Suyang didn\u2019t catch the water bottle. Instead, the water bottle accurately smashed against his body. Suyang was motionless.</p><br/><p>I covered my mouth; not knowing what to do.</p><br/><p>Deep down, I was thinking, \u201cWow, the poisonous tongue bully Suyang has been knocked out by a water bottle thrown by me?\u201d</p><br/><p>I hastily ran to Suyang and held him up. His entire body limply fell into my embrace. I could tell his eyes were unable to focus, and I lightly slapped his cheek, \u201cHey, you ok?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWater\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>He was already in this critical state, yet he was still begging for water. After I unscrewed the lid, I placed the water bottle against his lips.</p><br/><p>With my help, Suyang finished the entire bottle.</p><br/><p>After drinking the water, Suyang didn\u2019t get up. He remained in the same position and his eyes appeared lifeless as he gazed off at a distant location.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d I followed the direction of his gaze, but I didn\u2019t see anything interesting.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026want\u2026to\u2026.eat\u2026\u201d After a long time, Suyang suddenly said a sentence.</p><br/><p>True, he hadn\u2019t eaten in two days. No wonder he was acting like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Wait for me here. I will make something for you to eat now.\u201d I lied the weak Suyang flat against the ground. Then, I ran to the fridge to look for the chocolate and sweets that Shen Shaoqian had told me to buy and gave him some to replenish his sugar level. Lastly, I simply cooked Suyang two bags of instant noodles and eggs.</p><br/><p>The smell of instant noodles filled the room, and as Suyang gnawed on the chocolate, he began to wiggle on the ground. It was as if he was coming back to life, but he didn\u2019t have the strength to get up.</p><br/><p>So, I, a 160cm+ tiny person, had to lift a 180cm+ big person to the dining table to eat. Envisioning it was very hilarious.</p><br/><p>While Suyang was wolfing down his noodles, I couldn\u2019t help but ask out of curiosity, \u201cWhat have you been doing these past two days?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWriting a novel.\u201d Suyang responded without lifting his head, as he continuously sucked his noodles.</p><br/><p>\u201cWriting a novel doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t eat or drink for two days, right? Based on how you\u2019re eating, I feel like you can swallow a whole ox.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInspiration is something that you must grasp immediately.\u201d Suyang suddenly lifted his head and sharply stared at me. He continued, \u201cOnce, I didn\u2019t sleep for five days in a row to write. This is already considered light.\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone was downplaying his words. \u201cFive days? How did you survive? Pure willpower? Are you even human?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShen Shaoqian found a doctor to inject nutrient fluid in me.\u201d</p><br/><p>My eyes were nearly popping out. I couldn\u2019t hide my shock. Suddenly, I felt like Suyang\u2019s existence was like a God. What type of life did he lived back then? He had completely evoked my curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you a famous author? What type of novels have you written?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you found a job yet?\u201d Suyang didn\u2019t answer my question. Instead, he asked another one.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. The moment I think about it, I feel so depressed\u2026\u201d In an instant, my mood turned from sunny to cloudy. \u201cFor a commoner like me who came from an average school, who graduated with an ordinary degree, it is not so simple to find a job in this terrible economy. Now that I think back, I feel so wronged for losing my previous job!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you lose your previous job?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm\u2026I accidentally knocked the boss\u2019s mother across the hall when I ran out of the washroom\u2026.not something big\u2026.\u201d I mumbled obscurely.</p><br/><p>Suyang laughed and nearly spat out all his noodles, \u201cI don\u2019t think you were wronged for losing your job at all. As expected, you are a goldfish!\u201d</p><br/><p>I grudgingly glared at Suyang, \u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang shrugged his shoulders, \u201cI mean, can you cook me another bag of noodles?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have strength now. Cook it yourself.\u201d I left the dining table and went to the living room to sit on the couch. I hugged the cushion as I imagined my pathetic future; being stranded on the streets.</p><br/><p>Suyang also came out. He was probably not going to cook the noodles. Currently, he was holding onto the bread that I had left over. \u201cWhat type of expression is this? Who would want you when you have such a miserable face?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you try to understand the sorrows of modern average women? Do you know how grim it is for us? If we are the same age, we cannot compete against their higher education. If they have the same education level as us, we cannot compete against the young ones\u2026\u201d At this point, I deeply sighed again.</p><br/><p>\u201cOhhh, so you\u2019re inferior!\u201d Suyang began to chew my bread as he looked down at me.</p><br/><p>I crossed my eyes as I glared at him and pursed my lips, \u201cWhat do you mean inferior?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally, I thought you were staying home because you would often get into trouble. Unexpectedly, the main issue is your ability.\u201d Suyang had a very serious expression as he evaluated me like a member from the judging panel.</p><br/><p>I was even more annoyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m a good-for-nothing and I stir up trouble easily. I can also attract ghosts! Look! There is a ghost behind you!\u201d Tom gracefully strolled by Suyang. It was a real joke. I wanted to scared him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

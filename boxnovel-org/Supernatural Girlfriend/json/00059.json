Based on Shen Shaoqian\u2019s reaction, he should be familiar with Suyang\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>\u201cShaonu, I\u2019m warning you. Don\u2019t do anything weird. Or else, if Suyang gets mad, even I can\u2019t save you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang brother will not get mad at me over that woman!\u201d Shen Shaonu took out her cell phone and began to look up the address on the piece of paper.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, this again!\u201d Shen Shaoqian shook his head hopelessly and weakly sat down on the sofa. He gave up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Shen Shaonu seemed to have discovered something. She looked surprised and then frowned. I cranked my neck over because I wanted to see her screen. I wonder why her facial expression changed so negatively.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place is so far from home\u2026.\u201d Shen Shaonu muttered to herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if it\u2019s far?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but blurted.</p><br/><p>\u201cNormally, if Suyang wanted to meet casually, he wouldn\u2019t purposely go such a far distance. I have a very bad feeling about this!\u201d All of a sudden, Shen Shaonu acted like a detective as she rubbed her chin and narrowed her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat type of feeling?\u201d Since Shen Shaonu sounded so convincing, I was beginning to think like her too. <i>Perhaps Suyang is truly interested in this reporter? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cI told you. I only introduce the ones that matches\u2026..\u201d Shen Shaoqian proudly stated from the sofa.</p><br/><p>But before he could continue, Shen Shaonu picked up the cushion he had thrown at her earlier and furiously approached her brother.</p><br/><p>Then\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all your fault! I blame you! Ahhhh!\u201d Shen Shaonu shouted as she began to attack Shen Shaoqian with all her strength. \u201cIf Suyang brother ends up with that evil woman, I\u2019m going to make you die for your offense! You criminal offender! Take this! Take this! Ha! Ha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Shaoqian was trying to protect his head. He didn\u2019t have any opportunity to strike back.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can hit the body but not the face! Hitting the face will hurt my self-esteem!\u201d Shen Shaoqian hollered.</p><br/><p><i>Yes! Go go go! Left! Right! Right! Left! Haha! </i></p><br/><p>I was watching from the side and thinking, <i>Shaonu. Hit harder! Ideally, use your fists! </i>After all, I agreed with her. Suyang wouldn\u2019t have gone on this blind date if it weren\u2019t for Shen Shaoqian.<i></i></p><br/><p>It seemed like she was tired. Shen Shaonu was panting loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I watched her walked towards the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Obviously, I am going to interrupt their meeting! There is absolutely no way I will allow that woman to be with Suyang brother. They can\u2019t even be friends!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, I was cool with Shen Shaonu.</p><br/><p>The corners of my mouth curved into a smile. I think a good show was about to start!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>Shen Shaonu and I were hiding behind a scrub around the corner. Out of nowhere, she pulled out a pair of binoculars as she closely observed Suyang and Mi Fan chatting in a coffee shop.</p><br/><p>Humph! They seem to be enjoying themselves\u2026</p><br/><p>Speaking of Mi Fan, while we were on our way, I searched her up on the internet. She was an attractive reporter and was known as the Goddess of exposing crime. She was loved by all the people and a great example for newbie reporters. Practically, all the searches of her showed position results.</p><br/><p><i>Psssh.. Loved by all people? I already know two people who didn\u2019t like her. Me and Shen Shaonu. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cI came to ruin their date. Why are you here?\u201d Shen Shaonu still had her guard up against me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-\u2026.honestly, I\u2019m not a fan of Mi Fan. I\u2019ve disliked her from the start. The proverb says it best, \u2018<i>An enemy\u2019s enemy is a friend\u2019</i>. Plus, Suyang is my boss. If Mi Fan successfully becomes my boss\u2019s girlfriend, she\u2019ll probably get rid of all the women around him. Most likely, I will lose my job\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. An enemy\u2019s enemy is a friend. You\u2019re right!\u201d For the time being, Shen Shaonu allowed me to inspect with her. \u201cBut do you have any idea on how to ruin their date?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRuin their date?\u201d I lowered my head and thought about it. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we approach them upfront?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Shaonu shook her head to show her disapproval, \u201cIf Suyang brother sees me, he will know I was behind this. We need to think of a way where we won\u2019t be exposed. It has to be natural\u2026..ah, got it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Shaonu suddenly thought of something as she took her phone out and made a phone call.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello? Zhengyang? What are you doing right now? I see Mi Fan. Do you want to come? Ah. Yes. Ok. I\u2019ll send you the address and wait for you here!\u201d She ended her short conversation with the person. Currently, Shen Shaonu was beaming.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho did you call?\u201d Seeing her cunning smile, I felt like something bad was about to happen.</p><br/><p>Shen Shaonu looked at me and the corner of her mouth curved upwards. She whispered in my ear, \u201cThe person I called is a friend of mines. He\u2019s also someone who cannot live underneath the same sky as Mi Fan. The moment he appears, I\u2019m quite sure Mi Fan will have much more to worry about than her date.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s that powerful?\u201d I asked suspiciously.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust wait. Soon, the evil woman\u2019s greed and evil nature will be exposed!\u201d Shen Shaonu bitterly declared. I was starting to think that the hatred Shen Shaonu had towards Mi Fan was not simply restricted to her being Suyang\u2019s date.</p><br/><p>*Pa* *Pa*!</p><br/><p>Shen Shaonu and I were smacking mosquitoes left and right. There were so many mosquitoes in the shrub. But Shen Shaonu didn\u2019t seem to waver at all as she patiently waited for her friend to arrive.</p><br/><p><i>I thought the mosquitoes in shrubs didn\u2019t bite humans? But I already had two huge bites on my neck. I was so itchy\u2026</i></p><br/><p>I was physically and emotionally exhausted from fighting with the mosquitoes. Gradually, I was no longer able to focus. It was as if all my bites had decided to activate their itch at the same time. I was so uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t handle this. I have too many bites. I\u2019m going to go to the store to get some anti-itch spray!\u201d I told Shen Shaonu.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. Looks like your blood tastes better than mines? I haven\u2019t gotten a single bite yet. Big sister, your blood type is the O, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll discuss my blood type with you after I come back.\u201d I turned around and struggled to get up. My legs were quite numb from hiding for so long. Then, I slowly and quietly headed towards the direction of a pharmacy.</p><br/><p>I bought a bottle of anti-itch spray and sprayed some on my neck. It had an instant cool and refreshing effect. I felt much better. However, I wasn\u2019t brave enough to return to the shrub again. I was standing on the side of the road pondering what I should do next. Should I go home first? After all, Shen Shaonu seemed to know what she was doing\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Someone from behind me ran into my shoulder. He didn\u2019t even say \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d. The teenager walked by me with his head lowered. I held onto my shoulder and noticed he was swaying while holding onto a wine bottle. <i>Was he drunk? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cA punk that lacks common decency!\u201d I rubbed my painful shoulder as I blurted at his rear view. Suddenly, I felt a blast of cold air coming from behind me. I slowly turned around and noticed a white-haired old man. He was glaring with me with his two bloodshot red eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d I was so frightened that I took a few steps backwards and yelled without the intentions of doing so.</p><br/><p><i>He was a bit transparent. It was a ghost! </i></p><br/><p>I realized everyone\u2019s eyes were on me and I closed my mouth. I pretended I wasn\u2019t the person who had screamed as I closed my eyes and hummed a song.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld man, you\u2019re so scary. Old man, you\u2019re so scary! Old man, I don\u2019t know you. Can you please not stare at me like this?\u201d I muttered like a broken record. After a few seconds, I felt like there was no movements. So, I cracked my eyes opened.</p><br/><p>The old man was gone. He was following closely behind the teenager.</p><br/><p>But worse of all, my actions had caught the attention of all those around. Strangers on the streets, staffs from the stores, and volunteers that were passing pamphlets on the road were all giving me odd looks. To make the matters worse, Suyang had discovered me from the coffee shop.</p><br/><p>The moment we made eye contact, I thought to myself, \u201cOh shit! What should I say if he asks me why I am here?\u201d</p><br/><p>As I planned to slip away, I noticed Shen Shaonu standing up. But her destination was the opposite of mines. She was running towards the coffee shop.</p><br/><p><i>What happened? </i></p><br/><p><i>I thought she said she didn\u2019t want to expose herself? Why was she making it so obvious now? </i></p><br/>\n</div>"}

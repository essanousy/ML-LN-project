But afterwards, I gradually realized that wasn\u2019t true\u2026 eventually, I was certain that you were able to see ghosts. I\u2019m so envious\u2026 you could see those who others want to see but can never see again.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Don\u2019t say it! Don\u2019t say it! You don\u2019t know anything, Lin Yixin! Don\u2019t say it!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cAround 25 years of age. Approximately 180cm. Relatively skinny. Deep eye sockets. Clean and tidy short hair. There\u2019s a mole on the corner of his left eye. Do you know him?\u201d</p><br/><p>I honestly couldn\u2019t handle this woman\u2019s dejected expression. It was as if she was standing at the corner against the whole world. It made it difficult for me to ignore her.</p><br/><p>After hearing my description, Gao Jialan covered her mouth in awe. She crouched down and emotional tears began to stream down from her face, \u201cI was correct! You could see him. That man is my husband!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>During breakfast, the atmosphere was very weird. Most likely, it was due to the conversation Gao Jialan had a few hours ago. None of us said anything since then.</p><br/><p>I was staring at Gao Jialan while Gao Jialan was watching Suyang\u2019s expression. Suyang was secretly observing me.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you still mad?\u201d Suyang unpeeled a hard-boiled egg and stuffed it in my mouth. He broke my train of thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m just deep in thought.\u201d Then, I began to chew on the egg as I directly made eye contact with Gao Jialan. \u201cHow long do you plan to stay until?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan quickly lowered her head to eat her rice porridge. She was taking tiny bites as she stuttered, \u201cFor n-now\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long is for now?\u201d I continued to push. Initially, I was already against Gao Jialan staying with us. Now that I can see a ghost that was related to her, I was even more reluctant for her to be here. I didn\u2019t want to attract more problems.</p><br/><p>Ever since I survived the gunshot, I wanted to get away from all trouble. So, I truthfully was hoping she would leave as soon as possible.</p><br/><p><i>Why couldn\u2019t such a simple wish come true? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cDrink your juice!\u201d Suyang handed a glass of juice to me. Suyang probably made this gesture because he felt like I was putting Gao Jialan in an uncomfortable position. So, he felt the need to interrupt.</p><br/><p>I glared at him and seized the juice from his hand. I drank all the content in one gulp. Then, I roughly rubbed my mouth with the back of my hand, \u201cDo you want me to eat or drink anything else? Give it to me all at once.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang could tell I saw through him, so he shook his head with guilt and obediently lowered his eyes as he silently drank his milk. Then, he kindly gazed at me as he batted his eyes.</p><br/><p>I really didn\u2019t know how to deal with him. He was always trying to act cute, yet that was what I liked.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah! You have to go to the television station as an honoured guest today. I can\u2019t go with you. What to do?\u201d I suddenly recalled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you go with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to stay home to watch the apartment. I\u2019m not comfortable leaving her alone here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan lifted her head and smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I can be home alone.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>She\u2026..seemed to have misunderstood?! Why do I feel like she was misinterpreting my words? Please, I\u2019m not staying here because I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll be lonely\u2026 </i></p><br/><p>\u201cOf course you have to go with me. You\u2019re the one who accidentally accepted this interview. You must take responsibility until the very end.\u201d Based on Suyang\u2019s stance, I had no choice. I couldn\u2019t tell whether he was trying to help Gao Jialan or he actually wanted me to go.</p><br/><p>I had accidentally accepted the interview that day by mistake. It was when I had just been discharged from the hospital. Suyang had decided to be a responsible man and cook for me. So, he left me at home while he went to the supermarket to buy groceries.</p><br/><p>I was exhausted and fell asleep on the couch.</p><br/><p>While I was semi conscious, the phone rang and I picked it up. It was a publishing house that Suyang had been working alongside with for years. They wanted to invite him as a guest on a show. They wanted to take this opportunity for Suyang to become known to the public. They didn\u2019t want Suyang to be a hidden writer anymore.</p><br/><p>Although Suyang had published many best seller books, he had never publicly revealed his face to his readers before.</p><br/><p>Since my mind was muddled, I felt like the person on the phone was speaking gibberish. I made a few acknowledgement sounds.</p><br/><p>Who would\u2019ve thought that after a few hours later while Suyang and I were enjoying our romantic dinner together, the editor in chief of the publishing house would call again to confirm Suyang\u2019s schedule for the day?</p><br/><p>\u201cInterview?!\u201d Suyang crinkled his brows, \u201cWhen did I say I was going to go on a show?\u201d</p><br/><p>By then, I had already forgotten about the phone incident. So, I gazed at Suyang in confusion. Using body language, I asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm. I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang didn\u2019t say anything else except the simple response. But his face was gradually turning darker and darker.</p><br/><p>After he hung up, I rushed to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Your complexion doesn\u2019t look too good\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang put down his eating utensils, \u201cThe publishing house said a woman picked up the phone this afternoon and had already accepted the invitation from the television station on my behalf. Can you guess who that woman is?\u201d</p><br/><p>I instantly turned stiff as a rock. Suddenly, I recalled the phone incident from this afternoon. \u201cWho\u2026? I don\u2019t know\u2026. !?! Even if someone promised for you, you could always decline it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe television station has already made preparations. Also, their calls are all monitored and recorded. If I do not show up, they will figure out who was responsible and that person will be in deep trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat type of television station is this? Are their viewerships that high?\u201d I slammed my hand against the table, \u201cThey actually record their phone conversations!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang looked solemnly at me, \u201cWhat do you think I should do? I didn\u2019t want to go in the first place\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we going through some relationship roadblock!? You\u2019re not planning to break up with me right now, are you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWould the television station sue me? Would I have to go to jail?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 my chest is hurting\u2026 ahhh\u2026. I have endured a gunshot wound. I almost died\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease go\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>At the end, Suyang promised to go to the television station.</p><br/><p>So now, back to reality.</p><br/><p>Deep down, I know that once Suyang has made up his mind, no one could change it. One of the conditions he had for going to the television station was that I would go with him.</p><br/><p>Also, for Gao Jialan\u2019s safety\u2019s sake, he would not let me and her remain in the same room together.</p><br/><p>So after breakfast, I casually put some makeup on and reluctantly entered Suyang\u2019s car as we headed to the television station together.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you excited? If you\u2019re lucky, you might see a celebrity.\u201d Suyang asked me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in seeing celebrities. Plus, I already have a \u201chuge celebrity\u201d at home to take care of. Where would I find time to care about other celebrities?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang pinched my face as he gave me a huge smile, \u201cOhhhh! When did goldfish learn how to compliment so well!? What a good girl\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Why were my words being misinterpreted again?! </i>I rolled my eyes. <i>Could it be that I naturally have a very kind face, so people keep mistaking my sarcasm for compliments? Or could it be that I wasn\u2019t skillful enough? </i></p><br/><p>When we arrived at the television station, we first met with the director and he elaborated on the main details of the show. He smiled and handed a script to Suyang. Then, we went to the backstage and the makeup artist began to help Suyang do his makeup.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour skin is very good. Do you do any maintenance?\u201d The young makeup artist sweetly asked Suyang.</p><br/><p><i>Maintenance?! He\u2019s as lazy as you can get! </i>I silently answered.</p><br/><p><i>But, I must admit. His skin quality is quite high.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cMm. I guess so? Sometimes, I would secretly try out my girlfriend\u2019s facial products.\u201d Suyang replied.</p><br/><p><i>What?! Suyang has been secretly using my facial products?! No wonder these days I\u2019ve been running out so quickly! There was a time I thought my face had grown wider!</i></p><br/><p>I could see the young makeup artist paused. Although her shocked expression only lasted a second, I still caught it. \u201cY-you \u2026already have a girlfriend? I thought you were single\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have one before. But now I do.\u201d</p><br/><p>I sat on the couch and pretended to read Suyang\u2019s script. But in actuality, I was eavesdropping on their conversation. Deep down, I was very pleased with Suyang\u2019s response.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

So Suyang doesn\u2019t plan to sleep on the couch?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cI think you have misunderstood. I said you may move to my room. I never said I would leave my room\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I stared at Suyang with a frozen face. I finally found out his motive. It couldn\u2019t get anymore obvious than this. <i>When did Suyang turn into a pervert?</i></p><br/><p>I glared at his fake innocent, handsome face. I wanted to kiss it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you teasing me?\u201d I icily asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNope! But we are a couple and we\u2019re living together! And don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t do anything to you.\u201d Suyang fixed his collar, \u201cI\u2019m a man of honour.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLiar!\u201d I instantly refuted.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true! I promise you, I won\u2019t do anything. I swear!\u201d Suyang gently smiled at me. Each time he gave me this look, it was never that simple.</p><br/><p>\u201cLiar! You are a schemeful person! I already knew you had a motive. I just didn\u2019t think you would be so wicked!\u201d I began to back up from him.</p><br/><p>But Suyang grabbed me by the ankle. He sincerely looked at me, \u201cI really won\u2019t do anything. Think about it. When had I ever lied to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you let me stay in your room and sleep on the couch, I\u2019ll believe you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang suddenly crinkled his brows and had one hand against his head. He began to moan dramatically, \u201cActually, ever since I was little, my body has been very weak. I have an illness called, \u2018the moment I sleep on the couch, I would turn dizzy and cough\u2019. It has been many years, but I\u2019m still not cured\u2026. I think this illness is incurable\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure! Sure! Not only is it incurable, I think you\u2019re incurable!! The devil had devoured your soul and now you\u2019re deranged!\u201d I kicked Suyang. \u201cYou liar! You\u2019re lying to me right now! And you dare to say you\u2019ve never lied to me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling the truth!\u201d Suyang leaned forward to embrace me. His weight caused me to fall onto the couch. Based on the looks of it, if I didn\u2019t agree with his decision, he will not release me today.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Despite knowing he was not an honest soul, I couldn\u2019t help but soften and reach a compromise.</p><br/><p>Suyang nodded like those nodding puppets.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll trust you this one time. Plus, there\u2019s someone else in the apartment. I doubt you would dare to do anything!\u201d I forcefully smashed my forehead against Suyang\u2019s forehead, \u201cIf you dare to be touchy touchy, I will not forgive you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>Suyang\u2019s room was the same as I had last seen it. It was filled with anime, comics, games, and action figures.</p><br/><p>Since I didn\u2019t appear surprised at all, Suyang had to accept the fact that I had already seen his room. He lamented and then stormed to the phone in the living room.</p><br/><p>Immediately, I heard Suyang reprimand Shen Shaoqian.</p><br/><p>\u201cShen Shaoqian! You better watch after your sister!\u201d After yelling, Suyang harshly slammed down the phone. He had his hands on his waist as he huffed and puffed.</p><br/><p>Poor Shen Shaoqian probably didn\u2019t have the chance to say anything before Suyang hung up.</p><br/><p>Anyhow, as a matter of fact, it turned out that Suyang was truly a gentleman.</p><br/><p>Although my boyfriend had very good principles, I was actually quite upset he didn\u2019t make any moves on me the whole night.</p><br/><p><i>Was I lacking charm or what? </i></p><br/><p>Suyang was sleeping so well. His breathing was calm and steady. Whereas, I was the one who was tossing and turning.</p><br/><p>I borrowed the light from the moon as I laid on my side and observed Suyang\u2019s face from a close distance. <i>Thinking, how could a man\u2019s face be so beautiful?</i></p><br/><p><i>How long were his eyelashes? </i></p><br/><p><i>His skin was so good\u2026. </i></p><br/><p><i>No! At this rate, I will probably be the one making moves on him instead. </i></p><br/><p><i>This will not do!</i> I was probably destined not to get any sleep tonight. I stood up to head to the living room for a cup of cold water.</p><br/><p>But just as I exited, I noticed a man\u2019s rear view standing by the window.</p><br/><p>Since it looked somewhat transparent, I thought it was my hot bodyguard. <i>But why was he inside? He never comes in though\u2026. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you in here? Aren\u2019t you normally outside guarding the door?\u201d I asked casually. I went to the fridge to get a bottle of water and gulped it down.</p><br/><p><i>Ah\u2026. so refreshing! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cIs it because you\u2019re a ghost?\u2026.. Why does your rear view appear so lonely and sad? Did something happen?\u201d I asked. But my bodyguard didn\u2019t respond to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you ignoring me? Then forget it. I\u2019m returning to bed.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to interrupt his emotional atmosphere, so I decided to finish my water and leave.</p><br/><p>*cough cough*. Who would\u2019ve thought that while I was drinking halfway, the ghost would suddenly turn around. But his face wasn\u2019t the face of my hot bodyguard.</p><br/><p>I was so shocked that I began to choke and cough nonstop.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?!\u201d I frantically asked. It took awhile for me before I was able to stop coughing. I stared at this stranger ghost.</p><br/><p>I threw my water bottle on the side, \u201cActually, do ghosts these days lack common courtesy? Do you guys just enter people\u2019s houses whenever you feel like it? I\u2019m warning you. You better leave at the count of three. If not, you have to take responsibility for the consequences!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was as if he didn\u2019t hear me. The ghost began to come towards me and I felt a strong depressing aura approaching. I couldn\u2019t help but shiver.</p><br/><p>These days, I felt as if my existence was becoming more and more powerless. Not only do humans not listen to me, even ghosts were disobeying me.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come near me! I can see you! I can expel ghosts! The type that can make you vanish into smoke or dust so that you cannot reincarnate!\u201d I threatened him.\u201dDo you want to be dust? PM2.5, understand? (tl:I don\u2019t know what that means)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>The ghost was mouthing at me. It looked like he was trying to speak, but it was awfully frightening to watch\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cGhosts cannot make sounds. Since you cannot talk, you might as well go reincarnate.\u201d I waved my hand as I began to back away.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>The ghost was still \u201ctalking\u201d to me. It was as if he was a child that couldn\u2019t speak. But children were cute, whereas, he seemed very gloomy and depressed.</p><br/><p><i>What does he want? Why did he come to my apartment in the middle of the night? </i></p><br/><p><i>I swear, the ethics of ghosts were going down.</i></p><br/><p>I walked around the ghost as I carefully analyzed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop trying. You can\u2019t speak so just give up! It\u2019s poor conduct of you to enter a person\u2019s home without the owner\u2019s consent. Just go and reincarnate. Or else you might reincarnate into a bad body!\u201d I pressed my hands together and closed my eyes, \u201cBenefactor, Lord Buddha will bless you. Please leave. Amitabha Buddha\u2026. Amen\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d A clear female voice appeared from behind me. I quivered.</p><br/><p>It was Gao Jialan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t slept yet. And you have been talking for awhile. Who were you talking to?\u201d Gao Jialan walked towards me. In the darkness, I could vaguely see that her face was filled with shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 see? There\u2019s no one here! I was talking to myself.. Hahaha. It\u2019s a chronic illness.\u201d I pretended to do some stretching. \u201cI am the type of person who likes talking to herself. No need to pay attention to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan hesitated for a moment. Then, she said, \u201cYixin, I remember you\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember what?\u201d My smile was frozen on my face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI remember back when we were at the orphanage, you were very strange. As a result, no one played with you.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Oh\u2026 really? I don\u2019t remember much. Why is she reminding me of unpleasant memories? So what if no one played with me when I was young? I still managed to scoop myself a hot and rich boyfriend!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you bringing this up? I don\u2019t remember much.\u201d Since the lights were still off, I rolled my eyes at Gao Jialan.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne time, I asked you why you didn\u2019t play with other children. You told me, you already had a friend. Then, you pointed at the air next to you and introduced your \u201cfriend\u201d to me. I\u2019m quite sure I remembered this correctly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already told you I don\u2019t remember my past. And children tend to make up a lot of shit. How could you remember all of it so clearly?\u201d I awkwardly smiled.<i> Who is she? Why is her memory so good? </i></p><br/><p>It was such a odd feeling. I felt as if Gao Jialan had caught the tail I had been trying to conceal all these years. My tail was called \u201cthe tail that could see ghosts\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a ghost beside you, isn\u2019t there?\u201d Gao Jialan directly asked me.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? What nonsense are you speaking of? There are no such thing as ghosts in this world. Is your mind muddled?\u201d I didn\u2019t want to deal with her anymore so I began to rush back into Suyang\u2019s room.</p><br/><p><i>I shouldn\u2019t have came out tonight\u2026</i></p><br/><p>While I was passing by Gao Jialan, I heard her sigh, \u201cI\u2019m so envious of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>I halted my steps and stared at her.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

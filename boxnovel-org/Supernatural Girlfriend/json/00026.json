They both had the same faces; but one of them was cheerful while the other had no expression.</p><br/><p>I was a bit spooked. I just spoke to a ghost\u2026so now she knows I can see her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the invitation card. It is tonight at 7pm. Make sure you come!\u201d She dug for a pen and grabbed my palm and wrote a phone number on it. \u201cIf you have any issues, give me a call!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>I took the invitation card from her and watched the girl leave.</p><br/><p><i>Was it possible to have a ghost that looked exactly like a living person? Or vice versa? </i>As the saying goes, \u201cIf you live long enough, you\u2019ll see everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the girl left, the ghost also followed closely behind her.</p><br/><p>Something must be wrong here\u2026.but it was none of my business. In order to live a peaceful life, I must keep a distance from ghosts.</p><br/><p>I took out my cell phone to call Suyang. I wanted to know what he wants me to do now.</p><br/><p>I called many times, but no one picked up. Was he purposely avoiding me?</p><br/><p>When I arrived on the 2nd floor of the school, I noticed a huge crowd of students staring at someone.</p><br/><p><i>Oh kids\u2026</i></p><br/><p>Deep down, I felt like all Universities were the same. Just like how flowers bloom in Spring, and snow falls in Winter. Only a handsome guy can cause such a huge commotion amongst female students.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you seen the new literature professor? He is super hot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw! I saw! He even smiled at me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard he is very young. He\u2019s not even 30 yet! Aw man, if only I could be in his class\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you in the sciences? Why would you take a literature course\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other hand, my call finally went through. I paused my steps and yelled, \u201cWhat happened to the text message? Did you know I was waiting for your message the entire class? What am I supposed to do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Coincidentally, the female students began shrieking without prior consultation. I couldn\u2019t hear Suyang\u2019s response.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>I scorned at those crazy fangirls. Through a small crack, I distantly noticed Suyang. He was currently holding the phone by his ear. He was staring at my direction like he knew where I was.</p><br/><p>Following the surging female group of students, from time to time, I could see his eyes and nose. But I was never able to see his whole face.</p><br/><p>I was still in a bewildered state, but I could hear Suyang\u2019s voice now, \u201cFrom today onwards, I\u2019m going to be your professor. Can you see me?\u201d</p><br/><p>*Buzz buzz buzz* It was as if there were thousands of bees buzzing around my head. I had no idea that the cell phone had slipped out of my hand. Right now, my mind was continuously pondering over a question: \u201cHow could <i>he</i> be a <i>professor</i> here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClassmate, you dropped your cell phone.\u201d While I was zoning out, someone had picked up my cell phone and returned it back to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026thanks.\u201d I took the phone from his hand as I conveniently glanced at the guy. He was very tall and wore a basketball player outfit. There was a white towel around his neck, and he literally looked like a sunshine boy. If he went to my University, most ladies would consider him as Mr. Perfect! But I have left the student era long ago, so I had no interest in this child.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Bai Silu, right? I\u2019m from your class. My name is Kevin.\u201d Kevin\u2019s smile could really make a person bathe in youth. But he was still a child in my eyes, he had no manly charisma at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I awkwardly replied. Responding to my fake name was very weird and awkward.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to the student party tonight?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Kevin is the chatty type, eh?</i></p><br/><p>Suyang gave one look at my direction, and then he slowly left the scene.</p><br/><p><i>No way. Before he completely disappear from my sight, I must block him and ask what we\u2019re acting!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026I will go! I have something urgent to do at the moment, so\u2026 I\u2019ll see you tonight!\u201d I gave Kevin a half-hearted reply and ran after Suyang\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>I kept on running until I finally caught up to him. I pulled Suyang into an isolated corner and continued holding on his arm in fear that he will run off. \u201cBoss, can you please clearly explain to me what is going on?\u201d I panted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still unclear?\u201d Suyang spread out his hands, \u201cWe have both smoothly transitioned into our roles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat roles?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the student, I\u2019m the professor. Everything is ready, we\u2019re only missing the east wind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat east wind?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to fall in love with me.\u201d Suyang firmly commanded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa\u2026what?\u201d I released my hand. I was stunned, and didn\u2019t know how to continue the conversation.</p><br/><p>Suyang probably assumed I didn\u2019t hear him, so he slowly repeated it word for word, \u201cYou. Need. To. Fall. In. Love. With. Me.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was too dumbfounded and couldn\u2019t help but smack Suyang, \u201cBoss, feelings aren\u2019t something you can control. You can\u2019t just love someone whenever you want. Even if that is part of my weird job, you can\u2019t expect me to suddenly fall in love with you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I finished speaking, Suyang abruptly seized me by my shoulders and spun me around. In a split second, he had pressed me against the wall and stuck his forehead on mines.</p><br/><p>Suyang\u2019s action brought along a little breeze and I could smell the lemon scent on him. Subconsciously, my eyes widened as I held onto my breath. Suyang lifted my chin; leaving me no choice but to look him in the eye.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about this? Does this stir your heart a little?\u201d I could feel Suyang\u2019s breath on the wing of my nose. When did his voice turn so sexy?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you acting like this?\u201d My pupils were spinning around; I didn\u2019t want to make direct eye contact with Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is what I found online. This was one of the methods on how to quickly win over a woman. Is it not effective?\u201d Suyang stared deeply into my pupils. I felt like he could pierce through my soul.</p><br/><p>Hearing his words, I instantly pushed him away.</p><br/><p><i>He was trying to use me as a little white mouse again! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not effective! Not effective at all!\u201d I strongly insisted as I regulated my emotions. \u201cHave you ever been in a relationship? This type of trick doesn\u2019t work! You can\u2019t capture a woman\u2019s heart like this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang gave me a skeptical look but didn\u2019t say a word.</p><br/><p>I seemed to have sensed something and I rubbed my chin as I narrowed my eyes at Suyang, \u201cBoss, you have never been in a relationship before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Suyang had a \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d expression on his face. He was trying so hard that in my eyes, I found it unusually hilarious.</p><br/><p>After restraining it for awhile, I ultimately couldn\u2019t hold it in as I burst into laughter. One of my finger was pointing at Suyang while my other hand was holding onto my cramped belly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you\u2019ve..you\u2019ve\u2026.never?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou probably lost your previous job because you ridiculed your boss, eh?\u201d Suyang\u2019s face hardened. He was threatening to terminate my employment. It was very effective because I immediately stopped laughing and obediently stood by the wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you ever been in a relationship before?\u201d</p><br/><p>I shook my head. <i>Oh yeah, what gives me the right to laugh at Suyang. I have never been in one either\u2026.</i></p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the atmosphere turned very awkward.</p><br/><p>We sympathetically stared at each other with our single eyes, but I hated his pitiful gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn order to get into the right state of mind, I hope you can fall for me as soon as possible. Add oil.\u201d It was as if Suyang was trying to cheer me on. Then, he proudly walked away.</p><br/><p>I shook my head. I honestly don\u2019t understand him. How low could his IQ be? He would go up to a girl he doesn\u2019t like to tell her to fall for him as soon as possible?</p><br/><p>Especially when the girl already knows he is purely doing this for his creation..</p><br/><p>For a long time, my eyes lingered on Suyang\u2019s rear view.</p><br/><p>Today, the weather was nice and sunny. But because of one line from Suyang, my mood was covered in a layer of dense fog. It wouldn\u2019t go away.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I actually fall in love with you, would you take responsibility? Or would my feelings for you only continue in your novel\u2026.? If you aren\u2019t willing to take responsibility, how dare you talk about love\u2026.\u201d I muttered.</p><br/><p>That idiot!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Wen Yihan\u2019s words reminded me of something. </i></p><br/><p>My cell phone began to ring. It was bad timing.</p><br/><p>The ringtone caused Wen Yihan to resume back to normal as he began to slowly back away from me. Just as I was hesitating on whether or not I should pick up the call, Wen Yihan said, \u201cPick it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The call display revealed: <i>My super hot boyfriend</i>.</p><br/><p><i>Wow. Suyang changed his name on my phone again.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cI found Gao Jialan. Are you alright?\u201d Suyang\u2019s voice was filled with concern.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Go home first.\u201d I sat up from the couch as I turned my face a bit on the side and lowered my voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you in a position where it\u2019s not good to talk?\u201d Suyang attentively asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWen Yihan is right beside me, but it\u2019s not that I can\u2019t talk to you. I have some questions I want to ask him though. So, listen to me and go home first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re next to him?! That\u2019s too dangerous! No! Where are you? I\u2019ll come find you now!\u201d Suyang shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really fine. Don\u2019t forget the purpose of our mission. Go home and I\u2019ll be back shortly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Suyang could respond, I hung up.</p><br/><p>Then, I continued the conversation from where we left off. \u201cWhat do you mean earlier when you said you were killing a life but saving a life?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGao Jialan has a heart disease.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Heart disease? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cShe has congenital heart disease. She was born with it. That is why she was left and raised in the orphanage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does her heart disease have to do with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor a heart disease patient to give birth, 9 out of 10 times, they will die. Not to mention that she is already weak to begin with. The doctor has already determined she wouldn\u2019t be able to carry on the burden. If she forces herself, most likely\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><i>What? Gao Jialan never told me this\u2026.perhaps, she knew if she did, we wouldn\u2019t help her\u2026. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying, you\u2019re helping Gao Jialan decide? She lives and the child dies? But based on her personality, even if she dies in the delivery room, she would hang on until she gives birth first, no?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>A mother would definitely give everything to her child. I thought back to what Wen Yihan said about his mother dying for him. So he had his reason to do this\u2026.yet I called him cruel\u2026.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cI admit a part of me also doesn\u2019t want him to grow up and threaten my position. But more so, I want to save Gao Jialan. I\u2019m telling the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>I could see Wen Yihan\u2019s eyes softening when he mentioned Gao Jialan. You tell me there was nothing going on? I say bullshit! </i></p><br/><p><i>Now, I finally understood why Wen Yufan led me here instead of taking me to Gao Jialan. And all his strange expressions from before\u2026..it looks like Gao Jialan is the only one who actually wants the child to be born. </i></p><br/><p><i>So what should I do now? Aaaaaiii\u2026. Once again, I acted accordingly based on my own judgment. Was I wrong? </i></p><br/><p>I tried to see it from a different perspective as I stubbornly protected my standpoint, \u201cBut you should respect Gao Jialan\u2019s decision. If you force her to get rid of the child, she will hate you forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if she hates me forever? The things I\u2019ve done in the past were enough for her to hate me forever. She hasn\u2019t told you?\u201d Wen Yihan\u2019s expression turned fierce again. He was giving me goosebumps.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo are you admitting to everything she said?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAgain, I will not deny your opinions.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Who is this guy? Is he the beast who would kill his own relatives for status and money? Or a lovesick fool who would rather be misunderstood to save Gao Jialan? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cI have another question. Why are you telling me all this? Aren\u2019t you scared it will spread to others?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I am telling you, it means I already have a method to deal with the aftermath. I\u2019m only telling you the truth because you\u2019re Gao Jialan\u2019s last hope. If you\u2019re willing to be on my side, she will naturally be more obedient and it will save me a lot more work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what if I\u2019m not on your side?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not on my side?\u201d Wen Yihan seemed very confident.</p><br/><p><i>I\u2019m not sure. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cFrom our perspective, she should get an abortion. I know even Wen Yufan would choose her over the child. But every life has the right to be born. Each person also has the right to make his/her own decision. If Gao Jialan insists on giving birth to the child, I don\u2019t know what else I could say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything. Just remain still and make a phone call to tell your wonderful boyfriend to bring her here. Then, we are finished.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you already know everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can be the bad guy. You guys just need to pretend you don\u2019t know anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you\u2026give me some time to think about it? Give me a week. Allow Gao Jialan to remain in our apartment for a week and I\u2019ll give you an answer. If possible, I\u2019ll try to persuade her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA week?\u201d Wen Yihan thought about it. Then, he agreed to my suggestion. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll give you a week. Please be cautious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk, I\u2019m going to leave now\u2026\u201d There was no need to remain any longer. I\u2019ve already found out the truth. Now, my steps felt very heavy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, I\u2019m going to get someone to escort you back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s alright. You can go to bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, I thought of something. \u201cOh yeah, can you contact your subordinates and tell them to release a guy that they had captured?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like that, Shen Shaoqian and I headed home together. He was physically exhausted, while I was mentally exhausted.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>Wen Yihan gave me a week. Deep down, I knew he wanted me to convince Gao Jialan to get an abortion within this week. But to a mother, deliberately killing your own child was easier said than done.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, now that Wen Yufan was no longer alive, most likely, Gao Jialan was even more determined than ever to keep the child.</p><br/><p>I arrived back just a bit after Suyang. While I was heading towards the building, I could see Suyang dashing out. We made eye contact with each other and he hesitated for a second. Then, he tightly wrapped his arms around me.</p><br/><p>Whenever I snuggled against Suyang\u2019s broad chest, I always feel a sense of security. I dug my head into his chest as I greedily inhaled the scent that purely belonged to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d His voice was very light. It was far lighter than the hand that he was stroking my head with.</p><br/><p>I smiled and he tightened his arm around me. I raised my head and brightly gazed at him, \u201cI\u2019m fine. Were you planning to come looking for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou silly, do you honestly think I would leave you there by yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Sometimes, I feel like Suyang was very dependable. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d Although I didn\u2019t want to, I had to break out of Suyang\u2019s embrace because it was too awkward to chat in such position.</p><br/><p>Then, I walked a few circles around Suyang and said, \u201cYour baby came home unscratched.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing my joking tone, Suyang raised his brows, \u201cPshh\u2026 baby\u2026? Who says you\u2019re my baby?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ruthlessly pinched Suyang\u2019s face with my two hands. \u201cIf I\u2019m not your baby, who is your baby, huh?? Who dares to be your baby?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang showed me his cell phone. On the display was Shen Shaoqian\u2019s \u201cpotato\u201d message. By now, Suyang\u2019s face was looking kind of distorted from all my pinching.</p><br/><p>Suyang tried to act foolish, \u201cI was talking about Shaoqian.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201d I released my hands as I smiled at Suyang. \u201cHonestly, I can\u2019t compete with Shen Shaoqian. You two have been gay together for decades. I feel bad separating you two.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, you and Shen Shaoqian left together?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>How come Suyang questioned me like I had just been released from prison? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I think by now, your baby is already home and asleep?\u201d I looked down at my watch, \u201cHe was quite scared today. On the way home, he kept telling me how the security guards were very bulky and scary. They looked like gangsters. So, I told him to go home and stop scaring himself. I told him to wash up and go to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, I recalled Shen Shaoqian\u2019s helpless expression while we were walking home. It was incredibly funny and I couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Suyang thought it was extremely random of me.</p><br/><p>I waved my hand and wiped the tears that were coming out from the corner of my eyes. \u201cNothing\u2026 haha! I was just thinking about Shen Shaoqian\u2019s expression\u2026 haha! So funny! Tomorrow, make sure you buy some fruits and visit your baby. Give him some comfort!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, I want to know how you two managed to escape?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

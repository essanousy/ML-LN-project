Thinking back, be honest \u2026were you secretly crushing on me all along and fainted because you were too overly stimulated by our date?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPssh.. in your dreams!\u201d I rolled my eyes at Suyang. Then, I grabbed his collar. \u201cWhat about you, huh? Why did you decide to write a love novel out of nowhere? Then later on, you gave up so easily\u2026 you were the one with ulterior motives, right? Tell the truth! Was it because you wanted to date me, so you used the novel as an excuse to get me on a date?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYup.\u201d Suyang casually replied.</p><br/><p>I felt a bit awkward but I couldn\u2019t help but giggle. Ultimately, I had to cover my face and pretend to be shy. I punched Suyang lightly on the shoulder. \u201cOh you\u2026 how could you admit it so quickly! I am shy, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>I was positive that Suyang shivered after hearing my words. He was staring and muttering at the ceiling. \u201cDid you lose your IQ after you switched souls? How could you become so foolish and naive all of a sudden? Goldfish, you must conduct yourself well. Don\u2019t take a wrong step in life\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d I threw away my fried chicken thigh and aggressively pinched Suyang\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo! Yo!\u201d Suyang was yelling. (tl: He\u2019s saying \u201coil\u201d in Mandarin. The pinyin is <i>you</i> but the <i>u</i> is silent so it sounds like <i>yo</i>)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat <i>yo yo</i>! I can say <i>check it out</i>!!! Are you going to keep smiling so mischievously?\u201d I demanded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! I\u2019m talking about the oil on your hand! The oil! Cooking oil! Soya bean oil! Peanut oil!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was then I realized I had touched Suyang\u2019s face without wiping my hands first. Now, his face was all shiny and greasy. It was like he hadn\u2019t washed his face in 20 years.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not play around and talk about something serious. I want to continue our 24 hour date!\u201d I helped Suyang wipe the oil on his face as I suggested.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re already a couple. We can go on a date whenever we want!\u201d Suyang smoothly laid down on my leg and closed his eyes in a satisfied manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m talking about the continuation of our date from that day. It makes me sad to know we never finished it.\u201d I whined to Suyang. <i>Although whining never worked in the past, I wasn\u2019t the type to give up so easily!</i></p><br/><p>Suyang mocked, \u201cYou have an injured arm, Warrior Yang. Where would you like to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Suyang said I was Warrior Yang, I will act like Warrior Yang. \u201cGugu, please give permission to Guo\u2019er! These past few days, Guo\u2019er has been home and will turn moldy soon! At this rate, Guo\u2019er will have feathers growing and become a bird!\u201d I made a sullen face to try to gain Suyang\u2019s pity.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen where do you want to go? It\u2019s so cold\u2026 today, the weather is below 0 celcius\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to go to the beach; the same place where we went last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s so cold to go to the waters now! Are you sure you can handle it?\u201d Suyang asked out of concern.</p><br/><p>I nodded my head like mad. \u201cIt\u2019s fine! I want to go! Take me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang lowered his head to think about it. He didn\u2019t completely agree but he couldn\u2019t deal with my whining. \u201cAlright then. We\u2019ll go to the beach. Change your clothes. We\u2019ll go now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d I raised my hand in the air. I was still holding onto the tissue that I used to help Suyang wipe his face. Then, I ruthlessly shoved him off me as I hopped to my room to change.</p><br/><p>\u201cWash your hands first!\u201d Hearing Suyang\u2019s command, I took an emergency turn and dragged my injured arm as I went to wash my hands. Then, I changed into suitable clothing.</p><br/><p>Since I knew it was freezing out, both Suyang and I wore our thickest down-filled jacket. I also had my hat, scarf, gloves and face mask in my bag just in case. With everything we were bringing, people might assume we were climbing Mount Everest instead.</p><br/><p>We took the same route as last time. But this time, I wasn\u2019t asleep the whole ride. Instead, I tried my best to remember everything that was passing by. This was my homeland. I never knew how much the word homeland meant until now.</p><br/><p>After an extremely long ride through the highway, I could vaguely see the sparkling ocean from a distance. I was itching to run towards it and experience the winter beauty.</p><br/><p>The moment Suyang parked the car in the parking lot, I ran out like a wild horse. Regardless of how many times Suyang called out, I didn\u2019t turn around. I kept running towards the ocean. I didn\u2019t even know why. The only thing I saw was the silver ocean and I wanted to jump right in to forget everything else. I wanted to continue running until I reached the ends of the Earth.</p><br/><p>I used up all my strength to run and ended up slipping onto the beach. I fell down very hard.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoldfish?\u201d Suyang shouted from behind me. He ran over and crouched down to help me up. \u201cAre you hurt anywhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! No. I am dressed in a very thick layer.\u201d I continued laying on the sand with no intentions of getting up. I was smiling foolishly.</p><br/><p>Eventually, I patted the sand off my palms and sat on the ground. I pressed down Suyang\u2019s shoulders to make him sit next to me as well. Then, I placed my head against his shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second time is still so beautiful.\u201d I sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ocean looks beautiful regardless of when you see it.\u201d Suyang placed his arm on my shoulder. \u201cJust like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang\u2019s sappiness was making me uncomfortable. \u201cWhen did you learn how to say so much corny stuff? It\u2019s giving me shivers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shivering because the weather is cold. Not because my words are corny.\u201d Suyang inhaled and hugged me tighter. \u201cAside from watching the ocean, what else do you want to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just want to be silent at this moment. I like sitting here with you. It would be nice if we can be like this forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang was holding me so tightly that I could barely breathe. \u201cI think it\u2019s also pretty good. Why don\u2019t we come here daily then? Should we buy a house nearby? Face the ocean? Watch the seasons change?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have money?\u201d I gave Suyang a sideways glance.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always had a lot of money.\u201d Suyang gave me a kiss on the lips and replied like it was a matter of fact.</p><br/><p>\u201cPsssh!\u201d I shook my head. Then, I looked behind Suyang and my smile vanished. \u201cYou didn\u2019t bring the bag with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat bag?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d I rolled my eyes and stood back up. \u201cGive me your car keys. I\u2019ll get it myself. I prepared something special!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you trying to act mysterious?\u201d Suyang was skeptical as he handed the car keys to me. I caught it and quickly ran back to the car to take out the polaroid from the bag.</p><br/><p>I actually brought a box of photographic paper. Suyang and I barely had any photos together. I wanted to make use of today to take a bunch.</p><br/><p>On my way back, I noticed Suyang was sitting alone by the shore. He looked like a picture from a magazine. His back view gave off a cold and lonely feeling. Could he sense what was going on?</p><br/><p>I took a picture and placed it in my pocket before it had even developed. Then, I ran back like a child to show off my polaroid to Suyang.</p><br/><p>I must say, today, my energy level was 100%. It was as if I had regressed into a child.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the special item? What is it called again? Pararoid? Polaroid?\u201d Suyang took the polaroid from my hand and began to examine it.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop speaking nonsense and let\u2019s take a selfie to see the quality!\u201d I placed a photographic paper in the camera and then leaned against Suyang to take a picture.</p><br/><p><i>Darn it, every time Suyang and I were in the picture, it turned out defective</i>. I gave up on him and told Suyang to help me take an individual photo.</p><br/><p>I faced Suyang. With my back against the ocean, I had my hands around my mouth as I gathered all my strength and emotions to scream, \u201cThe person with the Su surname, I love you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you take the picture?\u201d After yelling, I ran back to check the photo.</p><br/><p>\u201cI pressed it a bit late. But this is not a video camera. Why were you suddenly confessing your love to me? It makes me feel weird\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Earlier I was the shy one. Now, it was Suyang\u2019s turn.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that photos can also record speech. From looking at the person\u2019s expression, you could tell what emotions they were feeling and what they wanted to express.\u201d</p><br/><p>After flinging the pictures for a long time, the photo was still not showing up. \u201cDid it run out of ink or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s take another one. Go and yell, \u2018I love Suyang\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn your dreams! I\u2019m not yelling anymore. I\u2019m tired.\u201d Then, I followed along the sandy shore and walked the other direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait for me! Why are you walking so fast today? You\u2019re supposed to be a patient\u2026.\u201d Suyang mumbled behind me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Now you know who has short legs!\u201d I joked. Then, I also made a face.</p><br/><p>Suyang spread out his arms and began running towards me. I quickly avoided it as I continued running.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>On December 17th, the weather was unusually nice. Early morning, I silently packed all my luggage. I left something on the coffee table and departed for City B.</p><br/><p>Ultimately, I never mentioned breaking up. I hoped that time will dilute everything and we\u2019ll be safe and sound respectively.</p><br/><p>I ended up burning all the pictures we took at the beach. I placed all the ashes in the metal box. On top, I left a note: <i>Let our past be ashes. If we\u2019re fated, perhaps one day we\u2019ll meet again when the flowers bloom. By then, I would\u2019ve started a new life. I hope everything goes well with you. Don\u2019t miss me.</i></p><br/><p>However, I still had the picture hidden in my pocket. It accompanied me to my destination.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The first thing that popped into my mind was that it was related to the teenager who rushed by me.</p><br/><p>So, I also ran towards the coffee shop. By the time I had arrived, it was already after the incident.</p><br/><p>The coffee shop was a complete mess. All the customers were gathered together at the corner, while Suyang had the teenager pinned down with his hands behind him. Shen Shaonu was anxiously kneeling beside Suyang while looking flustered and confused.</p><br/><p>As for Mi Fan, she was standing at a relatively safer spot. However, her face was white as she held onto her chest. It appeared she had gone through shock and wasn\u2019t fully healed yet.</p><br/><p>My eyes turned towards the *zzz* sound that was bubbling from the wine bottle. The bottle was shattered. If my guess was correct, it wasn\u2019t alcohol -but sulfuric acid.</p><br/><p>And his intended target was Mi Fan.</p><br/><p><i>Was this the person Shen Shaonu was talking about? </i></p><br/><p><i>How deeply must you loathe someone in order to want to splash sulfuric acid on her?</i></p><br/><p>Based on Shen Shaonu\u2019s expression, she probably had no idea the teenager was going to do something like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cCustomer, we have already called the police. This is considered an intentional harmful act. Customer\u2026. Are you hurt anywhere?\u201d A staff member walked towards Mi Fan and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d Mi Fan walked towards Suyang, \u201cHis target is me, so it is not a good idea for me to stay here. Perhaps we can continue our chat in the future, Author Su.\u201d</p><br/><p>After her statement, Mi Fan coldly left the scene. Her face was calm like nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bitch! Come back! I\u2019m going to kill you! Kill you!\u201d As Mi Fan departed, the teenager struggled and snarled with his eyes red.</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Zhengyang, are you insane? How can you do something like this?!\u201d Shen Shaonu shouted as she continuously punched the guy she referred to as \u201cLu Zhengyang\u201d.</p><br/><p><i>This wasn\u2019t the ending I was hoping for\u2026 everything happened so differently from my imagination. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cYou know him? Shaonu, this was your plan?\u201d Suyang yelled angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang brother\u2026 I didn\u2019t think something like this would happen. He is my friend. Can you please release him first?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! What if he goes insane again? We\u2019re remaining in this position until the police gets here!\u201d Suyang\u2019s face was dark. This was the first time I\u2019ve seen him like this. It was quite unnerving.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we not call the police? If the police comes, he might be detained as a criminal! Plus, Mi Fan has left. I don\u2019t think she is going to pursue charges. I can compensate the losses for the owner here!\u201d Shen Shaonu desperately pleaded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t something that I can decide. It depends on what the owner wants.\u201d Suyang indicated Shen Shaonu to go talk to the coffee shop owner.</p><br/><p>The result was that the talk failed\u2026</p><br/><p>At the end, the police arrived and took Lu Zhengyang away.</p><br/><p>Shen Shaonu was too concerned, so she left with them.</p><br/><p>As for me, I had to finally face Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Since Mi Fan wasn\u2019t injured, Suyang must have protected her. He had to protect her and restrain Lu Zhengyang at the same time. Fortunately, he didn\u2019t appear to have injuries.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Did you come with Shen Shaonu?\u201d Suyang didn\u2019t want to waste time and got straight to the point.</p><br/><p>\u201cI came because I was curious\u2026. I didn\u2019t know something like this would happen. ..\u201d I mumbled.</p><br/><p>Since Suyang was questioning me like this, it increased my guilt level. I lowered my head and didn\u2019t dare to make any eye contact with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a child fooling around. How can you also do the same?\u201d Suyang criticized me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know\u2026 I didn\u2019t know her friend would do something like this\u2026 it\u2019s my fault for not watching her carefully. I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you have sent a text message to me when you knew she was following me? If you weren\u2019t fooling around with her, then this wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d Suyang snapped as he dragged me out of the coffee shop.</p><br/><p>The moment we were out of the coffee shop, I flung his hand off me. \u201cAre you blaming me now? I already told you I didn\u2019t expect something like this to happen. Do you think it was within my control? How would I know the boy wanted to kill Mi Fan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that. But I feel like your actions are very immature. Because of you, Shen Shaonu, and the boy, Mi Fan was in danger. If I wasn\u2019t here to protect her\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t Mi Fan ok? If I could recall, she walked out of the coffee shop just fine!\u201d I didn\u2019t care that others were watching us as I screamed at Suyang, \u201cDo you think I called that crazy child? What does this have to do with me? If I had known this was going to happen, of course I would\u2019ve notified you! Haven\u2019t you known Shen Shaonu for years? Shouldn\u2019t you know her character well enough? Even her brother couldn\u2019t detain her, and you think I can? I feel like I came at the correct time for you to vent. It\u2019s not easy for you to find a woman you\u2019re interested in. But your assistant who lacked vision and two punks ruined it for you. So now you\u2019re in a bad mood, right? Sorry for ruining your future happiness!\u201d I bitterly shouted. I didn\u2019t know where I got the courage from, but I exploded and didn\u2019t leave a single word out.</p><br/><p>The more I said, the more wronged I felt. Tears continued to welled up in my eyes and I was no longer able to make eye contact with Suyang. I didn\u2019t care if he was still angry as I shoved through the crowd and left this suffocating place.</p><br/><p><i>That jerk! Asshole! </i></p><br/><p>I was upset at myself for crying over this. I cursed as I walked and kicked a discarded soda can. I pretended the soda can was Suyang and kicked it until it changed shape.</p><br/><p>After walking for a long time, I was exhausted.</p><br/><p>I went to a nearby park and sat on a swing. I was still boiling mad. I began to mutter to myself, \u201cI thought the child was going to play a joke. Who would\u2019ve thought he would be a madman carrying sulfuric acid? I am so unlucky! Why couldn\u2019t he think of why I was here instead?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Wait a second. Lu Zhengyang? Shen Shaonu\u2019s friend\u2019s name sounded very familiar! </i></p><br/><p>I spun around on the swings like a fried dough twist as I scrambled through my mind searching for his name.</p><br/><p><i>Lu Zhengyang? The rapist Lu Wenxue\u2019s son, Lu Zhengyang? </i></p><br/><p><i>I remember now! He was the son of the suspect, Lu Wenxue! That was the case that Mi Fan had reported! It was last year\u2019s rapist case that shook the entire nation!</i></p><br/><p>I remember his name because some disrespectful reporters had exposed the names of Lu Wenxue\u2019s family members as well.</p><br/><p>I was so overwhelmed with emotions that I lost control of my feet and began to spin around in circles on the swing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d Everything began to look very blurry and my world was spinning.</p><br/><p>I was so dizzy\u2026</p><br/><p>With great difficulty, I managed to stop. Fortunately, my train of thought remained. <i>Could it be that the reporter Mi Fan and the police revealed his father\u2019s sins, so Lu Zhengyang wanted to get revenge on Mi Fan? </i></p><br/><p>No. That can\u2019t be it. If that was the case, why would Shen Shaonu be on his side? From the degree of hatred Shen Shaonu had towards Mi Fan, the story can\u2019t be as simple as that.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, there was information I can use against Mi Fan!</p><br/><p>For some strange reason, this time I really wanted to find out what happened. People say women should not make life difficult for other women. But I purposely wanted to dig through her past and see what terrible things she had done to evoke such a deep hatred within Lu Zhengyang; to the point where he wanted to pour sulfuric acid over her\u2026</p><br/><p>Since I was still mad at Suyang, I remained out until it was dark.</p><br/><p>I watched my phone. There wasn\u2019t a single text message or call.</p><br/><p>From downstairs, I looked up at the apartment. The windows were dark. <i>Suyang wasn\u2019t home yet? It was so late. Where could he be?</i></p><br/>\n</div>"}

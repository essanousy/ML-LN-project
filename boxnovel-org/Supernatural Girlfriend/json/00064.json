He was wondering if he had fallen into some type of trap.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, really?\u201d I gave him an awkward brilliant smile. Deep down, I decided that I will never let him know the real reason why I want to find out Mi Fan\u2019s dark secrets. (It was because of my jealousy towards their date).</p><br/><p>After a brief moment of silence, I opened my mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m the type that\u2019s cold on the outside and warm on the inside. Also, I\u2019m very righteous\u2026.. So can you tell me what you and Shen Shaoqian have found out? Can you give me a brief summary of your findings?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy should I tell you?\u201d It appeared that Suyang wanted to purposely leave me with a cliffhanger as he turned to leave my room.</p><br/><p>I hurriedly ran to grab onto him, \u201cDon\u2019t go! If you didn\u2019t want to tell me, why would you have mentioned it? If you only say half of your sentence, then you\u2019re not being an upright gentleman!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have always been an upright gentleman.\u201d Suyang flung my hand away. His arrogant character had resumed. \u201cI never had the intentions of telling you from the start. Don\u2019t overthink.\u201d</p><br/><p>I pouted, \u201cYou\u2019re too unfair\u2026just tell me. Perhaps I can help out!\u201d</p><br/><p>I gave Suyang a flirtatious glance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is actually much more complicated than you might think. Her backup isn\u2019t someone we common people can come in contact with. The more you know, the more danger you will be in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how about you? If you\u2019re investigating, aren\u2019t you putting yourself in danger too?\u201d Once again, I seized him by the arm. This time, I used all my strength to ensure he cannot fling me off again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Suyang rubbed his chin as he thought about it. Then, he played it down. \u201cOk, it\u2019s not that dangerous. But how should I say it? I just don\u2019t want you to take part.\u201d</p><br/><p>I pretended to act cute as I made my voice all girly and whiney, \u201cBbbbb-osssss. Just tell meeeeee\u2026.!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop! How old are you? Why are you howling?\u201d Suyang made me shut up as he violently pulled me off of him. Then, he used his big red hand to push against my forehead, \u201cI need to sleep now. From now on, you\u2019re not allowed to think about the Mi Fan incident, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026.\u201d Since Suyang was so determined, I couldn\u2019t say anything else.</p><br/><p><i>No way! I\u2019m not the type of worker who wouldn\u2019t care about things if it was a matter of no concern to me. Plus, Suyang already said it might be dangerous. So that means I must help him!</i></p><br/><p><i>But if I don\u2019t know anything, how can I help\u2026..</i></p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Suyang interrupted my thought process as he accused, \u201cAre you thinking about it again? Stop it!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Could he read my mind?</i></p><br/><p>Before he left, Suyang was mumbling to himself, \u201cShould I find something\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Once the door was closed, my mind became clear again.</p><br/><p>I thought about my advantage. I could contact the dead Lu Wenxue and find out about things that others will never know.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t that a way to help Suyang? Also, originally, I wanted to grasp Mi Fan\u2019s tail using my own method.</p><br/><p>But the problem is, how can I see Lu Wenxue again? Last time I saw him, he was following Lu Zhengyang. As a father, even though he was dead, his child was the one he missed the most and couldn\u2019t let go of. That was why he was always by his side.</p><br/><p>So, I should go find Lu Zhengyang instead.</p><br/><p>But Lu Zhengyang wasn\u2019t that easy to locate either. Aside from his name and lots of fake news articles online, I didn\u2019t know anything else about him.</p><br/><p>The only connection we had together was Shen Shaonu. But I didn\u2019t have Shen Shaonu\u2019s contacts either.</p><br/><p><i>Shen Shaonu? Shen Shaonu? I recall seeing her name tag on her uniform\u2026 what was the name of her school again? </i></p><br/><p><i>I remember! It was Chengxin Female High!</i></p><br/><p>I smiled cunningly. <i>I will hunt Lu Wenxue down, layer by layer! </i></p><br/><p>When my cat Tom saw the evil expression on my face, he couldn\u2019t help but back away a few steps.</p><br/><p>The next day \u2013</p><br/><p>Chengxin Female High was our city\u2019s most extravagant female high school. So it turned out Shen Shaoqian\u2019s family was part of the invisible wealthy sect\u2026. I should\u2019ve known.</p><br/><p>All I had on me was 153rmb. That wasn\u2019t even enough to buy a sleeve of their school uniform. I knew I was categorized as the cheap broke type. After entering the school N times, I kept getting blocked by security. It was truly quite depressing.</p><br/><p>I told them I knew Shen Shaonu. Yet, they all \u201chumph\u201d and dismissed me.</p><br/><p>Since I couldn\u2019t get my way face to face, I decided to leap over the wall from the back.</p><br/><p>I patted the tree next to the school wall. \u201cWhen you\u2019re alive, you should attempt everything\u2026.\u201d Fortunately, I was relatively fit enough and managed to flip into the school yard.</p><br/><p>I was actually so proud of my perfect landing that I didn\u2019t pay attention to my surroundings. The first step I took, I accidentally slipped on an empty bottle and fell on my bottom.</p><br/><p>I rubbed my sore butt as I walked towards the school building. Inside, there were young girls around 18 or 19 of age. Each and everyone of them were wearing school uniforms. Their youthfulness was a slap to my \u201cauntie\u201d face.</p><br/><p>I entered the school building but I couldn\u2019t recall which class Shen Shaonu was in. I didn\u2019t even remember which grade she was in.</p><br/><p>But since Shen Shaonu was attractive, rich, and had a feisty personality, I was quite certain she was a known figure in the school. So, I randomly asked a girl next to me, \u201cExcuse me, do you know which class Shen Shaonu is in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShaonu? Third year, class B.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected\u2026everyone knew who she was.</p><br/><p>I arrived at the third year, class B room. From the outside, I immediately saw Shen Shaonu. I waved my hand, indicating for her to come out.</p><br/><p>She seemed surprised to see me. Then, she hesitated. Ultimately, she walked towards me. The first thing she said to me was, \u201cAuntie, why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s your auntie? Call me sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Shen Shaonu appeared unwilling, \u201cSo, why are you here, sister?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cObviously I came to find you. I want to see Lu Zhengyang. Help me out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you want to see Lu Zhengyang? Aren\u2019t you on Suyang brother\u2019s side? Was he the one who sent you here? If so, there is nothing to talk about. Whatever we choose to do is none of your business!\u201d Shen Shaonu suddenly began to attack me with her mouth cannons. Most likely, she had been wary of me since Lu Zhengyang\u2019s arrest.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop! I haven\u2019t said anything yet, and you\u2019re already creating scenarios in your head. I came without notifying Suyang. That day after I returned home, I thought about it very deeply. I decided I want to help you and Lu Zhengyang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to help us?\u201d Shen Shaonu wasn\u2019t as happy as I thought she would be. Her tone of voice was filled with disdain.</p><br/><p><i>Was she looking down on me? Ahhh! Hey missy! I can see Lu Wenxue! If you knew how amazing I was, I bet you would have tears and snots running down your face and you\u2019d be holding on my thigh begging me to help you! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cIs it because you don\u2019t believe I have the ability to help you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since I was so direct, Shen Shaonu no longer felt the need to hold back. She told me straight up, \u201cHonestly, sister, you\u2019re Suyang brother\u2019s assistant. In my opinion, you can\u2019t help us. Plus, Zhengyang doesn\u2019t want too many people to know about him. So\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand your concerns. But, your Suyang brother wants to date Mi Fan. Are you sure you don\u2019t want a spy to help you watch over them on a daily basis?\u201d I used the fatal bomb on Shen Shaonu.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

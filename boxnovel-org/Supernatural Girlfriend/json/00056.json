He walked towards Shen Shaoqian and nudged him with his foot, \u201cGet up. It\u2019s morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Based on Suyang\u2019s words, this wasn\u2019t the first time. No wonder\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d A low hoarse sound exited from the drunkard\u2019s throat. It sounded like it was sticking to his throat.</p><br/><p>I kindly gave Shen Shaoqian a cup of water. \u201cYou should be dehydrated. Here, drink this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Shen Shaoqian didn\u2019t open his eyes at all as he reached over to take the glass of water from my hand. Then, he began to drink the water while lying down. Actually, it looked like he was splashing water on his face instead\u2026</p><br/><p>That\u2019s still good. Perhaps, he will be more conscious now.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s eat breakfast first!\u201d</p><br/><p>After eating breakfast, I stood up while Suyang laid on the sofa. As for Shen Shaoqian, he sat on an individual seater as he cutely hugged a cushion and avoided my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you still remember what happened yesterday?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYesterday\u2026.I drank a lot of alcohol.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm hmmm, and then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then, I took a taxi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cContinue with your story!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Shaoqian gave me an innocent and sneaky Mona Lisa smile, \u201cAnd then, I\u2019m eating breakfast here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately after his statement, Suyang threw a cushion at him, \u201cSo you\u2019re saying\u2026. You forgot that you caused a ruckus in the middle of the night, and got on top of Goldfish?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean got on top\u2026.\u201d I was surprised, \u201cD-don\u2019t believe him. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, Shen Shaoqian appeared more shocked than I was. He leaned backwards and exclaimed, \u201cI got on top of her?! Oh God! How drunk did I have to be in order to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to say, huh? Shen Shaoqian comrade!\u201d I gritted my teeth. I should\u2019ve thrown him out the door while he was unconscious yesterday; regardless of how difficult it might\u2019ve been.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy head is still spinning. So don\u2019t get offended by what I say. Normally, I would only bother Suyang. I drank so much that I had forgotten you were living here too\u2026 sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing Shen Shaoqian\u2019s words, I gave Suyang a pitiful look.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that! You\u2019re not allowed to pity me.\u201d Suyang rolled his eyes, \u201cAlso, are you like this because of her? This time, were you cheated money or body?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Huh? Was it really a good idea to interrogate him like that in front of me? </i>But although it was awkward, I was too curious to leave. I wanted to stay to find out what happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was cheated money. 50k\u2026..\u201d Shen Shaoqian whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cCheated 50k!!!!!?!\u201d I yelled.<i> I thought Shen Shaoqian was smart! Yet, he was cheated money by women?!</i> Suddenly, I wanted to be his friend.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it happened once or twice, you can blame it on poor memory. But if it occurred more than ten or twenty times, that is your own fault.\u201d Suyang calmly replied. It seemed like he already knew what happened.</p><br/><p>But if he had been tricked over twenty times and he was still a victim, Shen Shaoqian was a true fighter. I\u2019m honestly interested to know how managed to live until today.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang, I came here because I actually really need your help\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure you didn\u2019t come here because you wanted to create a scene?\u201d I interrupted.</p><br/><p>Shen Shaoqian stared at me with no expression. After a long silence, I nodded and tactfully made the motion to keep my mouth shut.</p><br/><p>At times like these, I would suddenly feel that their relationship was very close. One of them already knew what the other person was thinking without the other having to say it.</p><br/><p>What was that called? Hearts linked?</p><br/><p>Normally, Suyang would refuse Shen Shaoqian before he even said a word. This time, it was the same.</p><br/><p>Suyang heartlessly stated the two words, \u201cNot happening.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaaaiii\u2026listen to me! This time, I promise it wouldn\u2019t be a request that will bother you! I\u2019m serious!\u201d Shen Shaoqian made a pledge.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What difficult request have you made in the past?\u201d I was nosy and wanted to know.</p><br/><p>\u201cA very difficult request!\u201d Suyang made firm eye contact with me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was it?! Can you tell me?\u201d My curiosity was evoked by Suyang. I blinked and blinked as I waited for him to continue.</p><br/><p>\u201cI had to share the same living space with the President of the woman\u2019s gossip association!\u201d Suyang pulled a face at me. I was so mad that I was turning red and green. He knew he had reached his goal.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d I waved my fist, thinking.<i> If we hadn\u2019t lived together, where would you have found such a diligent assistant with a lack of dignity (like myself) who allowed you to order her around? </i></p><br/><p>But I didn\u2019t end up saying those words. Because I knew if I had said it, Suyang would have a hundred lines to refute me. How could I beat him in a mouth battle\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, what is your request? Tell us. Suyang\u2026 no. My boss will think about it!\u201d Since he said I was the President of the woman\u2019s gossip association, I must live up to the title.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did I give you the power to help me make decisions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe!\u201d I laughed foolishly.</p><br/><p>Since I brought the question back, Shen Shaoqian gave me a look of gratitude. He cautiously began, \u201cA few days ago, your grandmother came to talk to me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Grandmother Meng?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cI knew it would be nothing good. I refuse!\u201d Suyang stood up. It appeared he wanted to return to his room. However, I blocked him. \u201cWait, you only heard the words \u2018grandmother\u2019. You don\u2019t even know what the issue is? You should hear the entire story before leaving!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Yixin. Don\u2019t you know that curiosity killed the cat?\u201d Suyang said to me.</p><br/><p>I pretended there was no evil in this world as I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know if curiosity killed the cat. But I do know curiosity could lead to lack of sleep!\u201d Then, I sat down next to Shen Shaoqian and pressed on.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what happened? Hurry and tell us. I\u2019ll help you persuade Suyang!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person involved is right here! Even if you\u2019re on my side, shouldn\u2019t we talk behind his back?\u201d Shen Shaoqian had a point, but it was too late.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe woman is a reporter. I\u2019ve seen her. She\u2019s intelligent, beautiful, and self-aware. She is your type.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Intelligent, beautiful and self-aware? Suyang\u2019s type? </i>My brain was trying to process the words. I came to a conclusion, \u201cYou want to go on a blind date?\u201d</p><br/><p>My voice was too loud. It almost cracked. Without knowing, I had pointed my finger at Suyang\u2026.I regretted it and quietly bent my finger back.</p><br/><p>\u201cIntelligent, self-aware, and beautiful is your type. Why are you trying to involve me?\u201d Suyang casually stated.</p><br/><p><i>Good job! </i>I shouted on the inside. <i>That\u2019s right! Reject him heartlessly and coolly!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah. I think you also know her. She\u2019s the reporter of last year\u2019s city-wide rape case, Mi Fan. And I remember you were very interested in the case when it surfaced. Didn\u2019t you want to speak to her at the time? This is your opportunity\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I secretly peeked at Suyang. He seemed to sway after hearing it was Mi Fan.</p><br/><p>My heart was screaming. <i>Suyang, don\u2019t go!!!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cMi Fan\u2026.\u201d Suyang lowered his head as he thought about it.</p><br/><p><i>You don\u2019t need to think about it! Just decline! Decline right away!</i></p><br/><p>Perhaps my eyes were too pressing; Suyang felt it and turned to me, \u201cWhat type of look are you giving me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? What look?\u201d I stared at the ceiling and avoided his glance, \u201cI just thought it was miraculous that you\u2019d be interested in blind dates, boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s at an age where he has to go on blind dates. Or else how would an otaku like himself ever find a girl?!\u201d Shen Shaoqian declared.</p><br/><p>Suyang was still thinking about it. After a long pause, he lifted his head and asked me, \u201cDo you think I should go or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does it have to do with me? This type of stuff is related to your life. How can I make the decision for you? But it looks like you are interested? Shen Shaoqian said you were curious about her in the past. Why not take this opportunity\u2026.\u201d The words were spilling out of my mouth, but I didn\u2019t mean a single word.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying, I should go?\u201d Suyang raised his brows at me.</p><br/><p><i>No no no no! Of course not! Oh God! Who can give me a legitimate reason to tell Suyang why he shouldn\u2019t go?</i></p><br/>\n</div>"}

He wasn\u2019t wearing this earlier\u2026don\u2019t tell me he purposely went home to change into the sportswear to come here?!</p><br/><p>I stopped tidying up and ran towards Suyang, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a question I should be asking you. Why are you here? Is it because you\u2019re unsatisfied with being my assistant, so you have decided to come become an assistant for a school association? I\u2019m not enough trouble for you?\u201d Suyang was walking towards me, step by step. On his way, he helped me picked up a basketball.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you jealous because I\u2019m an assistant for someone else? Don\u2019t worry, you are very annoying! No one can threaten your annoying position! Don\u2019t be anxious!\u201d I was praising him on the surface, but dissing him below. I reached my hands over to take the ball from Suyang.</p><br/><p>But Suyang didn\u2019t hand me the ball. Instead, he made a beautiful three-point shot in front of me. He proudly lifted his chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re clearly already 25 years old, yet you\u2019re wearing sportswear like you\u2019re a young lady. Do you think you can turn back to eighteen by dressing young? You\u2019re at this age but you\u2019re still chasing after a bunch of kids. Usually, whenever I ask you to do something, you always complain you\u2019re tired. Yet, you have energy for the basketball association? I guess I treat you too well\u2026 at this rate, this is not acceptable. I must increase your workload!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Was he still angry about what happened during lunch time? He wouldn\u2019t stop rambling\u2026.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cLet me ask you, is it because you want to look at hot guys? Is that the reason why you want to be a lousy assistant?\u201d Suyang was beginning to ask a bunch of ridiculous questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cProfessor Su, if you\u2019re going to continue acting this way, I\u2019m going to conclude you\u2019re jealous. But we\u2019re clearly not in that type of relationship where you have the right to be jealous\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, I\u2019m not your Professor. I\u2019m your boss. And your boss is telling you that he is also very good at basketball. Want to see?\u201d Suyang picked up a basketball and held it in between his waist. Then, he shifted his leg and acted very cocky.</p><br/><p>Before I could decline, he made another three-point shot and scored. Currently, his expression could totally be described as a dog catching a frisbee, and then turning excitedly to its owner with a \u201cHurry, praise me! Praise me!\u201d look.</p><br/><p>I hopelessly smiled as I was thoroughly defeated by Suyang\u2019s childishness. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this is the reason why you purposely went home to change into sportswear?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I do not have sportswear at home. I bought this now. The store representative said this is the current style of the year. It has a 3D dual ability to ventilate and separate ultraviolet rays. Under the scorching summer heat, it can\u2026..\u201d Suyang calmly replied as he recited the brainwashing advertisement the salesperson told him.</p><br/><p>It was even more absurd than going home to change.</p><br/><p>I have to admit defeat. What type of man would do something so outrageous? He was evoking my curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cWant to play a round?\u201d Suyang began to jump up and down in front of me. A 27 years old uncle was trying so hard to prove how active he could be. Wow, what a sad sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know how to play basketball.\u201d I firmly refused.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m commanding you, as your boss, to play a round with me.\u201d He demanded.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, stop trying to tease me\u2026if you want to play, you can play by yourself. If worse comes to worse, I\u2019ll be your audience and clap for you. That way, you won\u2019t feel lonely. Okay?\u201d I robotically clapped and coaxed him like I was speaking to a child.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll play five rounds. Whoever that is first to score three times wins. If I win, you have to promise me one thing. If you win, I will fulfill one of your wishes. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>I gave him an icy face, \u201cWe haven\u2019t played yet, and I already knew I lost. State what you want directly. You\u2019re the boss, stop acting so suave. As your employee, I have to listen to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo on a date with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI refuse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, we\u2019ll play. If I win\u2026.\u201d Suyang began to repeat himself again. He was like a loop.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop talking! Fine, we\u2019ll play. But under my rules.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, what rules?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d I thought about it very deeply. I needed to think of something that would absolutely benefit me, yet it couldn\u2019t be that obvious. \u201cYou will stand behind the 3-point line and cover one of your eyes to shoot. I will stand on the free throw line and shoot normally. You start, and we will alternate. Whoever that scores five baskets first is the winner. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is so unfair to me!\u201d Suyang refuted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can use your skills to make up for it. Why can\u2019t you lend an eye for a 25 years old who has never played basketball in her life?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang nodded and agreed to my words, \u201cFine, we\u2019ll do it your way. But don\u2019t forget. If you lose, you must promise to go on a date with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>I coldly laughed as I said with an undefeatable determination, \u201cIf I win, you have to give me a raise!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long have you been my assistant for? You\u2019re always asking for a raise\u2026so indecent.\u201d Suyang rolled his eyes at me in a displeased manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cMoney\u2026the more the better!\u201d I beamed.</p><br/><p>Suyang went first. It may seem simple covering an eye, but for most people who are accustomed to using both eyes on a daily basis, this was definitely not easy.</p><br/><p>As expected, he failed to score the first basket. I clenched my fist and happily squealed on the inside.</p><br/><p>For my first basket, I shifted the ball left to right many times before I shot. Although it was the first time I had played basketball, I probably had an innate talent because I managed to score!</p><br/><p>The game had just began, but I was already a point ahead of Suyang.</p><br/><p>However, he was able to adjust very quickly. He managed to score the other four tries.</p><br/><p>When it was my fifth turn, I knew as long as I get the ball in, I would win. I had managed to score all four baskets earlier. Why was I so good? Surely I was talented in basketball!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I win, I get a raise!\u201d I made a scary face as I laughed hysterically. I felt more powerful than Suyang, \u201cMuahahahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang was sweating as he gave me a look of disdain, \u201cIs that all you can think about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate the power of money!\u201d I shouted. Then, I bent my waist and narrowed my eyes to look at Suyang. He was so nervous that he couldn\u2019t stop pressing his lips together.</p><br/><p>I slyly smiled at the basketball hoop and threw my last ball. This ball will determine my victory!</p><br/><p>*Clang*. My basketball striked against the hoop and made a very loud bang. Then, it directly bounced the opposite direction of the net.</p><br/><p>\u201cDarn it!\u201d I walked away from my spot in a very irritated manner as I roughly picked up the ball and threw it at Suyang.</p><br/><p>On the contrary, the silent Suyang was now very excited. He threw his last ball, and the basketball entered the net and landed swiftly on the ground; declaring his victory.</p><br/><p>*Dong dong!* It was as if my heart was beating the same frequency.</p><br/><p>\u201cRawr!!! You lost!!! \u2026.now you must do as I say. This weekend, we\u2019ll go on a 24 hours date.\u201d Suyang enthusiastically danced in front of me. He was acting all smug and not his age at all. So childish!</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really have to act like this? You only beat me\u2026.\u201d I picked up the basketball and exerted all my strength as I threw it at Suyang. I unleashed all my frustrations and anger in my throw. Sadly, he managed to avoid it.</p><br/><p>On the other side, I sat on the ground and acted very pitiful and shameless. I requested a rematch.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! No!\u201d Suyang waved his finger, \u201cEven if we have a rematch, you will lose. For your pride\u2019s sake, I\u2019m not agreeing to it. This is called protecting the player.\u201d</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t able to conceal my smile. The corner of my mouth curved upwards without my control. I made a snickering sound; fortunately, Suyang didn\u2019t notice because he was busy living in his boundless praise.</p><br/><p>Well, now that I had gone to these efforts, it wasn\u2019t that apparent, was it? <i>My wish to go on a date with Suyang\u2026</i></p><br/>\n</div>"}

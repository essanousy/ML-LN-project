He appeared weaker than I had imagined. He was very pale and his body was thin and flimsy.<i> Was it due to the bone marrow surgery? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cHi, my name is Lin Yixin. Today, I\u2019m here because of Principal Lu Wenxue. Do you still remember him?\u201d</p><br/><p>*Bang*. Xuduo quickly ducked back into his apartment and forcefully slammed the door. While the door was in motion, the wind blew and my hair stuck onto my face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know any Lu Wenxue. Please leave!\u201d Xuduo yelled from the inside.</p><br/><p><i>He refused to see me and locked me out? </i></p><br/><p>My fingers were fidgety as I fumbled with the button on my shirt. This was not what I had expected\u2026</p><br/><p>I got rid of the hair that was sticking on my face as I knocked again, \u201cMr. Xu, I am not here to force you to do anything. I just want to have a talk with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>But regardless of how many times I knocked, Xuduo seemed to have disappeared. There wasn\u2019t a single sound coming from within. It was as if he was fearful of the words \u201cLu Wenxue\u201d.</p><br/><p>I regretted making my intentions clear so early\u2026.at this rate, this will not do. It appeared that he will not open the door for me today. I can\u2019t waste all my time on him.</p><br/><p>I sighed deeply and noticed a half transparent old granny attentively watching me from the stairs. It was a ghost, and I couldn\u2019t pretend not to see her. So, I smiled and slightly bowed at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d Suddenly, someone spoke up. I thought it was the old granny as I hastily lifted my head. But it was a gentle looking woman who was holding a food basket in one hand. She kindly asked, \u201cAre you here for Xuduo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmmm\u2026yes\u2026you are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m his girlfriend. My name is Xiaoai. What\u2019s wrong? No one answered the door? When I left, he was still at home. Perhaps he had stepped out?\u201d Xiaoai took out her keys and was about to open the door, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come in and take a seat while you wait for him to return.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I prevented Xiaoai from opening the door. If she opened the door now, it would put me in a bad position. Instead\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf possible, could we speak first? My name is Lin Yixin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to speak to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Xiaoai took me to a nearby cafe. She seemed a bit anxious as she sat across from me. She kept rubbing her hands together. Every time she appeared to want to say something, she would hesitate. Her behaviour was making my heart unstable.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and suggested, \u201cIf there is something you want to say to me, go ahead!\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, her face turned red as she asked, \u201cAre you Xuduo\u2019s lover? Are you here to take him away from me?\u201d</p><br/><p>*Pu* I choked on my coffee so hard that I saw stars. *cough cough*. \u201cI\u2026..oh my goodness, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d *cough cough* She instantly handed me a tissue to wipe my mouth.</p><br/><p>I must explain immediately before she imagined worse things in her mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not that type of person. Today, I merely came for Xuduo. Since you\u2019re his girlfriend, have you heard of a person named Lu Wenxue?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Wenxue?\u201d After hearing his name, Xiaoai\u2019s eyes teared up and tears began to fall. She looked so pitiful, \u201cAre you talking about Teacher Lu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry! What\u2019s wrong? Was it something I said?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>I was concerned. Why was she so emotional? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m also Teacher Lu\u2019s student. Xuduo and I both came from the mountains.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Suyang only gave me information on some of Lu Wenxue\u2019s influential students. There wasn\u2019t anything about the average student Xiaoai, so I wasn\u2019t aware\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why are you crying just because I mentioned your teacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiaoai clutched my hand as she took a deep breath, \u201cBecause I have always believed that Teacher Lu was innocent. I was his student. He had always treated us wholeheartedly. I don\u2019t know what happened, but I know Teacher Lu\u2019s character. He is definitely not the beast that everyone thinks he is!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiaoai\u2019s words made my heart turn warmer. Although she wasn\u2019t very successful nor had much power, at least she was a student that trusted Lu Wenxue.</p><br/><p>Perhaps I could understand why Lu Wenxue wanted to remain in such a poor and remote place for years.</p><br/><p>Now, I was the one holding onto Xiaoai\u2019s hand, \u201cThank you for believing in him. If Teacher Lu could hear your words, I\u2019m sure he would be very touched.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut not all students think this way\u2026. Xuduo\u2026. He\u2026..\u201d Xiaoai lowered her head as disappointment flashed through her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cXuduo, he\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiaoai gave me an account of what happened to Xuduo:</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter the news came out about Teacher Lu, many work unit said that students of Teacher Lu were indecent people. So, his co-workers began to push Xuduo aside and exclude him. There was a period of time when he went through depression because of this. He actually went to see a psychiatrist for help. But ever since he donated his bone marrow to help the sick child, his co-workers have treated him a lot better. They\u2019re no longer against him and treats him as a good person who saved a life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that Xuduo\u2019s real reason for saving the child was to alter the biases people had of him due to Teacher Lu?\u201d I testingly asked.</p><br/><p>Xiaoai didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>My guess was correct.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then he must really hate Teacher Lu? No wonder\u2026.\u201d I had no idea that the problem would be so severe on Xuduo\u2019s side. I touched the rim of my coffee cup and finally made up my mind.</p><br/><p><i>Even if I could not convince Xuduo to help us, I want to at least get rid of the misunderstanding he had of Lu Wenxue. If I leave it without doing anything, both Xuduo and Lu Wenxue will suffer. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cXiaoai, actually, earlier I saw Xuduo. But due to the misunderstanding he had about Teacher Lu, he probably won\u2019t open the door for me again. But no matter what, I want to see him once more. There\u2019s something I have to say to him. Could you help me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026.. I can try, but I can\u2019t guarantee\u2026.\u201d Xiaoai agreed to my request, but wasn\u2019t sure if it will be successful.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You don\u2019t have to force it. Just try your best.\u201d</p><br/><p>So, for now, I\u2019m temporarily letting Xiaoai deal with Xuduo.</p><br/><p>Now, I have Mo Xiaotian and Ye Lili left. They were both high profile people that were difficult to meet.</p><br/><p>The chances of encountering Mo Xiaotian was so low. Sources say that ever since she had gotten married, she was a full time wife of a rich and powerful family. She rarely left the house.</p><br/><p>As for Ye Lili, she was always rushing around with rich people\u2019s problems. There wasn\u2019t any trace of her.</p><br/><p>While I was sulking, Suyang called.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I said out of despair.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m underneath Xuduo\u2019s building. I had a face to face interaction with him earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWere you able to convince him?\u201d</p><br/><p>I hesitated. <i>Should I tell Suyang what happened? But if I do, would I seem very useless? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it didn\u2019t go as smoothly as I thought it would. He is very resistant. I\u2019m trying to think of a solution right now\u2026. Oh yeah, in terms of Mo Xiaotian and Ye Lili, I have no idea how to get to their circles. It is very difficult\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about those two. I have figured it out. Just put your focus on Xuduo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve figured it out? What do you mean?\u201d My eyes instantly lit up; as if I had discovered a new glimmer of hope.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a charity event party tonight. They will both be attending. I also happened to receive an invitation. So don\u2019t worry, I will take the responsibility to convince the both of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang was about to hang up the phone, but I yelled to stop him, \u201cAi ai ai!!! Wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to go to the charity event party alone? You don\u2019t need a female partner?\u201d I asked. I hope Suyang could understand what I was trying to say.</p><br/><p>My internal heart was screaming.<i> Bring me! Bring me too! I want to go too!!!!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. I\u2019ll be attending with Mi Fan.\u201d Suyang flatly replied.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Then, I was flabbergasted. But since he was trying so hard, I had to suppress my urge to roast his skills.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere.\u201d With great difficulties, he managed to unpeel one apple and delivered it to my hand.</p><br/><p>Originally, I would\u2019ve needed two hands to hold onto this huge apple, but now, I could pick it up with two fingers\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I took a bite. Although most of the apple was missing, it was still quite sweet.</p><br/><p>The sweetness went straight to my heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cPssssh..!\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, Shen Shaoqian was the person who shattered the perfect atmosphere between me and Suyang. That guy seriously lacked the ability to make discerning judgments.</p><br/><p>Currently, he had his two hands crossed in front of his chest as he leaned his back against the window. He looked like a bum as he shook his short legs.</p><br/><p><i>Why was he wearing those pants? It made it seem like his legs were only 30 cm long. </i></p><br/><p>Suyang was putting all his focus on peeling another apple. He didn\u2019t have time to pay attention to Shen Shaoqian.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, are you two officially together? Let me tell you. You\u2019re the second person that Suyang has peeled an apple for! Do you feel honoured?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! The first one was\u2026.\u201d Before Shen Shaoqian could finish his sentence, Suyang threw the incomplete apple at him. But Shen Shaoqian caught it.</p><br/><p><i>Actually, thrown wasn\u2019t the correct term. It was more like, smashed. </i></p><br/><p>Since Suyang didn\u2019t allow Shen Shaoqian to continue, it evoked my curiosity. I asked, \u201cThe first one was\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Shaoqian displayed his bitten apple. \u201cOnly the skin part could be eaten from Suyang\u2019s apples. Do you see this? This is the legendary Su weapon! If I continue talking, my life will be in danger. A wise man submits to his circumstances!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>What a way to ruin my appetite\u2026</i></p><br/><p>I made a pouty expression as I glared at Suyang with a determined look that conveyed, \u201cWho was the first person? Tell me now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing me like this, Suyang finally put down the knife in his hand and sighed, \u201cI\u2019m really no match for you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I secretly beamed. I thought he was finally going to tell me.</p><br/><p>Suyang made a hand gesture; indicating he wanted me to lean over towards him.</p><br/><p><i>So, I tilt my head and pushed my ear towards his direction. But who would have expected Suyang to grab onto my ears with both his hands as he fixated my head and gave me a kiss on the lips?! </i></p><br/><p>*cough cough*. After Suyang released me, I heard Shen Shaoqian\u2019s awkward coughing. He must have choked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I was also surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you pouting because you wanted a kiss?\u201d Suyang calmly responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not! I wanted you to tell me who the first person was! How could you\u2026.\u201d I had one hand on my face and one hand fanning my face.</p><br/><p><i>So strange. Why was it suddenly so hot in here?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cThis is not a place for a single dog like me. I\u2019m leaving\u2026!\u201d Shen Shaoqian\u2019s voice sounded a bit broken. Poor guy.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving already?\u201d Although I was saying this, deep down, I had no desire to keep him around. Suyang was the same. Except, he was too lazy to even say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this how you treat a friend who came from distant parts to deliver a gift? As a friend, I\u2019m absolutely heartbroken. This is too sad!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGift? What gift?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang hasn\u2019t told you? He has a surprise for you!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Surprise?!</em> My eyes lit up. They were filled with hope.</p><br/><p>\u201cShaoqian\u2026.\u201d Suyang slowly said his name.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it a surprise if you\u2019re telling her? Didn\u2019t I warn you to keep your mouth shut?\u201d Suyang gritted his teeth. The atmosphere couldn\u2019t get lower than this. I could see Shen Shaoqian\u2019s pupils diffusing.</p><br/><p>Shen Shaoqian was always so dramatic. It was as if he was acting in a drama and his punishment was death.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh\u2026 did you really say so?\u201d Shen Shaoqian carefully took a step away. One step\u2026 two steps\u2026 he was walking like a crab. It appeared he was planning to escape before Suyang went nuts.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat surprise? Since he has already mentioned it, tell me! Tell me!\u201d I exclaimed as I grabbed and shook Suyang\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>Suyang sighed again. Using the exact same tone from earlier, he said, \u201cI guess I have no choice\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>I released him right away and covered my mouth. I didn\u2019t want him to make the same move from before.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Suyang rubbed my head as he stood up and headed towards Shen Shaoqian\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro! I didn\u2019t leak on purpose! I forgot\u2026.\u201d Shen Shaoqian tried to lie out of desperation. He thought Suyang was going to beat him up.</p><br/><p>Instead, Suyang lightly patted his back and said, \u201cLet\u2019s bring it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the two of them left the ward.</p><br/><p>Initially, I thought Suyang was going to let Shen Shaoqian off. But within three seconds, I heard a sharp scream from the hallway.</p><br/><p>I should\u2019ve expected it! I coldly humph and silently thought to myself, \u201cDisturbing patients from resting\u2026 humph! I don\u2019t know those two! I don\u2019t know those two!\u201d</p><br/><p>I waited in my room for a long time. I was sitting in a lotus position as I continuously reached out my neck out to see when they would return.</p><br/><p><i>What surprise could it be? I was so excited! </i></p><br/><p>While I was racking my brain trying to guess what Suyang was going to give me, another visitor showed up.</p><br/><p>Shen Shaonu\u2019s head suddenly popped up from the corner. Her eyes were wide open as she looked around the room like a deer. At the end, her eyes landed on me and she smiled, \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShaonu?\u201d I was surprised. I didn\u2019t expect her to come visit me. \u201cCome in! Your brother and Suyang just left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang brother just left? Which direction did he go?\u201d Shen Shaonu asked with her eyes opened wide. If I told her where, she would probably instantly dash and run to find him. Yes, she was someone that would do such a thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He said he was going to get something.\u201d I waved at her, \u201cAren\u2019t you here to see me? Why are you asking about Suyang? Come here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Shaonu shook her head, \u201cI didn\u2019t come to see you. I came to see Suyang brother. But someone else came to see you!\u201d Then, Shen Shaonu pushed a familiar person from behind the walls into my sight of vision.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhengyang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Zhengyang was forcefully revealed, he looked very embarrassed and cute.</p><br/><p>\u201cOk, you two can chat. I\u2019m going to go look for Suyang brother!\u201d Then, Shen Shaonu disappeared like smoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the first time you\u2019ve seen me? Why are you standing there? Come here!\u201d I acted like an older sister as I patted to the seat next to my bed.</p><br/><p>Lu Zhengyang obediently came over. He no longer had an angry resentful face; as if people had owed him five million dollars. Now, Lu Zhengyang had a youthful sunshine aura like a teenager should.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026. Also, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t expect this to be his first line. I was a bit confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you sorry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were hurt because of my dad\u2019s case\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh, that silly child! I smiled and took an apple from a basket as I handed it to Lu Zhengyang. \u201cIf you\u2019re very apologetic, please peel an apple for me to eat!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

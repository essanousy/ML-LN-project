I conveniently kicked an abandoned soda can into the garbage bin. I was shocked.</p><br/><p><i>What? Could I be gifted with soccer ability? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cIs there anything else you would like to say?\u201d Before I could snap out of my haze, Suyang asked on the phone.</p><br/><p>I paused and headed towards the garbage bin to check, \u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to say..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk. I\u2019m hanging up.\u201d The phone went *duut*</p><br/><p>I stared at my cell phone and coldly humph as I had one hand on the garbage bin and spoke to it, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter! It doesn\u2019t matter! He\u2019s only getting close to Mi Fan to solve this case! I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m fine\u2026. My pride is definitely not hurt\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>I must keep my heart calm and collected in order to comfort myself.</p><br/><p><i>If Suyang wasn\u2019t bringing me, then\u2026.</i></p><br/><p>Since technology had advanced so much, I could finally take advantage of it. With just a few clicks, I was able to find the location of the extravagant venue and the time it was taking place.</p><br/><p>The venue was at Chairman Jicheng\u2019s hotel.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t let me go? Well, I\u2019m going to go regardless!\u201d I silently made up my mind.</p><br/><p>The Sun hadn\u2019t set yet, but I was already on my way.</p><br/><p>Chairman Jicheng\u2019s hotel business was one of the leaders in the industry. He owns hundreds of large scale hotels. Yet, tonight\u2019s event happened to take place at the furthest villa.</p><br/><p>I had my hands on my waist as I loudly panted and stared at the continuous curved mountain road ahead of me. If I had known it would be such an obstacle, I wouldn\u2019t have came\u2026</p><br/><p>While I was on the way, there were a few cars that had passed by. But not a single one stopped for me. This was truly a cold world indeed.</p><br/><p>In addition, there wasn\u2019t even a bus option nearby. After climbing nearly two hours of mountainous road, I could finally see the hotel from where I was.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, just as I was about to give up all hope, it appeared. My head was spinning. I was so exhausted that I felt like I was about to report to the next world.</p><br/><p>I used the last bit of my strength to entered the hotel. The moment I arrived at the lobby, I fell onto the sofa without any regards of my appearance.</p><br/><p>The lobby was decorated very gloriously. It was so bright that it hurt my brain.</p><br/><p>While I was resting, I saw a group of people following a woman dressed in black attire. They were neatly lined up and walking by me. I was quite sure they were the servers of tonight\u2019s event.</p><br/><p><i>If I couldn\u2019t enter without an invitation, I should follow them\u2026</i></p><br/><p>I forced myself to stand up as I lowered my head. I pretended nothing was wrong as I followed behind them. I wanted to see where they were going and then find an opportunity to sneak in.</p><br/><p>The last woman in the line was walking very strangely. She was right in front of me, but from time to time, she would pause and stop.</p><br/><p>Soon, she couldn\u2019t keep up with the line as she stood next to me. But no one in the front noticed because they were too focused on walking forward.</p><br/><p>Just as the woman was about to lose consciousness, I reached out to catch her and I whispered, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026.\u201d The woman was so weak. She couldn\u2019t even speak.</p><br/><p><i>Okay! You\u2019re the chosen one!</i></p><br/><p>I dragged the weak woman into the washroom and while she was unconscious, then I switched clothes with her.</p><br/><p>I felt my new outfit as I sighed. <i>Who would\u2019ve thought that there would come a day where I would take another outfit from a woman in the washroom. You truly never know what you will experience in your lifetime.</i></p><br/><p>I quietly comforted the unconscious woman, \u201cSorry for taking your clothes. But don\u2019t worry, someone will come save you soon. Don\u2019t be scared.\u201d</p><br/><p>I ran out of the washroom and pretended I was in a lot of distress as I ran towards the counter with those unfamiliar heels. I yelled at one of the staffs, \u201cOh no! Oh no! One of our customers has fainted in the washroom on the first floor!\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, all the staffs that were present ran towards the washroom. Everywhere was bustling with activity. I chose to leave in the midst of the chaos.</p><br/><p>I purposely hid at a corner until the event was just about to start. Then, I did fifty squats to make my face appear flushed. I had to create the image that I was very out of breath.</p><br/><p>After that, I hastily stood up from the corner and ran straight towards the entrance for the VIPs.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! You\u2019re not allowed to enter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a security guard appeared out of nowhere and blocked my path.</p><br/><p>I stomp on my feet like I was in a rush, \u201cBig brother, please please please! Let me go in! I\u2019m one of the servers of tonight\u2019s event!\u201d I flashed the girl\u2019s name tag.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a specific entrance for servers. This entrance is exclusively for VIPs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, I had an emergency earlier! So I lost my group\u2026if the manager knows I wasn\u2019t with them, I will get fired! I\u2019ll only get away with it if I sneak in unnoticed!\u201d</p><br/><p>I began to unleash my watery big puppy eyes at the two security guards. I could tell one of them were wavering. He looked at his partner.</p><br/><p>But the other guy remained unmoved.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother! You know how difficult life is. It was so hard for me to get this job. If I get fired, I don\u2019t know how I will survive. I\u2019m begging you! Just help me once. After the event is over, I will definitely repay you two!\u201d I clasped my hands together and begged.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the alarm I set ahead of time began to ring.</p><br/><p>I pretended to pick up a call as I turned around and continued my act:</p><br/><p>\u201cHello? Sister? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You need money? Mom has already completed her surgery. Why do you need money again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already told you not to get a job! You\u2019re only in Grade 9! You need to focus on your studies! Older sister will earn the money!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already told you I\u2019m doing overtime tonight. I will be able to make a lot today. Afterwards, I\u2019ll rush to the hospital and pay the bills. Just tell the doctor to wait a bit!\u201d</p><br/><p>I lowered my cell phone and looked tearfully at the two security guards.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiaowu, my eyes kind of hurt. Can you come to see if sand had entered? Help me blow on it.\u201d Suddenly, the emotionless security guard opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d His partner was still slow and confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you to come over to tell me blow sand out! My eyes hurt and I can\u2019t see! I can\u2019t even see who\u2019s entering this entrance\u2026..\u201d The guy dragged his partner on one side and allowed me to enter.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d I gave the two men a deep, sincere bow. Then, I was inside the venue.</p><br/><p><i>Haha! Suyang! When you see me, you\u2019re going to shake! I proudly flung my hair. I will definitely convince Mo Xiaotian and Ye Lili!</i></p><br/><p>This was just the beginning.</p><br/><p>I have successfully accomplished my first step.</p><br/><p>I glanced around the room. At my 3 o\u2019clock direction, I saw a chubby man holding onto a sexy, gorgeous woman. He seemed to be very satisfied.</p><br/><p>At my 6 o\u2019clock direction, there were two women who were dressed quite alike as they smiled and gave each other icy looks. It seemed like a battle of the auras.</p><br/><p>At my 9 o\u2019clock direction, I noticed my first target, Mo Xiaotian. She was with her husband enjoying a very expensive wine.</p><br/><p>I walked directly to Mo Xiaotian and placed my tray near her.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

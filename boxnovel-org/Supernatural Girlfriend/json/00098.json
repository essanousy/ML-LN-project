There happened to be a bench for us to sit on. I went over and gestured Gao Jialan to sit down as well. After she was seated, I continued, \u201cI wanted to hear you lie. I wanted you to tell me that there is no relationship between you and the Wen clan. But I know I\u2019m just lying to myself. If you and the Wen clan have no relationship, why would Wen Yufan randomly appear in my living room? But what I don\u2019t understand is why, you, as the granddaughter-in-law of the Wen clan, are not on the news? I have never seen any reports about you. Also, what are you running from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan sighed as she lifted her head. She had a mocking expression on her face. \u201cDo you honestly think the Wen clan would allow an older woman with no background to be their granddaughter-in-law? An orphan? Yufan and I signed the marriage certificate secretly. Only the family is aware of this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Currently, I pictured Gao Jialan as Cinderella and Wen Yufan as the Prince.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to ask you the specifics. But the accident from a month ago\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYufan and I signed the marriage certificate this Spring. But two months ago, his grandfather suddenly brought Wen Yihan home and announced to everyone that he was his son. Although the company seemed to be functioning fine on the surface, all the family members were going nuts. Originally, Yufan and I had already moved out. But because of this issue, Yufan had to temporarily return home to help deal with the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWen Yihan is Wen Yufan\u2019s uncle, right? The illegitimate child!\u201d Thinking back to my brief encounter with that man, I began to shiver. It was obvious that he was a person who had been through a lot.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it is fate. Who would\u2019ve thought that the chairman would suddenly pop out an illegitimate child\u2026\u201d Gao Jialan\u2019s voice was turning lighter and lighter. I could barely hear what she was saying.</p><br/><p>Before I could ask, she continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfterwards, although the family members calmed down, my father-in-law suddenly became ill. He had a hard time accepting he had another brother. So, Yufan and my mother-in-law were going to take him to suburbs to recuperate. Who would\u2019ve thought that they would die in a car accident along the way\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan covered and face as she began to choke with emotions. She couldn\u2019t continue anymore.</p><br/><p>The death of Wen Yufan must have been a huge shock to Gao Jialan. By demanding for the truth, I had neglected the negative impact it may have on her. I was wrong. Now, I felt quite guilty\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry. If you don\u2019t want to say it, don\u2019t force yourself. I kind of understand now\u2026. Let\u2019s not talk about it! Let\u2019s not talk about it!\u201d I patted her on the back and wanted to change the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, the more I tell you, the more you\u2019ll know. But the more you know, the more danger you\u2019ll be in. Throughout history, the wealthy have always used the most ruthless tactics. My only wish is to quietly hide in your apartment for three months; until the waves are quiet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHide? Are you hiding from the family?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really think the car accident was an accident? Right after Yufan and his parents died, Wen Yihan took this opportunity to become the CEO of the company. For someone who is part of the family, I have no choice but to hide!\u201d Gao Jialan blurted.</p><br/><p><i>I\u2026. think I found out something I wasn\u2019t supposed to. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cJust out of curiosity, what happens if you are discovered by the Wen family?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan shook her head, \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u2026. right after Yufan\u2019s accident, I ran to escape. For the past month, I\u2019ve been hiding everywhere. Just as I was almost out of money, God led me to you!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>I was kind of confused. Something wasn\u2019t linking up\u2026</i></p><br/><p>\u201cSo the person who wants to capture you is the CEO, Wen Yihan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the most ruthless person I know. I honestly don\u2019t know what will happen if he finds me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeriously? Wait. Let\u2019s retract a few steps. Even if you\u2019re Wen Yufan\u2019s wife, the Wen family doesn\u2019t acknowledge your position. So what\u2019s the difference between you and an outsider? What\u2019s the point of Wen Yihan seizing you anyway?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan didn\u2019t immediately answer my question. She was deep in thought. After a long pause, she sighed and pulled my hand and placed it upon her stomach. She gravely stated, \u201cI am pregnant with Yufan\u2019s child.\u201d</p><br/><p>My fingers began to twitch, \u201cHuh? How many months\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has almost been three months. For my child\u2019s sake, I must not be caught by Wen Yihan!\u201d Gao Jialan strongly gripped my hand, \u201cIf he discovers me, he will definitely make me get an abortion!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree more months! After three months, my stomach will be stable. It will be a lot harder for him to deal with me then!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat nonsense are you spewing? If Wen Yihan wants to kill your child, why would it matter how long you\u2019ve been pregnant for? If the car accident wasn\u2019t an accident, do you think it would matter if your stomach gets a bit bigger?\u201d</p><br/><p>After analyzing, I began to feel very anxious. Suddenly, everyone around felt like enemies.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hurry and buy some clothes. Then, don\u2019t leave the apartment again!\u201d I hurriedly stood up and dragged Gao Jialan with me. I took her to a maternity store and bought a few outfits for pregnant women.</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan seemed stunned by my extreme change of attitude.</p><br/><p>My left arm was linked with Gao Jialan, while I carried the shopping bags with my right. On my way home, I was very anxious. I felt like an extra minute outside could lead to another accident.</p><br/><p><i>Why?! Why am I always the one who encounters these type of situations?</i></p><br/><p>When my hot bodyguard saw how fidgety I was, he floated towards me with astonishment in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now on, if strangers are nearby, you must let me know!\u201d I informed my ghost bodyguard.</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan gazed at the air in front of her and whispered, \u201cIs there\u2026something here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 it\u2019s a bit troublesome to explain. Please don\u2019t mind me.\u201d I hastily opened the door and pulled Gao Jialan in. Then, I locked us in.</p><br/><p>Suyang was already awake and wandering around the apartment. He had a popsicle in his mouth. \u201cI thought you kicked her out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it so cold in here?\u201d I was wearing short sleeves and I felt goosebumps on my arms.</p><br/><p>Suyang pointed at the air conditioner. \u201cI turned on the A/C.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d A/C was bad for pregnant women. So, I took the remote control from Suyang\u2019s hand and firmly turned it off.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom today on, no more A/C at home!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Suyang protested, \u201cIt\u2019s Summer! If there\u2019s no A/C, I\u2019m going to melt!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMelt? Do you think you\u2019re ice-cream? You can live without it for a month or two\u2026 plus you\u2019re eating cold stuff and getting blown by the A/C. Do you want to get sick?\u201d</p><br/><p>As I lectured Suyang, I handed the bags to Gao Jialan and spoke in a gentle tone, \u201cWe\u2019ve walked for a long time. You must be tired. Go rest first.\u201d</p><br/><p>After seeing Gao Jialan off, I solemnly stared at Suyang. He was licking the popsicle like a kitten. \u201cYou! From now on, you\u2019re not allowed to bully Gao Jianlan! She\u2019s not doing any of the household chores, understand? And give her the passcode to enter the apartment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang was concentrating on licking his popsicle. Then, he stared at me; stunned. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUghhhh\u2026.\u201d I rolled my eyes at him, \u201cHow old are you? How could you eat a popsicle so disgustingly? Gross\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Suyang purposely acted like a child as he jumped in front of me to demonstrate how to lick a popsicle.</p><br/><p>I shoved him away and headed towards his room, \u201cChildish\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoldfish\u2026.\u201d Suyang\u2019s mouth was dripping with green popsicle juice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang shook his head at me and exclaimed, \u201cWere you shocked by lightning while shopping? How could your attitude change 180 degrees? Should I remind you who was the one who kept bullying Gao Jialan in the first place\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to lecture me. Just remember, from now on, I will treat her well. You must do the same!\u201d I made a face at Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cWomen\u2026what a difficult species to understand. Your hearts are like the needles underneath the ocean floor. So hard to grasp!\u201d Suyang teased.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

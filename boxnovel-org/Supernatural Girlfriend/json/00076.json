I will follow you like this forever!\u201d All of a sudden, Shen Shaoqian went insane as he began to say a lot of gibberish, \u201cWhy are you breaking up with me? Is it because you\u2019ve met a more outstanding man than me? Get on the car and tell me the truth. Or else I will not give up! Tell me, how much is that man offering you?! I can also give you\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>What. The. Heck. Was. He. Talking. About?</i></p><br/><p>I felt the burning gazes of everyone around me as I dramatically shook my head and waved my hands, \u201cNo\u2026 I\u2026he\u2019s nuts\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like a lost cause regardless of how I explained. Before the situation worsen, I must depart. So I deeply sighed. I covered my face and lowered my head as I entered Shen Shaoqian\u2019s car.</p><br/><p>\u201cDrive!\u201d Currently, the most important thing was to get away from here. After Shen Shaoqian had gone a fair distance, I gave him the killer glare.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Shen Shaoqian gave me his charming smile. It was as if he totally disregarded his shameful behaviour from a moment ago.</p><br/><p>I took a deep breath and then uttered three words, \u201cStop the car.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Shaoqian pulled the car on the side and gave me a stiff smile.</p><br/><p>I smiled back in response and made eye contact with him for three seconds. Then, I quickly took off my seatbelt as I wrapped my hands around his neck and shook him, \u201cWhy did you have to say that? Don\u2019t you know that you\u2019ve successfully shaped me into a strange woman? What am I going to do if I encounter these people again? How am I going to live?! Ahhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>I roared as I tightened my grip.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was wrong! I was wrong!\u201d Shen Shaoqian showed me the whiteness of his eyes as he raised his hands to demonstrate that he was surrendering.</p><br/><p>Seeing how he was nearly unconscious, I loosen my grip and returned back to my passenger seat and straightened my disarrayed clothes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy must you say such misleading words?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy does it matter? It was just random people passing by. You don\u2019t know them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, I live around the area. You don\u2019t live around here, but I\u2019m in the same neighbourhood as them. Who knows whether I will encounter these people again? If they\u2019re spewing bad rumours about me, will you take responsibility?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Are you mad that people may mistaken you as a woman who loves money? Or are you mad that people may mistaken us for being a couple? If worse comes to worse, I\u2019ll just take you in as my girlfriend. If you\u2019re my girlfriend, I\u2019ll be taking responsibility, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>I gave Shen Shaoqian an expressionless face, \u201cAre you kidding me? Are you here to make jokes today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mad! Don\u2019t be mad! I\u2019m just kidding! I would never dare to touch you! If I have any sexual thoughts towards you, Suyang would cripple me!\u201d Shen Shaoqian gave me a sheepish smile. I felt like he was implying something.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026 I\u2019m just being upfront. You like Suyang, right? Why are you playing dumb? You two will eventually get together. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d Shen Shaoqian reassured me like an older brother.</p><br/><p>I was shocked. I thought Shen Shaoqian was a fool. Who would\u2019ve thought he could tell these things so clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did you find out I liked Suyang?\u201d Since he saw through me, I might as well be honest.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang is attractive, rich and outwardly cold but passionate on the inside. Isn\u2019t he the type that women find irresistible? So I assumed, as a woman, you would definitely fall for him too! But I didn\u2019t expect you to personally admit to it.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Damn it! I got tricked by Shen Shaoqian!?</i>! I didn\u2019t want to accept this cruel reality, so I leaned back against my front passenger seat as I began to envision my future. <i>This guy isn\u2019t going to tell Suyang, right? </i></p><br/><p>It was as if Shen Shaoqian could see through my thoughts. He smiled and reassured me once more, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t tell Suyang. But if you two get together, it would be great. At least, you\u2019re a good woman.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Why was he talking about this? It made me feel so embarrassed. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cAlso\u2026.\u201d Shen Shaoqian wasn\u2019t finished, \u201cMy standards aren\u2019t so low!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, your looks is the only thing that passed in my books. Your body failed. Your personality failed. Your family background failed. But don\u2019t worry, to the 27 years old otaku Suyang, what you have is already enough. After all, he doesn\u2019t have a perfect ideology like me. So, do you feel much better now?\u201d Shen Shaoqian patted my shoulder and gave me a motherly smile.</p><br/><p>As expected, Shen Shaoqian couldn\u2019t be likeable for more than three seconds. I really wanted to beat him up. He ignited smoke between us. If looks could kill, he would\u2019ve already been hacked into thousands of pieces.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful for you and Suyang\u2019s help.\u201d While I was giving him a dirty look, Shen Shaoqian changed the topic and spoke to me in a proper tone again. The way he kept changing back and forth made it difficult for me to adapt.</p><br/><p><i>Does he have multiple personalities or something?</i></p><br/><p>One of him was serious, another one was an offender, another one was a mind reader, and lastly, he also played stupid.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you doing this for Shaonu? You don\u2019t want your sister to go in battle alone, so you asked Suyang for help!? Deep down, you\u2019re a great brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I found it annoying how Shen Shaoqian kept switching personalities, I still treated him well.</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I a great brother?\u201d Shen Shaoqian massaged his chin as he thought about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Shennu is determined to help Lu Zhengyang no matter what. You know how dangerous the opposition is, so you want to secretly help and protect her, right? You\u2019re a good brother.\u201d I gave Shen Shaoqian a thumbs up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Shen Shaoqian took off his sunglasses and revealed his swollen eyes and dark circles.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to your face?\u201d I was shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking in your mind? How come I don\u2019t understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was saying you\u2019re a good brother\u2026. Unless those aren\u2019t your thoughts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course they\u2019re not! Don\u2019t blindly create conclusions in your head, ok?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Then you\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI asked Suyang for help because Shen Shaonu lied and took 50k from me to give to Lu Zhengyang. I will not give up until I get my 50k back! You see this?\u201d Shen Shaoqian pointed towards his eyes, \u201cThese days, the moment I recalled how my hard earned money was tricked and stolen away from a child, I couldn\u2019t sleep! I have been washing my face with my tears!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re saying you\u2019re only doing this for your 50k? Your eyes are like that because\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! Can you think of a better explanation aside from the 50k? That punk actually tricked her biological brother and gave a stranger money to spend. As her brother, I am devastated!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Well, seeing you like this, I am devastated Shen Shaonu has you as her brother. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cPsssh!\u201d I shook my head, \u201cI heard your family is quite well off. Why can\u2019t you let go of 50k? It shouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal for you, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the money issue, it\u2019s my pride! A man\u2019s pride!! Once we get to the bottom of this, watch me sort out that punk!\u201d Then, Shen Shaoqian stepped on his gas pedal.</p><br/><p><i>Man, I swear he suffers from male chauvinism. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Calm down! Don\u2019t be so emotional and slow down!\u201d The car was accelerating at a very high speed. I quickly put my seatbelt on as I tightly grasped onto the handrail.</p><br/><p>In a blink of an eye, we have arrived at Xuduo\u2019s neighbourhood.</p><br/><p>Since Shen Shaoqian drove at such an incredible speed, my stomach was surging. The moment he stopped the car, I rushed off and held onto a tree as I vomited air.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you need me to go up with you?\u201d Shen Shaoqian yelled from his car.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. Also, you can leave. I do not need to bother you, Master Shen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhh\u2026ok! Bye bye!\u201d Without any hesitation, Shen Shaoqian drove off like a wisp of a smoke.</p><br/><p><i>Wow, he sure was fast. When he arrived, he stuck to me like glue in order to monitor me and stop me from going to find Director Rui. Yet the moment he knew I had no intentions of doing so, he vanished. </i></p><br/><p>After I recuperated, I took out the profile from my bag and found Xuduo\u2019s home.</p><br/><p>From the outside, it looked like any ordinary home. It was average and didn\u2019t seem super extravagant.</p><br/><p>*Ding dong* *Ding dong* I pressed the doorbell twice. There was a male voice coming from within, \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Mr. Xuduo at home?\u201d</p><br/><p>The door slowly opened a crack and a man gazed at me suspiciously. \u201cI am Xuduo\u2026.who are you?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

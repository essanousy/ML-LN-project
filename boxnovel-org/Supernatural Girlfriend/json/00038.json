Why was she suddenly here again? Especially during this crucial moment\u2026my date with Suyang\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Suyang seemed to have sensed my strange behaviour.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Nothing. T-there seemed to be a mosquito in the car. It just flew by.\u201d I waved my arm; indicating for Xu Weishan to withdraw her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWere you bitten? I have an anti-swelling and itch cream in the car.\u201d Suyang said as he began to shift his arm to locate it for me.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. I wasn\u2019t bitten. I\u2019m fine.\u201d Then, from the rear mirror, I gave Xu Weishan an annoyed look. I wanted to condemn her and hoped she would figure out a suitable time to excuse herself.</p><br/><p>In my opinion, that suitable time was now.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t appear to want to leave, as she remain seated at the back with thick skin.</p><br/><p>Suyang continued to drive along the highway. Gradually, I began to see the coastline. Through the weak glow of the street lamps, I could see a distant beach ahead of us. I slightly opened the window and a salty breeze blew in. I could vaguely hear the sounds of sea waves.</p><br/><p>Could Suyang have\u2026.</p><br/><p>In the dark, Suyang finally stopped the car, \u201cWe have arrived. You may get off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I pulled my hand out to stop Suyang from taking off his seatbelt, \u201cDon\u2019t get off yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we\u2026.stay in the car for a bit longer?\u201d I pointed to the sky. \u201cThe stars are so beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang chuckled, \u201cI thought you wanted to say something else. You want to look at stars?\u2026.\u201d Suyang leaned over to me and unbuckled my seatbelt. Then, he slowly lowered my seat and opened the sunroof.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow you can have a clearer view.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm..\u201d From the tiny sunroof, I had a panoramic view of the entire starry sky. It was very clear and made the stars appeared extra dazzling. I could never experience this type of serenity in a city.</p><br/><p>At this moment, I felt like I could finally let go of all my problems and resentment.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s true that after we die, we turn into stars?\u201d I was feeling sentimental, and asked Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. After we die, we will become nothing.\u201d Suyang calmly replied. I wasn\u2019t satisfied with his response, so I gave him an annoyed glare for ruining the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>I could see ghosts. Grandmother Meng said most of the ghosts remain on Earth due to resentment. But sometimes, I was curious. After they disappear, where do they go?</p><br/><p>Was it what Suyang said? They turn into nothing? Or do they begin a new life elsewhere?</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a question\u2026..\u201d Suyang asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAsk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we watch from the outside? If we go out, we can see the entire sky.\u201d Suyang suggested.</p><br/><p>I tilted to the side as I shook my head at Suyang, \u201cIt is too chilly outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang seemed to accept my reasoning as he nodded. Then, he followed me and reclined down to gaze at the starry sky.</p><br/><p>His eyelashes were very long; his nose was straight and his lips were rosy. His side view was very attractive. I went from admiring the starry sky to admiring Suyang. I watched as he slightly opened his mouth. I had a feeling I knew what he was about to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t you think this place would be a good place to commit a crime? The criminal can easily conceal his tracks.\u201d</p><br/><p>I instantly felt my blood running cold as I sat up straight and stared at Suyang in astonishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was no one around. The coast light was faint. A man was chasing a woman who was running barefooted. The woman had her hands bound together, and the seashells had cut through the soles of her feet; leaving traces of blood. However, her will to survive allowed her to temporarily forget the pain. She continued running as she cried for help. But the only responses she received were the sounds of the crashing sea waves. There was an endless amount of darkness in front of her; as if she was going through another dimension. As she ran across the sandy beach, the woman gradually lost all her strength. She turned around and saw the man approaching closer and closer. Her fear began to magnify. Ultimately, her hope turned into despair as she collapsed onto the sandy beach. The tide soaked through her legs, and the bone-chilling cold awakened all her senses. Finally, the man\u2019s thick lower legs stopped in front of her. The next moment, her scalp felt numb as it was accompanied by mad laughter. The woman was pulled into the ocean; ankle, knee, waist, chest\u2026chilliness enveloped her whole body. Soon, the oppressing water made it very difficult for her to breathe. By the time the man had forcefully shoved her head into the ocean, the woman suddenly began to wave her hands and feet furiously in the air despite no longer having the energy to struggle. It wasn\u2019t because she planned to escape. However, when facing death, these were humans\u2019 final acts of helplessness\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt a cold breeze blowing by me as I listened to Suyang\u2019s words. I began to lean my back closer towards the car door as I fearfully stared at him.</p><br/><p>What was the purpose of his words?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Suyang lifted his head and declared, \u201cI\u2019m going to write these words into my new novel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese words are for\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a scene where the MC is recalling his past memories.\u201d Suyang took out a notebook and began to scribble down his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cRecalling past memories? How is this considered recalling past memories?\u201d But I felt a sigh of relief. Earlier, when he was talking, he sounded like he was going to commit the crime himself.</p><br/><p>After Suyang was done jotting down his words, he put his notebook away and said to me, \u201cLet\u2019s get off the car now. We can\u2019t remain in the car the whole time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment we came out, a stronger sea breeze than I had expected surrounded me. It was making me very disheveled. After taking a few steps, I felt the soft sand against my feet.</p><br/><p>Just as I was about to take off my shoes, Suyang stopped me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is difficult to see the seashells at night. Keep your shoes on to prevent injuries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, what are we doing now?\u201d I looked around our surroundings. There was only darkness. It didn\u2019t feel romantic at all. In fact, the setting was very horror-like.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is currently 3:16am. At approximately 4:50am, we will be able to see the sunrise.\u201d Suyang gazed at his watch as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying we have to stand here for another hour and more?\u201d I glanced to my left. Xu Weishan was crouching next to me as she stared off into the distance. She appeared to be deep in thought.</p><br/><p>I sighed, \u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019m returning to the car. It is too chilly here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Suyang grabbed my hand, \u201cRather than watching the stars from the tiny sunroof inside the car, why don\u2019t we withstand a bit of wind so we could experience the entire sky instead?\u201d</p><br/><p>Out of nowhere, Suyang took out a blanket and spread it across the beach. He sat on it and then patted the spot next to him, \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><br/><p>I sat next to him as I shook my head and said in a pitiful manner, \u201cIs this your idea of a date? No wonder boss has never had a girlfriend before. It\u2019s not because you didn\u2019t want one. It\u2019s because you can\u2019t get one. You poor soul\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang was lying down. He reached and pulled me down with him. He wrapped his arms around my arms. I was tightly protected in his embrace. Suyang had his chin on my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou talk too much. Stop talking. Now that we\u2019re cuddling, you\u2019re not cold, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm\u2026\u201d I closed my mouth as I gazed at the sky. The sky appeared so close, it felt incredible. I felt like I could touch it if I reached my hand out.</p><br/><p>I breathe in the air. Apart from the salty scent of ocean water, I could also smell Suyang\u2019s lemon scent. The mixture of the scent was messing with my mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss\u2026I\u2019m really sleepy\u2026.\u201d My eyelids were starting to feel heavy. After all, it was past 3am. Most normal people would be asleep by now.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now on, don\u2019t call me boss. During this 24 hours date, we are not in a boss subordinate type of relationship.\u201d Suyang whispered in my ears. \u201cIf you\u2019re tired, then take a nap. I\u2019ll wake you up when the sunrise begins.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he tightened his grip and I felt so much warmer in his embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me sing you a lullaby.\u201d Suyang suddenly suggested.</p><br/><p>\u201cLullaby? Why lullaby\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it common for couples to sing to each other? I read it online.\u201d Suyang explained. Before I gave him consent, he began to sing, \u201cPig\u2026..your nose has two holes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I smacked Suyang, \u201cWhat type of lullaby is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop interrupting. I purposely chose this song for you. You\u2019re ruining the atmosphere.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one ruining the atmosphere!\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but giggle hysterically. I turned over and saw how serious he was. It made me laugh even harder.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop being so funny!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFunny?! How?\u201d</p><br/><p>I sat up as I touched my warm face, \u201cBecause of you, I can\u2019t sleep!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, let me teach you something!\u201d Suyang also sat up next to me. \u201cGive me your left hoof.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat hoof\u2026.?\u201d I felt my mood turning sour, but I still obediently reached out my left hand. I wanted to know what he was going to do. He better not be playing a joke on me.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It looked like the apartment that was covered with water\u2026</p><br/><p>But the water was gone. The furnitures were gone too. Actually, aside from the blanket underneath me, there were no items left in the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? What happened?\u201d I clasped the blanket as I looked around my surroundings. In the end, my gaze landed on an attractive man that was leaning against the wall on my right side. He was sizing me up. I instantly turned red, \u201cYou are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I spoke, the gorgeous man made a humph sound and titled his head, \u201cYou slept too much and became a fool? Or did you lose your memory from shock? You are such a dull woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>He sure was handsome, but too bad his mouth was vile.</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t going to settle for that type of attitude, so I stood up. But my head was still spinning.</p><br/><p>After a few seconds later, I took huge strides towards the man.</p><br/><p>Although I was half his size, my attitude was comparable to his. I lifted my chin and glared at him, \u201cA fool? Excuse me. This is the first time we\u2019ve met. How can you be so rude? What happened to those two uncles? I don\u2019t want to talk to you. Go get them. I have stuff to say to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat uncles?\u201d The handsome man slightly frowned. He appeared to be confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cEarlier, there were two uncles with mustaches all over their face. You should know them, right? Get them for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember us?\u201d Another unfamiliar voice spoke up. I immediately turned towards the source. It was another hot guy. His smiling face peeked out from the washroom.</p><br/><p>What was going on? The two uncles disappeared, and now there were two good looking men here?</p><br/><p>My mind was utterly confused, \u201cWhat are you saying\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe just washed our faces and you can\u2019t recognize us? Suyang, we must have looked very sloppy!\u201d The man in the washroom started to chuckle.</p><br/><p>Something clicked and I pointed my finger at the Suyang guy closest to me. I couldn\u2019t hide my shock as I exclaimed, \u201cYou two were the two uncles from before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Suyang quickly enclosed his hand around my finger. His face remained icy. \u201cBingo. But when you\u2019re speaking, don\u2019t point. It\u2019s rude.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO-ok. I understand. Let go.\u201d I forcefully pulled my finger from his grasp.</p><br/><p>My finger was warm now. My fingertip actually felt a bit numb.</p><br/><p><i>You shouldn\u2019t touch a young lady so casually, ok?</i></p><br/><p>The man from the washroom came out as well. As he walked over, he was trying to forcefully remove his rubber glove.</p><br/><p>It took him a lot of effort before he managed to pull one off, and he reached out to shake my hand, \u201cHi. My name is Shen Shaoqian. We scared you today, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><br/><p>I stared at his hand as I hesitantly decided whether I should shake it or not. He had just came out of the washroom with rubber gloves on. Who knows where his hands had reached?</p><br/><p>But he was sending me a bright smile, so I couldn\u2019t bear to reject. I summoned up the courage and touched his hand, \u201cI\u2019m not good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll the furnitures have been damaged by the water. So we called the moving company to help us remove it. There was so much noise and commotion, yet you still managed to sleep through it. I\u2019m impressed! I was wondering if you were sleeping or fainted from fright.\u201d Shen Shaoqian stated very cheerfully.</p><br/><p>His cheerfulness seemed a bit abnormal to me. Why didn\u2019t they fix the water pipe if it was damaged? Their furnitures were damaged and they act like it didn\u2019t matter? They had nothing left in the apartment yet he was still cheerful?</p><br/><p>My mind was filled with questions I wanted to ask. But right now, the most important one was \u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two are honestly the two men from before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! Replacement guaranteed if fake! Did we turn too handsome that you cannot recognize? As I mentioned previously, my name is Shen Shaoqian. The guy over there with the poker face is Suyang. He is the owner of this apartment.\u201d Then, Shen Shaoqian patted Suyang\u2019s back with the hand that still had the rubber glove on. Instantaneously, Suyang\u2019s poker face became the disgusted face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just reached your hands down the sewers. Don\u2019t touch me!\u201d Suyang sternly warned Shen Shaoqian.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was wearing gloves, you punk! How dare you give me such a disgusted expression? You\u2019re the one that pledge your life you wouldn\u2019t do this type of work, so I had no choice but to help you. I worked so hard and you don\u2019t even know how to be grateful. You\u2019re just standing there like it\u2019s none of your business. Have you no shame?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m giving you an opportunity to workout. As a good friend, I want you to maintain a healthy physique at all times.\u201d When Suyang spoke, I didn\u2019t feel any emotions. He wasn\u2019t convincing at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me! Who is the more healthier person out of us two? I workout everyday! Whereas, you just stay home all day\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two wouldn\u2019t stop bickering while I was silently observing. Honestly, what happened while I was asleep? How could those two gruffy uncles transformed into these two attractive young men?</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you done staring?\u201d Perhaps my stare was too intense, Suyang gave up his tongue battle with Shen Shaoqian and casted a glance at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d I subconsciously replied. When I snapped out of it, Shen Shaoqian and Suyang were giving me the \u201cWHAT\u201d expression.</p><br/><p>It was so awkward, I didn\u2019t know where to look. In order to dissolve the bizarre atmosphere, I lightly coughed twice, *cough cough*\u2026.oh yeah, the water from your apartment has damaged my ceiling. It is now dripping water.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was finally back on track.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s next?\u201d Suyang asked.</p><br/><p>I blinked. What kind of human being is this Suyang person? How could he still remain so calm and confident when he had caused damage to his downstairs neighbour? He looked like he didn\u2019t give a damn.</p><br/><p>At least, give me a line of apology? \u2026.. Ugh. Whatever. It wasn\u2019t like I came here to hear an apology. I want to solve the issue!</p><br/><p>Of course, using money!</p><br/><p>I suppressed my explosive emotions and calmly stated, \u201cAnd then, I came over to find you guys. Who would have thought you two would be playing some f**kup roleplay? And forcefully included me as well! I actually thought it was real. I even reminisced all my experiences and sorrows from my 25 years\u2026 all\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you had nothing in these 25 years? Why are you going through your memories then?\u201d Suyang gave me a look of disdain and cut me off.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d</p><br/><p>I wanted to storm and punch Suyang\u2019s handsome face twice, but Shen Shaoqian held me back. \u201cCalm down! Calm down! He\u2019s like that. He has a repulsive mouth. Don\u2019t lower yourself to his level!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

You\u2019re clearly my teacher. Can you please take note of your image? Aren\u2019t you afraid of people seeing us like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang naturally released my hand and led me to a room upstairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou got a room?\u201d I shockingly exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\u201cGot what room?\u201d Suyang rolled his eyes at me. \u201cThe school rented this room for staff members to take breaks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang crossed his arms and sternly looked at me, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were coming here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my business whether I come or not. Why must I tell you\u2026?\u201d I mumbled. Deep down, I was feeling very restless and kept rubbing my fingers together. \u201cPlus, you didn\u2019t tell me you were coming either\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you certain you\u2019re not here as a joke? Why would you wear something like this?\u201d Suyang retorted in a criticizing tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026.before coming, I wasn\u2019t aware it was this type of party. To be honest, I was shocked\u2026\u201d My voice was becoming more and more timid; as if I was losing lung capacity.</p><br/><p>Suyang was defeated by me, he had his hand on his forehead as he paced back and forth in front of me, \u201cAll the students in your class are children of high officials. If you had used your brain, it would have been obvious that this wouldn\u2019t be an ordinary party\u2026.I included this information in the folder, but you didn\u2019t memorize it?!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was at a loss for words. At the time, I only cared about memorizing my own profile. I didn\u2019t care about the school nor the class. I thought it was just extra information.</p><br/><p>After all, Suyang wrote it\u2026 so I thought he included unnecessary stuff.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve put me in a regular class!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare to talk back? Which school would take you in if it was a regular class?\u201d Suyang\u2019s eyes grew big as he roared. I was so frightened that I withdrew my neck and involuntarily stood by the sofa.</p><br/><p>Seeing me like this, Suyang didn\u2019t know what else to say except sighed, \u201cForget it. Right now, the top priority is to get you to change into a formal attire.\u201d He fished out his phone and dialed a number.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I just go home\u2026.?\u201dI raised my hand as I tried asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. This is an opportunity for you to fit into the class. You have barely started University and you already want to be excluded? Don\u2019t worry about the evening gown, I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>To me, it didn\u2019t really matter. It wasn\u2019t only in University; ever since I was little, I had always been excluded. It was a common occurrence. Being excluded once more wouldn\u2019t make much of an impact.</p><br/><p>But this time, while I was helplessly standing all alone in this \u201cawkward\u201d isolated island, Suyang was like a sailboat that was lightly floating towards me from the boundless ocean. It was as if God had specifically sent him down to save me.</p><br/><p>Although, the name of the sailboat was, \u201carrogant\u201d.</p><br/><p>I was shallowly laughing as I watched his rear view making the call.</p><br/><p>In less than ten minutes, someone knocked on the door. Both of us were instantly on the alert.</p><br/><p>I hid behind the sofa while Suyang went to answer the door.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until he said, \u201cCome out\u201d, before I revealed myself. \u201cWho was it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang had an extra box in his hands. He placed the box on the table and turned to leave, \u201cChange into the formal attire. I\u2019ll stand outside to guard the door for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Suyang left, I happily ran to open the box. Inside, there was a beautiful blue gown that was exquisitely made. In addition, there were accessories and a pair of shoes to go along with it.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god\u2026.\u201d I gently stroked the high quality material with my hands. It felt as smooth as a baby\u2019s skin. <em>Wow, I never thought I would have the opportunity to wear something like this.</em> For some reason, my heart ached for the gown.</p><br/><p>With a serious mind, I changed into the formal attire. It fit perfectly.</p><br/><p>While I was pulling the zipper up from behind, it accidentally caught onto my hair and made my scalp feel numb.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Oh no, my hand, zipper, and hair were tangled together.</p><br/><p>The pain increased the more I struggled. Thus, in order to lower my pain, I crookedly faced upwards as I headed to the door and knocked, \u201cBoss! Come in and help me\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you done?\u201d Suyang entered the room. My left shoulder strap accidentally slid down and Suyang instantly covered his eyes as he turned around, \u201cAre you crazy? You haven\u2019t finished changing and you told me to come in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m stuck at the back. Can you help me undo it?\u201d I headed towards him for help in an inconvenient position. However, Suyang ran the other direction when he heard my footsteps.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going? Stop running!\u201d I chased after him.</p><br/><p>The way he ran while I chased reminded me of an anime -as if I was the crazy girl chasing after Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop running and help me undo this!\u201d I tried hard to suppress my frustrations. I really didn\u2019t have any physical strength to chase him around.</p><br/><p>Suyang halted his steps and turned to face me, but his eyes were still closed. Like a blind person, he reached out his two hands to explore, \u201cFine\u2026where are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHere! Here! Here!\u201d I yelled as I took the initiative to walk in front of Suyang and turned my back against him, \u201cOpen your eyes! Or else, how would you untie?\u201d</p><br/><p>I honestly didn\u2019t understand Suyang. Normally, he would bully me with no mercy, but whenever it has anything to do with physical contact, he would turn into an innocent fellow?! Last time he acted very strangely while I was changing too..</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I can untie it even with my eyes closed.\u201d</p><br/><p>I quietly listened to him boast.</p><br/><p>As expected, after touching air for awhile, Suyang missed the zipper entirely and unintentionally touched the inside of my dress.</p><br/><p>When my skin came in contact with his hand, it was like getting shocked by lightning. We both bounced away from each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you touching?!\u201d I frowned as I yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see, remember?\u201d Suyang also shouted impatiently. Yet, he still refused to open his eyes.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, I felt his hand on my head and his evil claws reached for my face as he brutally pinched me, \u201cYou. Are. So. Troublesome!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop! Don\u2019t pinch me. It hurts!\u201d I whined as I tried to twist out of his grasp. Unfortunately, my tangled hair didn\u2019t permit me to make any big moves.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, do you seriously think we have time to waste? If someone comes in, we wouldn\u2019t be able to wash ourselves clear even if we plunge ourselves in the Yellow River! I beg you, open your eyes and untie me. Then, we can happily leave this room. Okay?\u201d I turned around and used my free hand to forcefully opened one of Suyang\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Suyang glared at me with the eye that I had forced open. After thinking about it for a moment, he nodded and opened his other eye.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, I turned around without any vigilance. Subsequently, I was faced with the female ghost. She was a fist away from me.</p><br/><p>The moment I made eye contact with her deathly pale face and expressionless eyes, I freaked out. I tried to back up and escape. I had completely forgotten about the person that was grumbling about my dress from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is this zipper on this dress so long?\u201d</p><br/><p>I directly elbowed him in the gut and then accidentally stepped on his lower leg. Then, I slipped and fell on him like an arc.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, my face landed on his firm chest. The two of us fell over very comically.</p><br/><p>I lifted my head. Suyang stared at me with his round and bulging eyes. He was speechless as he stiffly smiled. His first line was, \u201cWhy did you hit me?\u201d</p><br/><p>His second line was, \u201cWhy did you step on me?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no way I could explain what had happened, so I sat up. However, my hand was still caught by my hair. So, with my free hand, I tried to find a way where I could push myself up. In a daze, I think I unintentionally touched something I wasn\u2019t supposed to, and Suyang looked like he was in tremendous amounts of pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, are you ok?\u201d I felt bad and knew I was in big trouble. I didn\u2019t dare to move anymore as I tried to shift my body and put less pressure on Suyang\u2019s body part.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Suyang couldn\u2019t even yell at me properly. After he regulated his breathing, he suddenly flipped me over and pressed me down.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop moving!\u201d Suyang\u2019s face was restrainedly red as he began to use both his hands to untie my hair from my neck.</p><br/><p>He was always making these ambiguous moves on me\u2026. <i>Isn\u2019t this too intimate?</i> I silently thought.</p><br/><p>Although I couldn\u2019t see his face in my current state, I could feel Suyang\u2019s breath on my back. The feeling was enlarged and my back felt very limp and itchy.</p><br/><p>\u201cSi\u2026..\u201d I hissed as a strand of hair was torn from my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you in pain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you can continue.\u201d</p><br/><p>I tried to turn my attention elsewhere as I steadily stared at the design on the carpet. For some reason, the odd design began to magnify in front of me. It kept going until the image became very blurry.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is your heart beating so fast?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026*cough cough*. My heart naturally beats fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>My lips were turning dry, and I kept using my tongue to wet it. My hands were tightly gripping the carpet. If there was a hole right now, I would definitely crawl in to escape.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to say\u2026.\u201d Suddenly the door opened and Xu Weishan stormed in. Following behind her was Kevin, who had his head down. It looked like they were fighting. But the moment they saw me and Suyang on the ground, there was silence.</p><br/><p>The four of us made eye contact and stared at each other. We were all in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t lock the doors?\u201d I asked Suyang.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

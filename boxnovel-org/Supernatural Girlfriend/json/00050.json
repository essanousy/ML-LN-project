After he had returned home, he confirmed she had the same face as Xu Weishan. Yet, why did one of them possess a noble air that was too high to reach; while the other appeared to be leaking an aura of poverty?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not blind! If you don\u2019t make a move on me, I\u2019ll thank God. The money is on the table. Go and get it yourself!\u201d Kevin pretended to be reserved and aloof. He entered his apartment and placed the delivery on the table. Then, he sat on the couch and smiled. His expression showed that he was well prepared.</p><br/><p>The moment Hong Xiaobei entered, she focused her attention on the table with money and went to get it. She wanted to leave as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d She accidentally noticed a picture on the table. In the picture, there were two children that looked around ten years of age. <i>But why did the girl look like her younger self? </i></p><br/><p>She does not recall taking a picture like this?!</p><br/><p>Seeing how Hong Xiaobei was standing still, Kevin smiled. He knew his plan had worked. He had purposely developed the picture of him and Xu Weishan and displayed it onto the table. He intentionally wanted Hong Xiaobei to see it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person in the picture is the person that I know. Last time, I thought you were her. You two look exactly alike, right?\u201d Kevin rushed over as he asked excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is the person in the picture?\u201d Hong Xiaobei shockingly pointed to the child who looked identical to her. She had a very strange feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is the infamous unruly little princess. I don\u2019t know how you two can look exactly the same. Are you girls related?\u201d Kevin began to stare at Hong Xiaobei again as he jokingly asked.</p><br/><p>*Pa*. Hong Xiaobei slammed down the picture and ran off.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Where are you going?\u201d Kevin wasn\u2019t able to stop Hong Xiaobei in time. He pouted as he looked at the fried chicken she had delivered to him. \u201cI ordered two orders of fried chicken for us to share. Originally I wanted to chat and eat with you\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Could I be\u2026\u2026\u201d Hong Xiaobei wanted clarification as she headed to the hospital. After her father\u2019s death, her mother found out she had terminal cancer. She was now living in the hospital.</p><br/><p>Because she ran too quickly, Hong Xiaobei accidentally crashed into a child. The child fell onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Hong Xiaobei halted her steps as she lifted the child up and rubbed his forehead. She checked to see if she had caused any damages.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Bei\u2026\u201d The child softly whimpered. Hong Xiaobei focused and realized it was the sick child that was living in the same ward as her mother. It was Xiao Xin.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Xin, why are you running around and not staying in your ward?\u201d Poor little guy was so sick at such a young age. In addition, he was an orphan. Ever since knowing his story, Hong Xiaobei treated this child extra special.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are no toys in the ward. I want to play with toys\u2026.\u201d Xiao Xin sadly whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Xin, next time I come, I\u2019ll bring you some toys. Be good and stay in the ward, okay?\u201d Hong Xiaobei gently rubbed his head as she tried her best to squeeze out a smile.</p><br/><p>She held onto Xiao Xin\u2019s tender little hands as they walked back into the ward. When she saw her sick mother, she could see how the cancer had taken its toil on her.</p><br/><p>Seeing her mother like this, Hong Xiaobei didn\u2019t have the courage to question her. Initially, she wanted to ask if she had a twin sister elsewhere.</p><br/><p>However, Hong Xiaobei kept delaying the question. Ultimately, her mother passed away and she never asked the question.</p><br/><p>While she was going through her mother\u2019s belongings, Hong Xiaobei discovered the document from 19 years ago. It turned out she was adopted from the same orphanage as Xiao Xin.</p><br/><p>Although the orphanage was no longer ran by the same director, the current director was able to go through the old records to prove that she was indeed an adopted child. The parents she had loved all these years were not her biological parents.</p><br/><p>Another reality was that she had a twin sister elsewhere who was living a luxurious life.</p><br/><p>She was resentful, jealous, and bitter. After all, she was human.</p><br/><p>After a series of psychological shock, Hong Xiaobei could no longer handle it. Her grades began to deteriorate. Within three months, Hong Xiaobei went from a good student to a delinquent girl. Every night, she would drink at a bar until she was intoxicated. She wandered around the streets like a walking corpse.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey gorgeous, you look so pretty. Wanna go somewhere nice with me?\u201d A bunch of hooligans had been eyeing on Hong Xiaobei for awhile. One day, they finally decided to make a move on her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you guys? Get away from me!\u201d Hong Xiaobei slurred as she swayed and irritably tried to push the men away. Her stomach began to overturn as she violently vomited into a corner.</p><br/><p>An arm aggressively pulled her by the shoulder and forcefully grabbed her clothes as he slapped Hong Xiaobei across the face.</p><br/><p>Hong Xiaobei saw stars and fell over a garbage can.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare to act smug towards me?\u201d The man that had struck Hong Xiaobei appeared to be furious that she had disregarded him.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelease me! You guys, release me!\u201d The guys were planning to carry Hong Xiaobei away. Although she tried her best to break out of their grasps, it was no use. Her body was so soft and weak at the moment. She wasn\u2019t able to control it.</p><br/><p>Hong Xiaobei felt like she had been abandoned by God her entire life. <i>Was this the end of her difficult life? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cHey guys, where do you think you\u2019re taking my girlfriend? Taking others\u2019 girlfriend without permission isn\u2019t a good idea!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hong Xiaobei wondered who her savior was. He wasn\u2019t afraid to get killed? With the help of the weak lighting, Hong Xiaobei recognized Kevin. Once she did, she excitedly yelled, \u201cKevin!? Is that you?! Come save me! Hurry! They beat me up. I\u2019m in pain\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The intoxicated Hong Xiaobei didn\u2019t care about the time or setting as she drunkenly sat down and pointed to her leg. She was acting cutely in front of Kevin.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re acting so flirty, I\u2019m going to safely take you away even if I end up like a pig head\u2026.\u201d Kevin hopelessly smiled. Then, he took off his jacket and stretched his limbs.</p><br/><p><i>Why was it that he couldn\u2019t let go of this girl? </i></p><br/><p>In the silent night, at the corner of an unknown alley, were sounds of fighting. While Kevin was busy fighting the hooligans, Hong Xiaobei had crawled to a corner to vomit some more.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel terrible\u2026\u201d With difficulties, Hong Xiaobei held onto the wall for support and stood up. Just as she was about to run, she turned around and noticed that all the hooligans were on the ground. \u201cHuh? You beat them all?! Not bad! I didn\u2019t expect you to win\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour words make me so sad. Because of you, I am wounded. Is this how you treat your savior?\u201d Kevin pointed to his injuries as he teased.</p><br/><p>Hong Xiaobei ignored him like she didn\u2019t hear. She pretended nothing happened as she swayed towards the direction of her home.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going? I saved you and you didn\u2019t even say thank you!?\u201d Kevin grabbed onto Hong Xiaobei as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, um. Thanks.\u201d Hong Xiaobei sounded extremely insincere. Kevin was infuriated but he couldn\u2019t blame her. After she had left that day, he secretly investigated her background. He knew what she had gone through. He couldn\u2019t help but pity her. So how can he get mad?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

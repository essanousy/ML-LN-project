She continued to do Suyang\u2019s makeup miserably.</p><br/><p>Since they were no longer chatting, I placed all my attention on the script. There were many questions. The director wanted Suyang to take a look ahead of time so he had an idea of what to expect.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, there are many questions on the script. Would you like to see it now?\u201d Since we were out, I acknowledged Suyang as my boss.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t open my eyes right now. Read them out to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe literature media had elected you as the most outstanding speculative author of the year. How do you feel about that?\u201d After reading out this question, I scratched my head and muttered to myself, \u201cWhen did they elect you? How could I wasn\u2019t aware of it\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you ever seriously cared about my writing and creations?\u201d Suyang calmly replied, \u201cAfter the program is over, I am going to change your internet main page to my fanclub site. I\u2019m your boss. Can you show more care towards what I do? I pay you a wage\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Suyang say this, I instantly began to reflect upon myself. <em>I was probably the most unreliable assistant ever.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYou have a fanclub?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but applaud. \u201cWe have so many people in our country. So many that there are people out there who are bored enough to help you create a site.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShen Shaoqian did it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, no wonder.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCurrently, I have five million authorized fans and approximately 300k VIP members.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Wow\u2026 he has that many fans? How come I\u2019ve never heard him talk about it before?! But that might not be a good thing, right? Most likely, the majority of his fans are female</i>\u2026. Immediately, I felt a lot of pressure.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis question\u2026 *cough cough*. Numerous female fans are very interested in your love life. From our understanding, you do not have a girlfriend. So now, I would like to help your female fans ask. What is your ideal type?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell the truth and say I already have a girlfriend.\u201d Suyang responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that!\u201d I freaked out. The moment I imagined five million pairs of eyes watching me; or perhaps 300k mouths attacking me, I felt like I was going to die. It would literally be my worst nightmare.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have so many fans. How could you tell them that you have a girlfriend? Aren\u2019t you worried that your fans would abandon you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t attract fans using my face. That is the reason why I had never made any public appearances before. I want my readers to admire my writing for what it is. Not for the way I look.\u201d Suyang proudly stated.</p><br/><p>Suyang was being a narcissist again. If his fans knew what he was truly like, they would probably all run, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue\u2026 but is it really good to destroy your readers\u2019 image of you? They all assume you\u2019re single.\u201d I tested.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they are true supporters, they will be happy for me.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>It\u2019s over. It\u2019s over. Suyang is too naive. He seriously doesn\u2019t understand females! Women in their twenties are hopeful and longed for love. If he openly announces that he\u2019s in a relationship, they will be very critical of the girl; especially if they do not think the woman is good enough for their idol. </i></p><br/><p><i>Plus, that woman was me\u2026. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cI still think it\u2019s better if you say you\u2019re not in a relationship.\u201d I suggested.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you trying to tell author Suyang to lie?\u201d The young makeup artist interrupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! I\u2019m telling him to lie. You\u2019ve helped many celebrities with their makeups before, right? You should know that they often lie. What\u2019s so strange about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since the young makeup artist was much younger than me, I wanted to demonstrate I had more authority than her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ve seen this often. Usually, it\u2019s the manager that forces the celebrities to lie. Just like what you\u2019re doing. But I\u2019m curious, authors have managers too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not his manager. I\u2019m his assistant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026.\u201d The young makeup artist nodded and the corner of her mouth curved into a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s also my girlfriend.\u201d Suyang added and then introduced me, \u201cThis is the girlfriend that I have been dating for a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCurrently, I\u2019m your assistant. I\u2019m responsible for your maintaining your image. Just listen to me. When you are on the show, don\u2019t say you have a girlfriend. It will be better for you.\u201d <em>I seriously felt like I have what it takes to be a manager.</em></p><br/><p>Suyang didn\u2019t directly respond. He avoided the topic.</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if he would do as I say. So, while they were doing the recording, I followed and sat at the further audience spot to keep an eye on him.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of people. The majority of them were female.</p><br/><p>Since it was the first time they had seen Suyang\u2019s face, they were all very excited.</p><br/><p>Woman A: \u201cWow! He\u2019s so hot!\u201d Woman B: \u201cOh God\u2026. I never expected Du Yu to be so handsome\u2026 I can\u2019t handle this!\u201d Woman C: \u201cBased on his work, I already knew what type of person he was\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>I sat amongst them without saying a single word as I silently played on my cellphone. I was kind of proud and scared at the same time.</p><br/><p>Soon, the recording began. First, the host made her opening remarks. Then, Suyang entered through the backstage once again.</p><br/><p>As expected, the whole crowd began to scream. Although there were often a lot of fake acting in video recordings, I was confident that these fans were actually real.</p><br/><p>In addition, they weren\u2019t the only ones fangirling. I was also gazing at Suyang like a love struck fool.</p><br/><p>Deep down, I thought to myself: <i>As expected of my man. Regardless of which angle you look at him from, he was perfect. </i></p><br/><p>The purpose of today\u2019s show was to interview Suyang. So, the questioning segment began almost immediately. A lot of the questions we had practiced backstage weren\u2019t used. But the question about Suyang\u2019s ideal type was chosen nonetheless.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is your ideal type of girl, Author Su? I\u2019m sure many of the audience and viewers of this show are extremely curious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Suyang paused to think about it. Then, he laughed very heartily, \u201cNot too tall. Not too fat or skinny (right in the middle), black hair, huge eyes, do not enjoy wearing makeup, unkempt, persistent, queer, poor temper, reclusive yet kindhearted, strong and independent. That\u2019s my type.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! Author Su, your type is quite different from the mass! It appears that most of the words you chose have a negative connotation to them. Are you trying to imply that it\u2019s fine to have a bad personality as long as deep down, she\u2019s kindhearted? I have a feeling tonight, many ladies will go to salons to dye their hair back to black!\u201d The host joked. My heart also calmed down.</p><br/><p>At least the question was over. Suyang wasn\u2019t too stubborn and listened to what I said.</p><br/><p><i>Good job! Good job!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no use. There is only one person who meets my criteria.\u201d After Suyang\u2019s declaration, the entire crowd gasped.</p><br/><p>I thought Suyang was done with answering the question. Aside from me, the host was also stunned, \u201cWhat do you mean by that, Author Su?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is only one person in this world who meets my criteria. Everything I say is adjusted towards her. Basically, if she grows taller, I will like tall woman. If she gets plumper, I will like plump woman. If she dyes her hair brown, I will like brown hair. If she wears makeup, I will like makeup\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould Author Su already have someone he likes?!\u201d The host\u2019s voice obviously turned lower.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t merely someone I like. I already have a girlfriend. She\u2019s sitting at the very last row; closest to the exit. Currently, she\u2019s trying her best to shrink her short legs. That\u2019s her.\u201d Suyang pointed at me between the rows of audience.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I didn\u2019t feel good saying this.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing it for Xiao Su. You understand, right? In the future, make sure you learn some spiritual techniques. The older you get, the easier it is for evil spirits to find loopholes to use you. You must learn to protect yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore I met you, I was doing just fine. I can be alone\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t attract so many ghosts, I would\u2019ve approved of you as my grandson\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to apologize for not letting you know that Suyang and I had became a couple. I knew you were against us, that\u2019s why I purposely didn\u2019t say anything. I was afraid you would kick me out\u2026\u201d I held onto Grandmother Meng\u2019s hand. I sounded both nervous and pained.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can save those touching words when you\u2019re Lin Yixin again!\u201d Grandmother Meng rushed me, \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk.\u201d I was no longer emotional as I laid on the bed. My eyes stared at the design on the ceiling. Suddenly, my eyelids became heavier and heavier. Soon, my eyes were closed.</p><br/><p>This time, I knew what was going on. Although my eyes were closed, I could clearly feel my body turning lighter and lighter. It was slowly floating upwards like a cotton.</p><br/><p><i>Was I coming out of Anson\u2019s body? I could finally say goodbye to being a man?! To be honest, these past few days were very inconvenient for me. Let\u2019s not talk about the other stuff, just going to the washroom alone was veryyyyyy uncomfortable! </i></p><br/><p>It was actually a simple process. In no time, I heard Grandmother Meng\u2019s loud snap and I woke up. I turned my head and saw Anson lying next to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew\u2026.\u201d I touched my soft boobs and felt a breath of relief. I was back. The female Lin Yixin was back!</p><br/><p>The moment I tried to get up, I felt a burning pain coming from my right arm. \u201cPain pain pain! This\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou forgot? Lin Yixin got shot on her arm! Now that you\u2019re back, you must experience the pain.\u201d Grandmother Meng seemed to be rejoicing in my misfortunes.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though it\u2019s painful, I\u2019m so glad to have my body back!\u201d I grinned.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is for you.\u201d Grandmother Meng handed a piece of paper to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I took the piece of paper and noticed an address was written on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is where my Master lives. If you want to learn how to control your spiritual powers, then go find him. If you guys are destined to meet, you will be able to find him.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Not that I wanted to be rude, but</i>\u2026 \u201cGrandmother Meng\u2026your Master? How old is your Master?\u201d I carefully asked. <i>Grandmother Meng\u2019s Master was still alive?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cPeople who have spiritual powers tend to live a long life. Let me see\u2026 my Master should be 102 years old this year! Is it 102 or 103?! Aiya, I am a bit confused myself.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Don\u2019t worry about it. That\u2019s pretty much the same thing</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>I scrupulously put the paper away.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen are you planning to leave?\u201d Grandmother Meng asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow!? We only have an hour, right? I need to rush back to the hospital for Xialing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not talking about that. I want to know when you\u2019re leaving this city.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? I don\u2019t know\u2026is it that urgent? I will leave! Don\u2019t worry!\u201d I honestly didn\u2019t want to continue with this topic. So I stared at the unconscious Anson and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the child will be able to wake up.\u201d sighed Grandmother Meng.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe child isn\u2019t injured. He has sealed off his soul. How should I explain it? I guess you can consider it as a type of suicide? He chose to be a person in a vegetative state.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Anson is not going to wake up for the rest of his life?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. It will depend on him. Sources say the child has committed many terrible crimes. I guess we\u2019ll let him use his own method to settle the debt. Sigh. I\u2019m partially responsible. Back then, if I had taught him the difference between right and wrong, perhaps he wouldn\u2019t have ended up like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow\u2026.oh yeah\u2026 Grandmother Meng, I hope you won\u2019t mention my departure to Suyang when he comes in. Before I leave, I want to make sure we have no regrets.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo regrets?\u201d Grandmother Meng covered her mouth in shock, \u201cWhat are you going to do to my precious grandson? I\u2019m telling you, Suyang is a very innocent child! You better not corrupt him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop thinking in the wrong direction! Plus, you think your Suyang is innocent?!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Psssh. Suyang always act like a pervert. But I didn\u2019t tell that to Grandmother Meng. I was afraid to give her a heart attack. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it going to be more difficult for you guys to separate the longer you two stay together?\u201d Grandmother Meng gave me a sideway glance.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re both adults. We know we should make decisions that are best for everyone. I just want to give myself some memories. After I leave, time will dilute everything\u2026 Suyang will be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d After thinking about it, Grandmother nodded in agreement. Her support meant more than words could say.</p><br/><p>I held onto my painful arm and ran out of the room. Suyang was standing near the couch very anxiously. I ran straight for him and fell into his arms. Suyang was caught by surprise. He didn\u2019t seem to know how to react.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! I\u2019m already delivering myself to you and you\u2019re not even holding onto me?\u201d I grumbled as I lifted my head to glare at him.</p><br/><p>Suyang rubbed my head and lovingly murmured, \u201cMy goldfish has returned.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d I behaved like a cute innocent bird and burrowed myself deeper in his arms.</p><br/><p>Grandmother Meng came out and coughed aloud. She reminded us we didn\u2019t have time to linger around. We had to rush back to the hospital.</p><br/><p>When Suyang and I entered the hospital, Sheyu happened to be taking a nap while she was on guard. We entered the ward and Xialing was napping as well. We woke her up right away.</p><br/><p>Xialing opened her drowsy eyes and gazed at me and Suyang. She asked gruelingly, \u201cYou have switched back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you guys?\u201d Suddenly, Sheyu stormed into the room. Xialing was still lying on the bed!</p><br/><p>The three of us froze.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Y-you\u2019re awake!?\u201d Sheyu pointed at me. Her tone sounded warmer.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 yes. I\u2019m awake.\u201d I awkwardly said, \u201cLong time no see\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Sheyu took out a pair of handcuffs and handcuffed me to the handrail of the bed. \u201cYou\u2019re a kidnapper and you\u2019ve violated the law. So now that you\u2019re awake, I must follow procedures.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang stood in front of me. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say it\u2019s fine as long as we revoke all her accusations? I am now revoking all of Lin Yixin\u2019s accusations.\u201d</p><br/><p>I gazed at Suyang\u2019s broad back and secretly chuckled.</p><br/><p>Then, Xialing pressed the emergency button and called the doctor over to examine me.</p><br/><p>Sheyu informed her colleague and soon he arrived. He wanted to record an oral confession.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already told you guys many times! We were just playing. Who would\u2019ve thought that the cops would take it so seriously and shoot me in the arm! But as a generous person, I will forgive you. Just pretend nothing happened!\u201d I quibbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cBullshit! You guys called the cops! And you were holding onto a real gun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, you saw me! At the time, I was pointing the gun at me! I wasn\u2019t pointing it at anyone else. You could say it was an unsuccessful suicide!\u201d</p><br/><p>I watched as Suyang and Xialing were driven out of the room, \u201cPlus, Suyang says he doesn\u2019t wish to press charges. If I were really kidnapping them, why would he help me?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to jail for what Anson has done!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf anything, you can say I was hindering business from operations. But there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to accept kidnapping charges! I won\u2019t accept it even if you kill me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis woman!\u201d The police officer was so mad that steam was practically coming out of his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened between you guys, but after the recording today, we won\u2019t be looking for you anymore. You can be at ease and take your time to heal.\u201d Sheyu told me after she walked her colleague out the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Since the victim says not to investigate, we cannot file a case.\u201d Sheyu took off her hat. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m glad that this incident ended this way. I don\u2019t know what happened but I trust you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d I smiled and hugged Sheyu.</p><br/><p><i>I\u2019m alive! I\u2019m alive! I leaned on Sheyu\u2019s shoulder and gave Suyang a victory sign \u201cV\u201d</i>!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>Everything went back to course and life continued. It was as if I had woken up from a dream. I was still me. I was still Lin Yixin.</p><br/><p>As for Anson, we found out from Xialing that Huaze Yuxiang was taking Anson back to Japan. Now that he was in a vegetative state, we didn\u2019t think it was right to start a trial against him.</p><br/><p>As for my departure, I never brought it back up to Suyang again. Suyang didn\u2019t say anything about it either. We pretended as if that part never happened. We continued living together. But I was only putting on an act; hoping that our separation will not come so soon.</p><br/><p>I realized my abilities to heal were different from ordinary people. Within a few days, I was able to move my arm at ease. Last time, the same occurred for my chest wound. The doctor praised me and said it was the first time he had met a patient that could heal so well.</p><br/><p>With each passing day, the weather was turning colder and colder. I would spend the entire day wrapped up in my blanket at home. Today, Suyang had something to do so he wasn\u2019t home. So, I was looking up online flights while I was on the couch.</p><br/><p>Behind his back, I decided to depart the day after tomorrow at 10am. I bought the ticket to City B.</p><br/><p>I could hear the password being pressed. Suyang was back! I swiftly closed the ticketing booking site from my phone and lay on the couch as I pretended to be asleep.</p><br/><p>But through the blanket, I could smell fried chicken. It was mouthwatering. When I tried to focus on the aroma, my soul nearly flew away with it. I couldn\u2019t hold it anymore and flipped open the blanket.</p><br/><p><i>No wonder the smell was so strong! Suyang was in front of me pacing back and forth with the fried chicken! He deliberately wanted to lure me. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cWoah! It smells so good!\u201d I sighed. Then, I snatched the box from his hand, \u201cFor me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already taken it. I can\u2019t say it\u2019s not for you\u2026.\u201d Suyang sat next to me as he joked, \u201cEat less. You already don\u2019t exercise enough. After eating fried chicken, you\u2019re going to get even fatter!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! I\u2019m a victim of gunshot wound! I\u2019m a patient! I must eat something good to comfort myself!\u201d I refuted.</p><br/><p>Suyang looked at me from left to right, \u201cI swear, you\u2019re quite good at absorbing bullets. You\u2019re basically a reincarnation of a bullet sucking machine!\u201d He smirked.</p><br/><p><i>\u2026..as expected, the poisonous tongue Suyang was back. I miss the gentle and considerate Suyang</i>\u2026..</p><br/><p>Based on his expression, he looked like he was going to say something else. Before he could say another word, I stuffed a chicken thigh in his mouth.</p><br/><p>I had a silly smile on my face, \u201cOur author Su has been busy the whole morning. You must eat something yummy to replenish your physical strength! No more talking for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang\u2019s mouth was all greasy from the fried chicken. There was something sexy about it.</p><br/><p>As I ate the fried chicken, I suddenly recalled there was something that we never finished from the past. I wanted to make sure we did it before I left.</p><br/><p>I leaned over to Suyang and placed my head on his shoulder, \u201cDo you remember back then you were going to write a love novel? We had a 24 hour date that we never finished!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

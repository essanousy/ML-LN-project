First, shave his beard. Second, cut his hair.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know how to do it?\u201d Suyang stared at my left hand. It was currently covered with shaving foam. I was clutching the razor with my right hand; looking lost.</p><br/><p>Suyang\u2019s body was trembling a little.</p><br/><p><i>Was he trying to run away? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you just put the foam on the face and shave it off with the razor? How hard could that be\u2026.?\u201d I casually responded. But deep down, I wasn\u2019t sure. After all, I had never shaven a guy\u2019s beard before.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey hey\u2026 your hand is shaking.\u201d Suyang warned me.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Really?\u201d I stared my at right hand. It was being disobedient.</p><br/><p>Suyang took the razor off my hand and the wiped the shaving foam away too. Then, he kicked me out of the washroom, \u201cForget it. For my life\u2019s sake and to prevent you from going to Japan by yourself, I\u2019ll do it on my own.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he shut the door, I heard the sounds of an open faucet. Around half an hour later, caveman Suyang had transformed back into pretty boy Suyang. Thank God!</p><br/><p>It had been a week since I last saw him. I had my hands propping up my chin as I admired his handsome face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAww, our little Xiao Su has lost weight. Poor baby\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I uttered those words, Suyang gave me a very odd look. Then, he wrapped his arms around his chest and appeared very bashful.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your motive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d I slyly smiled at him.</p><br/><p>Suyang was so startled that he ran to his bedroom with only a towel wrapped around his body. By the time he came back out, he had already changed.</p><br/><p>Like always, we bickered as we headed to the department store. We were going to go pick up the vouchers.</p><br/><p>When we arrived at the inquiry desk, I felt as if the staff had a grudge against me. <i>Was it because of the phone call from earlier? </i></p><br/><p><i>She was probably the one who made the call. But don\u2019t blame me. It\u2019s not my fault there were so many scammers around</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you being abnormally quiet? Along the way, your mouth wouldn\u2019t stop running.\u201d Suyang teased despite knowing the reason.</p><br/><p>When we were in an area where the workers couldn\u2019t see us, I lightly pinched Suyang and made a face at him.</p><br/><p>After arriving at the office, the staff member went over the redeeming procedure with Suyang. There was no need for me to be there, so I randomly walked around the store by myself.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t believe we actually won a five day trip to Japan. My fidgety legs were an obvious indicator of my enthusiasm.</p><br/><p>Honestly, if I could, I would teleport to Japan. Too bad I didn\u2019t have the ability.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, I felt as if someone was watching me. It gave me shivers and I anxiously glanced around my surroundings. However, I didn\u2019t see anyone. <i>Could I be hallucinating due to overexcitement? </i></p><br/><p>We had gone through too much stuff lately. It was a rare opportunity to finally relax and go on vacation. I didn\u2019t want any weird ghosts messing it up for us. So, I closed my eyes and began to chant.</p><br/><p>\u201cGhosts and demons, stay away! Ghosts and demons, stay away!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang tapped me from behind. He caringly asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You saw another ghost?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Are you done?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang displayed the five vouchers.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are there so many?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a family trip\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we invite others then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to spend alone time with me? You want others to join too?\u201d <i>Suyang was so cute whenever he showed signs of jealousy. </i></p><br/><p>I shrugged my shoulders and pinched Suyang\u2019s smooth face. Then, I felt depressed. <i>How could a man\u2019s skin be better than a woman\u2019s? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you have inappropriate thoughts towards me!\u201d I teased.</p><br/><p>\u201cPssh. You\u2019re the one who has inappropriate thoughts towards me! When we were sleeping on the same bed, I didn\u2019t do anything. Yet you were the one who kept tossing and turning. Am I correct?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>I thought Suyang was asleep the whole time. So it turned out he wasn\u2019t, eh</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>I instantly rebutted, \u201cIf you were asleep, you wouldn\u2019t have known I was tossing and turning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang stared at me; speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! I caught you! The truth is, that night, you didn\u2019t sleep well either! Right?! Right?!\u201d</p><br/><p>*cough cough*. Suyang suddenly coughed, \u201cUm, we\u2019re done here. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to switch the topic! Admit it. You didn\u2019t sleep well either!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 I\u2019m hungry. Let\u2019s go eat. What do you want to eat?\u201d Suyang avoided my eyes as he stared ahead.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! You\u2019re blushing! Who would\u2019ve thought Suyang would blush!? This time, I caught you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my treat.\u201d Suyang held me in his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Then, I want to eat hotpot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>It took around a month for all our passports and visas to arrive. So, it wasn\u2019t until the beginning of November that we were ready to travel.</p><br/><p>While we were waiting at the airport for our tickets to print, I noticed two familiar figures. I raised my brows and turned towards Suyang as I pointed at them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Please explain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Suyang shook his head awkwardly, \u201cShaoqian\u2019s new girlfriend broke up with him. These days, he has been too depressed. So, I decided to invite him to help him heal and loosen up.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>He got dumped again?! Wait. Why was I saying \u201cagain\u201d? I had already predicted it. </i></p><br/><p>*<i>Flashback</i>*</p><br/><p>Ever since Shen Shaoqian broke up with his girlfriend, he would bombard us daily. He would always call Suyang late at night. If Suyang didn\u2019t pick up, he would call me\u2026</p><br/><p>Usually, his first line would be from a classic oldie:</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t I your dearest love? Why aren\u2019t you saying anything\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Later on, I finally learnt how to block his number. I thought we would be able to regain a few days of peace. But we ended up receiving a call from a server.</p><br/><p>Suyang and I quickly got dressed and rushed to the scene. When we arrived, we witnessed a handsome looking server being shoved to the ends of the sofa. Shen Shaoqian was jabbering on and on. He had a bottle in his hand as he refused to let the person go; red faced. \u201cWomen are all liars\u2026 they cannot be trusted. Why must they hurt me? Tell me, do I seem\u2026.like such an easy target?\u201d He sobbed.</p><br/><p>The server looked helpless as he quietly pleaded for us to help him, \u201cUh\u2026can you guys help me?\u201d</p><br/><p>I patted Suyang\u2019s shoulder and he coldly proceeded forward. He dragged the unmoving Shen Shaoqian off the server and threw him onto another sofa like he was a piece of garbage.</p><br/><p>The alcohol in his bottle splashed over his face.</p><br/><p>We apologized to the poor server and now there were only the three of us left.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough. How many days has it been? You have to wake up now.\u201d Suyang ruthlessly slapped Shen Shaoqian on the face. \u201cWake up. We\u2019re heading home now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Shen Shaoqian buried his head in the sofa. Then, he instinctively wailed, \u201cThis is the place where we first met. I am waiting for her. Waiting for her to come back\u2026.and watch the peach blossoms bloom with me\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked around the room. If this was the place where Shen Shaoqian and his ex-girlfriend met, I could understand why he got played so badly.</p><br/><p>Although Shen Shaoqian had a tendency to talk big, deep down, he was a pure, innocent, loyal boy. Compared to the other male snakes around, he didn\u2019t stand a chance.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get him home soon\u2026 I\u2019m really tired.\u201d I yawned to Suyang.</p><br/><p>Suyang icily laughed, \u201cYou want me to take him? Dream on. Do you know how heavy a drunk Shen Shaoqian is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrust me, I know.\u201d I recalled the time when the drunk Shen Shaoqian had fallen on top of me. It was as if it happened yesterday.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Shen Shaoqian bounced up from the sofa and held onto his bottle like it was a microphone. He began to sing very loudly as he walked towards me with his arms opened wide. \u201cIf you are willing to peel off my heart, layer by layer\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>I began to slowly back away. <i>Uh.. Shen Shaoqian was probably confusing me with someone else. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me!\u201d Shen Shaoqian whined as he rushed towards me.</p><br/><p>I began to run. A second later, I saw that Suyang had gotten up from the sofa. Now, Shen Shaoqian had one hand up against the wall as he leaned forward to prevent Suyang from escaping.</p><br/><p><i>Not only was Shen Shaoqian getting faces wrong, he was also confusing genders.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cI found out how the server got our numbers.\u201d Suyang lifted Shen Shaoqian\u2019s arm and revealed a list of numbers that were written down. It said, \u201cIf I\u2019m drunk, call these people.\u201d</p><br/><p>It took us a long time before we managed to carry him home. I watched the drunk Shen Shaoqian sleep on our couch. Just as I was about to cover him with a blanket, Suyang stopped me.</p><br/><p>He looked very serious, \u201cAlthough he\u2019s super annoying, you can\u2019t strangle him.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Who\u2019s the one who wants to strangle him?! </i></p><br/><p>*<i>Back to reality</i>*</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>I shook my head violently and pointed at Shen Shaonu. \u201cNo! I\u2019m not talk about Shen Shaoqian. I\u2019m talking about her!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

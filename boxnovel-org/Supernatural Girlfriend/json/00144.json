My memories were gradually coming back to me. <i>Last night while I was drunk, Suyang carried me back here!? I recalled seeing upside down elevator buttons\u2026. Oh God! Who could give me back my memories? </i></p><br/><p>*knock knock knock*. But there was no response from within.</p><br/><p><i>He\u2019s not home? But he said to meet here</i>\u2026. I stared at the password device at the door. <i>Was it still the same code? If he left it the same, then</i>\u2026.</p><br/><p>I was getting a bit emotional and pressed the code from three years ago. The door went \u201cka cha\u201d and opened.</p><br/><p>Suyang never changed the password. I was kind of touched. The moment I entered, there was a heart-shaped rose display in front of me. In addition, there were lit candles everywhere.</p><br/><p>Suyang was in a suit and stood right across from me with a bouquet of roses in his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2026.\u201d I was stunned. I wasn\u2019t sure how to respond to this type of scene. My words were stuck in my throat and it was tough for me to make any sounds.</p><br/><p>Suyang slowly walked over like a prince from a fairytale. Except, I wasn\u2019t a princess or Cinderella.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou left a letter for me three years ago. In the letter, you said perhaps we might reunite again in the springtime. I thought it would\u2019ve been in March when the flowers bloom. I didn\u2019t think it would be the springtime after three years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d I foolishly accepted the roses from Suyang. A second later, he had pulled me into his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cRegardless if it\u2019s March or three years later, the fact that you\u2019re back is the most important thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang wrapped his arms so tightly around me that I could hear his heart beating. Or perhaps, it was the sound of my own heart beat.</p><br/><p><i>Wait, so what is going on now?</i> I decided to sort out everything and lightly pushed him away. \u201cCan you tell me what\u2019s happening right now? Are you trying to get back with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026..no! Everything is happening too fast! I\u2019ve only been back for three days\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need time to get accustomed to it? If you want, I can chase you. We\u2019re working for the same company anyway. It\u2019s easy for us to see each other.\u201d Suyang casually stated.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah! The company!\u201d I destroyed the romantic atmosphere as I turned on the light, \u201cToday, I came here to discuss important matters with you. Can we pretend not to know each other when we\u2019re at work?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang nodded, \u201cWe can.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d <i>He agreed so easily? That doesn\u2019t seem like Suyang\u2019s style. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cBut..\u201d</p><br/><p><i>There was a condition. I knew it!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to move back here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re no longer in a relationship like three years ago. Why do I have to move back here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause\u2026.\u201d Suyang went to his room and pushed out a familiar looking luggage. \u201cYour luggage is already here. I have already checked you out of your hotel room.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow the hell did you do that?\u201d I was flabbergasted.</p><br/><p>\u201cSimple.\u201d Suyang took out my identity card from his pocket, \u201cWhen you weren\u2019t around, I went through your wallet and took out your identity card along with your bank card. Then, I smoothly helped you completed the checkout procedures.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was speechless. \u201cMr. Suyang, do you know that you\u2019re committing a crime? How dare you take my identity card and bank card without my consent? I can call the cops on you and get you arrested!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, are you going to call the cops and arrest me?\u201d Suyang tried to make an innocent face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t call the cops. Just give me back my stuff. We\u2019ll call it even.\u201d I was trying to bargain him like I would bargain with a child.</p><br/><p>Suyang shook his head like a rattle-drum. \u201cI guess you still don\u2019t understand my point\u2026 you haven\u2019t gotten any smarter in three years!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy point is, if you want me to keep our relationship a secret, you have to move back here. If not, then don\u2019t blame me if my mouth accidentally slip soon\u2026..\u201d He threatened with a cunning smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still the same as three years ago. All you know how to do is to threaten others!\u201d I refuted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for the compliment!\u201d Suyang went to the kitchen to grab a ladle to extinguish the candles one at a time. Meanwhile, he was speaking too, \u201cWhat a waste of my romantic gesture. You really don\u2019t want to be my girlfriend again?\u201d</p><br/><p>I sat on the couch and solemnly questioned Suyang, \u201cDon\u2019t you hate me? I left without saying a word.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHate you for what? At the time, it was obvious why you left. We just never talked about it. I already knew that day would come. I just didn\u2019t think it would\u2019ve happened so soon. I was caught off guard. Also, as I had predicted, we would meet again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what is our relationship now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows\u2026.?\u201d Suyang grinned at me in a naughty manner, \u201cBed buddies?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so inappropriate!\u201d I snapped at him as I gave him a killer glare, \u201cWhen are you going to grow up!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang left the last candle on. Then, he turned off the lights and ran to me. With his back facing me, he lifted his shirt up. \u201c<i>I\u2019m</i> inappropriate? Look at your glorious achievements from last night!\u201d</p><br/><p>The faint lighting from the candle revealed Suyang\u2019s back. It was covered in purple and red scratch marks.</p><br/><p>I guiltily stared at my nails. <i>How could it create so much damage? It has only been three days since I last cut my nails. </i></p><br/><p>I smacked Suyang\u2019s back and comforted him, \u201cAs a man, you can\u2019t even handle a little bit of pain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. I actually felt very overwhelmed from favour with the huge gift you gave me last night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened last night? I don\u2019t remember anything!\u201d I held onto my head. I had a headache the moment I tried to think about it.</p><br/><p>Suyang covered his mouth in shock. He was acting like those little maidens that were bullied in ancient times. He joined his thumb and his middle finger and extended the rest of his fingers as he pointed at me; squealing, \u201cYou dare to forget? You beast! You ate everything whole!!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Beast?!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cAre you playing with me? Put your girly fingers away! Holy moly. Has your brain been damage after three years?\u201d I ruthlessly smacked Suyang\u2019s fingers.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am teasing you.\u201d In a second, Suyang reverted back to normal, \u201cYes, we haven\u2019t seen each other in three years. I miss you so much that my brain is damaged.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang kept attacking me with sweet words. At this rate, I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to endure it.</p><br/><p>I lightly coughed twice. \u201cWho is the beast? You\u2019re the one who took advantage of the weak while I was drunk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame me. You were too eager. I was forced.\u201d Suyang shrugged his shoulders. He sounded like a skillful player.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re full of shit! \u2026.the same as you were back then!\u201d I changed the topic and began to look around the apartment. I walked to my old room, \u201cHere\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I opened the door and turned on the lights, I froze. My face darkened.</p><br/><p><i>Damn you! I caught you! You dare to blame me for being heartless? You changed my room into a study room! I guess he really enjoys living the single life! </i></p><br/><p><i>Wait, why am I getting so emotional? I can\u2019t show my emotions. Calm down! Calm down! I can\u2019t let Suyang see how affected I am! </i></p><br/><p>I pretended everything was fine as I turned off the room light. \u201cSo you changed my room into a study, eh?\u201d I coldly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did you change it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout a week or two after you left? I don\u2019t remember\u2026.\u201d While Suyang was thinking about it, I began to strangle his neck. I used all the strength I had, \u201cYou dare to say I\u2019m heartless? You changed my room into a study a week after I was gone!?!! Ahhhh!!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Was I seeing things? Why was Suyang smiling while he was being strangled?</i></p><br/><p>Seeing how he looked like he was going to suffocate, I released him, \u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m laughing at you. Verbally, you say you have no plans to get back with me. Yet, you care so much that I changed your room. What a liar! The drunk Lin Yixin is so much more honest than the sober Lin Yixin!\u201d Suyang smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just annoyed. It\u2019s understandable. Imagine if someone was totally in love with another person\u2026.but the moment she was gone, he changed her room\u2026.\u201d I began to interrogate. \u201cWhy did you change my room?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I decided!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDecided what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI decided that the room is no longer yours. When you return, we will never separate again.\u201d Suyang whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2026.\u201d Suddenly, I remembered something, \u201cGrandmother Meng. What would she say if she knew I was back? No, I can\u2019t stay here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, I turned around to grab my luggage to leave.</p><br/><p>Suyang rushed over to take my hand that was holding onto the luggage. \u201cGranny\u2026.\u201d He looked depressed, \u201cpassed away last year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGranny passed away last May.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Wow, I had to find out about this huge news through Suyang\u2019s mouth. I felt so bad. I couldn\u2019t raise my head because I was so ashamed.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2026.\u201d <i>I didn\u2019t purposely want to remind you of the pain</i>\u2026.I didn\u2019t end up saying that line.</p><br/><p>Suyang interrupted me, \u201cThree months after you left, I stopped writing. At the time, I hid in the study daily to read. I didn\u2019t care about anything else for a year and a half until granny became very ill.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer final wish was that I would get back on my feet and become strong again. So, she requested a close friend to help me contact the Xu Clan corporation. As you already know, I\u2019m no longer \u2018Du Yu\u2019. I\u2019m now the marketing manager for the Xu Clan corporation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you stop writing novels?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just felt like my fingers were weak. I couldn\u2019t type or hold onto a pen anymore.\u201d Suyang held onto my face and forcefully made me gaze into his eyes, \u201cThe moment you left, you took away all my inspirations and soul.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

But as the bullet was coming out, my brain didn\u2019t even think. My body reacted first. I naturally blocked it for him. </i></p><br/><p><i>When did I become so nimble? </i></p><br/><p><i>But I don\u2019t regret it. </i></p><br/><p><i>Finally, I\u2019ve done something I wouldn\u2019t regret\u2026.</i></p><br/><p>By the time I felt the intense pain on my chest, I had already fallen into Suyang\u2019s arms. Everything appeared more and more hazy. I couldn\u2019t tell if it were my tears or I was losing consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Yixin! Lin Yixin! Remain alert! Don\u2019t sleep!\u201d</p><br/><p>It has been a long time since I heard Suyang use my real name. He normally calls me \u201cGoldfish\u201d. Now that he was acting like this, it made me feel the severity of the situation.</p><br/><p>I have been shot.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t use my name\u2026 it sounds too serious\u2026.\u201d I managed to squeeze out those words as I raised my hand to touch Suyang\u2019s face. I felt something wet.</p><br/><p><i>He was crying? </i></p><br/><p><i>Why was he crying?</i></p><br/><p><i>Don\u2019t cry\u2026.you\u2026.</i></p><br/><p>This was the first time I\u2019ve seen Suyang\u2019s tears. It was more painful watching him cry than crying myself. Or perhaps, it was because of the pain I felt from the gunshot.</p><br/><p>I finally came to the realization that I didn\u2019t simply like him. I love him.</p><br/><p>Gradually, I began to lose consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine! I won\u2019t let anything happen to you!\u201d Suyang screamed into my ears. But it sounded so distant and far away.</p><br/><p><i>Silly, I\u2019m the one who wouldn\u2019t let anything happen to you\u2026. </i></p><br/><p>Before I completely lost consciousness, I secretly made a vow to Suyang \u2013 I must stay alive for his sake!</p><br/><p>\u2014-</p><br/><p>The gunshot wound was two centimeters from my heart. Because of those two centimeters, I lived.</p><br/><p>I was sitting on a chair in my ward as I watched my unconscious self on the hospital bed and snickered.</p><br/><p><i>I am experiencing the out-of-body experience\u2026.!</i></p><br/><p><i>Yes! I\u2019ve become a spirit!</i> Although my body still showed vital signs, my consciousness had floated out. I was in the same state as Sheyu once was.</p><br/><p>Regardless of how loudly I yelled, no one could hear me.<i> Ai\u2026..is this what ghosts normally experience? How boring</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>Suyang had already been by \u201cmy\u201d side for the entire day and night. He had never left. Since his back was facing me, I couldn\u2019t see his facial expressions.</p><br/><p>Suyang\u2019s proud waist was now curved like dazed wanderer. <i>Was he feeling guilty? </i></p><br/><p>The more Suyang was like this, the more my heart ached for him.</p><br/><p>This incident occurred because of my failure to think thoroughly. Obviously, I wouldn\u2019t have let Suyang taken the bullet\u2026</p><br/><p>I wanted to comfort him and hug him. I wanted to lightly pat his back and tell him it was fine. <i>I\u2019ve been by your side all this time. </i></p><br/><p>Yet, I couldn\u2019t do something so simple.</p><br/><p>I approached Suyang as I crouched by his side. I admired him and rested my chin on my hands. Since he wasn\u2019t aware of my existence, I could admire him from any direction.</p><br/><p>Suyang was no longer in a violent rage. Currently, he had reverted back to his calm self. But his pupils appeared to have lost a layer of some sort. It seemed so dim.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Yixin\u2026.\u201d Suyang began.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I was spooked and fell onto the ground. I thought Suyang could see me. I didn\u2019t blink at all as I waited for him to continue.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile you\u2019re asleep, I will say this once. Regardless of whether you could hear it or not, I\u2019m only going to say this once.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d <i>So he can\u2019t see me after all\u2026.</i></p><br/><p><i>Go and say whatever you want! I am listening!</i> I replied next to him. Except Suyang couldn\u2019t hear anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cI like you.\u201d Suyang\u2019s voice turned abnormally gentle. It was as if his voice had turned into a feather that was floating softly down into my lake.Then, *di*, there was a ripple.</p><br/><p>I remained frozen at my spot. I was at a loss for words. <i>Why was he suddenly confessing? Wait wait! Why was he doing it while I am unconscious? That\u2019s messed up. Was he only saying this because I am unconscious? He should be telling me this when I\u2019m conscious and awake! </i></p><br/><p>Right now, I desperately wanted to grab onto Suyang\u2019s collar and shake him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me this when I\u2019m awake, huh? This is such a serious issue!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIncluding your part, I\u2019m going to get it all back from the Chairman\u2019s family.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Falls apart* <i>Who the hell cares about the Chairman\u2019s family at this time?! </i>I rolled my eyes.</p><br/><p><i>The most important point was that Suyang had confessed to me!?! </i></p><br/><p><i>He said he likes me, right?! I haven\u2019t misheard?!</i></p><br/><p><i>Could I be hallucinating ever since I\u2019ve become a spirit?! Or maybe I was in an alternate universe?! Does a different Lin Yixin and Suyang exist in another world? </i></p><br/><p>I wanted to hear him say it again\u2026</p><br/><p>While I was praying to the Heavens, Suyang got up and gradually minimized the distance between us. Our lips were getting closer and closer\u2026</p><br/><p><i>He wants to kiss me? Not now! Hello!?!? I\u2019m over here! I\u2019m over here!!! </i></p><br/><p>I anxiously tried to seize Suyang\u2019s thigh, but I only managed to grab onto air.</p><br/><p>\u201cNoooo! Noooo! Noooo!!\u201d I screeched.</p><br/><p><i>At least do it when I could feel it!?!</i>\u2026. I wanted to cry but had no tears. I was so frustrated that I began to roll across the floor.</p><br/><p><i>Under these circumstances, there was no difference between kissing or not kissing!</i></p><br/><p>But fighting was useless. I blatantly glared as Suyang gave me a light kiss on the lips.</p><br/><p><i>My first kiss</i>\u2026. I covered my face.</p><br/><p><i>I had my first kiss without actually experiencing it. What a waste. </i></p><br/><p><i>On a brighter note, Suyang actually likes me? Damn\u2026 I had no idea! He hid it so well! Yet, I still caught him! Muahahaha. </i></p><br/><p>Thinking of this, I cunningly smiled at Suyang.</p><br/><p>He was gazing at \u201cme\u201d very lovingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I interrupting you guys?\u201d Following the sounds of the high heels, Mi Fan appeared. I was quite surprised to see her. I stood up and floated to her side.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was wondering when you would come.\u201d Suyang slowly got up. He was different from his usual polite self. His voice was very cold and the atmosphere changed drastically.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really need to be so guarded towards me? I didn\u2019t have anything to do with what happened to her.\u201d Mi Fan calmly replied. Then, she stepped forward, \u201cThis is the information you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang didn\u2019t take the stash of paper from Mi Fan. He coldly replied, \u201cYou have prepared it all along? Then why are you giving it to me now?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

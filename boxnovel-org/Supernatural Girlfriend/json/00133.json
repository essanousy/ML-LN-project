Anson was still moving on the ground. His brain wasn\u2019t shot, but his arm was. The bullet came from outside and shot the arm he used to hold the gun.</p><br/><p>Earlier, while we were in the car, I had secretly stuffed my cell phone in Suyang\u2019s hand. I hinted that he shouldn\u2019t argue with Xialing any longer.</p><br/><p>After Xialing confiscated Suyang\u2019s cell phone, Suyang was still able to use my phone to send a text message to the police officers he was familiar with. He texted them our location.</p><br/><p>So, the whole time, Suyang and I were trying to buy ourselves more time. Just as we thought we were done for, the cops showed up at a vital moment.</p><br/><p>After we were untied, the first thing I did was embrace Suyang. We nearly died and experienced something that only belonged to the two of us. Suyang\u2019s heart was pounding furiously. I could feel every single beat.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ok now. It\u2019s fine\u2026.\u201d Suyang quietly comforted me.</p><br/><p>I took a look at Anson. He was blankly staring at the ceiling. I also saw the gunshot wound on my arm. Deep down, I thought to myself, <i>Wow, not only have I gotten shot on my chest\u2026now I have a shot on my arm! What sins have I committed to deserve this? What kind of girl has so many gunshot wounds? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang, you\u2026.\u201d Suddenly, Anson seemed to have came back alive. His eyes looked like they were spitting fire.</p><br/><p>After Suyang and I were untied, Suyang\u2019s expression completely changed, \u201cBased on what happened to my parents and what happened just now, I will never forgive you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you just\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were correct. I was lying to you all along.\u201d Suyang icily responded.</p><br/><p>A drop of tear came out of Anson\u2019s eyes. After the cops helped him wrapped his wound, they lifted him up.</p><br/><p>I figured Suyang\u2019s statement will cause Anson misery for life.</p><br/><p>Before the cops took him away, Anson began to laugh like a madman. He stared at me, \u201cYou think you\u2019ve won? Actually, I won.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t understand what he meant until afterwards. \u2018Lin Yixin\u2019 was the one who was taken away!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>That day, I watched as \u201cI\u201d was taken away. For a long time, I wasn\u2019t able to snap out of it. Three days had gone by since Anson was arrested. Fortunately, after a lot of investigation, we accidentally discovered that Sheyu was the police officer watching over Anson.</p><br/><p>Based on the relationship we had with her in the past, Suyang was able to find out some stuff in regards to Anson\u2019s current status and future possibilities.</p><br/><p>Most likely, Sheyu was in shock. The good citizen Lin Yixin somehow ended up as one of the criminals she had to guard.</p><br/><p>By the time the police had shown up, Huaze Yuxiang and Xialing had already escaped. So, Anson was the only one who was arrested.</p><br/><p>I curled up at the corner of the couch as I bit my nails restlessly. My eyes couldn\u2019t help but continuously turned towards the clock that against the wall. Suyang had left over four hours ago.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, I heard someone pressing the password on the door. I swiftly got up from the couch and rushed to the entrance. As expected, it was Suyang. I ran and seized him by the arm, \u201cHow\u2019s everything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang\u2019s complexion didn\u2019t look good. My heart began to beat irregularly. \u201cIs it really bad? Are they going to press charges against \u2018Lin Yixin\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSheyu says if we don\u2019t wish to press charges, then the issue will pass. But right now, Anson isn\u2019t who we have to worry about. You\u2019re in bigger trouble. During the chaos, one of Sheyu\u2019s colleagues recognized \u2018Anson\u2019. Sheyu says that her colleague has been investigating Anson for a long time. At this rate, you\u2019re going to be in a lot of danger.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Anson was truly ruthless. After all this, he still wants me to pay for his crimes.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cThen, we better figure out a way to quickly switch our souls back!\u201d I lowered my head and thought about it, \u201cAnson is still in the hospital, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in a coma at the hospital. We could use this time to switch your souls back. Except\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Grandmother Meng ok?\u201d <i>I haven\u2019t actually seen Grandmother Meng since she had been rescued. I was ashamed to see her because she wouldn\u2019t have been in danger if it weren\u2019t for me.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cBased on my granny\u2019s condition, I don\u2019t think she will be able to help you. Granny has gone through a lot in her lifetime but she is quite old now, so she really needs to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang saw how depressed I was and gently caressed me. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll think of something. Even if you\u2019re a man for life, I\u2019ll accept it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I pressed my head on his shoulders and wailed in Anson\u2019s deep voice, \u201cNooooo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou make it sound like I\u2019m useless!\u201d Suddenly, Grandmother Meng barged in through the door like a boss.</p><br/><p>Suyang and I instantly leaped apart from each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother Meng, you\u2026..\u201d I exclaimed.</p><br/><p>The moment Grandmother Meng came in, she saw me as Anson. She came over and touched my face gently, \u201cOh child, you still look the same as back then. You didn\u2019t change at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t change at all? How come I felt like he changed a lot? If I didn\u2019t do a deep analysis, I wouldn\u2019t have recognized him.\u201d Suyang argued.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you know? You were a child back then! How would you remember?\u201d muttered Grandmother Meng.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother Meng\u2026 do you know who I am?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Suddenly, the gentle hand turned into a harsh punch. I was punched in the head, \u201cYou have no heart! I have helped you so much and you never once came to see me!?! I need to beat you up! You\u2019re a rude child!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother Meng! Calm down!\u201d I was trying to avoid her vicious attack as I begged for mercy. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t want to see you. It\u2019s because\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no face\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly child. Why not? Is it because of what I said to you previously? I\u2019m telling you! I still meant what I said. I won\u2019t agree to your relationship with Suyang!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know! Initially, I was planning to leave.\u201d At this point, I secretly peeked at Suyang. He seemed mad.</p><br/><p>On the contrary, Grandmother Meng beamed. She grabbed onto my hands, \u201cReally? You are going to leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a condition for me to switch your soul back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother Meng. I would never use Suyang as a condition for anything.\u201d I sincerely replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood! Since you\u2019re such a good girl, I\u2019ll help you get your body back no matter what! Honestly, when the child came to see me with your appearance, I already knew it was him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you figure it out?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>What? I thought it was very strange. Both Grandmother Meng and Suyang could tell the difference between me and Anson?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you forgotten? I have been in contact with ghosts all my life. I don\u2019t only see the outer appearance. Instead, I see the souls too. I can immediately tell when the soul and the physical appearance don\u2019t match. Plus, the child\u2019s aura is bad. I couldn\u2019t even pretend not to know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow. You\u2019re so pro. Unlike me\u2026.\u201d I whispered to myself.</p><br/><p>Grandmother Meng didn\u2019t hear me. She asked, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, the bigger question is, how can we swap the souls?\u201d Suyang brought us back on topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn order to swap souls, both parties\u2019 physical bodies and souls must be present. Or else things could go very wrong. I heard that the child is still in the hospital. But if we go to the hospital, there will be way too many people interrupting. It will not work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t take Anson out! There\u2019s a police officer watching over him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you guys discuss with Sheyu and let Anson out for\u2026..\u201d I looked at Grandmother Meng.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn hour!\u201d Grandmother Meng stated.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn hour! Can she let Anson go for an hour? Plus, right now, the person lying on the bed is not Anson. It\u2019s \u2018Lin Yixin\u2019! Didn\u2019t she say that as long as we don\u2019t want to pursue charges, she\u2019ll be fine? Lin Yixin doesn\u2019t have any criminal records! If Sheyu is in charge, she would be ok with it, right?\u201d I asked hopefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even bother. Sheyu is so stubborn. She won\u2019t let anyone get close to Lin Yixin until after she\u2019s awake. Sheyu refuses to release \u2018Lin Yixin\u2019 until she personally close the case and make a written record.\u201d</p><br/><p>I nervously bit my lip, \u201cIf Anson wakes up, he\u2019ll definitely send my physical body to jail by making up or admitting to all sorts of crimes! By the time he wakes up, it\u2019ll be too late!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, I thought of something, \u201cWhere is Xialing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Ever since she escaped with Huaze Yuxiang, we haven\u2019t heard from them. Honestly, I don\u2019t even know if she was on our side or Anson\u2019s. How could she have fallen into his own trap as his subordinate\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite sure Xialing was clueless at the time. Anson isn\u2019t a simple person to deal with. But since Xialing was his subordinate for so many years, she must be quite of value. Perhaps she could help us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYixin has a point.\u201d Grandmother Meng coolly pointed at me, \u201cHonestly, there are very few garbage supernatural people like her.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Grandmother Meng, your words hurt\u2026!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to find Xialing to help us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s missing. How could we find her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough she\u2019s missing, I have a way to contact her\u2026. \u201cI went over to the door and happened to see Xiazhi doing push-ups. I made eye contact with him and said, \u201cXiazhi, do you know where your sister is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiazhi froze and remained in the same position as he observed me. He was stunned. Then, the corner of his mouth curved into a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! What\u2019s wrong? Does my face frighten you?\u201d I waved my hand in front of him.</p><br/><p>Xiazhi shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould you help me locate her? I really have something important I need to discuss with her!\u201d I pressed my palms together in a begging position.</p><br/><p>Xiazhi understood my words and nodded. Then, he vanished. I think he went to find his sister. If Xiazhi spoke up for me, Xialing should be willing to help me.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

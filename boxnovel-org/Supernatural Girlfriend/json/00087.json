He was at least several levels higher than Suyang. I watched him peel the thin skin off. He was almost finished, but all the apple skin was still intact!</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t help but clap and praised, \u201cThat\u2019s amazing! Where did you learn how to peel apples so well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHere!\u201d Lu Zhengyang appeared a bit flustered from my compliment to him. His face was red as he handed the apple to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI accept your apology. But if you truly want to thank someone, you shouldn\u2019t be thanking me. To be honest, I wasn\u2019t much help to your father\u2019s case. You should thank Shaonu instead. She\u2019s the reason why Suyang and Shen Shaoqian paid any attention to this case.\u201d</p><br/><p>After pausing for a moment, I decided to continue, \u201cThere\u2019s another person you should thank. Do you know who it is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Zhengyang was silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of her that we managed to turn the tables. She gave us solid evidence. She\u2019s the reason why we managed to make the final blow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re still unwilling and unable to let go of the bitterness inside. It isn\u2019t easy. But she has already taken action to show her remorse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, I have already seen Mi Fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d <i>So fast?!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cYesterday, I went to see her. Although I cannot thoroughly forgive her, I know I must face her eventually.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve grown up! If your dad is aware of this, he will be very content.\u201d I actually said this to Lu Zhengyang, but my eyes were on Lu Wenxue. He was standing behind his son.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang brother!!\u201d I could hear Shen Shaonu\u2019s whiney voice from a distance. They were heading back.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?! A visitor? You\u2019re the one my sister stole my money for?! Come out, let\u2019s have a talk!\u201d The moment Shen Shaoqian walked in, he looked like he wanted to fight Lu Zhengyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026.\u201d Lu Zhengyang was clearly frightened by Shen Shaoqian. Before he could react, Shen Shaoqian dragged him out of the ward.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to stop them?\u201d I stared at the main culprit and reminded Shennu.</p><br/><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s fine. My brother can\u2019t fight against Zhengyang. I\u2019m not worried. Oh, Suyang brother, I haven\u2019t seen you in so long\u2026 I miss you!\u201d Shen Shaonu tiptoed towards Suyang and wanted to lean her head against his shoulder.</p><br/><p>But Suyang avoided her.</p><br/><p>*Cough cough* Shen Shaonu held onto the wall and coughed twice to loosen the awkwardness. \u201cOlder sister, after what happened, I have a whole new level of respect for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for having a whole new level of respect for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, from now on, whoever that bullies you, tell me! Aside from Suyang brother, I will help you deal with them!\u201d Shen Shaonu made an oath.</p><br/><p><i>But, Shaonu, there\u2019s no one else that bullies me aside from your Suyang brother\u2026? </i></p><br/><p>However, I didn\u2019t have enough guts to say it.</p><br/><p>Instead, I said, \u201cThank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Shen Shaonu remembered something and clapped her hands together, \u201cHas Lu Zhengyang told you that he likes you yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!??!!\u201d This news was too shocking. I had difficulties accepting it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 I guess he didn\u2019t tell you. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll help him tell you! That punk says he is a bit interested in you.\u201d</p><br/><p>I secretly watched for Suyang\u2019s reaction. Surprisingly, his face remained expressionless and calm; as if it was no big deal to him.</p><br/><p><i>Hey!? Currently, someone likes your girlfriend and you\u2019re not worried at all? Dude! Can you show me some concern here? </i></p><br/><p>Shen Shaoqian and Lu Zhengyang happened to walk in at this time. Lu Zhengyang anxiously went to cover Shen Shaonu\u2019s mouth, but it was too late.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what she said.. I\u2026. at the time, I was just casually saying it! Please don\u2019t misunderstand!\u201d Lu Zhengyang rushed to explain himself as he examined my reaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle bro, you\u2019re a step too late. They\u2019re already together. There isn\u2019t any room for a third member.\u201d Shen Shaoqian patted Lu Zhengyang\u2019s back to comfort him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho and who\u2019s together??!?!\u201d Shen Shaonu squeaked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe red faced patient on the bed and the black faced man standing next to her. Those two! What? Are you worried now that someone else is interested in your girlfriend? Don\u2019t worry about it. You still have enough potential to beat this punk. Although, in comparison to me, you\u2019re no match\u2026.\u201d Shen Shaoqian smiled cunningly at Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two are\u2026.\u201d Shen Shaonu covered her mouth and collapsed against the wall. It was as if Suyang and I had betrayed her. She screamed at me, \u201cI hate you! Don\u2019t ever let me see you again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, she ran out of the ward.</p><br/><p><i>Does she think she\u2019s in a Chinese drama?!</i></p><br/><p><i>One second ago, she swore she wouldn\u2019t allow anyone else to bully me. The next second\u2026. Aaaii, seriously, how could her love turn into hate so fast! </i></p><br/><p>Shen Shaoqian and Lu Zhengyang went to chase after Shen Shaonu. So now, it was only me and Suyang in the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you jealous?\u201d I directly asked. <i>Earlier, Shen Shaoqian said Suyang\u2019s face was black. How come I can\u2019t tell?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cJealous of what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJealous of the fact that Shaonu said Zhengyang likes me\u2026. Do you not feel anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going through puberty right now. He will develop feelings to any one of the opposite sex as long as they treat him well. Plus, he lost his mother at an early age. So, he probably has a thing for older women and may mistaken it as love rather than reliance. I can understand.\u201d Suyang calmly analyzed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of a speculative writer. Not bad!\u201d I applauded. <i>But, could Lu Zhengyang really have a thing for older women? </i>I couldn\u2019t help but recall the picture of Mi Fan and Lu Zhengyang together\u2026<i>err I don\u2019t think so? </i></p><br/><p>While I was being distracted, Suyang took the apple Lu Zhengyang had unpeeled for me and harshly bit on it. He didn\u2019t say a word.</p><br/><p>But based on his unusual behaviour, I could tell he was jealous. <i>Psssh. I have unmasked your true nature! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, what\u2019s the surprise you have prepared for me?\u201d I didn\u2019t want to talk about the other stuff anymore.</p><br/><p>The corners of Suyang\u2019s mouth curved into a smile, \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I was afraid Suyang was going to be a kissing maniac. So, I refused to close my eyes. \u201cJust take it out now! Hurry!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Was it roses? A ring? A cake?</i></p><br/><p>While N amount of items popped in my mind, Suyang happily pushed the surprise in front of my face.</p><br/><p>It instantly shattered all the romantic images I had.</p><br/><p><i>A wheelchair?</i></p><br/><p>He really knows how to tease me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Why is your expression so stiff? You don\u2019t like this present?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you giving me a wheelchair? What is that supposed to mean?\u201d I was furious, but I still tried to maintain my plastered smile.</p><br/><p>Suyang happily smiled, \u201cThe doctor says you can be discharged, but you can\u2019t walk too far. So when Shaoqian and I were choosing a gift for you, we both decided to get you this! What do you think? Doesn\u2019t it brighten your day?\u201d</p><br/><p>Haha.</p><br/><p>Suyang was taken by me. But, I finally understood why Shen Shaoqian was destined to be single.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

So she insisted on coming too.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing Suyang\u2019s explanation, I stared at the Shen siblings again. What a great \u201cpicture\u201d this was.</p><br/><p>Shen Shaonu looked like she wanted to slaughter me. She was biting her lips and her eyes were bulging. I hadn\u2019t seen her since the hospital incident. As for Shen Shaoqian, he was staring at the marble floor with no expression. Most likely, he was still hungover.</p><br/><p>After Suyang and I finished checking in, we met up again. Then, Shen Shaonu immediately announced, \u201cI forgot to buy medication for motion sickness. Can you buy it for me, Yixin sister?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d Suyang volunteered but I stopped him. I gave him the <i>I\u2019ll go</i> look. It was better that he stayed with them.</p><br/><p>If Suyang went to buy the medication, I would be left to deal with Shen Shaonu. She would definitely whine and claim that I betrayed her. I didn\u2019t want to hear her complain and express how much she loathed me. So while she was still calling me, \u201csister\u201d, I should just help her with her request.</p><br/><p>After buying the motion sickness medication, I ended up colliding full on with a woman wearing a mouth mask. The medication fell from my hands. The woman didn\u2019t say anything but disappeared through the crowd.</p><br/><p>I stared at the medication and felt kind of panicky. <i>Why was it that I felt as light as a feather after she crashed into me? </i></p><br/><p>I crouched down to pick up the medication.</p><br/><p><i>It was right in front of me, yet I couldn\u2019t touch it? What\u2019s going on? </i></p><br/><p>I tried to stand upright and gazed around my surroundings. Everything appeared very distorted. While things were swaying all around me, I noticed someone approaching from a distance. It was Suyang.</p><br/><p>Just as I was about to fall, he caught me. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMedication\u2026.\u201d I mumbled. My mental state was scattered as I pointed at the medication on the ground.</p><br/><p>Suyang picked up the medication and told me that Shen Shaoqian and Shen Shaonu had already boarded the flight.</p><br/><p>When we got on the flight, I disregarded Shen Shaonu\u2019s jealous eyes and leaned against Suyang. \u201cI think I have been overly stimulated. My body has gone overdraft.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>*chuckling* For some reason, I instinctively heard someone laughing. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cLuckily, I came to find you. I really can\u2019t leave you alone.\u201d Suyang gently lectured. \u201cWe still have quite a distance to go. Take a nap first.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know why I was so exhausted, but by the time I reopened my eyes, we had already arrived at Tokyo, Japan.</p><br/><p>My energy had returned and as the plane was parking, I tapped the seat in front of me. I asked Shen Shaonu, \u201cAre you alright? Do you feel motion sickness?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Shen Shaonu looked at me; fully alert.</p><br/><p><i>She was the one who said she needed medication for motion sickness. Psssh, I didn\u2019t see her eat it and she\u2019s fine nonetheless. I should\u2019ve expected it. </i></p><br/><p>On the contrary, next to me, Suyang\u2019s face was deathly pale and his eyes were still shut. His lips were pursed together and his eyebrows were crinkled. Everything indicated that he wasn\u2019t feeling well.</p><br/><p>After we got off the plane, it was as if all of Suyang\u2019s strength had been sucked out of him. He needed to hold onto me the whole time.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou ate medication for motion sickness, yet it seemed useless on you\u2026\u201d I sighed as I shook my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just want to hurry to the hotel and lay down for a bit\u2026.\u201d Suyang\u2019s eyes were closed as I led the way. I had no idea his motion sickness was so serious.</p><br/><p>Amongst the four of us, we had one with motion sickness, one depressed, one jealous to the point of explosion, and one normal person (me). We were awaiting for the arrival of a tour representative to pick us up from the airport.</p><br/><p>Soon, we noticed a woman holding a sign that stated, \u201cWelcome, Suyang, Lin Yixin and guests.\u201d She was waiting by the exit.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Lin Yixin.\u201d I went over to the representative as I introduced myself. Apparently, we were still 40 minutes away by car from the hotel. Deep down, I was wondering if Suyang could last until then.</p><br/><p>The 40 minutes was the longest and slowest 40 minutes of my life. Throughout the trip, Suyang was lying in my arms with his eyes tightly shut. From time to time, he would weakly ask, \u201cAre we there yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>We were staying at a privately owned Japanese hot spring hotel in the outskirts of Tokyo. From the exterior, there was already a traditional Japanese feel to it.</p><br/><p>But there was no time to explore right now. The moment the vehicle came to a stop, Suyang ran out like a wild horse towards the direction that the tour guide had pointed. He ran to the washroom and vomited everything in his stomach.</p><br/><p>Since it was the men\u2019s washroom, I could only anxiously ask from the outside, \u201cHow are you feeling? Do you feel any better?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang brother!!!!\u201d Shen Shaonu exclaimed. She was about to run inside, but I blocked her.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me!?! This is for men only! How can you enter as a woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t just allow Suyang brother to suffer and wait outside!\u201d Shen Shaonu was about to shove me and rush in when Suyang came out.</p><br/><p>Shen Shaonu wanted to hold onto him, but he ignored her and weakly leaned on me.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgggh!\u201d Shen Shaonu gave me a dirty look as she pouted and left.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you feel better now?\u201d I lightly patted his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm..\u201d Suyang responded feebly.</p><br/><p>Since Suyang was feeling slightly better, we went over to the hotel lounge to meet up with Shen Shaoqian and Shen Shaonu. Along the way, I saw a Japanese ghost uncle crouching on the streets. I accidentally made eye contact with him, and he began to follow us.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! What should we do? We have just arrived and now there\u2019s a weird ghost following us!\u201d I whispered to Suyang as I quickened our pace.</p><br/><p><i>I\u2019ve always heard there were many perverted and crazy old men in Japan. Could he be one of them? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.. I will protect you\u2026\u201d Suyang responded as he stretched out his words.</p><br/><p><i>Uh, who\u2019s protecting who? </i></p><br/><p>When we had arrived at the hotel lounge, the tour guide explained, \u201cI\u2019m your tour guide for the next few days. My name is Huaze Yuxiang. You may call me Huaze. I\u2019m Japanese, but I\u2019ve studied abroad in China before. So if you have any questions, feel free to ask me in Chinese. Next, I\u2019m going to be elaborating on our 5 days 4 nights itinerary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToday is November 7th and the tour will last until 7pm of the 11th. I\u2019m sure everyone is exhausted from the flight, right? After having the lunch prepared for us, you may return to your rooms and rest. Today is the day to relax. Go and enjoy the hot springs. Starting from tomorrow, we will be going to many major attractions. Some of the main ones include: Red Autumn Valley, Mount Fuji, a traditional religious festival, the Japanese Bridge, and a day of free activities.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAkihabara\u2026.\u201d Suyang murmured. I didn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>I looked around the hotel and noticed the Japanese uncle again. He was crouching at a corner smiling very perversely at me. Because I gave him another look, he was even more certain that I could see him now. So, he got up and started heading towards my direction.</p><br/><p>Subconsciously, I tightly grabbed hold of Suyang and quietly gritted through my teeth, \u201cNow, that Japanese uncle is heading towards us!\u201d</p><br/><p>In a matter of seconds, the uncle was already in front of my face as he crooked his head sideways and stared at me.</p><br/><p>Now, I could no longer concentrate on what the tour guide was saying. But I was still pretending like I was listening. My eyes were wandering all over the place as I tried to avoid making eye contact with the Japanese uncle again.</p><br/><p>Suyang couldn\u2019t see him, but his voice was still trembling. \u201cWhat the eyes doesn\u2019t see, the heart doesn\u2019t grieve over.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was so expected of Suyang. Despite being terrified of ghosts, he still had to pretend to sound wise.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah. We have an issue. Initially, you informed us only two of you would be coming. Then afterwards, you added another two people. Unfortunately, the hotel doesn\u2019t have any more single rooms available. We only have a Japanese style room. However, unlike other hotels, this Japanese style room has no bed. You would be sleeping directly on the floor. As a result, there\u2019s a lot of space. If you want, four of you guys could stay in one room.\u201d stated Huaze. \u201cSo, we have two single rooms and one Japanese style room available. Here are the cards. You guys can arrange amongst yourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Yixin sister and I can have our own rooms while the guys can share the Japanese style room. Sorry for the inconvenience, guys!\u201d Shen Shaonu rushed to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to be in the same room as Yixin\u2026\u201d Suyang trembled as he placed his head on my shoulder again. I was so shocked that I smacked him, \u201cWho said I want to be in the same room as you\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you scared that if you sleep alone, the Japanese uncle will watch you from the side?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

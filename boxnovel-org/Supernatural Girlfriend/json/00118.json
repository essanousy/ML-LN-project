After his statement, I felt goosebumps all over and no longer refuted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI object! I object you two staying in the same room together!\u201d Shen Shaonu stomped her feet. But before she could say anymore, Shen Shaoqian grabbed her by the collar and dragged her towards the direction of the single rooms.</p><br/><p>On his way, he was angrily muttering, \u201cYour Suyang brother and Yixin sister are a couple. What makes you think you could stop them from staying in the same room together? From the plane until now, they\u2019ve been all touchy and feely towards each other. They\u2019re not done showing off their love\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t have came. Who said this would help me heal? As a single dog, I feel even more depressed now\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>We could all hear Shen Shaoqian\u2019s bitterness.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Japanese style room is that way.\u201d Huaze pointed to the opposite direction of Shen Shaoqian. \u201cHave a great relaxing day. I\u2019m going to leave now. See you tomorrow morning at 9am sharp. We will be gathering here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he\u2026..still here?\u201d Suyang quietly asked me after Huaze left.</p><br/><p>I raised my head to take a peek. The Japanese uncle was standing next to Suyang. He remained unmoving as he continued to stare at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 he\u2019s still here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess that cannot be helped. Let\u2019s go then! I\u2019ll lead the way.\u201d Suyang covered my eyes with his hands so that I couldn\u2019t see the ghost. Then, under his guidance, we reached the Japanese style room.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m keeping my eyes shut the whole time, what\u2019s the point of coming? I can\u2019t even see anything\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat cannot be helped. Didn\u2019t you say you can see the ghost? Unless, you can pretend he doesn\u2019t exist\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt drained as I laid on the ground. \u201cHow could I pretend he doesn\u2019t exist? Just imagining his perverted eyes\u2026ugh!!!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Forget it. I still wanted to enjoy the scenery. </i>So, I decided to open my eyes.</p><br/><p><i>Huh? The Japanese uncle was gone!?! Was it because he lost us? Or he gave up? </i></p><br/><p>I was in a good mood again as I happily unpacked my luggage.</p><br/><p>The scenery of the room was great. The moment I opened the wooden window, there was a man-made brook. It was similar to what I had often seen in anime; once it was filled with water, it would tap and make a hollow, crisp sound on the bamboo.</p><br/><p>It was like a scene you would see from a dream.</p><br/><p>*gugu*\u2026. After going through such an agonizing morning, my stomach was rumbling from hunger.</p><br/><p>Someone knocked against the door. Then, a staff dressed in a kimono spoke a bunch of Japanese to us. I couldn\u2019t understand a single word. While I was thinking about how to respond, Suyang calmly replied back in fluent Japanese.</p><br/><p>After the Japanese lady left, my mouth was opened wide as I stared at Suyang, \u201cYou could speak Japanese?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so surprising about that? Your chin looks like it\u2019s about to fall off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat were you saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe told us that our lunch is ready. Let\u2019s go!\u201d Suyang got up and stood in front of me. He looked like a giant.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come you can speak Japanese?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang shrugged his shoulders. \u201cBecause I watch a lot of anime. Plus, when I was little, I studied in Japan before.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Wasn\u2019t he playing it down too much? Damn. Suyang is so talented! It\u2019s actually quite shocking to find out about his skills and abilities like this. </i></p><br/><p>I gave Suyang a thumbs up and praised, \u201cYou\u2019re the only person I will admire in this lifetime, Sensei!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too kind.\u201d Suyang had a proud smile on his face as he took huge strides towards the dining hall. \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019m starving!\u201d</p><br/><p>Our Japanese style lunch was much lighter than I expected, but it was still quite satisfying. After eating, I dragged my tired body back to my room to take a nap.</p><br/><p>But at around 5pm, Shen Shaonu suddenly entered the room while I was deep in my slumber. She was holding a basin as she loudly hollered, \u201cYixin sister! Let\u2019s go soak in the hot spring!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026..\u201d I had my face buried underneath my blanket, but Shen Shaonu lifted the blanket and ruthlessly dragged my arm to pull me out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026.Suyang! Shen Shaoqian! Save me!!! Shaonu is bullying me! Who can save me?!\u201d My eyes were still closed and my voice sounded hoarse from my sleep.</p><br/><p>\u201cPsssh! They\u2019re already gone! Yixin sister, let\u2019s hurry. I want to go to the hot springs while Suyang brother is still there!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a mixed spring\u2026 Shaonu, allow this sister to teach you. In the world, there are male public baths and there are female public baths.\u201d</p><br/><p>I sat in a lotus position as I uttered these meaningful and heartfelt words.</p><br/><p>Shen Shaonu crossed her arms and acted like a love-struck fool. She had a cunning smile on her face, \u201cI know. But I heard that the male and female Japanese public baths are only separated by a wall. The moment I imagine Suyang brother\u2019s naked body on the other side, I feel so emotional!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>People! Lady boss! If you don\u2019t block this girl now, your wall from your spa hotel will most likely be knocked down! </i></p><br/><p><i>If I could speak Japanese, I would definitely tell on her. </i></p><br/><p>Since I didn\u2019t have much of a reaction, Shen Shaonu narrowed her eyes and raised her nose at me, \u201cAlthough you and Suyang brother are together right now, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you guys will be together forever! I will keep pursuing him until I succeed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to wish us well! Sigh\u2026 do whatever you want. Since you\u2019ve made so much effort to wake me up, let\u2019s go and soak in the hot spring\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stood up and brought my towel and bath products as I followed behind Shen Shaonu and headed towards the hot springs.</p><br/><p>This was the first time I\u2019ve ever been to a Japanese hot spring. Most likely, there weren\u2019t many visitors in this hotel as Shen Shaonu and I were the only two people inside.</p><br/><p>The moment we entered, Shen Shaonu headed straight to the wall and shouted, \u201cSuyang brother, are you guys there?!\u201d</p><br/><p>No response.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang brother! Are you guys there?!\u201d Shen Shaonu attempted again as she knocked on the wall.</p><br/><p>Again, there was no response.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess they\u2019re finished.\u201d Then, Shen Shaonu turned around and resentfully glared at me, \u201cYixin sister, you were too slow! We\u2019re too late\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>No. They\u2019re probably still there. They\u2019re simply ignoring you. </i></p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t say that out loud though. I was afraid to hurt Shen Shaonu\u2019s maiden heart.</p><br/><p>I sat in the hot spring and placed my back lightly against the natural rock as I felt my body ascending along with the water vapor. I felt as if my stresses and thoughts were also evaporating; leaving behind only my relaxed self.</p><br/><p>While we were enjoying the whole spring to ourselves, another person came in.</p><br/><p>\u201cWah\u2026..!\u201d</p><br/><p>I could hear Shen Shaonu staring and gasping at the other individual. Just as I was about to teach her some manners, I also took a glimpse at the woman.</p><br/><p>Subconsciously, my mouth widened and I exclaimed, \u201cMother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her golden hair spilled over her shoulders and her five facial features were comparable to a fine china doll. Her blue eyes were like diamonds and her smooth skin was the colour of white milk. Based on my observations, her 3 sizes were 82/64/84..</p><br/><p><i>Was she human? Or were we dealing with a sexy fox that specialized in bewitching earthlings? </i></p><br/><p>For some strange reasons, she sat next to me when she could\u2019ve sat anywhere. I instantly felt very inferior and restless.</p><br/><p>\u201cPsshh\u2026.\u201d Looking at me, Shen Shaonu shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you psshing about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are both women, but the difference is substantial.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you a woman as well?\u201d I retorted.</p><br/><p>Shen Shaonu shook her head, \u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m still a teenager going through puberty. But Yixin sister, you\u2019ve already passed the age to develop. I reckon that it\u2019ll only be a downward spiral for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>I used my finger and flicked Shen Shaonu\u2019s forehead. Then I muttered quietly, \u201cWho told you I have stopped developing, huh? I still have a chance to grow, ok\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Darn it. Shen Shaonu actually heard me.</i></p><br/><p>My face was red and I remained silent. <i>Child, why are you so curious? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys are Chinese?\u201d The woman with the devil figure spoke up next to me. Shen Shaonu and I were stunned. Based on her appearances, we assumed she was a foreigner\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can speak Chinese?\u201d I asked; impressed.</p><br/><p>The beautiful woman smiled, \u201cMy mother is Chinese, and I grew up in China.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Ahh\u2026her smile! I feel tipsy\u2026!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cHello. My name is Shen Shaonu! You can just call me Shaonu. The woman next to me is an elder sister of mines. Her name is Lin Yixin.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>What elder sister</i>\u2026?! I gave Shen Shaonu a warning glare to keep her mouth shut.</p><br/><p>Currently, the three of us were sitting together. Shen Shaonu was sitting on my left, while the woman with the devil figure was sitting on my right.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Yixin. Shen Shaonu. I have memorized it. Hi, my name is Anna.\u201d Anna amiably extended her hand. I shook it. Based on how delicate she looked, I was surprised by how hard her grip was.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour skin is very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Anna didn\u2019t seem like she had any intentions of releasing my hand.</p><br/><p>I stared at her with my eyes opened wide, \u201cWhat? Yours is obviously much better\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, we heard a basin dropping from the other side of the wall. Shen Shaonu stretched her neck out like a giraffe as she stared at the wall. Then, she abandoned me and swam towards that direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you maintain it?\u201d Anna asked as her hand began to gradually move up my arm.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

But although he said \u201cplease\u201d, in actuality, he pressed me down onto the sofa vertically. After seeing him in real life, all my thoughts of flipping him over went out the window.</p><br/><p>I obediently and respectfully remained seated as I observed his every movements\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a reason for your late visit, Miss Lin?\u201d Wen Yihan was dressed in very comfortable clothing. This was probably his house.</p><br/><p><i>He already knew the reason, yet he was still asking! Humph! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cI already told you, I came to deliver mooncake. After all, we kind of know each other\u2026 no\u2026 I mean, I know Gao Jialan\u2026 it\u2019s Mid Autumn Festival, I came to visit her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re a visitor, you should have entered through the front doors with the owner\u2019s permission. But you?\u201d Wen Yihan was a bit speechless. Then, he continued, \u201cShe is already resting. Pregnant women need to sleep early if they want their babies to be healthy.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Even if you beat me up, I wouldn\u2019t believe you care about the baby\u2019s wellbeing!</i> I thought to myself.</p><br/><p>I stood up, \u201cGao Jialan and I are from the same orphanage. Since we\u2019re parentless, she\u2019s practically family. Mid Autumn Festival is a day where people are supposed to reunite with each other. Why can\u2019t we meet today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFamily? You haven\u2019t seen your \u2018family\u2019 for over a decade. You still consider her \u2018family\u2019?\u201d Wen Yihan\u2019s tone turned cold. \u201cAlso, I\u2019ve already told you. She\u2019s resting now. If you want to see her, wait until tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>I lit up, \u201cReally? If I wait until tomorrow, you\u2019ll let me see her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wen Yihan nodded. Then, he casually added another line, \u201cIf you\u2019re still here by tomorrow\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA-\u2026..are you going to report me to the police so they can lock me up?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>For a moment, I imagined myself being locked up with Shen Shaoqian. Aside from shame, I couldn\u2019t feel anything else. We were always the one slowing Suyang down. Now, Suyang was our only hope. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be sending you to the police station. But someone will escort you home soon.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>That was quite unexpected. I thought he would take this opportunity to crush me\u2026 I didn\u2019t think he would let me go so easily. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t help Gao Jialan anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Ah, so there was a condition.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cIs that your condition for releasing me? I knew it! You wealthy people always have so much drama! But this child is innocent. He doesn\u2019t know anything. Plus, the Wen clan had never acknowledged Gao Jialan. Why do you have to get rid of her? As long as you promise to release her, she will take her child and leave this place. She won\u2019t be competing with you and the Wen clan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did I ever say I am going to get rid of her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about the child?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe child cannot stay.\u201d Wen Yihan curtly responded. The certainty in his voice did not allow for any negotiation.</p><br/><p>Since I was already caught, I wasn\u2019t going to give up so easily. \u201cThis child is not a threat to you. Why must you be so cruel?\u201d I blurted.</p><br/><p>\u201cCruel\u2026.? In your eyes, what type of person do you think I am?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa?!\u201d I was a bit speechless by Wen Yihan\u2019s question.<i> In my eyes, he was definitely not a good person\u2026.he imprisoned Gao Jialan and wanted to get rid of her child. Most likely, Wen Yufan\u2019s car accident had something to do with him too\u2026 </i></p><br/><p><i>But should I tell the truth? </i></p><br/><p>I cautiously thought about it. But perhaps I was taking too long, because Wen Yihan became impatient. \u201cWhat? You don\u2019t have an evaluation of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do. But I\u2019m on Gao Jialan\u2019s side. Are you sure you want to hear my honest opinion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d <i>Fine, if worse comes to worse, I\u2019ll die. I\u2019m doing this for the child! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cAs I have mentioned earlier, I think you\u2019re a very cruel person\u2026.but don\u2019t misunderstand! I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re the vicious and merciless type of cruel\u2026 Not that type. You\u2019re just a bit cold and icy..your nature. Ah! No, not your nature\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p><i>How come my explanation was sounding more and more strange?</i></p><br/><p>Suddenly, an idea flashed in my mind. \u201cAh! I know! Why don\u2019t you and Gao Jialan sign some type of contract agreement stating that you\u2019ll let her give birth but she must give up all rights to inheritance. What do you think? That\u2019s a double win, no!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think she would agree to this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! I have a feeling she would do anything to keep this child.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wen Yihan nodded. I began to see a glimmer of hope.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good idea, but no.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not?!\u201d I wailed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know how hard it was for me to get to this position? I will not allow anyone to put my position at risk.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>This guy\u2026</i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about your brother? What about your family?\u201d<i> I don\u2019t know why I always say whatever that comes to my mind. I was the type that couldn\u2019t stop either</i>, \u201cWhat about those who are related to you by blood? In your eyes, are they merely all stumbling blocks to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will not deny your opinions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will not deny? So you admit it!? What if I told the chairman about Gao Jialan and the child\u2019s existence? What do you think will happen?\u201d I threatened.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already told me your plan. Aren\u2019t you worried I\u2019ll strike first to gain an upper hand?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Aiya! I forgot! Usually, on TV, those who spilled their plans will get killed\u2026 how could I make such a stupid mistake?! If that\u2019s the case, the violent storm will be even more intense! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t answered me. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the type that wouldn\u2019t think of an escape route.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you tell my father, this child still cannot stay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy must you view the child as your enemy? He isn\u2019t even born yet\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, I wanted to make a wild guess. I carefully tested, \u201cUmm\u2026 I heard you and Gao Jialan were high school classmates. Did you guys\u2026.have a past relationship or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Wen Yihan icily gave me a warning glare.</p><br/><p><i>Honestly, in my mind, I had already came up with a crazy family love drama. The uncle had fallen for this girl since high school. But he didn\u2019t dare to confess. Many years later, they reunited again but the woman was now his nephew\u2019s wife. So, he felt a fury of anger and wanted to eliminate their child. He swore to God that he would destroy the love that he was never able to attain</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys cannot save the child, but don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t harm Gao Jialan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you honestly think she could live without her child? Don\u2019t you know what a child means to a mother?\u201d I exploded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how cruel\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already said I know!\u201d For some strange reason, Wen Yihan suddenly roared at me. Then, he rushed over and pressed me against the sofa. His eyes were red like a ferocious beast. There was nowhere for me to run.</p><br/><p>Wen Yihan grabbed onto me as he lowered his voice and growled. \u201cI know a mother would do anything for her child; including risking her life.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>If you know then</i>\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy mother died seven years ago because she was trying to save me. Because of this, I must get rid of Gao Jialan\u2019s child. I may be killing a life, but at the same time, I\u2019m saving a life.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>What type of expression was this? Suddenly, Wen Yihan gave me the feeling as if he had lost the entire world\u2026</i></p><br/><p><i>In my eyes, he had always been a cold and ruthless man. But based on our conversation so far, why did it seem like there was something more going on\u2026? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA mother\u2019s love can save a person or kill a person. Why do you think Gao Jialan grew up in the orphanage?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

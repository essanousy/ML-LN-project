So, you\u2019ve decided to secretly enter my house now?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Oh no! It\u2019s over! It\u2019s over! Now, I only have one thought left on my mind. It looks like both Shen Shaoqian and I were f**ked. Except, my situation was even worse!</i></p><br/><p>I shakenly took out the mooncakes from my pocket. There were only two pieces left. They looked squished. I displayed the pieces to Wen Yihan with both my hands as I dryly laughed, \u201cHaha. If I told you I was here to deliver mooncake, would you believe me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d I pressed my dry lips together and looked at my watch. I laughed brainlessly and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not midnight yet. So, Happy Mid Autumn Festival!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Alright. I admit it. I\u2019m doomed</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>(This part is in Gao Jialan\u2019s POV while she was in high school)</p><br/><p>12 years ago, Gao Jialan was a senior at a high school. On that fateful day, she was the student on cleaning duty so she was by herself in the empty and spacious classroom. After tidying the classroom, she was ready to head home.</p><br/><p>It was the monsoon season of July and there hadn\u2019t been so much rain for the past ten years. The rain just happened to come out of nowhere. Coincidentally, it was on this day that Gao Jialan was carrying her most cherished doggy designed umbrella.</p><br/><p>But, she wasn\u2019t planning to use it. She was standing inside the school by the entrance as she stared into the rain. It was difficult to tell why she was so distracted. Her eyes were unfocused; it was as if her body and mind were separated.</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan will never forget that day.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a guy\u2019s voice appeared from her side. He overbearingly snatched the umbrella from her hand and brought her back to reality. The guy assertively stared her up and down and stated, \u201cGirl, it is raining too hard. Lend me your umbrella.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he roughly opened the umbrella. When he saw the dog designs all over it, his brows furrowed and he looked displeased.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo childish.\u201d He muttered. But still, the boy took the umbrella and ran off. Since the rain was too strong, his gangster back view quickly vanished like smoke.</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan was annoyed and unwilling to accept this. <i>Her beloved umbrella was stolen by an evil tyrant?</i> Even though he said he was going to \u201cborrow\u201d it, his method wasn\u2019t acceptable.</p><br/><p><i>Forget it. It wasn\u2019t worth forming a connection with this guy for an umbrella. </i></p><br/><p>So, Gao Jialan sat by the entrance and waited for the rain to finish. This type of rain shower was the type to arrive suddenly and disappear suddenly. However, since it was so fierce, anyone with an umbrella would be soaked regardless.</p><br/><p>Initially, she wanted to tell the guy that she was going to go home after the rain. But before she could tell him, he had already dashed off. Now, he could experience what it was like being soaked. That was his punishment for stealing her umbrella.</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan was bored and decided to review her lessons. She began to memorize what she learnt in class earlier today, \u201cA confident youngster raises his eyes to look at the sky; is comparable to a jade tree facing the wind.\u201d Gao Jialan quietly repeated the poetic line and thought of the boy that had just came by.</p><br/><p>She mumbled to herself, \u201cHe\u2019s such a irritable fool\u2026.but rather good looking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, Gao Jialan secretly smiled. As expected, the mind of teenage girls were hard to predict. A second ago, she was annoyed; yet a second later, she thought this random encounter was interesting.</p><br/><p>A week later, Gao Jialan accidentally slept in because her alarm clock had stopped working. By the time she had arrived at school, she had already missed two periods.</p><br/><p>Although she was an excellent student, she still had to abide by the school rules. Gao Jialan\u2019s teacher courteously told her to head to the corridor. While the other students weren\u2019t watching, the teacher quietly whispered to her, \u201cPlease forgive your teacher. I know you weren\u2019t late on purpose, but I must treat all students the same. I will have to trouble you to stand outside for the duration of one period.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan lowered her head. This was the first time she had ever been punished at school. She was going to take it as a life lesson. So now, she headed towards the punishment station with an expressionless face.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, there were already a group of students present. Some of them had piercings, wore short dresses, and tattoos\u2026 none of them looked like high school students.</p><br/><p>God truly wanted to test her.</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan scanned her eyes across the group and instantly recognized the guy who had taken her umbrella. Everyone around him were holding their backpacks on top of their heads as punishment.</p><br/><p>His expression looked like someone owed him six figures.</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan finally remembered that he was the class\u2019s troublemaker. He was one of the lowest ranking students and often came to class late and left early. Although they had been classmates for over a year and a half, she barely knew him.</p><br/><p><i>What was his name? Oh yeah\u2026 Han something\u2026. Wen Yihan\u2026!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cOh? You\u2019re being punished too?!\u201d Wen Yihan gave her a welcoming expression and drove the others away. He indicated for Gao Jialan to stand next to him.</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan ignored his invitation and stood at the very end of the line.</p><br/><p>Wen Yihan\u2019s friends snickered at him and Wen Yihan knocked them against the head. Then, he carried his backpack and walked over to Gao Jialan\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the person who lent me the pink umbrella, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm.\u201d Gao Jialan abruptly replied. She thought rather highly of herself and didn\u2019t want to associate with garbage like Wen Yihan. She didn\u2019t want to waste another line of conversation on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you get home last time? I had an umbrella but I was still drenched. Without an umbrella, weren\u2019t you in a worse position than I was?\u201d Wen Yihan wouldn\u2019t give up and continued the conversation.</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan was wondering if Wen Yihan lacked IQ. <i>Why must he bring this up? Fine, she\u2019ll go along with it.</i> \u201cTell me, why didn\u2019t I have an umbrella?! When are you returning it back to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour umbrella was gloriously sacrificed in the rain\u2026\u201d Wen Yihan shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it though. In a few days, I\u2019ll give you money to buy a new one.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>It was merely an umbrella. Wen Yihan made it seem like it was such a valuable item.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cForget it. I don\u2019t need you to return it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of which, where is your backpack?\u201d It wasn\u2019t until now that Gao Jialan realized every single person around her was holding a backpack above their heads.</p><br/><p><i>Most likely, her teacher didn\u2019t want her to suffer so she purposely let her off easily? </i>Thinking of this, Gao Jialan felt lucky on the inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get in trouble. We might be bad students, but at least come to school with a backpack?!\u201d All of a sudden, Wen Yihan was the one lecturing Gao Jialan instead. \u201cIf the teacher sees you without a backpack, he will increase the severity of your punishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Wen Yihan shoved his backpack towards Gao Jialan, \u201cUse mines.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d That was ridiculous.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m used to getting in trouble with the teachers.\u201d Wen Yihan was acting like a hero as he righteously declared.</p><br/><p><i>So now, he was helping her? </i>Gao Jialan\u2019s eyes were open wide. After a few seconds, she snapped out of it and politely rejected Wen Yihan\u2019s offer. \u201cKeep the backpack for yourself\u2026 I\u2019m fine without it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Last time, you lent me an umbrella. This time, I lent you my backpack. So now, we\u2019re even.\u201d Wen Yihan spoke as he placed the backpack above Gao Jialan\u2019s head. \u201cJust hold on. Don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t have many books in my bag. It\u2019s not that heavy.\u201d</p><br/><p>But the moment Wen Yihan released the backpack, Gao Jialan couldn\u2019t hold it up. Her arms couldn\u2019t handle such a heavy load and it immediately fell onto the ground. *bang*</p><br/><p><i>What kind of backpack makes that type of noise? That was clearly the sound of metal?! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so careless?\u201d Wen Yihan picked up his backpack with ease and handed it to Gao Jialan again. This time, Gao Jialan wouldn\u2019t accept.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you put inside?\u201d She blurted.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot much. I feel like books are too heavy, so I put two metal rods instead. A person in jianghu must be able to defend himself!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Unbelievable! He resented the books for being heavy so he replaced them with two metal rods? They were definitely not from the same world. </i>Gao Jialan gave up talking to Wen Yihan. Regardless of how he tried to continue the conversation, she ignored him.</p><br/><p>Finally, the 3rd period was over and Gao Jialan had permission to return back to her class.</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan breathed a sigh of relief. She no longer had to stand next to that weird guy. She didn\u2019t want anything to do with him.</p><br/><p>But fate was strange; the more you disliked something, the more it will appear.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

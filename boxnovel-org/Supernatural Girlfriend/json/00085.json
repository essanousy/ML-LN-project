He ran over with a concern look as he shoved Shen Shaoqian aside and placed his hand on my forehead and face.</p><br/><p>He began to mumble to himself, \u201cShe seems alright\u2026.why is she having a nosebleed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps the sounds of your shower triggered her?!\u201d Shen Shaoqian began to pinch my face, \u201cYou\u2019re actually awake, aren\u2019t you, Lin Yixin?\u201d He teased.</p><br/><p>I was still unconscious. <i>But how did this jerk figure out the cause of my nosebleed?! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cStop playing around!\u201d Suyang pushed Shen Shaoqian\u2019s hand off my face, \u201cAre you here to provoke the patient?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine fine fine, I won\u2019t touch her, ok?\u201d Shen Shaoqian pouted, \u201cBy the way, I have completed the task that you wanted me to do. Yet, because of a woman, you\u2019re speaking to me in such a cold manner. I am so hurt\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Shaoqian acted like an ancient maiden as he pretended to wipe his non-existent tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve convinced all of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Shaoqian shook his head, \u201cI didn\u2019t convince them. Xuduo was the only one who I convinced. I had to threaten the rest! I told Mo Xiaotian if she didn\u2019t help us, I will send the photo of her cheating to her husband. I told Ye Lili that if she didn\u2019t help us, then I will send her list of debts to her clients\u2026 so they thoroughly accepted defeat. Now, the moment you give me the command, the news will be exposed. This subject will definitely lead to a lot of public opinion!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa!\u201d Shen Shaoqian proudly made a cool pose. \u201cIn the end, you still need to rely on me to settle things\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was speechless by Shen Shaoqian\u2019s shamelessness. Suddenly, Shen Shaoqian turned towards the unconscious me and solemnly stated, \u201cXuduo said he was willing to help us because of Lin Yixin. Initially, he didn\u2019t want anything to do with Lu Wenxue. But since a stranger was so trusting to the point where she almost lost her life for Lu Wenxue, as an ex-student, he decided to trust his ex-teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Oh? So it turned out my attempt was successful after all? </i>After hearing Shen Shaoqian\u2019s words, my heart felt very warm and fuzzy.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Let\u2019s give the chairman\u2019s family a blow he will remember for life.\u201d Suddenly, Suyang\u2019s eyes darkened. This was drastically different from the poisonous tongue Suyang or the gentle and considerate Suyang I was so familiar with.</p><br/><p><i>Is this the Suyang that was ready for battle? </i></p><br/><p><i>He\u2019s so charming!</i></p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t control myself as I began to admire Suyang with my groggy eyes again. I will remember Suyang\u2019s hot expression for years to come.</p><br/><p>Suyang\u2019s procedural plan to destroy the chairman\u2019s family was as follows:</p><br/><p>The first step is to use Mo Xiaotian, Ye Lili, and Xuduo to create an online campaign to demonstrate Lu Wenxue\u2019s innocence. They were people who had quite a large following in society.</p><br/><p>The second step is to expose Lu Wenxue\u2019s life motto to the world.</p><br/><p>The third step is to expose the relationship between Lu Wenxue and Chairman Jicheng. The goal is to make others believe that Chairman Jicheng was responsible for this crime. It is crucial to strike when the wind and waves are the fiercest.</p><br/><p>The fourth step is to get Ye Lili to appeal Lu Wenxue\u2019s case since she\u2019s a lawyer. Then, get Chairman Jicheng\u2019s driver and subordinates to go against him with evidence.</p><br/><p>The fifth step is to order Chairman Jicheng to go to court. At this time, their stocks from their corporation will drop dramatically. They will suffer from a cash flow problem.</p><br/><p>The sixth and the most important step is to make Mi Fan appear in court as a witness to expose Chairman Jicheng as the true culprit of this case. She will expose the recordings she had of Chairman Jicheng and share all the evil things she had done for the family.</p><br/><p>The outcome has already been set in stone. Regardless of how powerful Chairman Jicheng may be, the evidence Mi Fan had against him were too real and undeniable. He will have no chance of making a comeback.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>Since Mi Fan fabricated a crime, she was taken into custody. Her sentencing will be determined at a later date\u2026</p><br/><p>However, because Director Rui still hadn\u2019t been caught, I was still unable to return back to my body. So, I attended the trial as a spirit.</p><br/><p>I will never forget Lu Zhengyang\u2019s tears when the court pronounced Chairman Jicheng as the true culprit and cleared Lu Wenxue\u2019s name. In addition, I will never forget the smile on Mi Fan\u2019s face. She was finally set free from her guilt.</p><br/><p>I was quite surprised by how smoothly Suyang\u2019s plan turned out. Originally, I kept thinking I had an advantage over him since I was able to communicate with Lu Wenxue face to face.</p><br/><p><i>Suyang was truly a murder mystery writer! Just my type! </i></p><br/><p>Hilarious enough, Director Rui was arrested on the 27th; the day of my birthday.</p><br/><p>When Mi Fan exposed Chairman Jicheng\u2019s misconduct, she also exposed Director Rui\u2019s crimes as well. Director Rui fired employees illegally, raped female subordinates, and took drugs. She also shared the incident between me and him.</p><br/><p>The reason why Director Rui was caught was because he couldn\u2019t handle his lack of sexual activity and contacted an ex-girlfriend of his. It turned out that the ex-girlfriend called the cops, so he was arrested.</p><br/><p>On this very day 26 years ago, I was born. 26 years later on this day, I was reborn.</p><br/><p>I had no idea when my spirit had returned to my body. But the moment I woke up, the first person I saw was Suyang.</p><br/><p>When I was a spirit, I was so worried that my memories would all disappear when I woke up. Luckily, I didn\u2019t lose all my memories like Sheyu. Suyang\u2019s kiss, words, and actions were all forever embedded in my mind.</p><br/><p>I had no idea how he remembered my birthday. Suyang actually prepared a cake for me. It was on the table and he currently had his eyes closed as he made a silent wish.</p><br/><p>I smiled and waited for him to notice me.</p><br/><p>When I opened my eyes again, Suyang made eye contact with me. His lips were trembling like he wanted to say something. But after a long time, he only managed to utter one line, \u201cYou\u2019re really awake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm..\u201d Since I haven\u2019t spoken \u201chuman\u201d language for so long, my throat was burning the moment I tried to make a sound. It wouldn\u2019t allow me to say anything else.</p><br/><p><i>Have I lost my ability to speak? </i>I was freaking out!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to talk yet. I\u2019m going to call the doctor. Don\u2019t move!\u201d Suyang was like a bunny as he bounced and leaped out of the ward.</p><br/><p>After the doctor had finish conducting some simple inspections, he nodded with satisfaction. \u201cYou\u2019re fine now. You\u2019ve healed very well these past few days. You are definitely blessed with good fortune!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Whew. So I was fine\u2026</i></p><br/><p>\u201cIs the cake prepared for me?\u201d After gulping down a cup of water, I was finally able to squeeze some words out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou walked around the gates of hell and now you\u2019re imagining things? I only bought it because I wanted to eat it.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Are you freaking serious? How could Suyang\u2019s attitude change so much the moment I woke up? At least, lie better? The cake has my name on it! Does he think I\u2019m blind? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cI want to eat\u2026.\u201d I gave him my puppy eyes as I weakly pointed to the cake.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! You\u2019ve just healed. You\u2019re not allowed to eat greasy and sweet stuff. Look at you! You barely have enough strength to open your eyes!\u201d Suyang refused my request.</p><br/><p><i>What?! I was trying to show him my puppy eyes! </i></p><br/><p>Since I looked so grumpy, Suyang tried to reassure me, \u201cWhen you\u2019re better, I\u2019ll buy you another cake\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang, while I was unconscious, I heard a line. I\u2019m not sure if it was in my dreams or if it was real\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat line?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA guy with a blurry face gently told me he liked me. He also kissed me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Suyang heard my words, he froze.</p><br/><p><i>Ahhhhh\u2026. It doesn\u2019t seem like a good time to bring this up. I regret it so much. Now, I had turned the warm atmosphere into an awkward atmosphere. </i></p><br/><p>So, I quickly shook my head and pretended to play stupid.</p><br/><p>*cough cough* \u201cI guess I was dreaming!?! Haha. Wow. I had an erotic dream while I was unconscious.. Haha! I guess I should\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould I kiss you?\u201d Suyang\u2019s expression suddenly turned very serious as he cut me off.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d I was at a loss for words as I stared at Suyang.</p><br/><p>Before I could react, Suyang got up from his seat and placed his right hand gently behind my neck. His red, luscious lips landed on my lips.</p><br/><p>I was welcomed by Suyang\u2019s scent.</p><br/><p>Although it was a very gentle approach, I was still blinking like a fool. I watched Suyang\u2019s trembling eyelashes.</p><br/><p>We were both newbies in the dating scene. We didn\u2019t know what steps to take next. So, only our lips touched.</p><br/><p>After a long time, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and lightly shoved Suyang away, \u201cWas this your first kiss?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Suyang cared too much about his face as he crossed his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Then how come you\u2019re so unskilled?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy first kiss was the time when I secretly kissed you\u2026.\u201d Suyang confessed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t count!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Well, then it is. It\u2019s also your first, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now, we finally understood why we were so awkward. After awhile, Suyang shook his head in embarrassment and I turned my head to avoid looking at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas the kiss in your dream like this?\u201d Suyang gently asked. He sounded like a cotton tickling my heart.</p><br/><p>I smiled, \u201cYes. You\u2019re as stiff as the guy in my dreams. No improvement at all\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Yixin, be my girlfriend!\u201d Suyang\u2019s eyes lit up like the universe. He gazed at me so deeply that I couldn\u2019t help but feel sucked in.</p><br/><p>It was as if I was under a spell. I smiled and truly wanted to be everything to Suyang, \u201cOk!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

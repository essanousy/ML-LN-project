I tried to dodge a little. Then, I seized an opportunity to stop her hand from continuing. I didn\u2019t know where to put my eyes. <i>We were both women, but why did it feel so awkward?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cYour body is amazing.\u201d I murmured.</p><br/><p>Perhaps Anna noticed I felt awkward, her eyes suddenly dimmed and she released my hand, \u201cOh, is that so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026.\u201d As I responded, I shifted closer towards Shen Shaonu\u2019s original spot. Then, I noticed that she was practically trying to drill herself through the wall.</p><br/><p><i>There was a stranger here. How much face does she plan to lose? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cYou should quit already! Regardless of how much you lean over, you won\u2019t be able to see anything!\u201d I yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho says?! What if God sends me a miracle? Perhaps the wall will collapse or something\u2026\u201d Shen Shaonu smiled with her thick skin.</p><br/><p>\u201cGod wouldn\u2019t waste a miracle on something so ridiculous. Just give up already!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI refuse! This is a great opportunity to see Suyang brother naked. The moment I imagine his white skin and firm muscles\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>As a High School student, doesn\u2019t she feel any any shame? I mean, if it was just me, whatever. But Anna was here too. Most likely, Shen Shaoqian and Suyang could hear us.</i></p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t help but imagine their current facial expressions and began to chuckle.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d Shen Shaonu turned around, \u201cYixin sister, does this remind you of something?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>To be honest, It does actually remind me of something. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cCould you\u2026.\u201d Shen Shaonu made an awful expression; as if she had swallowed a mosquito. She pointed at me with shaky fingers, \u201cCould you have already seen\u2026Suyang brother\u2019s\u2026.. You two\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I splashed water at Shen Shaonu.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo?!\u201d The child crooked her head at me as she fumed.</p><br/><p>I wanted to prove my innocence, \u201cOf course\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Wait, while I was a ghost, I did accidentally..well, it wasn\u2019t an accident, but I did see him naked\u2026did that count?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Shen Shaonu began to scream, \u201cYou\u2019re hesitating! How could you hesitate over such a simple question! I knew it! Ahhhh! My pure Suyang brother has been tarnished by a witch!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Shaonu began to howl. She completely disregarded the fact that a stranger was in the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop stop stop! I didn\u2019t! Stop thinking dirty! We didn\u2019t do anything! How do you know so much at such a young age, huh? Who taught you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy brother.\u201d Shen Shaonu replied.</p><br/><p>Then, we heard a loud and crisp slap from the male spring. There was also a painful cry of \u201cah!\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cYixin, you\u2019re vacationing Japan with your boyfriend?\u201d Anna asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, along with his friend and sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere have you gone so far?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe only arrived today. We haven\u2019t officially begun to tour around yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 then let me recommend you a place. Have you heard of the Asakusa Temple?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a mysterious smile on Anna\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>I shook my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, when I was in school, I often went to pray for blessings at the Asakusa Temple. Their prayers are quite effective, so I recommend you to go check it out if you want to have a wish granted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I have time, I\u2019ll definitely check it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason, I felt like there was something odd about Anna. Every so often, she would blatantly stare at my body and try to come in close contact with me.</p><br/><p><i>Oh God! Could she be a lesbian? Was she interested in me? </i></p><br/><p><i>I\u2019ve been told that Caucasians were very open in this regard. It was a bad idea for me to stay here any longer. Plus, I\u2019ve already been here long enough. </i></p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t have the courage to walk around naked in front of Anna. So the moment I stood up, I quickly wrapped my body around with a towel and bid farewell, \u201cI\u2019m going to go now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Shen Shaonu asked me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m done soaking. I\u2019m going to head out first.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I exited the spring, I happened to bump into Suyang. He was exiting from the male side.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a coincidence!\u201d I said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a coincidence. I came out because I could hear your voice.\u201d Suyang had his head lowered as he whispered, \u201cHurry. It would be bad if we bump into Shaonu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Shaonu is still trying to drill herself through the wall to look at your naked body\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang shook his head hopelessly, \u201cThat girl is learning all the bad things from Shen Shaoqian!\u201d</p><br/><p>After we left the hot springs, we went straight to the dining hall for our evening meal. Later on, we returned back to our room and I opened the window so that we could enjoy the gorgeous scenery outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not cold?\u201d Suyang came over and wrapped a quilt around me. Then out of nowhere, he took out a towel and began to help me dry my wet hair.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you catch wind while your hair is still wet, you might get sick.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang!\u201d I used a very serious tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m becoming more and more charming!\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately, Suyang lowered his eyes and gave me a look of disdain.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m serious! Earlier, when I was in the hot spring, the Anna woman was definitely interested in me!\u201d I excitedly told him my experience.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sick? Do you have a fever? Turning hot to the point where you\u2019re nuts?\u201d Suyang touched my forehead with his hand. He didn\u2019t believe me.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke around!\u201d I pushed his hand off.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s joking around. Are you nuts?\u201d Suyang rolled his eyes at me and dragged me back as he shut the window.</p><br/><p>I had my hands on my waist as I grumpily sat down on the ground, \u201cAre you implying that I have no charm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you prove to me whether you have charm or not?\u201d Suyang sat down and wrapped his hand around my waist. He planted a light kiss on my lips. He murmured, \u201cTonight\u2026.let\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSleep on your own side!\u201d With determination, I shoved him away. Then, I got up and filled all the cups in the room with water as I used them to create a line across the centre of the room. It was as if I was making a border between South and North Korea.</p><br/><p>Suyang obediently remained sitting on his side as he gave me a pitiful look.</p><br/><p><i>He was deliberately trying to make me feel bad\u2026 </i></p><br/><p><i>No, I must not fall for his trap. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cYou, stay over there! I\u2019ll be over here. We\u2019re sleeping separately!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>Huaze Yuxiang was going to take us on tour for three days. Coincidentally, the November religious festival turned out to be at the Asakusa Temple. It was the place that Anna had mentioned.</p><br/><p>That night, we were all dressed in traditional Japanese clothing. I purposely chose pink because it was a youthful colour. Suyang chose indigo blue.</p><br/><p>The moment we arrived at the Asakusa Temple, Suyang\u2019s expression became very sullen. I tugged his sleeves, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you feeling unwell?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. But in the past when I was studying in Japan, I would often come here. Their prayers are quite effective. Do you want to try?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Suyang\u2019s word sounded so familiar\u2026. Oh yeah, Anna also said it.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cWow, Anna also said the same thing when she recommended this place to me\u2026 \u201d I narrowed my eyes at Suyang, \u201cYou two have also studied in Japan. Could she be your childhood lover or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnna? I don\u2019t know her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the Caucasian girl I met yesterday at the hotel. Super beautiful!\u201d While we were talking about Anna, I suddenly saw a blond girl walked by me. <i>Wasn\u2019t she the Anna from yesterday? </i></p><br/><p>I enthusiastically dragged Suyang and headed towards Anna\u2019s direction. I tapped her on the shoulder and smiled, \u201cSuch a coincidence! We meet again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Anna seemed very shocked to see me. Her eyes were already big to begin with, but they grew bigger. She anxiously looked at me and then made eye contact with her friend. She turned to me and said in English, \u201cAh\u2026. Sorry, I can\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying. Do you know me?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>She couldn\u2019t understand me?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cWe met yesterday\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before I could say anymore, Suyang blocked me and responded in English, \u201cSorry, most likely, my girlfriend got the wrong person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like that, Anna disappeared from my field of vision. I was left alone in confusion as I turned towards Suyang; flabbergasted, \u201cCould I be suffering from face blindness?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>I was still staring at Anna\u2019s back view. I couldn\u2019t let go. It was clearly her\u2026 but how come she couldn\u2019t speak Chinese anymore? If only Shaonu was nearby\u2026then, she could help me figure this out. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cOk! Stop overthinking. Since we are here at this event, we should try to enjoy ourselves. The fireworks are going to start soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFireworks?\u201d I forgot about Anna and hugged Suyang, \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019re watching fireworks together. I\u2019m so happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang kissed me right on the lips, \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, I felt a blast of cold air behind me. It was as if someone was watching me. I hastily turned around but I only saw men and women dressed in Japanese traditional wear.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to quickly get to the location of the fireworks. Or else, we won\u2019t be able to get a good spot.\u201d Suyang didn\u2019t give me anymore time to fret as he grabbed my hand and led me towards the river bank.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

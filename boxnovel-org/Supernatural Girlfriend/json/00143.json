I-I have to escape!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Song Qianqian didn\u2019t understand Lin Yixin. She watched her stumbled her way out. Qianqian decided to hold onto her as much as she could, \u201cYou drank too much. I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I can walk by myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with her?\u201d Guo Zijun came out to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is drunk. I\u2019ll take her home first and come back later.\u201d Song Qianqian replied.</p><br/><p>Although Lin Yixin was drunk, she was sober enough to know that she could not allow anyone from the company to know that she was staying at a hotel. So, she continued to shake her head and yelled, \u201cNo! I can return myself! Both of you go back inside! See you tomorrow! Byeeeee!\u201d She waved and then left with her bag.</p><br/><p>After waiting for a long time, there were no signs of taxis anywhere. Lin Yixin leaned against a lamppost as she rolled her eyes and grumbled. \u201cWhat type of shitty place is this?! How could there be no taxis around!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Suyang was wandering the streets looking for Lin Yixin. He had parked his car in the parking lot by the work building. Currently, he was strolling along the street nearby.</p><br/><p><i>This street is filled with restaurants. If she\u2019s at a gathering, she\u2019s probably somewhere around here. </i></p><br/><p>As expected, in less than three minutes, Suyang found Lin Yixin leaning crookedly against a lamppost.</p><br/><p>Her body reeked of alcohol. Just as Lin Yixin was about to collapse and fall asleep onto the ground, Suyang caught her.</p><br/><p>Lin Yixin could feel someone holding onto her. She turned around and touched Suyang\u2019s face, \u201cWhat type of taxi driver are you? You\u2019re too slow! I\u2019m going to file a complaint!\u201d she slurred.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m your taxi driver?\u201d Suyang lightly laughed. \u201cClimb up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Yixin obediently got onto his back. She was in a great mood as she swung her two legs and hummed a song.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the streets and found a penny\u2026 then I handed it to the police officer\u2026\u201d Before she finished her song, she had already fallen asleep.</p><br/><p>Suyang chuckled. <em>His life was probably destined to be in Goldfish\u2019s hands forever. How could he find her so cute in this drunken state? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cWhere do you live now?\u201d Suyang wasn\u2019t sincere at all. He was whispering. Clearly, he didn\u2019t want Lin Yixin to hear.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to tell me, then I can only take you back to my place!\u201d Suyang continued to mumble. \u201cAlright. It has been decided! You can only blame yourself for not speaking up\u2026.\u201d Suyang couldn\u2019t help but praise himself. <i>He was truly a genius! A genius! </i></p><br/><p>He was still living where he used to live. The moment Suyang parked, Lin Yixin woke up. However, she thought she was still dreaming.</p><br/><p>The entire time, Suyang assumed they were going to have a romantic reunion. But the moment he carried Lin Yixin out of the car, she recognized the area and began to struggle out of his embrace. After she got out of his arms, Lin Yixin began to flap her arms up and down as she ran around in the parking lot.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh no! Oh no! Concubine Xiang has turned into a butterfly and flew away! Concubine Xiang has turned into a butterfly and flew away!\u201d</p><br/><p>It took a lot out of Suyang before he managed to restrain her and forced her to get into the building.</p><br/><p>Along the way, Lin Yixin was resting against Suyang\u2019s shoulders and excitedly shouting, \u201cOh! I know this place! This is Suyang\u2019s home! We have to take the elevator! There\u2019s an elevator! I used to live here. 27th floor! Yeah! Hurry and press 27th floor!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang touched his ear; it was heating up. The moment they entered the apartment, he threw Lin Yixin onto the couch before even taking off his shoes. He totally didn\u2019t care to treat the fairer sex well.</p><br/><p>Suyang massaged his sore arms. Then, he watched as Lin Yixin began to roll back and forth on the couch. <i>Too bad for her. He hadn\u2019t exercised for a long time. </i></p><br/><p>He sat next to Lin Yixin as he rested. But before he knew what was happening, Lin Yixin had climbed up and fell on top of him.</p><br/><p>She reeked of alcohol, but it wasn\u2019t a discomforting scent. In fact, it was very seductive and luring. Suyang observed Lin Yixin. Her eyes seemed kind of zoned out and her red lips were slightly opened. Her collarbone was faintly showing.</p><br/><p>He began, \u201cI feel like you\u2019re very different from three years ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?! In what ways?\u201d Lin Yixin had her hands wrapped around Suyang\u2019s neck as she sat upright and pushed herself closer towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve become more likeable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Emperor likes how you haven\u2019t seen the real world and states the truth.\u201d Lin Yixin grinned and she gave Suyang a rough kiss on the cheek. Since she was so intoxicated, she had no idea this was real life.</p><br/><p>Suyang decided to play along with her roleplay. \u201cI thank the Emperor for the compliment!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat! This Emperor has decided to bestow you the title of Empress. From now on, you\u2019re the biggest boss of this Emperor\u2019s harem!\u201d Lin Yixin proudly bragged.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis concubine wants to ask your Majesty how many sisters does she have to live with?\u201d Suyang shifted his face closer towards Lin Yixin.</p><br/><p>Lin Yixin humphed, \u201cThis Emperor only wants one cup of water.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thirsty?\u201d Suyang stood up. He was about to pour Lin Yixin a cup of water. But, she tugged his arm and stopped him from moving. Then, Lin Yixin fell against him on the couch. She laid on top of him and looked down as she lightly purred on his lips, \u201cI mean, I will choose a spoonful of water from the whole ocean.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang was the face she had thought of day and night. Since the alcohol had numbed her brain, Lin Yixin was purely following her subconscious desire as she passionately kissed Suyang.</p><br/><p>At first, it was very gentle. But in no time, their tongues began to tangle. She knew it wasn\u2019t a dream anymore. It was real. The man she had been craving for all along was in front of her. She continued kissing until she ran out of oxygen. Then, she got up and boastfully gazed at Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour kissing technique has improved.\u201d Suyang murmured.</p><br/><p>Lin Yixin chuckled, \u201cOf course! This Emperor had not wasted his years doing nothing! Do you know what I have been doing all these years?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang stood up and candidly carried Lin Yixin into his bedroom. \u201cOh? I want to know what you\u2019ve been doing these past few years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Yixin was worried she would fall off, so she wrapped her arms around his neck tighter. Then, she placed her head against Suyang\u2019s chest as she angrily muttered, \u201cHow could you not know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in three years. How would I know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStupid!\u201d Lin Yixin was thrown onto the bed. She closed her eyes and had her hands supporting her face, \u201cThese past three years I\u2019ve been\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBusy missing you\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Suyang heard her response, he was very satisfied. He gently removed Lin Yixin\u2019s hands from her face as he brushed the hair away from her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too. These past three years, I\u2019ve been busy thinking of you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?!\u201d Lin Yixin looked troubled, \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you come find me? Why didn\u2019t you call me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was afraid to leave. I was afraid you would come find me while I was gone.\u201d Suyang whispered. Then, he slowly kissed Lin Yixin as his hands began to swim all over her body.</p><br/><p>Lin Yixin no longer tried to avoid the physical contact like she had three years ago. Instead, she welcomed Suyang\u2019s advances. The two of them gradually took off their clothes.</p><br/><p>Lin Yixin happened to touch something hard. Then, she used all her strength and smacked her hand against the light switch.</p><br/><p>The lights in the room instantly turned off. Suyang was a bit spooked and he stopped what he was doing.</p><br/><p>Lin Yixin was panting; her face flushed. \u201cIt\u2019s better with the lights off\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI got it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, no more words were spoken. Instead, slow moans and raspy gasps continued throughout the whole night.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

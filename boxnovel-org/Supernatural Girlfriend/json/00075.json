The way he analyzed was different from me. I had the tendency to incorporate my own biases and emotions when coming up with conclusions. Whereas, Suyang used a spectator perspective. He would arrange all the clues before carefully examining them.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang, were you part of the police department previously?\u201d I asked out of curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, why?\u201d Perhaps he was astonished by my admiring gaze as he lightly coughed twice.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I just feel like the way you organize your thoughts is very professional; just like a detective!\u201d I had both my hands on my chin as I gave him an idolized look.</p><br/><p>Suyang proudly smiled, \u201cHave you forgotten who I am? I\u2019m a speculative author!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah! I\u2019m speechless!\u201d Seeing how Suyang was so full of himself, all my admiration vanished without a trace. All I had left were sarcastic words.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo who are these people?\u201d I took out the profiles of those I hadn\u2019t seen before. <i>They seemed like random strangers that were passing by. How were they related to the case? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cThey are either experts or influential people around this territory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are they related to this case?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re Lu Wenxue\u2019s ex students. They must know Lu Wenxue\u2019s character. If they are willing to step out and say a few words for Lu Wenxue, there would be some influence and we may have a chance of success.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to go against the Jingrui corporation?\u201d I blurted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Are you afraid?\u201d</p><br/><p>I shook my head. \u201cWhat is there to be afraid of? Those who are the most dangerous are people like myself. Since we have nothing, there\u2019s nothing for us to lose. However, as an author, aren\u2019t you afraid to be blacklisted?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlacklisted? Before you can blacklist me, you better get through Shen Shaoqian. Don\u2019t underestimate him. He has quite a powerful background.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. No wonder you\u2019re so brave, boss. You have backup, so you can afford to be righteous.\u201d I lightly teased. \u201cBut when the incident happened, no one stepped out for Lu Wenxue. What makes you think they will do so now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang placed his arm over my shoulder as he solemnly stated, \u201cGoldfish\u2026 since you want to take part in this, it is your responsibility to get these three to help us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy responsibility?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cConvince them to speak up. I believe you can do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you assign me something else? I have never met those three before. I would probably have a better chance of going after him.\u201d</p><br/><p>I flaunted Director Rui\u2019s business card in front of Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you have Director Rui\u2019s card?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you. I was present while he was eating with Mi Fan earlier. It was a coincidence, but they thought I was a server from the Jingrui hotel. That\u2019s why I was able to overhear their conversation. Before he left the room, he made a sexual move on me. Then, he gave me his name card. Oh yeah, Director Rui knows of you and warned Mi Fan to watch out for you\u2026. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t meet her anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>I secretly added the last line since it was my wish.</p><br/><p>\u201cSexual move?!\u201d Suyang raised his voice.</p><br/><p><i>Was that the main point?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cLower your voice! He said I was pretty and he will be waiting for me to contact him at night. I can\u2019t help it. Since I\u2019m such a pretty girl, I\u2019m admired wherever I go. So troublesome\u2026.\u201d I batted my eyes and flipped my hair shamelessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think Director Rui\u2019s eyes must be slanted.\u201d Suyang heartlessly teared my confidence apart.</p><br/><p>\u201cPsssh\u2026 anyway, why don\u2019t we split the tasks. You are responsible for Mi Fan while I am responsible for Director Rui. Perhaps I\u2019ll get to the bottom of this faster than you can! After all, I feel like Director Rui doesn\u2019t have much of a brain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe might not have a brain, but you\u2019re even more brainless than him!\u201d Suyang harshly jabbed his finger at my brain, \u201cBefore you can trick him, he would\u2019ve already swallowed you whole! He\u2019s a dangerous person. Don\u2019t be a fool and try to get close to him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026 what he did to me today was rather frivolous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAllow me to demonstrate!\u201d Then, I turned Suyang\u2019s body around and stood on top of the couch as I imitated Director Rui\u2019s movement. First, I bent down my waist and lowered my head towards Suyang\u2019s shoulder. Then, I lightly whispered into his ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, he stood behind me and whispered in my ears\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>To make it more realistic, I blew air into Suyang\u2019s ear and made him feel goosebumps all over. He shivered.</p><br/><p>Hehe. Fine. I was purposely trying to flirt and tease him. For some reason, I really enjoyed making him flustered.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, before he left, he pinched my butt!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe pinched your butt?!\u201d It looked like Suyang\u2019s green veins were about to pop out. His eyes looked like they were about to blast out fire. Suyang aggressively snatched the name card from my hand and crumpled it as he threw it into the garbage.</p><br/><p><i>Three point shot! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, you\u2019re going to bed? You don\u2019t want to see my demonstration anymore?\u201d I called out as Suyang stormed back to his room. It was actually quite fun being teased and teasing Suyang.</p><br/><p>Just as I was reminiscing, Suyang suddenly came back out and took off his outer shirt. \u201cDisgusting! I can\u2019t wait until tomorrow. Wash it now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he slammed the door.</p><br/><p>I frowned. <i>If he thought it was gross, then why didn\u2019t he push me away while I was drooling? Ugghh</i>\u2026</p><br/><p><i>No one told him to remain there while I drooled! </i></p><br/><p>Anyhow, after some deep reflection, I decided to listen to Suyang and not mess with Director Rui. After all, I wasn\u2019t stupid and I could tell what type of person Director Rui was. Currently, he wasn\u2019t someone I could afford to mess with.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>It was a fine sunny day; the perfect day to find people.</p><br/><p>I had Suyang\u2019s profiles in my hand as I decided to pay a visit to Lu Wenxue\u2019s three ex students.</p><br/><p>Mo Xiaotian was a top outstanding graduate of a prestigious University. She was married to a CEO of a listed company and now she was extremely wealthy.</p><br/><p>Ye Lili was one of the most sought after lawyers today. She specialized in helping rich people with private consultation. Lastly, Xuduo was an ordinary white collar worker. Last week, he donated bone marrow to a child with leukemia and saved his life. Many newspapers reported it. Based on the search results, he may have the biggest influential power.</p><br/><p>He seemed to be the best person to start off with. Since he was an ordinary white collar worker, he would be the easiest person to approach. Also, if he was willing to donate bone marrow to a stranger, he must be rather kind.</p><br/><p>Anyhow, I had no idea where Suyang found all this information. He had all the addresses, phone numbers, and even their workplaces written down.</p><br/><p>Modern people truly have no privacy.</p><br/><p><i>Today was Sunday, they should be home, right? </i></p><br/><p>Just as I was about to walk towards the bus stop, a cool and wild Lamborghini I had never seen before stopped in front of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Seeing this flashy car, the level of my disgust was raised by ten thousand percentage points. Thinking, who would be so boastful?</p><br/><p>As expected, it was him.</p><br/><p>Shen Shaoqian pressed down the window as he smiled at me with his sunglasses on, \u201cWhere are you going? I\u2019ll drive you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo thanks. I can take public transportation.\u201d I walked by his car pretending I didn\u2019t know him as I headed towards the bus stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! Don\u2019t reject my kind offer. Just let me take you there!\u201d Shen Shaoqian drove in turtle speed as he followed me. \u201cAt the same time, you can experience my new car! When we\u2019re on the highway, you\u2019ll feel like wind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to feel like wind. And the speed of this street is 60km/hour. How can you drive so quickly? Do you want a ticket?\u201d I kindly reminded this \u201cfriend\u201d of mines.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop with the bullshit and get on!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang is the one who asked you to come, right? He wants you to monitor my moves and not spy on Director Rui?\u201d I was a smart girl. I could tell what was going on immediately.</p><br/><p>Shen Shaoqian clapped his hands and nodded, \u201cYou\u2019re correct! I guess you have become smarter ever since spending more time with Suyang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t become smarter because of Suyang. I was already smart, ok?\u201d I rolled my eyes at Shen Shaoqian, \u201cIf not, why haven\u2019t you become smarter since you\u2019ve been friends with him for all these years?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa! Now you\u2019ve also learnt how to insults others from Suyang, eh? Don\u2019t forget. If it weren\u2019t for me, the two of you wouldn\u2019t be living together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes yes yes. It\u2019s all because of you. Because of you, I\u2019m always in deep waters and scorching fires. Thanks to you, I am living a life of slavery!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh..don\u2019t say that! Your salary is quite high, no? Plus, you have a lot of free time. You can always take a walk and do your own thing. You should be thanking me.\u201d</p><br/><p>I finally arrived at the bus stop, but Shen Shaoqian was still beside me. He stopped right in front of the bus area where only buses were allowed to stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I won\u2019t be so stupid to look for Director Rui. Just tell Suyang no need to worry.\u201d It was quite awkward since I could feel many eyes on me and Shen Shaoqian. <i>It was because of his flashy car\u2026. </i></p><br/><p><i>I felt like I was losing face\u2026</i></p><br/><p>\u201cHurry and leave! This is for the buses only. You can\u2019t stop here. Go go go!\u201d I looked at a distance and avoided Shen Shaoqian\u2019s eyes as I waved my hands in the air to indicate for him to leave.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

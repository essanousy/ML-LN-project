The fragrance of flowers gradually transmitted into the room. The wind loosened my hair and touched the left side of my face. Subconsciously, it made me feel a bit itchy and I wanted to scratch myself. But Suyang grabbed my left hand just as I was about to raise it.</p><br/><p>His whole body enveloped around me. The second button of his shirt had came undone mysteriously; revealing his white collarbone that happened to be aligned with my line of sight.</p><br/><p><i>How could a man be as pale as him? He was nearly transparent?!</i></p><br/><p>As Suyang spoke, his Adam\u2019s apple rolled up and down. I was fascinated as I stared and listened to his silky voice, \u201cFirstly, make some efforts in your choice of clothing. Secondly, concentrate in class. Ideally, make eye contact with me. Thirdly, smile more. Fourthly\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang paused for a second. Then, he reached behind my head and lightly tugged onto my rubber band. My ponytail came undone and my hair spilled over my shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour hair looks better this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>My right hand was tightly gripping the table. I didn\u2019t know how to respond.</p><br/><p>Suyang gradually came closer. I tried to inch away as I attentively watched his pupils drawing near. I shifted my focus onto his rosy lips\u2026</p><br/><p><i>What was I thinking?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d Suyang crooked his head, \u201cfeel hot?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? No\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour face is super red. You\u2019re not hot?! Do you have a fever?!\u201d Suyang suddenly took a few steps back. He covered his mouth and nose, \u201cIf you have a fever, don\u2019t infect me!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>What fever</i>\u2026.I placed my hands on my blushing cheeks, \u201cUmm\u2026the office is a bit hot\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I left the table and walked towards the window. I leaned out to breathe in fresh air.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you remember the four points I mentioned?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFour points?\u201d Earlier, I was so focused on watching Suyang that nothing he said had entered my mind. I shifted my vision onto the ground outside, \u201cAh\u2026four points. I r-remember.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak the truth! You\u2019ve forgotten already, correct?\u201d Suyang saw right through me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026.\u201d I turned around and laughed awkwardly. I raised up my forefinger, \u201cOne more time\u2026 just repeat once more!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang icily smiled, \u201cYour Goldfish title is truly well deserved. How am I supposed to feel anything if you\u2019re always like this?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbsolutely! Yes yes yes, I\u2019m so stupid that you cannot fall for me. So what should we do now? I\u2019ll do whatever you want.\u201d Unintentionally, I happened to cast a glance outside and noticed Kevin walking by.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt this rate, this is not going to work\u2026 forget about the teacher student relationship, let\u2019s go on a date!\u201d Suyang blurted. His explosive statement shocked me so much that my arm almost slipped twice from the window ledge.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Are you crazy? What nonsense are you speaking!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. Let\u2019s try to go on a date. At least, we\u2019ll see each other as the opposite sex.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>I have never\u2026.wait! Is he implying that he never sees me as a woman? </i></p><br/><p>Kevin was about to disappear from my horizon. I have things I wanted to ask him. So, I ran to Suyang and patted him on the shoulder, \u201cBoss, continue to think of a constructive plan we can implement. I have something urgent to do, so I have to go now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoldfish! Lin Yi\u2026.Your boss is talking to you. How dare you not listen?!\u201d Suyang angrily yelled behind me. But his voice got cut off once I shut the door.</p><br/><p>I quickly ran down the stairs and managed to catch Kevin right before he disappeared. I loudly called out to stop him. It was rare to see him without Xu Weishan around. I clasped my hands behind me and appeared very cheerful, \u201cWow, what a coincidence! Where are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNowhere in particular. I\u2019m just going to the basketball court to play ball.\u201d Kevin took a look at where I came out from and asked, \u201cWere you at Professor Su\u2019s office?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d Based on my memory, Kevin didn\u2019t take Suyang\u2019s course.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, this is where Professor Su\u2019s office is located, so clearly you came from there!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell? Suyang isn\u2019t the only professor here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kevin nudged me with his shoulder, \u201cLook at you. We call him Professor Su, yet you call him Suyang\u2026. Plus, last time, Shanshan and I have already decided to help you two keep the secret.\u201d He teased.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026..\u201d I had almost forgotten that Kevin was one of the witnesses from the incident at the hotel. \u201cWe only spoke for a bit, but now I have nothing to do\u2026 so bored\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I stood closer to Kevin as I brightly smiled and waited for him to continue. A fool would be able to tell I was hinting, \u201cI\u2019m bored! Whatever you\u2019re doing, bring me along!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kevin looked at me and then whispered in my ears, \u201cWere you and Professor Su speaking words of love to each other?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d For a second, I thought he was a certain sister from the gossip association! If it weren\u2019t for the fact I was trying to break into the internal enemy\u2019s side, I would never give any attention to this lousy kid!</p><br/><p>Deep down, I rolled my eyes. But on the surface, i was smiling as I tried to demonstrate my most youthful side, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about me and Suyang\u2026er..Professor Su. Oh yeah, you\u2019re heading to the basketball court. Is it outdoors or indoors?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s indoors. I am going to practice my skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>I clapped my hands, \u201cWhat a coincidence! I heard the basketball association is looking to recruit an assistant. I want to try out, but I don\u2019t know where the basketball association office is. Let\u2019s go together!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? I didn\u2019t hear anything about recruiting an assistant\u2026.\u201d Kevin tilted his head as he murmured to himself.</p><br/><p>Actually, that was a random comment. Why would I know anything about the basketball association?</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Kevin wasn\u2019t suspicious. He had his heart set on asking about me and Suyang. He went as far as making a solemn vow to reassure me, \u201cDo not worry. I swear to God I will keep your relationship with Professor Su a secret. So, tell me about it! How did you two meet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026we just met! How did you and Xu Weishan meet?! How long have you two been together?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe also met naturally\u2026 there\u2019s nothing more to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked such a simple question, yet Kevin totally disregarded it. I felt like he didn\u2019t want to talk about Xu Weishan. Was it because he could tell the current Xu Weishan was different from the old one? Perhaps he was stressed about it?</p><br/><p>Anyhow, I wanted to find out more about Kevin and Xu Weishan, but Kevin wanted to know more about me and Suyang. Ultimately, neither of us were able to obtain any important information from each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come Xu Weishan isn\u2019t with you today? Aren\u2019t you two normally together? I saw her in class earlier\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe left already. Every Wednesday after school, she goes to the orphanage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOrphanage?\u201d My ears perked up; this may be important information, \u201cWhat is she doing at the orphanage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer parents recently used her name and created a charitable foundation. They have been contributing to a particular orphanage. She said the children from there are too pitiful, so she visits them every week.\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded half-heartedly, \u201cWow, she has such a kind heart!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Honestly, I couldn\u2019t imagine a person who killed her own biological sister would donate to a charity. There must be something fishy about this orphanage! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the office, I\u2019ll come with you. I\u2019m very familiar with the president of the basketball association, I can help you say a few good words.\u201d Kevin confidently stated. He had no idea that I had used the assistant thing as an excuse.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. I can go on my own.\u201d I tried to stop him.</p><br/><p>But it was too late, Kevin had already opened the office door. He casually entered like it was his house. Then, he loudly shouted at the guy with glasses, who was sitting by an office desk, \u201cI heard you guys are looking to recruit an assistant?\u201d</p><br/><p>In my head, I was thinking of all kinds of excuses. Surprisingly, the guy with the glasses replied, \u201cOh? How did you know? We haven\u2019t posted the flyer yet!\u201d He revealed a poster that was even taller than himself. \u201cI\u2019m currently working on the poster to hire an assistant! Looks good, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. My friend wants to be a basketball court assistant. Take a look.\u201d Kevin pushed me inside. I made direct eye contact with the guy that had acne all over his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm.. actually, the only requirement we need for this position is sufficient time availability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the same class. When I\u2019m available, she\u2019s available.\u201d Kevin did all the talking for me. So in silence, I was pushed to a position where I could no longer back down.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease register! From now on, you are a member of our basketball association!\u201d The guy raised his two hands -like he was waiting for me to enthusiastically give him a high five.</p><br/><p>I gave him a high five and awkwardly smiled, \u201cPlease treat me kindly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like that, I was a 25 years old \u201cuniversity student\u201d who became the basketball court assistant without somewhat intending to do so. It wasn\u2019t until afterwards that I found out my job was to help them pick up the balls, sweep, deliver water and towels on a daily basis.</p><br/><p>It was no big deal. It was similar to my situation at home. But instead of serving one person, I was serving a group of individuals.</p><br/><p>Strangely, the group was easier to serve than the individual at home.</p><br/><p>In addition, unlike the guy at home, watching these young guys play basketball gave me some youthful energy. All Suyang does on a daily basis was play video games on his couch. He only moves his fingers.</p><br/><p>With Suyang, a day feels like a year.</p><br/><p>Nighttime. After I waved goodbye to the last person, I was all alone in the empty basketball court tidying up. Today, I finally experienced the saying, \u201cYou made your bed, so now you lie on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>But in return, I was able to gain something important. Now, I know Xu Weishan goes to the orphanage every Wednesday.</p><br/><p>I felt like a famous detective and I was quite proud of myself. Suddenly, the doors of the basketball court opened, and someone came in.</p><br/><p>I was quite far from the entrance as I was tidying up. Hence, I wasn\u2019t able to see the person clearly, \u201cSorry, the gym is closed for today\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I walked closer, I realized it was Suyang.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

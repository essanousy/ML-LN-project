He had a pitiful expression on his face.</p><br/><p><i>Where does he get all this confidence from? And who\u2019s the woman that\u2019s like a wolf and a tiger, eh?!?</i></p><br/><p>With difficulty, I suppressed my frustrations as I took in a deep breath. Then, I began slowly, \u201cAllow me to explain. It is not what you\u2019re thinking\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoldfish! I\u2019m really serious right now. Listen to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Suyang\u2019s attitude changed 180 degrees. I was a bit worried. <i>It was a joke, he wasn\u2019t seriously mad, right? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, if you use my real name. Perhaps I can take you more seriously\u2026\u201d I suggested.</p><br/><p>\u201cConsidering how you\u2019ve been disappearing without cause or reason these days, and flirting with your boss\u2026most importantly, flirting with your boss!!\u2026the only explanation for this behaviour is because I\u2019ve been too lenient on you. Hence, it is part of my duty to assign you a mission so that you\u2019re not slacking off all the time. Then, you can be an useful human being\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I blankly stared at Suyang, \u201cSorry boss, you said too much and I don\u2019t understand your point\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTomorrow, go to the aquarium and take a picture of all the sea creatures that you see. Then, I want a hand-written report of their breed, livelihood, and habits. The more details the better.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>What type of messed up mission is this? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, after you\u2019re done, create a powerpoint presentation to show me. Report back to me the day after tomorrow. Remember, I want every kind! Every variety! Even if they\u2019re the same species but in a different colour.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too soon! Plus, what\u2019s the purpose of this mission?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, you didn\u2019t return home in the designated time I had given you. So, I am going to deduct your salary. But if you manage to complete this mission well, I will return your salary to you.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>He was using my salary to threaten me again?! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang, you\u2019re purposely messing with me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA boss has every right to order his employee to tasks. You have a problem with it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Currently, Suyang and I were exchanging an intense eye contact with each other. I could lose money or whatever, but I must not lose my aura!</p><br/><p>But humans must be flexible at times. Sometimes, we must lower our heads when necessary. \u201cNo! Boss, you\u2019re the electricity! You\u2019re the light! You\u2019re the only God! Whatever you say, I will do! Please\u2026do not deduct my salary!\u201d</p><br/><p>I hopped out of my the couch and stood up; throwing the cushion aside. I lightly pinched Suyang\u2019s face with my two hands as I smiled, \u201cAlright, I\u2019m going to go and prepare the necessary information you want. Sleep earlier, boss! Late nights aren\u2019t good for the skin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang reacted like he was a rock. He awkwardly gazed at my hands that were on his face. After a second, he slowly questioned, \u201cDid you\u2026 wash your hands after you touched your foot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d I gave him an obvious look as my response. Then, I headed to my room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! Before you return to your room, warm me a cup of milk!\u201d Then, Suyang paused and added, \u201cBut go wash your hands first!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Yes, yes. I was his servant the whole time; an old nanny he spent money to hire.</i></p><br/><p>Although I was annoyed, I still maintained the smile on my face. Like a professional female worker, I gently responded, \u201cYes, please wait, Sir. I will immediately help you warm a cup of milk.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>F*** Suyang! Why must he create some type of aquarium mission to make my life difficult? </i>But deep down, I knew it was because he didn\u2019t want me to use my spare time to meddle with the Lu family and Mi Fan\u2019s issue.</p><br/><p>However, I was the type that won\u2019t give up once I have made up my mind. Plus, the moment I imagined Suyang and Mi Fan spending time together, I felt distraught with anxiety.</p><br/><p><i>Why do I feel that way towards him?! I don\u2019t know. He was bossy and opinionated. </i></p><br/><p><i>Also, why wasn\u2019t he intimidated by the intimate distance between us? It was something that affected me so much. </i></p><br/><p>As I stirred the warm milk I had heated up from the pan, I noticed a bag of salt in the kitchen. I coldly laughed. <i>Haha. Suyang, after you drink my \u201cdelicious\u201d milk, I hope you will sleep well\u2026</i></p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, your milk is ready! Savour it slowly, I am going to return to my room now.\u201d I handed the milk to Suyang and rushed back to my room in quick steps.</p><br/><p>\u201c1, 2, 3!\u201d I locked my bedroom door as I leaned on it and counted to three. Then, as expected, I heard Suyang choking and his footsteps were moving towards my direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha!\u201d I covered my mouth as I giggled secretly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Yixin! How could you be so despicable to mix salt into the milk? Come out! If you\u2019re not happy with me, we\u2019ll deal with it face to face!\u201d Suyang knocked on my door. It sounded like he wanted to break it down.</p><br/><p><i>Deal with it face to face?! You think I\u2019m an idiot? As a common citizen, how could I argue against you, leader? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cUmm, boss, did the milk turn salty? Perhaps it\u2019s expired? It\u2019s rather late now. I have to rest. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll buy new milk and replace your expired milk!\u201d I tried my best to suppress my laughter and made my voice sound as normal as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Yixin! I could hear you laughing! Come out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Boss, you heard wrong. I-I\u2019m not laughing. I\u2019m going to sleep. You should sleep too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, I ran to my bed and rolled on it.</p><br/><p>The moment I envisioned Suyang\u2019s current eye bulging expression from the outside of my room, I wanted to smile. Today was a day worthy of being commemorated. The common people have successfully caused an uprising against the leader! This was the first step to victory. Long live the revolution!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d I was so exhausted early in the morning. I had bitter feelings towards Suyang as I got up with difficulty. In order to complete Suyang\u2019s assigned mission, I had to take the bus for two hours. I was the first visitor to the aquarium.</p><br/><p>For the first time in my life, I was so sick of looking at fishes that I felt like vomiting.</p><br/><p><i>Serious, weren\u2019t they all just swimming around? </i>To me, the fishes all look relatively similar. It\u2019s like how Caucasians cannot tell the difference between Asians, and how Asians cannot tell the difference between Caucasians.</p><br/><p>After observing for a long period, I decided I didn\u2019t want to eat any fishes for at least a month.</p><br/><p>But as I attentively scrutinized the fish photos I had taken, I had a sudden thought that perhaps I should be a photographer.</p><br/><p>I was planning to half-heartedly stroll around the aquarium to finish my mission, but suddenly, I noticed a very familiar figure with her back facing towards me.</p><br/><p>I took another look. <i>That woman\u2026..isn\u2019t that Mi Fan? Why is she at the aquarium?</i></p><br/><p>I finally understood the line \u201cWhen you search high and low, you will not find what you want. But when you\u2019re not searching, it\u2019ll be right in front of you.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>If Suyang knew I encountered Mi Fan in the aquarium, he would go insane!</i></p><br/><p>I secretly hid at a corner as I observed Mi Fan\u2019s actions.</p><br/><p>Soon, she left with a staff member.</p><br/><p>Although I wasn\u2019t finished with Suyang\u2019s mission, I wasn\u2019t going to let a big fish escape from me! I could tell that Mi Fan was going to disappear from my field of vision. So, I rushed to follow as I got onto a taxi.</p><br/><p>\u201cDriver, please help me follow that vehicle in front of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, are you trying to track someone down? That is not good. If the cops think you\u2019re following someone around, you might be considered a psycho and locked up.\u201d The driver still hadn\u2019t moved his car. He was wasting time as he lectured me.</p><br/><p>I was at a loss for words. But time waits for no one. So, my anxious heart began to beat faster and faster. I had no choice but to fabricate a story, \u201cUncle, she is a mistress! I am suspecting that she is sleeping with my husband. So, please catch up to her! Or else I won\u2019t be able to get the proof that I need! I\u2019m begging you!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

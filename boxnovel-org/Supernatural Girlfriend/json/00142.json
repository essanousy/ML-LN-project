What do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing. I was just thinking about how you were last night. You drank the most out of all of us. Yet, you were determined not to get escorted home. So, I was wondering whether you actually made it back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did make it back\u2026 but did I leave by myself last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. You were insane! You couldn\u2019t even walk a straight line. I\u2019m surprised you made it back!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>So that means Suyang didn\u2019t appear at the BBQ shop. When did we meet then? While I was walking blindly on the streets!? </i>I narrowed my eyes.<i> I think I\u2019m starting to remember</i>\u2026.</p><br/><p>My intuition told me that Suyang\u2019s hot gaze never once turned away from my direction. So, I shrank my head and hid behind the cubicle.</p><br/><p>I knew I couldn\u2019t hide forever. But I still haven\u2019t thought of an explanation for last night\u2019s occurrence.</p><br/><p><i>Explanation! Explanation! Oh yeah! Logically, Suyang should be the one giving me an explanation! I drank too much. My mind wasn\u2019t conscious. I was the victim here! </i></p><br/><p><i>No no! I can\u2019t think like that! I\u2019ve heard that when I\u2019m drunk, I act like a female version of Shen Shaoqian. I hug everyone in sight. I wrap my arms around everyone. I am a mess</i>\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Yixin, the manager is calling you.\u201d Guo Zijun said from his cubicle.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My voice was shaky as I fearfully poked my head out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you overreacting a bit too much?\u201d Guo Zijun ridiculed me, \u201cI know you were punished by the manager yesterday, but it\u2019s still not too late to fix your relationship with him. Don\u2019t make him wait too long or else you\u2019re going to get yelled at again.\u201d</p><br/><p>I closed my eyes and took a few deep breaths. <i>Sigh. What will come will always come.</i> Although the distance between my cubicle and Suyang\u2019s office was less than 7 metres, it felt like an endless execution ground.</p><br/><p><i>I wished my legs were only 1cm long. That way, it would take me forever to get to his office</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>Suyang had a crafty smile on his face until I entered his office.</p><br/><p>\u201cManager, is there something you need help with?\u201d I didn\u2019t know where to put my arms. Today, their existence felt like a surplus.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou take forever to come into my office, yet you slipped out of my apartment so fast.\u201d Suyang teased.</p><br/><p>The moment he said those words, I quickly turned around and locked the doors behind me. Then, I reminded him, \u201cShhh! We are at work right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis company permits dating amongst coworkers. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang casually leaned back against his chair. Right now, I was the only one in panic mode, \u201cThis has nothing to do with dating within the company. This is an issue between the two of us! We can\u2019t let anyone know about it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur issue? What issue do we have\u2026.?\u201d Suyang grinned. <i>He obviously knew what he was doing. Ughhhh he was so despicable!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you wearing a high collar shirt? You don\u2019t find it hot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you asking the question when you already know the answer to it?\u201d I spoke through my teeth.</p><br/><p>Suyang stood up; not bothering to hide his cheerful mood. \u201cActually, I wouldn\u2019t have gone so overboard. But last night, you wouldn\u2019t let me go. That\u2019s why I\u2026.\u201d Suyang murmured. Then, he slowly unbuttoned his dress shirt to reveal all the hickeys on his collarbone.</p><br/><p><i>I was the culprit</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me, how are you going to take responsibility for me?\u201d Suyang tilted his head as he began to lightly swing one of my arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy should I be the one taking responsibility? I was drunk last night. I wasn\u2019t conscious. You took advantage of me!\u201d I pulled my arm away from him as I backed away to keep a safe distance between us.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh I see\u2026\u201d Suyang placed his hand on his chin, \u201cHow about I take responsibility for you instead? Actually, it doesn\u2019t matter who takes responsibility for who\u2026but you really surprised me after three years of no contact.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d I snapped. I found it extremely annoying how Suyang spoke to me in such a frivolous tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were much more forward and passionate compared to the past\u2026.\u201d He slowly stated. There was a cunning glint in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough! Enough! You don\u2019t have to explain!\u201d I rushed over to cover Suyang\u2019s mouth. But when I remembered this was the office, I quickly released my hand, \u201cCould we not talk about this stuff at work?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAside from here, where would you like to meet after work?\u201d Suyang asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come to your apartment to find you and we can chat then. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDeal. I\u2019ll be waiting for you at home. You better show up.\u201d Suyang smiled as he returned back to his seat, \u201cAlright, Lin Yixin job candidate, you may leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>After I exited Suyang\u2019s office, I felt like there was a huge gloomy cloud in front of me. <i>Great. Now, I have to find time to deal with what I had done to Suyang. When am I going to have time to investigate Yao Youfan?</i></p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>(Last night)</p><br/><p><i>The more Lin Yixin thought about it, the more enraged she felt. She had been living for 29 years and now a punk had set her up? </i></p><br/><p>She noticed all the new hirees were smiling around her. Hence, she couldn\u2019t make her anger so obvious. So, she fakely smiled as she continued to drink cup after cup.</p><br/><p>In no time, she had devoured two bottles.</p><br/><p>Usually, she wasn\u2019t much of a drinker. After drinking two bottles of beer, her mind was already spinning. All the new hirees were busy talking about their own departments. No one paid attention to her.</p><br/><p>Since she was bored, Lin Yixin clumsily took out her cell phone and began to yell without dialing a number, \u201cHello!? Hello!!? Is anyone there? Yo! You punk, I never thought I would see you again! How dare you keep me in your office alone? Have you been corrupted by bad examples?\u201d</p><br/><p>All the new hirees became silent. They held onto their breath as they stared at Lin Yixin. <i>Who was she shouting at? </i></p><br/><p>Suddenly, Guo Zijun slammed the table and nervously turned to the girl next to Lin Yixin. \u201cQianqian, hurry and hang up her phone. Could she be calling the manager?\u201d</p><br/><p>Now, everyone was anxious and the atmosphere was super awkward. If a job candidate drunk-dialed a manager at a gathering, they would all be in trouble.</p><br/><p>Song Qianqian freaked out and immediately took Lin Yixin\u2019s cell phone away from her. But when she glanced at it, she felt a great sense of relief. \u201cWhat the heck. She didn\u2019t even dial a number!\u201d</p><br/><p>They were all scared for no reason. Someone began to joke, \u201cI bet she doesn\u2019t have the manager\u2019s number. Hahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlus, this morning, the manager lectured her right away at his office. I am pretty sure she got yelled at so much that she is kind of traumatized. Now, she\u2019s venting to air.\u201d Guo Zijun mocked.</p><br/><p>Once again, all the new hirees focused on their own issues and ignored Lin Yixin.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d When Lin Yixin was given back her cell phone, she drank another cup and smirked. She had overheard what the new hirees were saying and she was provoked. She muttered, \u201cHumph! Who says I don\u2019t know Suyang\u2019s number? I\u2019ll call him now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Suyang\u2019s number was no longer on Yixin\u2019s phone, she had memorized it deep in her subconscious memory. Lin Yixin accurately dialed the number in her drunken state. The moment it went through and she began to laugh, \u201cHAHA! Guess whoooooo?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang had just finished showering. His hair was still dripping with water droplets when he noticed the caller ID. After a moment of hesitation, he picked up, \u201cHello?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Yixin was laughing like a mischievous child. She told everyone around her to be quiet, \u201cShhh! I can\u2019t hear the phone!\u201d</p><br/><p>But everyone ignored her. So, Lin Yixin stood up and left the BBQ shop. She sat on the steps in front of the restaurant and began to foolishly smile. She was smiling at the sky.</p><br/><p>Suyang whispered, \u201cYixin\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPssh! You suck! How could you figure it out so quickly?\u201d Lin Yixin hollered. Then, she dramatically stood up and twirled around, \u201cBut, I\u2019m no longer the Lin Yixin from 3 years ago! Now, I\u2019m the short hair version! And I can communicate with ghosts!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang didn\u2019t know whether he should laugh or cry. <i>Goldfish must be drunk. Or else, she wouldn\u2019t have called him. But he was very happy that she would call him while she was intoxicated. Could it be that she had never been drunk these past three years? Why did it take her so long to call?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Suyang was already changing to go find her.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuess!\u201d Lin Yixin ran over and began to hug a lamppost. \u201cIf you guess correctly, I\u2019ll tell you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you drink too much or are you suffering from aphasia? How could you tell me to guess?\u201d Suyang gasped as he tried to quickly pull up his pants.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you I\u2019m around the company building or you\u2019re going to come find me! Do you know that we\u2019re not supposed to see each other?\u201d Lin Yixin slurred. She happened to see a floating ghost dressed in white as she ran back to the BBQ shop.</p><br/><p>The new hirees were about to have a toast. Lin Yixin took the cup from Guo Zijun\u2019s hand and drank it all down in one gulp.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah! So good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Guo Zijun\u2019s glass was stolen from him and his hand was still in mid air. Someone tapped his arm next to him and gave him another glass. But no one noticed his flushed face as he began to dry cough.</p><br/><p>Suyang was fully dressed now. He sighed a breath of relief. It was actually good that Lin Yixin had such a low IQ at times. At least, now he knew where she was.</p><br/><p>He warned, \u201cBe good and remain where you are. I\u2019m coming now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! You can\u2019t come!\u201d Lin Yixin sat back at her original spot as she began to stomp her feet. However, the new hirees assumed she was still speaking to air so they continued to dismiss her behaviour.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you call me because you wanted me to find you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I -I just don\u2019t understand how you\u2019re a marketing manager here!? Do you know how awkward I felt when I saw you today? I was so shocked, I was speechless. I foolishly stood there like a pole. So silly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guo Zijun stared at Lin Yixin from the corner of his eyes. Lin Yixin\u2019s back was facing him.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, I felt like you were quite good at talking back.\u201d Suyang had arrived at the parking lot. He was about to drive to the work building to find Goldfish.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh\u2026why am I on the phone?\u201d Lin Yixin asked herself out loud. Then, she hung up; leaving Suyang speechless. All he heard was the \u201cdut dut dut\u2026\u201d sound of a broken line.</p><br/><p>In no time, Lin Yixin drank another three bottles of beer. Just as she was about to devour her fifth bottle, she was dancing alone in her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe little girl carried her doll and went to the garden to see cherry blossoms. The doll cried for mama and the birds on the tree went haha\u2026.\u201d Lin Yixin was humming a song as her mind wandered off into Lala Land.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Suyang called. Lin Yixin was brought back to reality and wanted to hang up on him. However, she slid her finger in the wrong direction and ended up picking up the call.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you? I\u2019m already at the work building.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

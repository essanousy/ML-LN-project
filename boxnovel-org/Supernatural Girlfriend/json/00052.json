Earlier, she had secretly went through Kevin\u2019s phone. She noticed there was a girl in the photo album who looked exactly like her. However, she was wearing a fast food uniform. It was clearly not her.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Xu Weishan felt like she had been betrayed by her family and lover.</p><br/><p>She put away her kindhearted image and exposed her true jealous, crafty nature. Xu Weishan secretly vowed that she will get revenge: <i>You two treated me like this. I\u2019ll definitely not let you guys go.</i></p><br/><p>A few days later, Xu Weishan received a text from Hong Xiaobei. Hong Xiaobei wanted to meet her at a very deserted place. She said she had something important she wanted to discuss with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerfect\u2026.\u201d Ever since Kevin saw Hong Xiaobei, it was as if he had gone through trauma. He refused to pick up any of Xu Weishan\u2019s calls. He wouldn\u2019t even leave his house.</p><br/><p>Before their appointment, Xu Weishan went to the supermarket and bought a knife. She placed it in her million dollar bag.</p><br/><p>The meeting place was an abandoned old chemical factory. Combined with the black, gloomy clouds, it seemed like the perfect setting for a crime to take place.</p><br/><p>Based on Hong Xiaobei\u2019s body language, Xu Weishan could instantly tell she wanted to borrow money. Deep down, she hollowly laughed. Now, simply the look of Hong Xiaobei\u2019s face irked her.</p><br/><p>\u201c200k? Why do you need so much?\u201d The previous Xu Weishan would\u2019ve lent it it Hong Xiaobei regardless of the amount. However, the moment Xu Weishan thought of her sister and Kevin\u2019s conversation, all she felt was hatred.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>I\u2019m begging you not to say this. Please, treat my sister well</i>.\u201d</p><br/><p>The more she replayed Hong Xiaobei\u2019s words in her mind, the more bitter she felt.</p><br/><p><i>Was she pitying her? She was actually being pitied by someone so poor and low in society? </i>All along, she had appeared in front of Hong Xiaobei like a savior. She will absolutely not allow their positions to switch!</p><br/><p>No matter what, Xu Weishan could not swallow this down. So, she firmly refused Hong Xiaobei\u2019s request.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know this request is unreasonable. If it weren\u2019t for a fact that a child I know is in need of an operation, I wouldn\u2019t ask you for the money either, sister. But I really have no other choice. Sister, please help me! I only need 200k and the child will be able to go through the surgery. I will eventually pay you back\u2026.\u201d Hong Xiaobei pleaded.</p><br/><p>\u201cPay me back? How are you going to pay me back? Ever since we have met, how much have you taken from me? How are you going to pay back?\u201d Xu Weishan coldly responded, \u201cAlso, why do you always ask me for money?\u201d</p><br/><p>From the dim lighting, Hong Xiaobei clearly noticed Xu Weishan\u2019s tone had changed. Her facial expression had also turned somewhat sinister?</p><br/><p>\u201cSister, what do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me tell you, Kevin\u2019s family is also very rich. If you\u2019re so in need of money, why don\u2019t you take advantage of his gold mine? Actually, no. You two have met a long time ago. You probably already know he is rich. Could it be that you\u2019re doing it on purpose? True. It\u2019s probably not good to step into two gold mines at the same time. You have to wait until one of them stop producing before you use the other\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSister\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already know about the two of you. You think I need your charity to gain love?\u201d Xu Weishan violently lifted Hong Xiaobei\u2019s chin and angrily screeched, \u201cYou think I would be grateful to you? Well, you\u2019re wrong! Your method is the biggest insult to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSister, I didn\u2019t\u2026..\u201d Hong Xiaobei didn\u2019t try to stop her sister. She couldn\u2019t think of a reason to resist. She only wanted Xu Weishan to calm down so she could listen to her explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up. Let me talk. Actually, I should be thankful to you. You prevented me from telling others about your existence. Now, even if you disappear from this world, no one is going to know!\u201d Xu Weishan reached out inside of her bag and took out her knife. She was about to make her move.</p><br/><p>Hong Xiaobei frantically avoided the shining knife just as it was about to pierce through her body.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister?\u201d Her eyes were wide. She couldn\u2019t believe that Xu Weishan, her biological sister, was trying to kill her. Hong Xiaobei\u2019s arms managed to stop Hong Xiaobei\u2019s knife from coming down. She was shaking uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing how you\u2019re about to die, I\u2019ll tell you the truth. I honestly really like Kevin. Considering how much I\u2019ve helped you, please be kind and help me out for once. Silently depart to another world so that he can forget you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insane!\u201d Hong Xiaobei managed to push Xu Weishan\u2019s hand away from her direction. After all, Hong Xiaobei had been working all sorts of hard labour jobs her entire life. Naturally, she was physically much stronger than Xu Weishan.</p><br/><p>Hong Xiaobei could vaguely see a sewer behind Xu Weishan. As long as she could shove Xu Weishan to that direction and throw the knife elsewhere, she\u2019ll be ok.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, Hong Xiaobei began to implement her plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d Hong Xiaobei\u2019s strength surpassed her expectations. Xu Weishan was very anxious. If she doesn\u2019t succeed today, then she will never have the opportunity again.</p><br/><p>And if Kevin found out about this, he will definitely leave her.</p><br/><p>Xu Weishan bitterly sighed on the inside, why had she allowed him to affect her so much?</p><br/><p>During their struggles, Xu Weishan thought about making a final strike. She desperately used all her strength as she pushed and shoved. Suddenly, Xu Weishan appeared to have stepped on something and slipped forward. Her chest happened to land on the knife that Hong Xiaobei had successfully taken away a second ago.</p><br/><p>At that moment, all was silent.</p><br/><p>Xu Weishan\u2019s body twitched as she stared at the knife that had entered her body. Then, she fell backwards. She didn\u2019t even have time to say her last words. In ten seconds, there wasn\u2019t a vital sign left.</p><br/><p>Everything happened too quickly. Hong Xiaobei never shifted from her original spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister\u2026.\u201d Hong Xiaobei crouched down and lightly tapped Xu Weishan\u2019s body. Her hands were covered in fresh blood. Hong Xiaobei almost lost consciousness. She collapsed onto the ground. \u201cWhat am I going to do? What am I going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>She frantically looked around her surroundings. There wasn\u2019t even a ghost in sight.</p><br/><p>In this type of circumstances, how was she going to explain? Regardless of which way one would look at it, she was the killer.</p><br/><p><i>Who would believe her that Xu Weishan had fell over and accidentally killed herself? </i></p><br/><p>Hong Xiaobei took out her cell phone and hysterically tried to find someone to contact. The only person she could think of was Kevin.</p><br/><p>\u201cSave me\u2026what..what am I going to now?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Kevin picked up the phone, he heard Hong Xiaobei sobbing. Initially, he was at home sulking. But now, he was extremely alert, \u201cWhat happened? Stop crying. Tell me the story. Where are you now?\u201d</p><br/><p>By the time Kevin had arrived, Hong Xiaobei was sitting next to Xu Weishan\u2019s body. Her eyes appeared empty as she stared fixedly at the ground.</p><br/><p>Now that Kevin had arrived, Hong Xiaobei slowly opened her mouth, \u201cI didn\u2019t do it on purpose. Sister wanted to kill me. So\u2026.so I grabbed the knife. And for some reason, she fell over and crashed into me. And now\u2026what am I going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was as if she was narrating someone else\u2019s story. Hong Xiaobei was calm by now.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hong Xiaobei shook her head as she intently gazed at Kevin and desperately tugged on his sleeve, \u201cIs it because you don\u2019t believe me? You think I killed her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kevin tried to comfort Hong Xiaobei as he lightly patted her head, \u201cI trust you. So you must trust me too. I will help you solve this problem. Don\u2019t be scared. Let me think about what to do\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>If they called the cops, no matter how he explained it, Hong Xiaobei was going to be imprisoned.</p><br/><p>So in the end, in order to protect her, Kevin brought Xu Weishan\u2019s body to the deserted countryside. Then, from his car, he took some gasoline and poured it over Xu Weishan\u2019s corpse and lit it up. The fire will destroy all the secrets and turn them into ashes.</p><br/><p>Kevin turned to Hong Xiaobei, \u201cFrom today onwards, you are now Xu Weishan\u2026.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

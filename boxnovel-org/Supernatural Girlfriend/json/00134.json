It seems so complicated!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cComplicated? It\u2019s not complicated! You\u2019re just taking two souls and swapping it. How hard is that?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Hearing Grandmother Meng say this, I admit, I was garbage\u2026. she knew all sorts of tricks. Anson could enter anyone\u2019s body. Xialing could communicate with other ghosts\u2026 basically, anyone who had supernatural powers were more powerful than me! It was time for me to do some self reflection.</i></p><br/><p>An hour later, Xiazhi still had not returned. But Xialing gave me a call.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you persuade my brother to get me to help you?\u201d Xialing sounded very gloomy.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told him I really had something important to discuss with you. I knew Xiazhi could find you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you need help with? Anson has already been arrested by the cops.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the person the cops took away is not Anson. It\u2019s Lin Yixin! I want my soul back. Please help me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already told you I do not know how to swap souls. It\u2019s too advanced for me. I can\u2019t help you!\u201d Xialing sounded like she was about to hang up the phone. I quickly yelled, \u201cWait! I know you can\u2019t swap souls, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before I could continue, Suyang snatched the phone from my hand, \u201cYou can lay down, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Xialing didn\u2019t understand what Suyang meant. Even I was confused. Suyang smiled, \u201cI already have a plan in mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Xialing was extremely unwilling, ultimately, she was willing to meet us behind the hospital. So currently, Suyang, Grandmother Meng, Xialing and I had gathered at the back of the hospital.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is Xiazhi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe went to reincarnate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?!\u201d I was shocked.<i> I didn\u2019t even thank him and now he\u2019s gone forever?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cI told him, if he wanted me to help you, he had to go reincarnate immediately. I didn\u2019t want him to linger in this world any longer.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>I was quite sad when I found out I\u2019ll never see Xiazhi again. I\u2019ve known him for far longer than Suyang and Grandmother Meng\u2026. I still remember he became my bodyguard the day we made eye contact. He had always tried his best to protect me. It may seem ridiculous but that was the truth.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is your plan?\u201d Xialing\u2019s voice cut off my thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe plan is, granny will go distract Sheyu. Then, after Sheyu is gone, Yixin and I will enter the room and carry Anson out. Xialing, you\u2019ll be lying in the bed to pretend to be \u2018Lin Yixin\u2019 for an hour. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmother Meng raised her hand, \u201cHow am I supposed to distract the cop?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo whatever you want! Just act like how you usually act when you don\u2019t want me to leave you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d Suddenly, Grandmother Meng clutched her heart and shut her eyes. She looked like she was suffering from immense pain. \u201cAh\u2026\u2026my heart! My heart feels\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xialing and I were stunned by her acting skills. We reached over to hold onto her. Unexpectedly, Grandmother Meng recovered in a second, \u201cLike that?\u201d</p><br/><p>*<i>clap clap clap</i>*. Xialing and I couldn\u2019t help but give applause. If the situation wasn\u2019t so serious, I would\u2019ve given Grandmother Meng the best female actress award.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a question!\u201d This time, I raised my hand, \u201cCan the two of us carry Anson out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang rubbed my head, \u201cDon\u2019t forget, you\u2019re in a man\u2019s body right now. How could two men not carry a woman?\u201d Although, to tell you the truth, Lin Yixin is a bit heavier than the average woman\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026..you can shut up now.\u201d I was grumpy because Suyang was making fun of my weight again. I angrily put down my hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, if everyone understands, then let\u2019s hurry! We\u2019ll meet in the car. Xialing, in approximately an hour, we\u2019ll come back for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI got it.\u201d Xialing replied listlessly.</p><br/><p>Her attitude was perfect. She needed to act as an unconscious person. If she was too enthusiastic or energetic, it would be too obvious.</p><br/><p>So, we split up and entered the hospital.</p><br/><p>Suyang, Xialing and I secretly entered from the back doors and into the hospital. Along the way, I made a record and tried to figure out the shortest route for us to exit.</p><br/><p>When we arrived at the fire exits on Anson\u2019s floor, we could already hear a lot of commotion. I was about to rush out, but then I saw Grandmother Meng and Sheyu arguing. So, I hurriedly ducked my head back in. The three of us held onto our breath as we continued to observe; our heads were lined up vertically with one above each other.</p><br/><p>Grandmother Meng was arguing intensely with Sheyu. Suddenly, she grabbed onto Sheyu\u2019s sleeve and had her mouth gasped open as she collapsed.</p><br/><p>If I hadn\u2019t already seen her acting, I would\u2019ve rushed out to save her. I felt bad for making her act such a dramatic scene at her old age.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the scene became very chaotic. Sheyu called a bunch of nurses on shift and everyone rushed to put Grandmother Meng on the wheel bed and took her away.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry! They\u2019re gone!\u201d While no one was watching, I quickly urged Suyang and Xialing. We didn\u2019t have much time. We must hurry and do everything in the shortest time possible!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh no! The door is locked. What should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a simple issue I can handle.\u201d Xialing declared with a smug expression. She took out a thin iron wire from inside of her pockets and began to stab it into the keyhole. She swirled and twirled and *ka cha*, the door opened.</p><br/><p>Suyang gave Xialing and thumbs up. Based on his shining eyes, he must be impressed by her skills.</p><br/><p>We noiselessly entered the ward. Fortunately, Anson\u2019s had an individual room. I was quite stressed and violently pulled out his IV drips. \u201cDo you think pulling these out will be ok?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already pulled them out. So why are you asking?! Hurry and get out!\u201d Xialing responded, \u201cI will lay here and wait until you guys come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Suyang and I replied in unison. Then, Suyang put Anson on his back. His face was turning red and he looked like he was struggling. \u201cAfter you get your body back, you really need to do something about your weight!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Damn that Suyang! He is always insults my weight! Am I really that heavy?</i></p><br/><p>I sharply shoved Suyang and stated like a boss, \u201cAre you a man? Let me carry her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Hurry!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>It\u2019s a female body! Plus, right now I was Anson. I was confident in my abilities and my body weight! Suyang was just exaggerating. Also, he rarely exercised; so he was weak to begin with.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cOkay! Then, catch!\u201d Suyang leaned over to slide Anson onto my back.</p><br/><p>\u201cPshhh!\u201d Xialing was already lying on the bed. \u201cTime is running out and you guys are still playing around? Why does it matter who\u2019s carrying her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand! This is what you call \u2018<i>you may kill the soldier but not dishonor him\u2019</i>!\u201d</p><br/><p>After I said those powerful words, I was faced with reality. Eh\u2026.? I weighed more than I expected. The moment \u2018Lin Yixin\u2019 was on my body, I had to grit down my teeth in order to hold on. With difficulty, I pretended I was totally fine to Suyang, \u201cSee? I\u2019m not that heavy\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang shook his head, \u201cIt\u2019s useless for you to hide it. The sweat on your forehead has betrayed you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m just hot!\u201d I began to pant. <i>I must lose weight after I get my body back!</i></p><br/><p>Suyang was leading the way as he checked the situation outside. Then, he gestured to me that it was safe to come out. The two of us rushed to the fire exit and ran for our lives.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry! Quick!\u201d Even though we had successfully taken Anson out, I was still afraid the cops would chase after us. <i>I felt like a guilty thief\u2026. wait, we weren\u2019t stealing any valuables; instead, we were stealing a living person!</i></p><br/><p>Fortunately since it was so late, there weren\u2019t many people on shifts. Suyang and I safely returned to the car and placed Anson inside.</p><br/><p><i>It was kind of odd. He was only shot on the arm. How could he be unconscious for so long? </i></p><br/><p><i>Even when I had been shot on the chest, I wasn\u2019t like this. It was the same body too\u2026 sigh. Poor me. My body must be the type to get shot easily. At such a young age, I\u2019ve already been shot twice. </i></p><br/><p>After we settled down Anson, Suyang gave Grandmother Meng a call to notify her. Soon, Grandmother Meng swaggered out the front door. She looked almighty and proud.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat cop is so easy to deal with. How could a cop be tricked so easily? Aaaiiii!\u201d</p><br/><p>Was she trying to show off? Suyang and I smiled but didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p><i>Sheyu had always been like this\u2026 luckily she was the one on guard.</i></p><br/><p>We drove to Grandmother Meng\u2019s apartment. She had already prepared two separate beds for me and Anson to lay down on. Then, she kicked Suyang out of the room.</p><br/><p>Before she began, she solemnly said to me, \u201cDon\u2019t forget your promise to me. You\u2019re going to leave after you get your soul back.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

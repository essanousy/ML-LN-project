From inside, he said to me, \u201cI\u2019m going to find a parking spot. Give me a moment and wait for me here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. You can go home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like you\u2019re kind of abnormal\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I placed my hand on top of his car window and teased. \u201cAre you worried about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPssh. In your dreams! I\u2019m not worried about you. I\u2019m just worried you\u2019ll go back on your words.\u201d Then, he disappeared from my sight.</p><br/><p>Was he just a stubborn duck that refused to admit his concern? I didn\u2019t expect the cold and heartless Suyang to actually have a human side to him. I smirked as I watched Suyang go. Then, I looked up at the sky. It was getting late.</p><br/><p>I turned to the huge batch of reporters that were waiting outside of the hospital\u2019s main entrance.</p><br/><p>I quietly walked beside a reporter as I raised my voice, \u201cAre you waiting for the police to come out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The reporter didn\u2019t even look at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have news to expose!\u201d</p><br/><p>I suddenly yelled on top of my lungs and all the reporters reached their necks over like giraffes to look at me.</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t sure who called out, \u201cShe is the woman from the Police Station yesterday!\u201d</p><br/><p>Three seconds later, the reports surrounded me like how they did the day before. In an instant, my path was blocked from all sides. But the difference between yesterday and today was this time, I came prepared. I directly faced the reporters and shouted as if I was afraid they wouldn\u2019t be able to hear what I was about to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Hey! Look over here! Here! I am the 10th victim of the homicidal maniac. At the same time, I\u2019m also a survivor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop pushing! No pushing! Stop pushing against me!\u201d The reporters were all trying to shove themselves at me. I was getting irritated. \u201cYou can all take turns asking me questions. I will respond one by one! One at a time!\u201d I stepped onto the rim of the flower bed* as I randomly pointed to a person, \u201cOk. You may start first.\u201d</p><br/><p> *She was probably standing on something like this. Flower bed is the closest thing I can think of.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould you tell us the entire process of what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was a dark, windy afternoon. The homicidal maniac cut me off in the alley when I was on my way home from buying groceries. He wanted to rob me, but I had no money. So, he flew into a rage and wanted to kill me. But in the end, he didn\u2019t succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he succeed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the time, a policewoman saved me. But even if she hadn\u2019t, I would be ok. Because through his eyes, I saw fear and weakness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen he was about to stab me, I looked him straight into the eye.\u201d I gave the reporters my deadliest look to demonstrate. \u201cThen, he began to panic. When the policewoman called out, he was instantly spooked out of his mind and fled.\u201d</p><br/><p>In order to provoke the homicidal maniac, I deliberately exaggerated like a novel and fabricated a story.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the policewoman\u2019s current condition?\u201d</p><br/><p>I cannot let the topic change to Sheyu. Or else, if he decided to get revenge on her, it would produce the opposite effect.</p><br/><p>I ignored the reporter\u2019s question and changed the topic, \u201cBasically, I just want to say the homicidal maniac is not that scary. If not, why couldn\u2019t he handle a tiny maiden like me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you trying to challenge the homicidal maniac?\u201d A reporter curiously asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cChallenge? I\u2019m not trying to challenge anyone. I\u2019m just stating a fact. Let me tell you a secret. I actually somewhat saw his face in the alley. But my mind is still kind of blurry so I temporarily cannot remember. But I have a feeling I will recall in the next few days. After I remember, I will tell the police. After it is verified by the police, I am certain the homicidal maniac will be caught! He is not going to roam free for long. Just wait for the news.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d An angry voice burst from the crowd. Everyone\u2019s attention turned to the person standing at the very end, Suyang.</p><br/><p>He walked towards me with a poker face, and everyone subconsciously opened up a path for him. Before I could react, Suyang lifted me up and threw me on his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou! Let me off!\u201d My hands and feet were fluttering like mad. But it was no use. Suyang carried me straight into the hospital to avoid the reporters.</p><br/><p>I watched the reporters upside down as I helplessly saw our distance grew wider. Deep down, I sincerely hoped they were going to publish what I said!</p><br/><p>I gave Suyang a flabbergasted look. What\u2019s wrong with him? It was as if he had changed into another person again.</p><br/><p>People were giving me strange looks and I covered my face, \u201cWhere are you carrying me to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang didn\u2019t put me down until we had arrived at the hospital\u2019s fire control passage. He clutched my collar and shoved me against the wall. The harsh impact injured my arm and I had to hold back from yelping out in pain. Suyang had one arm against the wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you crazy? If the reporters published or aired what you had just said, it would provoke the homicidal maniac! What if he comes looking for you\u2026?\u201d He furiously shrieked.</p><br/><p>I rolled my pupils around and avoided Suyang\u2019s glance, \u201cAre you afraid? Are you scared the homicidal maniac might get you if he sees us together?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang used one hand to pinch my face. He used so much strength that I could barely speak clearly as I cried out in pain, \u201cAi ai ai, lighter! Lighter! What are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>A drop of my saliva accidentally came out of my mouth and landed on Suyang\u2019s hand. He released me and frowned as he wiped the back of his hand on my shoulder. \u201cA goldfish is truly a goldfish. Your IQ must be negative. He is on the dark side and you\u2019re the opposite. You\u2019re just going to get hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Even if I hurt myself, I won\u2019t let it affect you. The moment we get home, I\u2019ll move out until this is over. Alright?\u201d I glared at Suyang\u2019s arm. \u201cAre you done talking? If so, move your arm so I can leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a stupid woman. Do you honestly think you\u2019re Virgin Mary? You walked around the gates of hell and you still don\u2019t understand your situation? You barely made it out alive. You should learn your lesson and stop causing trouble! Remain still! Why don\u2019t you have any memory? Do you normally lack sleep? Is that why you want to sleep forever?\u201d</p><br/><p>My heart was actually hurt by Suyang\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>I lost my temper as I yelled, \u201cAnnoying goblin! Your words are so spiteful. I\u2019m cursing you! I curse that you\u2019ll never find a girlfriend in this lifetime! Remain single for life!\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, I was hollering at Suyang, but then my voice choked with emotions, \u201cDo you think I wish to provoke the homicidal maniac? Who wouldn\u2019t want to be further away from him? Who wouldn\u2019t want to live? My luck had just began to change. I\u2019m not wandering around him because I\u2019m sick of living. I\u2019m not crazy. You seriously think I am tired of living?\u201d</p><br/><p>My eyes were red as I glared at Suyang. Surprisingly, my reaction caused Suyang to react much warmer. He took his hand off the wall and lightly patted my back. \u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand. It\u2019s not because I\u2019m afraid you will involve me. I\u2019m only saying this stuff because I\u2019m truly concerned about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to be so mean about it! My spirit is hurt\u2026\u201d I inhaled a deep breath from my nose and leaned my head against Suyang\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you tell me what your plan is?\u201d</p><br/><p>I still had my head buried on his chest. \u201cWhy should I tell you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang lowered his head and lightly stroked my hair. His voice was as gentle as the spring breeze. \u201cI can only help you if you tell me. You\u2019re a woman. You should allow a man to protect you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang\u2019s voice made me feel all warm and bubbly. I lifted my head and looked at him\u2026.appearing a bit confused. <i>No! Stay clear headed! Clear headed! I\u2019m not the type of woman that would allow honeyed words to deceive me. </i></p><br/><p>Suyang sincerely stated, \u201cIf we are together and you get beat up, I can secretly go and help you call the cops\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Suyang, you, grandpa!</i></p><br/><p>Hearing Suyang\u2019s words, the warmth I felt momentarily ago immediately disappeared without a trace. I hastily pushed him away and turned around and fan my cheeks to get rid of the blush.</p><br/><p>I almost fell for his trap again.</p><br/><p>As expected, he cannot be sweet for more than three seconds.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnnoying goblin, can you say something good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang coldly snorted, \u201cMy degree of concern is already quite good. Some men won\u2019t even help you call the police.\u201d</p><br/><p>I obediently returned home with Suyang. Along the way, I didn\u2019t say a word as I followed behind him.</p><br/><p>Around the neighbourhood was a defective streetlamp. It wouldn\u2019t stop flickering and gave off the \u201cIt was a moonless night. The killer came and killed.\u201d type of atmosphere. That moment hasn\u2019t come yet, but I was already shivering from fear.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

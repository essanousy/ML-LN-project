I sat frozen on the couch. By the time I figured I had to stand to greet her, she was already in front of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re surprised, eh? Because I didn\u2019t tell you I was coming ahead of time.\u201d Grandmother Meng glared at me. I could tell she was furious.</p><br/><p>I stood up from the couch and secretly peeked at Suyang. The atmosphere was so uncomfortable right now.</p><br/><p>Suyang rushed in to help me. He smiled apologetically, \u201cGrandma, how come you came without letting us know in advance? I could\u2019ve picked you up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I had told you in advance, wouldn\u2019t it have given you time to prepare?\u201d Grandmother Meng glared menacingly at Suyang. Then, she sharply stared at me, \u201cHave you forgotten what you promised me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026.\u201d Both Suyang and I were well aware of the reason why Grandmother Meng was so infuriated. It had to be because of our relationship.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you forget what I said? I told you, you two cannot be together!\u201d Grandmother Meng shouted. I had never seen her so enraged before.</p><br/><p>I had lost my ability to explain myself. I admit, I did betray Grandmother Meng. Seeing how I wasn\u2019t fighting back or responding, Suyang immediately went to defend me.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma, it was our fault for not telling you that we\u2019re officially a pair.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Su, do you think Grandma is mad because you didn\u2019t tell me? It\u2019s because you two absolutely cannot be together!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma, didn\u2019t you like Yixin? We\u2019re already together. That\u2019s a fact. You cannot change it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmother Meng began to tremble as she pointed at me, \u201cDo you know what Lin Yixin is? Do you know what will happen if you two stay together?! You will be a victim of many unpredictable events!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already been together for a long time. Grandma, you can\u2019t change it. So just accept it.\u201d Suyang responded. He seemed unaffected by her words.</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly child! Don\u2019t you know that\u2026 Lin Yixin can\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Yixin can see ghosts! I know!\u201d Suyang lifted my limp hand and placed it against his chest, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter to me. The fact that she was honest with me made me love her even more.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Actually, Suyang found out my secret because he tested me at the haunted hospital. Does that count as being honest? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cSilly child, do you think that she can only see ghosts?\u201d Grandmother Meng\u2019s words shocked me, \u201cShe can also recruit ghosts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean\u2026.?\u201d I was confused.</p><br/><p>I admit, currently, I was acting like a chicken. I was practically hiding behind Suyang as I whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI said, not only are you able to see ghosts, you can also attract them. I knew this from the moment I met you. Although so far there has only been nice ghosts around you, one day, I have no idea what type of evil ghost you\u2019re going to attract\u2026 what would happen then? If my Xiao Su is in danger, could you handle the responsibility?\u201d Grandmother Meng shrieked in anger.</p><br/><p><i>I was speechless. I have always know that ghosts seemed to have the ability to know I could see them. I\u2019ve always been followed around by them. But I had never thought of what would happen if an evil ghost came to me\u2026. I didn\u2019t want to involve Suyang. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cThen, we will deal with it together.\u201d Suyang responded for me. But that wasn\u2019t my reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeal with it? What are you going to use to deal with it? Your life?\u201d Grandmother Meng snarled.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma, your words are too harsh. We\u2026.\u201d Before Suyang could finish, Grandmother Meng shoved him into a corner. Suyang didn\u2019t dare to fight back.</p><br/><p>Then, Grandmother Meng violently grabbed me by my collar and yelled, \u201cIf something happens to my Xiao Su because of you, what will you do? The fact is, you do not belong in this world. Please don\u2019t take Suyang with you! I\u2019m begging you!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was surprised by Grandmother Meng\u2019s strength. Her aggressiveness was making me extremely upset. I never thought that was how she saw me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you understood me\u2026. But it turns out you see me like how everyone sees me. You think of me as a freak. But aren\u2019t you being too excessive? Grandmother Meng, you also try to communicate with ghosts\u2026\u201d I was fighting back tears as I flung her hand off me and fell down onto the couch.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I do come in contact with ghosts. That is why I keep my distance from Xiao Su. I know what I am doing. As his granny, I know to protect him so that he doesn\u2019t get troubled by evil spirits.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmother Meng\u2019s last line burned the most, \u201cAs an outsider, you have no rights to compare yourself with me and put him in danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma, please stop. I am staying with her willingly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Su.\u201d Grandmother Meng sighed and went over to him, \u201cHave you forgotten what happened while you were in Japan? That accident was the lesson for the both of us. I didn\u2019t think you would ever forget\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Japan? Oh yeah, Suyang said he had studied in Japan before. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cLin Yixin, let me tell you what had happened in Japan. Then, you can decide whether you want to stay or leave. How about that?\u201d Grandmother Meng\u2019s voice sounded very old.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma, it\u2019s getting late. Let me take you home. If you want to tell the story, I can listen on the way.\u201d Suyang\u2019s face and attitude suddenly changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid she\u2019ll leave after she hears it, right? You know she would also leave on her own\u2026. \u201d Grandmother Meng bitterly laughed as she continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then, when Xiao Su was still a child, we went to Japan with his parents. At the time, I was just learning how to communicate with ghosts despite being unable to see them. Xiao Su had a friend. I forget his name\u2026. But the child was just like you. He could see ghosts. Deep down, I had my own selfish self-interest. I wanted Xiao Su and the child to hang out more often. That way, each time the child comes over, I could ask him more about ghosts.\u201d</p><br/><p>I secretly peeked at Suyang. His head was lowered and his mouth was pursed. He didn\u2019t seem to want to be reminded of the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, I found out all sorts of ghost related stuff from the child while Xiao Su also had a playmate. At first, I thought that was the best of both worlds. But slowly, I found out that all of the child\u2019s ancestors had the ability to communicate with ghosts. At a very young age, he was already able to master all sorts of methods to recruit and expel ghosts. Initially, it wasn\u2019t a big deal. But gradually, I realized the child was heading towards a very dangerous path.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople are often scared of ghosts. But humans are much more dangerous than ghosts. There are some techniques that can manipulate and control ghosts. For example, the two ghost bodyguards in front of my entrance. They are controlled by me. But, some techniques could control humans. For example, I had helped two ghosts enter your body before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat child was destined to take another path. He managed to learn how to control evil spirits. I didn\u2019t know this at first. But by the time I discovered it, he had failed to control the evil spirits and they killed Xiao Su\u2019s parents. The evil spirits suddenly broke out of control and mistaken my family as his. So, they set a huge fire and killed my son and my daughter in law\u2026.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

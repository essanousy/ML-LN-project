She was our Japanese tour guide. So she was Anson\u2019s subordinates as well</i>..</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard she called you Anson.\u201d Suyang pointed at me, \u201cAre you him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou remember Anson? It\u2019s him\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could I forget him? While I lived in Japan, he caused my parents\u2019 death. So everything is his idea\u2026that means, \u2018Lin Yixin\u2019 is Anson right now?\u201d Suyang coldly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Did she\u2026..I mean the fake Lin Yixin..do anything weird to you?\u201d I secretly peeked at Suyang.</p><br/><p>Suyang paused and thought about it. \u201cWeird? Not really. We did what couples usually do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang\u2019s words made me feel very uncomfortable\u2026 <i>what couples usually do? What did Anson use my body for\u2026.!?! </i></p><br/><p>Although I had somewhat prepared myself, the moment I imagined the scene, I felt shivers down my back.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of which, Xialing, you were in contact with Yuxiang all this time? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 I guess the truth will eventually be revealed. Actually, this was our plan all along. Sorry for using you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat were you guys planning?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been Anson\u2019s subordinates for years and noticed that he is becoming more and more ruthless. This time, Yuxiang and I were hoping to change him. We don\u2019t want Anson to continue sinning. We were hoping for an ending that would benefit both parties\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSending me away is the ending that would benefit both parties?\u201d I asked; unamused.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, at least you would be alive and you wouldn\u2019t have to stay in a mental institution!\u201d rebutted Xialing.</p><br/><p>\u201cLetting the person who caused the death of my parents remain by my side without my consent is the ending that would benefit both parties?\u201d snarled Suyang. His green veins were practically sticking out of his forehead. He was gripping tightly on the passenger seat in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t expect you to be smart enough to figure it out\u2026. But Anson\u2019s ultimate goal is to remain by your side. Yuxiang and I both believe that as long as he stays with you, he won\u2019t hurt anyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe took away my granny. Your words don\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I.. we didn\u2019t think he would do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you continue and tell us the entire plan.\u201d I pressed on the side of my head and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 my brother kept begging me to save you. So after pretending to betray Anson, I discussed and bargained with him. He was willing to not send you to a mental institution as long as you promised you wouldn\u2019t return back to China. I didn\u2019t think he would go after Grandmother Meng after hearing that you\u2019ve escaped.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is Grandmother Meng now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYuxiang knows. We\u2019re going to find her now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am going to call the cops. If we\u2019re saving someone, we need the police to follow us to guarantee victory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiii! No! Don\u2019t call the cops! I\u2019m begging you! If you call the cops, Yuxiang and I would be considered kidnappers. Also, Anson too\u2026 although he did a lot of bad things, that\u2019s not the ending we want.\u201d Xialing pleaded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere will not be an ending that you would want. You think you can roam around freely after committing crimes? Plus, he should\u2019ve been punished long ago!\u201d Suyang coldly replied.</p><br/><p>Xialing suddenly pressed on the emergency brakes. Suyang and I both fell forward. \u201cIf you call the cops, I\u2019m not taking you guys to see Yuxiang.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them glared at each other and the atmosphere turned very uncomfortable. I secretly pinched Suyang, \u201cSuyang, let\u2019s just go ourselves. I also agree with not calling the cops. If the cops come, maybe Anson will turn crazier and Grandmother Meng will be in more danger. I trust that we\u2019ll be able to solve this on our own. One of us is a person he loves the most; while the other is the person he hates. Perhaps he will finally be able to release his feelings and let go. Let\u2019s not call the cops and see Yuxiang, ok?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang saw my warning gaze and finally muttered, \u201cFine\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHand me your cell phone! I don\u2019t trust you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang gave his cell phone to Xialing. Then, the car continued. After driving through the darkness for a long time, we finally came to a stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cI followed the map that Yuxiang gave us. I\u2019m surprised it led us back to here.\u201d Xialing walked out first to check the area. Then, Suyang and I came out as well. We silently entered the secret passageway.</p><br/><p>\u201cYuxiang, where are you? We\u2019ve arrive.\u201d Xialing whispered into the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d Yuxiang appeared like a ghost behind us. Suyang and Xialing held their breaths. I was so shocked that I completely fell down on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026the f-floor is too slippery\u2026.\u201d I smacked the floor. I couldn\u2019t think of an explanation. Suyang lift my collar and pulled me up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did Anson put Grandmother Meng?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuxiang shook her head and lightly replied, \u201cHe locked Grandmother Meng somewhere else. Other people are watching her now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen hurry and take us there! Wasn\u2019t this what we wanted to do in the first place? We have to stop him from committing more crimes! Xialing anxiously yelped.</p><br/><p>\u201cXialing\u2026.\u201d Huaze Yuxiang hesitated, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you sorry?!? If you don\u2019t want to go, just hand me the map. I can drive there on my own.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d The Anson version of \u201cLin Yixin\u201d appeared behind Huaze Yuxiang.</p><br/><p>Xialing realized she was betrayed, \u201cYou\u2026.!\u201d</p><br/><p>Behind Anson were many men dressed in black. They surrounded the three of us.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to bring Suyang with you. My life-plan is ruin. What should I do now?\u201d Lin Yixin cruelly laughed.</p><br/><p><i>I never knew my face could look so scary.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cLin Yixin! Ah! No!\u201d I yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnson.\u201d She evilly smiled at me, \u201cDo you remember this place? Welcome back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYuxiang!! Yuxiang\u2026. You can\u2019t keep helping the evildoer!\u201d Xialing screamed as she was taken away by Huaze Yuxiang.</p><br/><p>As for me and Suyang, we were taken down into the basement room that I was locked in previously. We were tied back to back against two chairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, this wasn\u2019t the result I wanted. If only you didn\u2019t figure out everything\u2026\u201d Anson sighed in disappointment. He turned to Suyang, \u201cWhat a pity. Our time together was as short as the life of an epiphyllum oxypetalum\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang was holding my hand secretly from behind the chair. Just like his voice, his hands were icy cold, \u201cWhere is my grandma?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuaze is watching over her.\u201d Anson was abnormally calm.</p><br/><p>\u201cThings have already reached to this stage. What else do you want?\u201d I asked Anson.</p><br/><p>After firmly securing Suyang, Anson came over and stood in front of me; sighing. \u201cYes, I never thought I would fail. So now, I\u2019m still thinking of what I should do next.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you need to do is to release everyone and return my body back to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Anson began to laugh hysterically, \u201cHahahahaha! Just look at you right now! You\u2019re tied in the basement and you can\u2019t move an inch. Yet, you think you are qualified to put forward conditions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving you conditions. I\u2019m giving you a word of advice. If you do what I say, we can give you a chance to escape and not call the cops.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Actually, I thought it was kind of funny how I was giving Anson conditions under these circumstances too. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cA word of advice\u2026.\u201d Anson repeated my words. Then, he nodded towards a direction and walked closer to me. Out of nowhere, he had a gun and he pressed it against my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay it again!\u201d Anson screeched.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

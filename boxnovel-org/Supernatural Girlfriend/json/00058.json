So, I loosened up and casually stated, \u201cI am already living with him. Shouldn\u2019t the type of our relationship be obvious? You\u2019re still a child, so you shouldn\u2019t know too much!\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, my words angered her. She gritted her teeth like she wanted to tear me in two. But I felt great on the inside. Who told her to mess with me on one of my moody days?</p><br/><p>I thought she was going to leave, so I was about to close the door. But suddenly, the child shoved me with surprising amount of strength and directly forced herself in.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang brother! Suyang brother!\u201d She shouted as she headed towards his bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi! You can\u2019t!\u201d That was a place even I haven\u2019t been in! I ran to stop her. But it was too late. Shen Shaonu had already opened the door.</p><br/><p>\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d This was the first time I\u2019ve seen Suyang\u2019s room. I couldn\u2019t help but suck in my breath.</p><br/><p>I was unable to restrain my laughter. Suyang\u2019s room was totally different from what I had imagined.</p><br/><p>Since his room had always been strictly prohibited, I had always assumed Suyang\u2019s room was a place where he\u2019d gain inspiration for his writing. So, I imagined he had all sorts of weird things inside.</p><br/><p>Instead, he had items piled up at every corner. His room was filled with all sorts of mangas, CD roms, Gundams, and action figures.</p><br/><p>It was as if this place was occupied by the fictional worlds of anime, comics, and games.</p><br/><p>Initially, I merely thought Suyang was a handsome otaku. Who would\u2019ve thought he was an anime manga otaku!?</p><br/><p>I was thoroughly defeated by Suyang. I never knew he had this side to him. So, I took out my cell phone and quickly snapped a few photos because I wanted to remember this marvelous moment.</p><br/><p>After all, I wasn\u2019t the one who opened his room. It was\u2026</p><br/><p><i>Oh shit! I almost forgot that the adolescence love-struck girl was going through Suyang\u2019s things! </i>It appeared she was searching for something in particular.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t allow her to keep doing this. So I quickly shut the door and blocked Shen Shaonu. \u201cEnough! What are you looking for?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for Suyang brother!\u201d Then, Shen Shaonu shoved me aside and bent down to peek under the sofa.</p><br/><p>I was speechless as I icily laughed. <i>Was this child crazy?</i> I kindly reminded her, \u201cDo you honestly think your Suyang brother would be underneath the sofa? Even a rat wouldn\u2019t be able to fit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShaonu, stop it!\u201d A stern voice rang from behind me. I turned around and noticed the solemn Shen Shaoqian. He looked like a completely different person from the drunkard he was yesterday.</p><br/><p>Shaonu turned around from searching and guiltily placed her hands behind her back, \u201cBro\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Bro? </i>A huge question mark popped up inside me. <i>This girl was Shen Shaoqian\u2019s little sister? </i></p><br/><p><i>Shen Shaoqian. Shen Shaonu\u2026. I should\u2019ve made the connection from the start! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t ashamed to come here at all?\u201d Shen Shaoqian angrily stormed over as he seized Shen Shaonu by the ear.</p><br/><p><i>What\u2019s going on?</i> I remained a silent observer.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little punk\u2026.I finally caught you! Give me back my money now!\u201d Shen Shaoqian still hadn\u2019t released Shen Shaonu\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! That\u2019s my money now. Why should I have give it back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy does a child like yourself need 50k? Give it back now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! No!\u201d Shen Shaonu began to shriek. Shen Shaoqian increased his strength and her voice began to turn squeaky. \u201cYou were the one who said you felt sorry for me so you wanted to give me some pocket money! You must keep your word!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>50k? How come that sounded so familiar. Could Shen Shaonu be the person who cheated 50k from Shen Shaoqian? Wow, these siblings are truly something else.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cDamn you! You got me drunk and then stole my money! If you actually wanted pocket money, don\u2019t you think I would give it to you? But you! Tell the truth! Are you giving that money to the boy every month?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot even\u2026.\u201d Shen Shaonu\u2019s aura was clearly much weaker now. \u201cZhangyang doesn\u2019t have any family of his own. He\u2019s all by himself. So I want to help him\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Shaoqian nodded and bitterly stated, \u201cDo a good deed? Wow. Amazing. Using your brother\u2019s money to do a good deed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust let me off this time! Also, I haven\u2019t gotten even with you for what you did yet!\u201d Shen Shaonu retorted.</p><br/><p>Shen Shaoqian sneered, \u201cOh yeah? What do you want to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst of all, who is she?\u201d Shen Shaonu gave me a dirty look as she coldly stated.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is a tenant here and Suyang\u2019s assistant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026assistant!\u201d Shen Shaonu gave me a devious look as she nodded and smiled, \u201cI knew it. Even if Suyang brother was hungry, he wouldn\u2019t eat any radish or salted vegetables. Psssh\u2026 you\u2019re just a worker\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t! Go! Overboard!\u201d I gnashed my teeth as I growled. <i>What\u2019s wrong with radish or salted vegetables? They taste good and are nutritious! How dare she look down on radish and salted vegetables? </i></p><br/><p><i>Plus, they were having a sibling argument. Why am I getting unjustly attacked during their internal battle? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cShaonu, how could you say something like that?\u201d Shen Shaoqian ruthlessly snatched a cushion from the sofa and threw it at her to teach her a lesson. \u201cYou should be acknowledging her as an older sister. How can you say the truth so blatantly in her face?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Finally, someone helped me! Yay\u2026wait? It didn\u2019t sound right? Oh my goodness. My young spirit was utterly being tore down by the Shen siblings today.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cAnyhow, bro, how could you introduce Mi Fan to Suyang brother? The moment I found out, I rushed here. Too bad I wasn\u2019t able to prevent him from going.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you trying to meddle in adults\u2019 affairs? Stop with the garbage and give me back my money!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! Mi Fan is an evil person. I will never approve of her and Suyang brother!\u201d Shen Shaonu yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would it matter whether you agree or not? What makes you think you have the right to get involved in Suyang\u2019s business? Return my money!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was quite obvious that Shen Shaoqian only wanted his money.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all your fault, Shen Shaoqian! You are single, but why must you have to worry about Suyang brother\u2019s status? Worry about yourself first! You\u2019re not young and you don\u2019t even have a girlfriend. Aren\u2019t you ashamed? I heard that mom and dad have been so naggy that you don\u2019t even dare to go home\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps Shen Shaoqian felt like he was losing face, because he gazed at the silent me and rushed to cover his sister\u2019s mouth as he warned, \u201cNo one will think you\u2019re mute if you say fewer words!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to talk!\u201d While they were fighting with each other, Shen Shaonu managed to free her mouth and continued, \u201cEven when you get girlfriends, you get scammed. You get cheated money and love. So it\u2019s safer if you just keep your money with your sister! I can be your savings account. You can come get your money when you\u2019re eighty years old.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be a miracle for me to live until eighty with a sister like you!\u201d Shen Shaoqian sighed, \u201cShut up! No. Go home with me. I have to talk to you about life!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Shaonu bit Shen Shaoqian and escaped from his grasp. \u201cI\u2019m not going home until I find out where Suyang brother and Mi Fan are meeting!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, I was thinking,<i> can\u2019t you two argue at your own home instead of here? Don\u2019t bother me\u2026.</i></p><br/><p>I was getting tired of standing. So, I sat on the sofa and crossed my legs and continued to watch the siblings bicker.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where they are meeting! I only gave Mi Fan\u2019s contacts to Suyang. He is the one who set up the date.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew it! But\u2026ha!\u201d Shen Shaonu proudly pulled out a little piece of paper out of nowhere, \u201cI know one of Suyang brother\u2019s habits. He has a tendency to write important things down. Sure enough, I found this in his room!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

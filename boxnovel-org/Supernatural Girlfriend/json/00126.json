I vaguely recalled Anson stabbing a needle in my arm. There was an intense prickly pain and then I lost all consciousness. By the time I woke up, my hands and legs were locked up in iron chains. I was in a stuffy black room.</p><br/><p>My head was spinning. I tried to move my fingers, but my body was reacting very strangely. It was having a hard time obeying my orders and I wasn\u2019t accustomed to it. It was as if it wasn\u2019t my body.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake?\u201d A woman dressed in a kimono pushed open the door and came in. She was holding something in her hands. Due to the dim lighting, I couldn\u2019t see her face clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I spoke, I froze. <i>Why was my voice\u2026.so deep?! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I said another line.<i> This wasn\u2019t my voice! This was a man\u2019s voice! Also, upon more careful examination, when were my hands and legs ever this long? I was also dressed in men\u2019s clothing!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cAnson, calm down.\u201d The woman came closer and handed a mirror to me. My reflection was the Anson makeup artist I met from Japan!</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d I screamed and threw the mirror. It shattered into pieces and I shoved the woman as I tried to break free from the iron chains. Due to my dramatic movements, metal clanging could be heard all around.</p><br/><p>The woman stood up and solemnly stated, \u201cFrom today onward, you are Anson.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying? What did you guys do to me?!\u201d I wanted to grab the woman, but due to the iron chains, I was very restrained.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell him to come here!\u201d I knew there was no point in screaming. So I tried to calm down, \u201cI want to see Anson.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never see him again. We\u2019re about to leave here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn another 5 hours, we will be taking a private plane and returning back to Japan. You should prepare yourself. You are no longer Lin Yixin. From now on, you will be living as a man. You will be living as Anson.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat type of joke are you trying to play?\u201d I icily laughed, \u201cI\u2019m Lin Yixin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou already saw who you are.\u201d Then, the woman coldly turned around to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I called out, \u201cWhy\u2026 why are you guys doing this to me? What is your motive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I cannot respond to your question. I\u2019m only following orders.\u201d Then, she left the room and I was left all alone in the pitch blackness.</p><br/><p><i>I\u2019m now\u2026.a man? </i></p><br/><p>All these crazy things kept happening one after another. <i>As a woman for 26 years, I\u2019ve suddenly became a man. </i></p><br/><p>Anson must have used some type of spell to switch our souls. He was able to possess Shen Shaoqian\u2019s body, so it must be no big deal for him.</p><br/><p>Based on what I could gather, Anson had already targetted me from Japan. <i>But what was his motive? Why switch souls with me? How come he wanted to be me? </i></p><br/><p>The more I thought about it, the more my head hurt. <i>Oh no! The woman said in 5 hours, we will be leaving here forever. That means, I must quickly find a way to escape and run. I have no idea what Anson is going to use my body for. What will he do to Suyang? I must hurry back!</i></p><br/><p><i>But my hands and legs were chained. How could I escape</i>\u2026..</p><br/><p>At this time, the door opened once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? You\u2019re awake?\u201d It was a woman. But her voice was different from the previous one. This woman\u2019s tone was a bit giddy. The one from earlier was very solemn.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d I cautiously stared at her; thinking, she must be one of the bad guys. They were working as a team.</p><br/><p>\u201cShhh! You don\u2019t know me. But I know you!\u201d The woman lowered her voice as she quietly tiptoed towards me, \u201cDo you know Xiazhi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is Xiazhi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! It\u2019s useless to ask you. As expected, you have no idea!\u201d The young lady sounded resentful, \u201cHe is my brother. My name is Xialing.\u201d</p><br/><p>I still had no idea who she was talking about.</p><br/><p>While I was confused, Xialing pulled out a hair clip from her hair and began to jab it into the keyhole area.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy poor big brother. He begged me to save you, yet you don\u2019t even know his name!\u201d Xialing continued to angrily jabbed at the lock. Soon, one of the chain bracelet came undone.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t dare to say too much. I was afraid I would anger her and she wouldn\u2019t help me anymore. So I waited until she unlocked all the chains before I asked, \u201cSeriously, who is Xiazhi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiazhi is the ghost bodyguard that guards your door 365 days a year! He\u2019s my biological brother!\u201d She blurted.</p><br/><p><i>What? So the ghost bodyguard\u2019s name is Xiazhi? He has a younger sister and she can see ghosts? </i></p><br/><p>I rubbed my injured wrists, \u201cYou could see ghosts too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s why I\u2019m part of Anson\u2019s team.\u201d Xialing laughed.</p><br/><p>Although she said that, I had a feeling she wasn\u2019t going to harm me.</p><br/><p>Xialing patted my shoulder, \u201cI\u2019m here to help you escape!\u201d</p><br/><p>Based on my current circumstances, I was in no place to ponder whether she was being genuine or not. So I directly went straight to the point, \u201cAre you seriously going to help me escape?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Xialing responded confidently, \u201cFollow me! I guarantee I\u2019ll bring you back to my brother undamaged and intact. Except\u2026your current appearance will probably be a huge disappointment to him!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Xialing reminded me that I was currently in Anson\u2019s body. I had his face and I was a man. </i></p><br/><p>Xialing lightly pushed open the door and poked her head out. After she was certain there were no one around, she quietly whispered, \u201cListen. There are surveillance cameras everywhere. Regardless of how much we try to hide, we will be discovered. So, the best solution is to run for your life. Run as fast as you can through the secret path and you will see the exit. I parked my car right outside the exit. So, we will run into the car and escape as quickly as possible. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I nodded vigorously. I could only trust Xialing now.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne! Two! Three! Run!\u201d Xialing counted. Then, we both ran for our lives.</p><br/><p>A man\u2019s body was definitely designed very differently from a female\u2019s body. I was able to take larger steps and naturally, I was much faster than I used to be. Whereas, Xialing was huffing and puffing behind me.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-\u2026you\u2019re running too fast!\u201d She panted as she tried her best to catch up to me.</p><br/><p>In no time, we ran out of the secret path. The moment we exited, the bright sunlight shone through the tree branches and into our eyes. My eyes were not used to the intense lighting. Everything seemed very hazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you still standing around? Hurry and get on!\u201d Xialing rushed me to get into the car. I snapped out of my zone and sat in the passenger seat. She smoothly started to vehicle and we escaped.</p><br/><p><i>Wasn\u2019t this escape a bit too simple? There weren\u2019t anyone after us?\u2026. It was suspicious</i>.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! We escaped! I\u2019m so smart!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now, I could finally see Xialing\u2019s face. She seemed very quick-witted and cute. She was chewing gum as she hummed a song while driving.</p><br/><p>She was relaxed, but I wasn\u2019t. \u201cLet me process this. So you\u2019re Xiazhi\u2019s little sister. And Xiazhi is the ghost bodyguard outside my apartment, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYup!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how come I have never seen you before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must ask my big bro about that\u2026. He was worried if you found out he has a sister who could see ghosts, you would tell me to take him away. So, he wouldn\u2019t allow me to appear in front of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said? You two are able to communicate?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, not all supernatural people are like you. You don\u2019t even know how to make basic communication. That\u2019s so garbage\u2026 aiii.. Seriously, you\u2019re wasting God\u2019s gift!\u201d Xialing sighed. \u201cAnyhow, I promised him I would save you. He promised he will go and reincarnate as well. If he tries to change his mind, make sure you try to convince him, ok?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiazhi can reincarnate?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! But he doesn\u2019t want to leave you.\u201d Xialing\u2019s expression became more sullen, \u201cI do want him to remain by my side, but I don\u2019t want him to remain as a ghost forever\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your relationship with Anson?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was once his subordinate. But not anymore.\u201d Xialing casually stated her betrayal.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you betray Anson?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!! You can\u2019t say it like that! I\u2019m doing it for my brother!\u201d Xialing emphasized.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is Anson\u2019s motive?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xialing began to giggle. But I was clueless.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! You\u2026 haha\u2026 oh my god! I can\u2019t handle this. Are you really stupid or acting stupid? At this point, you still can\u2019t tell Anson\u2019s motive?\u201d Xialing shook her head, \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThink about it. Why would Anson try his best to capture you and switch souls with you? Please, use your brain.\u201d Xialing pointed at my head, \u201cThink!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe thing I don\u2019t understand is, he seems to recognize and knows Suyang. But Suyang has never talked about him before\u2026. The first time I met Anson was in Japan\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>*giggle* Xialing broke out in laughter again. I turned to look at her.</p><br/><p>She explained, \u201cSorry. It\u2019s just that you have Anson\u2019s face right now but you\u2019re analyzing Anson. You must understand why this is hilarious to me\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Oh yeah. My biggest issue and problem is, how can I get my body back?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cKeep investigating. You\u2019re almost there. I won\u2019t laugh again! I swear!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJapan?\u201d I recalled Grandmother Meng saying how Suyang\u2019s parents died in Japan.<i> At the time, it was the fault of Suyang\u2019s playmate\u2026.could it be? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cSo Anson\u2019s target was Suyang all along? He is Suyang\u2019s childhood friend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve finally figured it out!\u201d Xialing smiled, \u201cYou weren\u2019t as stupid as I thought!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo why is he trying to get him back in every possible means? He wants to fix the friendship as Lin Yixin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPshh! What friendship!? At this point, it\u2019s definitely love!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLove?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess Miss Yixin is still confused. Allow me to simplify it for you. Back then, Anson caused the death of Suyang\u2019s parents. Afterwards, Suyang returned to China and cut off all ties with him. But there\u2019s another secret that no one knows. Since childhood, Anson has loved Suyang. Think about it, now that he was the main culprit of Suyang\u2019s parents\u2019 death, how else could he return to Suyang\u2019s side? Of course, he must use you! Get it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come you know so much?\u201d <i>As Suyang\u2019s girlfriend, I didn\u2019t even know this</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already been working with Anson for 4 years! If I don\u2019t even know this, my life must be a lie\u2026.\u201d Xialing rolled her eyes at me.</p><br/><p><i>4 years?! Yet, she betrayed Anson the moment her brother asked her to. I should be thankful to Xialing; even if she wasn\u2019t doing it for me. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cSo according to you, Anson has always loved Suyang. So, he plans to use my identity to be with him?\u2026but he\u2019s a man?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho says a man cannot love another man?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>True</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, he\u2019s not a man anymore! If you don\u2019t stop him soon, who knows what he will do with your body.\u201d Xialing smiled cunningly, \u201cYou know, Anson is ruthless. He\u2019s a psycho that\u2019s willing to do anything to get to his goal. Although I was his subordinate, I must admit that he is insane.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Of course I knew. From the day he kidnapped me, I already knew when I saw his eyes flashed.</i></p><br/>\n</div>"}

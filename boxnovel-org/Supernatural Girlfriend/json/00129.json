As for what happened here, I don\u2019t know. It was already a mess when I came.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother\u2019s client?\u201d Suyang narrowed his eyes to indicate his lack of trust towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi! You must be Suyang?\u201d I lightly punched Suyang on the shoulder. <i>That was how guys say hi, right? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother Meng often brings you up. You\u2019re his wonderful grandson, eh? Hahaha! I think she\u2019s busy today so I guess I\u2019m going to go too! Bye!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as I was about to leave, Suyang blocked me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait\u2026what\u2026?\u201d Suyang grabbed my arm and wouldn\u2019t let go. Then, with his other hand, he dialed a number.</p><br/><p>Grandmother Meng\u2019s cell phone began to ring on the table.</p><br/><p><i>Alright, I admit\u2026Grandmother Meng is missing and there\u2019s a mysterious man in her apartment. I\u2019m definitely very suspicious\u2026. But what could I say? Directly tell Suyang I\u2019m Lin Yixin? He\u2019s going to think I\u2019m insane! Plus, earlier I was already planning to tell Xialing I\u2019ll leave so that everyone could remain safe</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHave I seen you from somewhere before?\u201d</p><br/><p>My heart thumped. <i>Could Suyang recognize me? No way!? We aren\u2019t at the stage where we could see through each others\u2019 souls yet!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cYou look very familiar to me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Oh yeah! I am Anson now. \u201cWe\u201d used to be childhood playmates. Although that happened years ago, there must still be some sort of resemblance. It wasn\u2019t all that weird Suyang thought my face looked familiar. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cMost people often say I look like someone they know. Maybe I just have a face catered to the mass? Haha\u2026\u201d I pulled my arm out of Suyang\u2019s grasp.</p><br/><p>Suyang went over to Grandmother Meng\u2019s desk and picked up her phone. Based on his expression, I could tell his brain was speculating. I wanted to silently slip out while he was focused.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Suyang\u2019s voice rang from behind me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026er\u2026 Grandmother Meng isn\u2019t here right now. There\u2019s no reason for me to remain here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy grandma is missing and you are at the scene of the crime. You cannot leave!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Darn it. I couldn\u2019t even escape if I wanted to.</i> \u201cSo what do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to the police station with me! We are reporting the case to the authorities.\u201d Suyang grabbed my collar and dragged me. He was totally treating me like a man. He was so rough!</p><br/><p>Seeing how aggressive Suyang was acting, Xialing instantly knew I did not tell him the truth. She ran and blocked us, \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>I was trying to use my eyes to seek for help. I wanted her to think of a solution for us.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yes. You\u2019re also a suspect. You must go to the police station with us.\u201d With his other hand, Suyang grabbed onto Xialing\u2019s pigtails and dragged us both with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThink of a plan! You\u2019re a man right now\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! Wait! We can\u2019t go to the police station. Let me go and let\u2019s have a civilized chat!\u201d I yelled. However, Suyang ignored me. I had no choice but to shout, \u201cI -I know how to find Grandmother Meng!\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, Suyang halted his steps, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLend me your cell phone! I can find Grandmother Meng.\u201d</p><br/><p>I ignored Suyang\u2019s suspicious glance as I repeated, \u201cGive me your cell phone for a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do with it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t run off with it. If you want to find Grandmother Meng, just listen to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou better tell me what you know. Or else, I swear to God you\u2019re going to die a pitiful death!\u201d Suyang glared at me. This was the first time he had ever threatened me so cruelly before. I was annoyed.</p><br/><p><i>If you know I\u2019m Lin Yixin, you wouldn\u2019t behave like this! Humph! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, how about I give my phone to you, and you give me yours to make a call. Ok?\u201d I involuntarily pushed Xialing and made her help me and Suyang exchange phones.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou better remain in an area I could see you. If you plan to run, you\u2019re dead! You\u2019re a suspect!\u201d Suyang warned.</p><br/><p>I turned around and rolled my eyes. Then, I took Suyang\u2019s phone and went over to a far corner where he could still see me but not hear me as I dialed my number.</p><br/><p>Since Anson was acting as me, he must be using my phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it, Suyang?\u201d Anson picked up almost instantaneously. Clearly, Suyang was top priority for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Suyang. Can you guess who I am? I\u2019m the woman whom you almost sent to a mental institution. Actually, I\u2019m a man now\u2026.\u201d I threatened.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have Suyang\u2019s phone? You went to find him?\u201d Even through the phone, I could hear Anson gritting his teeth.</p><br/><p>It was definitely not a good idea to piss him off. So, I decided to calm him down, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I haven\u2019t said anything to Suyang. I am making a call because I wanted to let you know I\u2019ve made my decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to negotiate with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Grandmother Meng is in your hands, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYup. That old woman is very against your relationship with Suyang. I was just lectured a big deal. She talked too much so I\u2019m letting her sleep for a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hurt her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s up to you to decide?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Suyang\u2019s only family member. If you do something to her, he\u2019ll never forgive you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, from now on, I\u2019m Suyang\u2019s family. I\u2019ll be his only family member.\u201d Anson\u2019s bigotry was strong.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you let Grandmother Meng go and promise you won\u2019t hurt anyone else, I\u2019ll promise to let you be Lin Yixin for the rest of your life. You can get what you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m stupid? If you don\u2019t have Grandmother Meng, you definitely can\u2019t get your body back. With a face of a man, Suyang is not going to believe you regardless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to bet?\u201d These days, my threatening skills have improved substantially. Anson didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guarantee I won\u2019t show up in front of Suyang ever again. You are Lin Yixin and I\u2019ll be Anson. We\u2019ll be like this forever as long as you let Grandmother Meng go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy should I trust you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am using Suyang\u2019s cell phone but I didn\u2019t tell him the truth. You still can\u2019t trust me? I\u2019m being sincere right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to save Grandmother Meng. If my departure will ensure everyone\u2019s safety, I\u2019m willing to compromise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Anson began to laugh, \u201cDon\u2019t make yourself sound like a saint\u2026 you better not try to fool me. Or else, all of you will die! Fine, if you don\u2019t want to go to Japan, I\u2019ll prepare something else for you. After your departure has been verified, I will release Grandmother Meng.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Deal.\u201d I hung up. My heart felt very heavy.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t dare to turn around the instant I realized I might never see Suyang again in my lifetime. I was afraid that I wouldn\u2019t be able to control my tears the moment I see his face.</p><br/><p>I was a man right now. <i>What type of man cries so easily? </i></p><br/><p>I slowly began to readjust my emotions and deleted the record of the call. Then, I casually walked over to Suyang and handed him back his phone. \u201cAt the latest, Grandmother Meng should be home by tomorrow night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho did you talk to?\u201d Suyang was going through the records but I had already deleted it. \u201cYou\u2019re really a suspicious person. Who are you?!\u201d Suyang glared at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cA person you don\u2019t know.\u201d I coolly replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou look so familiar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, Grandmother Meng is missing because she was helping me. But I\u2019ve already located her. Sorry for all the troubles I\u2019ve caused you.\u201d I gave Suyang a bow. Then, I got up and gave Xialing a \u201cwe should leave\u201d look.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to leave again? Do you think I\u2019ll let you leave when I know the reason why my granny is missing is because of you? You must remain within my field of vision until my grandma is back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBelieve me, she\u2019ll come back soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy should I trust you?\u201d Suyang still wouldn\u2019t let go. At this rate, I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to control my emotions.</p><br/><p>I lowered my head and avoided his eyes, \u201cPlease, just trust me once!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! Until I\u2019m certain my grandma is back, I won\u2019t let you go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang!\u201d I yelled. I made up my mind and decisively made eye contact with him, \u201cTrust me. I know I may be a stranger to you, but please look me in the eye. You\u2019ll trust me.\u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason, maybe I was superstitious; but I was quite certain that regardless of what I had turned into, Suyang will trust me after seeing the sincerity in my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cStrange. My intuition is telling me to trust you. But if you dare to lie to me, I\u2019ll make sure you will die without your corpse.\u201d Suyang finally released his grip on my arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust in case!\u201d Suyang took out his phone and \u201cka cha\u201d a photo of me before I could react.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are really a criminal, I\u2019ll take your picture to the police station and get them to arrest you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes yes, whatever!\u201d I grabbed Xialing and the two of us left.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve decided to leave?\u201d Xialing leaned over and whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, after hearing your suggestion, I think it\u2019s the best solution. At least, I can save someone if I go.\u201d I looked off into the distance and couldn\u2019t help but feel depressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cRegardless where you go, I\u2019ll follow you!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was surprised to hear this from Xialing. It was touching but I softly refused, \u201cI\u2019ll be fine on my own. Why would I make you leave your native home as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou make it sound like you\u2019re being sent away to serve a penal sentence.\u201d She complained.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it true? I have to leave my native town and live elsewhere for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think of it like that. Perhaps, you\u2019ll realize you prefer living abroad after you begin your new life! Maybe your new life will be better than your current one!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue. My life is already such a mess. Could it get any worse? Look at me. I have been a woman for 26 years and now I\u2019m a man!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026a very hot man\u2026.\u201d Xialing muttered.</p><br/><p>Anson was very efficient. I could tell how badly he wanted me to disappear. Within a few hours, he already had the airfare, passport, visa, and everything prepared.</p><br/><p>Xialing and I went to a nearby mall for three hours. Then, she directly took me to the airport. During the three hours, I took a last glimpse of my native land for 26 years.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough Anson says there will be someone waiting for you in United States, you should still have some sort of luggage. It would be very inconvenient if you don\u2019t have anything. Why don\u2019t you fetch your boarding pass while I go nearby to get you some items for daily use?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. Ever since my soul was swapped, you\u2019ve been a tremendous help. You\u2019re not even related to me. I feel like I owe you a lot\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho says we\u2019re not related? If my brother was still alive, he would\u2019ve probably beat Suyang to it! You would probably already be my sister-in-law!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou and your naughty mouth.\u201d I rubbed her head. I knew Xialing liked intimate acts from me as I had Anson\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>I watched as Xialing diligently left. I stood in line and waited to get my boarding pass.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

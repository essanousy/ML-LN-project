But aside from me, there weren\u2019t anyone else. The whole staircase was empty. The atmosphere was very creepy.</p><br/><p><i>Could it be a ghost? But ghosts can\u2019t speak?! </i></p><br/><p>Perhaps I haven\u2019t spoken for far too long, the lights from the staircase suddenly turned off and scared me out of my mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhh!!!!\u201d I yelled. The lights turned back on. But it was definitely much dimmer than before. On the inside, I was very nervous because I was truly afraid that there was someone or something following me.</p><br/><p><i>Am I hallucinating?</i> The voice never appeared again. My heart began to calm down and I thought to myself,</p><br/><p><i>I only have to get on the first floor. It\u2019ll be ok once I get to the first floor. </i></p><br/><p>So, I began to focus on my task again. While I was three steps away from landing, it was as if someone suddenly shoved me from the back. I fell from the stairs and painfully landed on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d I screamed into the walkie-talkie and directly fell down the stairs. My painful cry echoed all around me. It felt very eerie.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck?!\u2026.\u201d I went to check my injury. There was a throbbing pain on my wrist. I must have sprained it.</p><br/><p>Since Suyang couldn\u2019t locate me, he would eventually come find me. So, I sat at the lowest step as I waited for him.</p><br/><p>As expected, in less than three minutes, I could hear Suyang huffing and puffing up the stairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d I tapped on the handrail and yelled down below.</p><br/><p>By the time Suyang reached my floor, he was already out of breath. He collapsed like a mess in front of me. \u201cI f-finally found you\u2026.! You never replied back to my message. I thought something happened to you!\u201d He panted.</p><br/><p>I pointed at my hand, \u201cSomething did happen to me. My wrist is injured.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI fell and twisted it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could you be so careless?\u201d Suyang had his eyes closed as he raised one hand to indicate that he needed a moment to catch his breath.</p><br/><p>A few minutes later, he crouched down and said, \u201cAlright, climb up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy wrist is injured, not my ankle. Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t want to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, since you offered\u2026\u201d I tried my best to straighten my arm. But I could barely touch his shoulder. \u201cNo, I need you to help me up. I can\u2019t get on your back while sitting down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang helped me up and I leaned against the handrail before I was able to leap onto his back. While Suyang carried me, I placed my chin on his shoulder and gave him a sideway glance. He was sweating profusely.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you stupid? Why didn\u2019t you take the elevator?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang gave me a bitter smile and refuted, \u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s stupid for asking that question. How would I have known which floor you were on? Obviously I had to check every single one!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah. I forgot. Which floor are we on now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c21st.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? After so long, I\u2019ve only gotten down 9 floors?\u201d I found the truth very unacceptable. But knowing that Suyang had ran straight up to find me was very touching.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, I tightened my grip around his neck. I wanted to hold him closer.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoldfish\u2026..\u201d Suyang sounded like he was suffocating, \u201cAt this rate, I\u2019m going to pass out.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Ugh! He\u2019s always ruining the mood!</i></p><br/><p>After 20 floors later, Suyang and I had an argument. He said we had to return back to the apartment to wrap my wrist and rest. But I wanted my free meal. I said he promised. So we were in the front of the elevators for a very long time.</p><br/><p>Suyang pressed the floor of our apartment. But I pressed the 1st floor. Ultimately, Suyang pressed 27th floor and pushed me all the way into a corner where I wouldn\u2019t be able to touch the elevator buttons.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Let me go! Suyang! I want to go for dinner! I\u2019m hungry!\u201d I didn\u2019t care that my wrist was killing me as I began to smack his back; whining.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe good. We can always go out to eat another time. But we must take care of the injury now. Or else, you will suffer from repercussions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m fine! Look!\u201d I climbed on Suyang\u2019s back and flung my uninjured wrist in front of him. \u201cLet\u2019s go eat, ok?\u201d I tried to look pitiful.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe other hand!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Darn it</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about I go buy whatever you want to eat after I wrap your injury? Ok?\u201d</p><br/><p>I shook my head, \u201cIt\u2019s different if you bring it back. I want to eat in a restaurant. I want it hot and steamy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, today, you\u2019re not allowed to go out.\u201d Suyang put me down and was about to open the door.</p><br/><p><i>Humph! Fine, you can stay home and eat by yourself. </i>For some strange reason, I was extremely stubborn about eating out today.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet back here, you!\u201d Suyang grabbed onto me. Sigh. I thought he was going to give in. But Suyang ended up placing me over his shoulders and dumping me inside the apartment.</p><br/><p>I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to get my way today. So, I laid on the couch in a  shape and howled, \u201cHungry\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me what you want. I\u2019ll order takeout.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to eat pig trotters, fried chicken, pizza, hamburger, roast duck, marinated beef, hotpot, bbq\u2026.\u201d I named everything I liked.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop stop stop!\u201d Suyang cut me off, \u201cYou may only choose one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I pick fried chicken! I want fried chicken!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s how you gained so much weight\u2026.\u201d Suyang quietly muttered. Then, he took out his phone from his pocket and called for fried chicken takeout.</p><br/><p><i>Fine! I\u2019ll pretend I didn\u2019t hear that comment!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang, my wrist hurts a lot\u2026.\u201d I showed him my wrist and pretended to act weak and delicate.</p><br/><p>Suyang calmly looked at me. \u201cI thought you said it didn\u2019t hurt earlier? Your body is quite unique.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Fine! I\u2019ll hold it in! Just you wait! You\u2019re going to fall into my trap!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you will help me wrap my wrist?\u201d I tried my best to speak as lightly as possible. The goal was to completely catch Suyang off guard. <i>Then I will\u2026 muahaha!</i></p><br/><p><i>I will give him a fatal blow! How dare he called me fat! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too careless. How could you always be so clumsy?\u201d Suyang nagged me like a granny as he took out the medical box and inspected my wrist, \u201cLook at this. It\u2019s all red.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Suyang wasn\u2019t paying attention, I unbuttoned the first two buttons of my blouse. I wanted to use this opportunity to tease him a bit.</p><br/><p><i>That\u2019s what he gets for not taking me out to dinner</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>I gazed at Suyang\u2019s face and waited for his reaction.</p><br/><p><i>Huh? No reaction? Could it be that it wasn\u2019t obvious enough? </i></p><br/><p>While Suyang wasn\u2019t looking, I unbuttoned another button. This time, I deliberately brushed against his hand.</p><br/><p><i>Still no reaction? This man is too focused! How come he can\u2019t multitask?! Now I feel like I have no charm\u2026 ugh. So sad. </i></p><br/><p>Just as I was about to unbutton the 4th button, Suyang commented, \u201cStop unbuttoning your buttons. At this rate, I can see your bra.\u201d The whole time, he was massaging my wrist.</p><br/><p>My hand stopped in mid air and I awkwardly looked at Suyang. <i>So he noticed</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cCalling you stupid is being nice\u2026.\u201d Suyang shook his head. However, he had a crafty smile on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s just me and you here. Are you sure you want to seduce me?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Oh! My! God! </i></p><br/><p><i>I was fooled by his innocent face! Although Suyang looked like a pure boy, I almost forgot he was a kissing maniac. </i></p><br/><p>Thinking of this, I quickly pulled my hands away and buttoned up my blouse.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, right now, you\u2019re injured. I\u2019m usually not the type that would take advantage of the weak. But since you\u2019re so willing today\u2026..\u201d Suyang shifted his body and gradually moved closer towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? I don\u2019t understand!\u201d I used one hand to stop Suyang from getting any closer as I began to shift backwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Yixin, would you like to be my woman?\u201d Suyang seductively asked. His face was flushed as he gazed at me.</p><br/><p><i>He was putting me on the spot. Regardless of my response, it was to his advantage. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we already boyfriend and girlfriend?\u201d I pretended to be naive and avoided the question.</p><br/><p><i>How come Suyang was suddenly so brave? It wasn\u2019t like him. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cToday, you\u2019re the one who tried to seduce me first.\u201d Suyang whispered into my ears. My soul practically flew out.</p><br/><p>*Ding dong* <i>Whew. The takeout person saved me.</i></p><br/><p>Suyang sighed and got up. I could hear him mumbling resentfully, \u201cHow are the takeouts are so fast these days?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang looked very unwilling as he went to get the door. But then, I saw his body froze. Based on my womanly instinct, something bad was about to happen.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Whose words were fake?</i> Strangely, I never saw Xu Weishan\u2019s ghost again\u2026</p><br/><p>She was like the wind that had disappeared from my life.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d After hearing Hong Xiaobei\u2019s story, I went to visit Grandmother Meng. I had my arms on my waist as I demanded answers from her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She appeared to be surprised by my sudden visit and didn\u2019t move from her seat for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it that the story I heard from the ghost is different from the story I heard from a person? Didn\u2019t you say I could experience her thoughts if I allowed Xu Weishan to enter my body? Could it be that what I saw wasn\u2019t the truth?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmother Meng lowered her head as she thought about it. \u201cWhen you allow a ghost to enter your body, you\u2019re only temporarily allowing her to occupy your mind. That way, you can see her thoughts. However, if she has the intentions to lie to you, then what you see would naturally be based off her imagination.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe could do that?\u201d I opened my mouth wide. I felt like all the strength had been sucked out of me as I weakly sat down on the chair, \u201cSo\u2026..so I was lied to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWere you lied to by the ghost that you came with last time?\u201d Grandmother Meng leaned her body forward as she stretched her neck towards me.</p><br/><p>I nodded, \u201cIt appears that I was.\u201d</p><br/><p>Being deceived by Xu Weishan was like getting hit at the back of my head by a stranger. The more I thought about it, the more speechless I became. \u201cShe came to me like a victim, begging me to help her capture her killer. But it turns out she was the one who caused her own death. What the hell?! How could a person be like this\u2026?! Ah! No, how could there be a ghost like this?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot all the ghosts in this world are good. There are also bad ones. Since there are bad people too, naturally there will be bad ghosts as well.\u201d Grandmother Meng tried to comfort me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me this now?\u201d I resentfully responded, \u201cIf I had known the information I was shown could\u2019ve been fake, I could\u2019ve prepared myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you beforehand! You probably forgot on your own!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I shook my head and instantly lost confidence, \u201cR-really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps, I have forgotten to say?\u201d Grandmother Meng seemed confused herself.</p><br/><p>While she was scrambling through her thoughts, I raised my voice, \u201cOf course you didn\u2019t tell me! If not, how could I have been deceived?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although that was what I said, deep down, my memories were vaguely beginning to surface. I think Grandmother Meng had warned me once. At the time, I was probably not paying attention.</p><br/><p>Grandmother Meng suddenly changed the topic in another direction, \u201cBy the way, how is my treasured grandson doing lately?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing? The same as usual\u2026.he eats well, sleeps well, he still has a poisonous tongue and a heart of stone.\u201d I casually replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre there any women he\u2019s getting closer with? Do you know whether he likes anyone right now? Or maybe\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Deep down, I thought to myself. <i>Suyang is a fickle person. When he\u2019s happy, he would appear to love or pamper you. But when he\u2019s grumpy, he would ignore you\u2026. Whoever that he likes will suffer a lot of bad luck! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cThe woman that he\u2019s closest with is me! Granny, am I an insider that you have placed around Suyang? No! On a work relationship level, Suyang pays me a salary. I refuse to leak out any of my boss\u2019s secrets. This is the basic principle of an assistant!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo we have a work relationship? We\u2019re talking as sisters! \u2026.it\u2019s a common topic. Come on. Let\u2019s talk about our grandson.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt a stab in my chest and nearly spat out blood. I had totally forgotten that we were sworn sisters!</p><br/><p>\u201cGranny, can you not joke around? Granny, how old are you? How could we be sworn sisters?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeing sworn sisters have nothing to do with age. Plus, I\u2019m trying to prevent you from having inappropriate thoughts about my Suyang!\u201d Grandmother Meng grinned. Suddenly, her smile froze on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What? Why did your expression change so suddenly?\u201d</p><br/><p>All of Grandmother Meng\u2019s wrinkles were scrunched together. She was motionless. It was making me feel very apprehensive.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move! Let me see you.\u201d Grandmother Meng firmly stated as she began to flip my eyelids and browsed up and down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you secretly try to allow a ghost to enter your body again?\u201d Grandmother Meng solemnly questioned me.</p><br/><p>I blankly stared at her, \u201cOf course not! Didn\u2019t you say that I should only do it under your supervision? \u2026.what? Did something happen to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnfavourable blood, pale complexion, dark eye socket\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Deep down, I thought to myself\u2026<i>Are you sure it\u2019s not due to Suyang\u2019s torture?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cBased on your current state, if you didn\u2019t physically give a ghost permission to enter your body, then the ghost must have attempted multiple times to enter your body without your consent. Fortunately, she didn\u2019t succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmother Meng\u2019s words were too horrifying. I felt goosebumps all over my arm. All of a sudden, everywhere began to feel very cold\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSo are you saying that Xu Weishan secretly tried to enter my body? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dripped your blood for her. That is equivalent to signing a contract. She has the rights to enter your body. From the looks of it, she had evil intentions and wanted to replace you to continue living in this world!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo freaky?!\u201d Thinking back, \u201cThere was a time when I was out. Originally, I was totally fine, but suddenly everything became very blurry. By the time I woke up, I was at the hospital. Was that related to her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so. You lost consciousness because the ghost wanted to enter your body and forcefully dominate your consciousness. Fortunately, she was unfamiliar with the procedure and failed.\u201d Grandmother Meng leaned back against her chair as she frankly stated.</p><br/><p><i>Who would\u2019ve thought Xu Weishan was such a terrifying person? </i></p><br/><p><i>I was kindhearted enough to help her, yet she wanted to replace me? What\u2019s the difference between this and killing me? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s going to happen to me now? Do I have to hide from her forever?\u201d I frantically glanced at Grandmother Meng a few times. She seemed so relaxed that I began to stomp my feet, \u201cThis is related to my life! Can you attach more importance to it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2026.the contract will naturally lose its effectiveness as time passes. In the meantime, wear this for self-protection.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmother Meng handed me a necklace. She said it could prevent ghosts from getting near me.</p><br/><p>I held onto the ugly necklace that had a ghost drawn on it as I thought to myself.<i> Oh God! How can I be so unlucky? I was targetted and used by an evil ghost. What\u2019s even more pitiful is that my life is dependent on a necklace. </i></p><br/><p>This was the first time I felt like the path home from Grandmother Meng\u2019s was so endless.</p><br/><p>Underneath the streetlamp, I could see a drunken ghost. He was holding an empty liquor bottle. <i>It could be a dangerous weapon.</i>..<i>stay further from him\u2026stay further from him..</i></p><br/><p>Furthermore, recently, there was a car accident around here. As a result, there was a new ghost around. He had only passed away a few days ago, so he didn\u2019t want to leave this world. <i>I must stay further from him\u2026.stay further from him\u2026</i></p><br/><p>Also, I always saw the High School girl ghost at the intersection. She was holding onto her report card. <i>Ah! She made eye contact with me\u2026.no\u2026. Must stay further away from her\u2026stay further away from her\u2026</i></p><br/><p>All these ghosts I was familiar with suddenly seemed so evil. <i>Why were they watching me? Did they want to replace me too?</i></p><br/><p>Due to my unstable emotions, I didn\u2019t even look at my hot bodyguard\u2019s face when I had returned back to the apartment.</p><br/><p>Remember, my hot bodyguard\u2019s face is his everything! That\u2019s the reason why I keep him around!</p><br/><p>Now, I\u2019m even afraid to make eye contact with my ghost pets. I had shrank my body into the sofa as I watched them play. Normally, I would be gazing at them with a satisfied expression. But today, I kept thinking that they want to replace me. What if I end up on the newspaper? Headline: <i>Wow! A woman that acts like a dog! </i></p><br/><p>Simply imagining it was nauseating.</p><br/><p>Suyang\u2019s shoes were by the entrance. I assumed he was busy in his own room.</p><br/><p>I turned on all the lights in the living room as I continuously stroked the necklace with my fingertips.</p><br/><p>For the past 25 years, this was the first time I had encountered a ghost that wanted to harm me. This shock will take me a long time to get over. As the saying goes, \u201cOnce you\u2019ve been bitten by a snake, you\u2019ll be afraid of a rope for ten years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMerciful Buddha\u2026 Merciful Buddha\u2026.\u201d I muttered.</p><br/><p>Before my butt could warm my seat, my cell phone rang. I was startled. It was an unknown number.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve been watching me.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

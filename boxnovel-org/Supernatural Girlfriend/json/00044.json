I don\u2019t have to tell you where I went. It\u2019s my privacy.\u201d These days, I was becoming more and more stubborn.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve had previous convictions, of course I have to watch out for you.\u201d Suyang flatly stated as he leaned his body towards the left. Most likely, he was playing a race car game and needed to make a right turn.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by previous convictions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t care about your life in the past. Who knows whether you\u2019ve gotten into some trouble again\u2026. Everyday, I have to watch you. Because of you, I\u2019ve already aged more than a decade! At the end of the day, am I your actual boss or are you my boss?!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Suyang continue to jabber on and on, I squeezed out a forced smile. Sadly, I was already involved in the Xu Weishan mystery.</p><br/><p>Although I was thinking of this, I still tried to reassure him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. Why would there be so many things for me to get involved in? Stop blindly accusing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen come and play a game with me!\u201d Suyang seemed to have finished with his current game. He patted on the spot next to him, \u201cThis is your boss\u2019s order. Come here.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>How come I felt like a dog instead?</i> I was a bit annoyed, but nonetheless, I still woefully went to his side.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor you!\u201d Suyang handed me a video game controller, \u201cThis is how you move forward, backward, left, right, accelerate, and drift\u2026understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstand my ass!\u201d He spoke faster than my Senior High School health studies. Even a ghost wouldn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>However, Suyang disregarded my protest. The game was starting, and he was clearly bullying a newcomer. There were a total of three rounds. After the game was over, he won by two rounds.</p><br/><p>After his win, Suyang appeared to be joyfully satisfied as he insulted me, \u201cYou suck at basketball. You also suck at race car.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I haven\u2019t gotten enough practice. If I play a few more times, watch me surpass you!\u201d <i>How could I let him look down on me?</i></p><br/><p>Hence, our battle began.</p><br/><p>We played hundreds of times, and I lost hundreds of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing anymore!\u201d I felt like I was going to explode from the continuous losses. So, I threw the video game controller aside and reclined on the couch. Deep down, I was thinking, \u201cHe had already played for so many years. Whereas, I have only played for a day. How could I beat him\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you tired?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy heart is tired!\u201d I shut my eyes. I was honestly very exhausted. In a few more seconds, I would have fallen asleep.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour face\u2026.\u201d Suddenly, Suyang used his hand to pinch my face. I was so surprised that I hurriedly opened my eyes and escaped from his evil clutches.</p><br/><p>I heartlessly slapped his hand away and snapped, \u201cWhat are you trying to do? Sexual assault? Psycho\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t move.\u201d Suyang placed one of his hands behind my back and prevented me from moving backwards. Then, he shifted towards me and tilted my chin up with his other hand as he stared at the left side of my face. He spoke forcefully and with justice, \u201cStrange\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Here we go again. Suyang is always making intimate moves on me without giving any prior notice. </i></p><br/><p>Likewise, my heart was pounding without prior notice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d His tone made me feel frightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something\u2026..\u201d Suyang licked his finger and began to wipe his saliva on my face, \u201con your face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh!?\u201d I grabbed Suyang\u2019s wrist and made an excuse, \u201cYour saliva\u2026is so filthy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFilthy? There\u2019s something sticking on your face, I\u2019m helping you remove it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need! No thanks!\u201d I rolled off the couch and ran to the washroom to see what was on my face.</p><br/><p>It was\u2026.</p><br/><p>I touched the faint red bloodstain on my cheek. This was Xiao Xin\u2019s blood.</p><br/><p>I stood in front of the mirror for a very long time as I fixedly stared at the bloodstain like I was watching a whirlpool. My eyes continued to enlarge. What type of world was this poor child living in?</p><br/><p>I had no idea.</p><br/><p>While I was deep in thought, Suyang was leaning by the washroom door without my notice. His presence brought me back to reality, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you wiped it off? I seriously don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing on a daily basis\u2026\u201d It sounded like he was complaining and investigating at the same time. Suyang was waiting for me to explain.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a child\u2019s blood. The child is around eight or nine years old. Today, he was on the swings underneath a tree. He collapsed in front of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I spoke, my voice began to tremble more and more. It was as if there was something stuck inside my heart and throat. I felt congested.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is his blood. He collapsed in front of me without any prior warning\u2026.\u201d I whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think about it anymore. If you keep imagining the scene before you, it will constantly repeat in your mind. You will experience the same intense emotions again and again. Are you grieving? Or is it pity? Sympathy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 my heart just feels very numb. It\u2019s hard to breathe.\u201d I pulled a tissue out and wiped the bloodstain off my face. I turned to Suyang and weakly said, \u201cI\u2019m tired. I\u2019m going to return to my room and lay down.\u201d</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t sure when my eyes had turned watery, but Suyang had became a very blurry image. I could still vaguely see him nodding though.</p><br/><p>I shoved my head into the pillow as I thought to myself, \u201cIf I\u2019m already suffering to this degree, I wonder how much the fake Xu Weishan was going through?\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t even have the strength to pull up the curtains. My eyelids grew heavier and heavier.</p><br/><p>*dong dong*. I was awaken by the sounds of knocking. Sure enough, Suyang wouldn\u2019t be Suyang if he would allow me have a good rest.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnter.\u201d I simply responded with one word. I didn\u2019t bother to turn my head as I waited for Suyang\u2019s explanation.</p><br/><p>But I only heard his light footsteps. It sounded like he had placed something on my bedside cabinet. Then, I heard him leave the room.</p><br/><p>By the time I turned around, Suyang was nowhere to be seen. On my cabinet was the book that Suyang wanted me to buy for him today. What was his intentions?</p><br/><p>I reached over and grabbed the book. I disassembled the packaging and opened the it. As I lay down, I turned to the first page. There was a preface:</p><br/><p><i>Emotion is what gives life meaning. There are two types of massacres: one is to satisfy the self-ego, while the latter is due to the desire for others\u2019 emotions. </i></p><br/><p><i>Deep down, thanks to emotions, all of us possess the seed of destruction. </i></p><br/><p><i>All of us have a measuring cup inside of us. No one knows its marked scale until the negativity has exceeded its load. </i></p><br/><p><i>Since every single human possess emotions, there isn\u2019t an absolute good or bad person. No one has the qualifications to judge a person based on their characteristics. Who created the labels? What\u2019s the boundary to a good and bad person?</i></p><hr/><br/><p>This chapter is quite sad! While waiting for more releases, why not read something else to keep your mind occupied? (wink) Please check out timebun\u2019s translations of . Timebun is a great friend I\u2019ve met through translating, and I\u2019m a huge fan of her work. Timebun was a great wingbun and promoted SG in her chapter 54, so I must return the favour! Her novel is about a female MC who transmigrated into a novel that she was reading. Interestingly enough, the male MC is a reincarnator and he hates the female MC because she cheated on him in his previous life. So now, we have two leads who \u201cknows\u201d what will happen in the story. Will they change anything? Read to find out!</p><br/><p>Note: The female MC only read half the novel before transmigrating, so she doesn\u2019t know the ending. \ud83d\ude09</p><br/>\n</div>"}

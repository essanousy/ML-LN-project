What!? Was she talking about Xu Chuqiao? But that\u2019s her stepson?! I thought Yao Youfan has no children of her own? Xu Chuqiao should be Xu Sen\u2019s only son\u2026 unless Xu Sen and Yao Youfan has another child of their own? Is that why Xu Sen gave Yao Youfan his entire estate? </i></p><br/><p>Suddenly, I was seeing another memory. <i>When was this?</i></p><br/><p>In front of me was Xu Sen\u2019s house. Everyday, Yao Youfan would pass by here after work and stare at it for a long period of time.</p><br/><p>Eventually, the house vanished from my view.</p><br/><p>At the time, Yao Youfan looked quite young. <i>But why was she staring at this house on a daily basis? Perhaps she had planned on marrying into this family long ago? </i></p><br/><p><i>Were they secretly dating at the time? Or were they still strangers? </i></p><br/><p>Based on her age, they should\u2019ve already encountered each other. But there weren\u2019t any signs of their relationship whatsoever. The only thing she did was stare at the house everyday on her way home from work.</p><br/><p>On one specific day, it was a weekend. Yao Youfan purposely wandered here on her day off. She clearly knew where her destination was.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, from far away, she heard a child crying. Yao Youfan followed the cries and noticed a boy on the ground. He was holding onto his knees and sobbing loudly.</p><br/><p>Yao Youfan rushed over to the child\u2019s side and asked, \u201cChild, are you alright?\u201d The child was only six or seven years of age. Since he was in too much pain, he wouldn\u2019t stop wailing. He couldn\u2019t hear Yao Youfan\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Yao Youfan harshly commanded. The child was astonished and instantly stopped crying. However, his tears were still sadly lingering on his eyelashes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a man, how can you cry!?\u201d Yao Youfan took a tissue out and wiped the tears and snots off the boy, \u201cThis auntie will take you to the hospital, ok?\u201d</p><br/><p>The child shook his head, \u201cMy mommy told me I cannot leave with strangers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen where\u2019s your mommy? This auntie will take you to her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMommy went out. I was the one who secretly sneaked out of my house.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Youfan sighed and rubbed the little boy\u2019s head. She patiently soothed, \u201cThen this auntie will take you home, ok? Do you live nearby?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d The child pointed to the most glamourous villa from where he was sitting. \u201cThat\u2019s where I live.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Youfan\u2019s heart thumped. My heart also thumped as well.<i> I wasn\u2019t sure why her heart was thumping but I was pretty sure the boy was Xu Chuqiao!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cCan you walk?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chuqiao shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis auntie will help you clean your wounds and then carry you home, ok?\u201d Yao Youfan gently lifted Xu Chuqiao into her arms. She looked like she would never let go.</p><br/><p>Xu Chuqiao felt a bit stuffed and was hesitant, but he nodded in the end.</p><br/><p><i>Xu Chuqiao probably had no idea that the auntie who helped him will eventually be his stepmother! </i></p><br/><p>Strangely, no disgust could be seen in Yao Youfan\u2019s eyes. <i>Weren\u2019t women usually jealous? He was her lover\u2019s son!? Could it be that she didn\u2019t love Xu Sen? </i></p><br/><p>I was confused by Yao Youfan\u2019s actions. But I was the one who forced myself into her consciousness, so I couldn\u2019t understand her thought process. I could only make guesses through following the memories.</p><br/><p>Yao Youfan carried Xu Chuqiao to the entrance of the villa.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis auntie has to go now. You can enter on your own, right?\u201d Yao Youfan placed Xu Chuqiao down.</p><br/><p>\u201cMommy says I need to thank those who have helped me.\u201d Then, Xu Chuqiao gave Yao Youfan a deep bow. He politely stated, \u201cAuntie, thank you for bringing me home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour mother taught you well\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Youfan noticed a security guard was heading their way and quickly left. She hid and watched from a corner.</p><br/><p>The moment the security guard realized their young master was injured, he immediately freaked out. He picked up Xu Chuqiao and exclaimed, \u201cMy ancestor! How could you run out and injure yourself?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI ran and tripped.\u201d Xu Chuqiao pouted, \u201cIf daddy notices, he is going to yell at me again\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! But right now, we need to take you to a doctor right away! Or else, you might get an infection! The security guard rushed to carry Xu Chuqiao back into the villa.</p><br/><p>Yao Youfan appeared to be reluctant to part with Xu Chuqiao. It was as if her eyes could see through the door. I didn\u2019t understand what was going on. At the time, Yao Youfan looked like she was still in her 20s.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, something that I never would\u2019ve expected occurred in front of my eyes. Yao Youfan, Xu Sen and Xu Sen\u2019s first wife were sitting together.</p><br/><p><i>What was going on? They all knew each other?! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, I\u2019m begging you! You\u2019re the only one I can trust!\u201d Na Wei appeared to be pleading with Yao Youfan. She had her hands on Yao Youfan\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do something like that to you. It\u2019s too cruel. You\u2019re making a mistake.\u201d Yao Youfan flatly refused. Next to her, Xu Sen\u2019s face was also very dark.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have no other paths we can take\u2026. Sen\u2019s parents have been pushing me non stop. They are demanding to know why I\u2019m still not pregnant yet. They\u2019ve already disliked me from the start. If they know I\u2019m infertile, they\u2019ll definitely kick me out of the Xu family!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Na Wei got onto her knees. \u201cJust once! Can you help me!? Please bear Sen\u2019s child for me\u2026 please!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I was in trouble, you helped me. You\u2019ve even saved my life once. I am willing to do anything for you. But if I sleep with your husband, that\u2019s a betrayal to you. I\u2019ll never do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! This is what I want! Please!! Give Sen a child!!!! I have no other solutions. I really have no other paths to take\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Sen was quiet. He loved his wife and didn\u2019t want to do anything that would betray her. But, his parents were also being very forceful. As a husband, it was his fault that he wasn\u2019t able to protect her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really can\u2019t promise you\u2026 this type of thing is forever. How could you bear to see your child when you know it was mines? I don\u2019t want you to regret it. Wei, you need to wake up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re so unwilling\u2026\u2026\u201d Na Wei wiped away her tears and sat on the couch with no emotions, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Yao Youfan could figure out the meaning of her words, she felt a wave of dizziness. She felt as if all her strength had been sucked out of her. She fell onto the couch.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you came, I drugged your water\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Yao Youfan couldn\u2019t believe her friend would do such a thing, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really have no choice\u2026just this once! If you get pregnant, it would be God\u2019s will. If not, it cannot be helped. Youfan, I\u2019ve helped you countless of times. Please forgive me.\u201d Then Na Wei stood up and gave Xu Sen an eye cue as she coolly left the room.</p><br/><p>When Na Wei left the room, Xu Sen slowly rise and picked up Yao Youfan. He took her to the second floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really going to do this? I know you love Wei\u2026. you can\u2019t betray her\u2026.\u201d Yao Youfan still had some consciousness left as she weakly stated.</p><br/><p>Xu Sen didn\u2019t say anything. He only carried Yao Youfan with a dark face. For his wife, he was willing to hurt another woman. At that moment, he was a sinner. He was hurting two women at the same time.</p><br/><p>Two months later, Yao Youfan\u2019s body reacted. When she arrived at the hospital, the doctor told her she was two months pregnant.</p><br/><p>The person who was the happiest to hear the news was Na Wei. She instantly gave Yao Youfan a house to give birth and lots of great conditions. She wanted to compensate for her conscience.</p><br/><p>Yao Youfan knew the moment the child was born, or perhaps earlier, she will lose Na Wei as a friend. Since she was already pregnant, she decided to go along with her wish. After giving birth to the child, she will depart forever.</p><br/><p>But plans have a tendency to change. It wasn\u2019t until Yao Youfan gave birth to the child that she realized how difficult it was to part with him. He had lived inside her body for ten months. She was his biological mother. The intense emotions she was experiencing wasn\u2019t something she could just separate from.</p><br/><p>When Xu Chuqiao was born, his tiny little fingers tightly wrapped around Yao Youfan\u2019s thumb. He had no basic knowledge but he knew he had to use all his strength to hold onto his mommy.</p><br/><p>Yao Youfan thought it was magical. On the second day after Xu Chuqiao was born, she personally delivered him to Na Wei\u2019s arms. Yao Youfan knew the longer she held on, the harder it would be for her to let go.</p><br/><p>Her son became Na Wei and Xu Wen\u2019s son and he was loved by everyone in the Xu family. Yao Youfan knew that her son would live a much better life with Na Wei, yet she couldn\u2019t help but stare at the glamourous villa her son lived in.</p><br/><p>The saddest thing was that she had no idea what her son looked like. She would gaze at the villa only because she knew he was inside. She was satisfied as long as she could admire the building from afar.</p><br/><p>In the end, after Na Wei\u2019s death, Yao Youfan thought of marrying Xu Sen in order to resume her mother position.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

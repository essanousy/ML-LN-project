Suddenly, Suyang sighed and released me.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it turns out you\u2019re not as heartless as I thought you were. After three years, I\u2019m still the person you love, right? You can be honest. Regardless of what you say, I\u2019ll believe you.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>How the heck does he expect me to answer this question right now? The word love hasn\u2019t came out of my mouth in so long. </i></p><br/><p>Suyang fished out a photo. It was the picture I took of him when we were at the beach. It was his back view. I wanted to snatch it, but he moved it away from my grasp. Suyang stood next to the last lit candle. \u201cI thought you burnt all the photos. Surprisingly, you kept one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was an accident. But I like the feeling this photo gives off. It would be a pity to burn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The whole time, I had kept Suyang\u2019s photo in my wallet. Although he wasn\u2019t physically by my side, it was comforting to know that a part of him was always with me.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you would rather keep a still photograph than to get back with me?\u201d Suyang lifted the photo and slowly brought it closer to the candle, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point. Let me help you end it now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang was about to burn the photograph. I screamed and ran forward to rescue the picture, \u201cNooooo!\u201d</p><br/><p>The last candle was extinguished by me. My nose tingled. I wasn\u2019t sure if I was crying due to the burning sensation on my hand or for other complicated reasons, but tears began to fill my eyes.</p><br/><p>The darkness became very blurry.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d Suyang rushed to hold onto my hand. He was carefully rubbing it with his palm. \u201cAren\u2019t you going too far for a photo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you\u2026.\u201d I took a deep breath, \u201cWithout it, I won\u2019t feel at ease. How about we just pretend we\u2019re strangers at work. I won\u2019t meddle in your affairs and you won\u2019t meddle with mines. From now on\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before I could finish talking, Suyang pulled my hand upwards and made me touch his eyebrow.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my eyebrow. This is my eye. This is my nose. This is my mouth.\u201d In the darkness, Suyang continued to lead me downwards. As my fingers touched his smooth skin, my fingertips were overcoming a challenge I never had to deal with before.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is me. I am Suyang; a real person. I am still in love with you.\u201d He whispered.</p><br/><p>Suyang\u2019s soft and sincere confession smashed apart my defensive line. I wasn\u2019t sure where I got the courage from, but I held onto him like no tomorrow. My heart was aching and I didn\u2019t care anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too! During the past three years, I never once stopped loving you. I tried lying to myself, but it was useless. You\u2019re so stupid. Do you know how difficult it was for me to finally decide to let you go? Yet, you deliberately keeps provoking me\u2026I\u2019m trouble, you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what trouble you are. I can decide for myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stood on tiptoes to kiss him. Just as my lips were about to meet with the pair of lips I had longed for day and night, Suyang suddenly moved back. He raised his brows, \u201cSo are you getting back with me now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026.\u201d I was pouting because our lips almost touched. Now, we were standing in an awkward position.</p><br/><p><i>I wasn\u2019t sure. Initially, I had no plans to get back together. This outcome was not what I had expected. Suyang was probably not used to my behaviour either. I was hot and cold. Even I was confusing myself because I didn\u2019t know why I was acting like this.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cLet me go first.\u201d Suyang was fidgeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Don\u2019t you still love me?\u201d I gave him an innocent face.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust let go first\u2026..\u201d Suyang lightly tried to push me off.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting go!\u201d I roared, \u201cI\u2019m only letting go if you trust me! Also, I\u2019m really mad at the fact you changed my room because you mean too much to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk, okay!\u201d Suyang gently patted my hand, \u201cYou can continue being lovey dovey later. I\u2019m going to the study to give you something. How am I going to walk if you keep hugging me like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Since Suyang said he was getting something for me, I immediately let go and stood around stiffly. I thought he just didn\u2019t want me to stick on him\u2026</p><br/><p>In my mind, I had a drama all planned out. I thought he was trying to get revenge so he wanted to get back with me. Then after I had my guard down, he would leave me\u2026</p><br/><p>Soon, Suyang came out from the study and turned on the living room lights. He had a letter in his hand, \u201cThis is the letter granny wrote for you before she died. She said to give it to you when I see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother Meng wrote a letter for me?\u201d I took the letter from his hand and opened the envelope.</p><br/><p><i>To Yixin,</i></p><br/><p><i>I just knew that one day you and Xiao Su would reunite again. I want to thank you for keeping your promise and not seeing my grandson while I was alive. Although Xiao Su and I appeared to be living the same lives as before, I could tell Xiao Su is very unhappy without you. Every time I see him hiding in his study, I always reflect. What have I taken away from him? Now, I regret the words I said to you that led to your departure. </i></p><br/><p><i>I know I have used up my lifespan. I won\u2019t be wandering the Earth like those lonely ghosts. I will reincarnate right away, so you probably won\u2019t have an opportunity to see me again. Aside from Suyang, there is nothing else that makes me reluctant to leave. The moment I know that I won\u2019t see him again, my heart hurts. By the way, I contacted my Master and he said that you\u2019ve already graduated and left. So now, I assume you\u2019re quite good at controlling your spiritual abilities? </i></p><br/><p><i>After you see Suyang, please do not feel apprehended by what I have previously said. Just live the lives that you want. A selfish part of me doesn\u2019t want my Xiao Su to be alone in this world. Although this request may be inappropriate, I hope you can be his friend if you no longer love him. If you still love him, then stay with him for life. </i></p><br/><p><i>Grandmother Meng</i></p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother Meng\u2026.\u201d I read the entire letter in my mind and then carefully folded and placed it in my bag.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did granny say?\u201d Suyang stretched his neck. He wanted to see the letter.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe letter was written for me; don\u2019t you even think about it! Since Grandmother Meng already made it clear, I guess I have no choice but to take on this difficult task!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere should I put my luggage? We can\u2019t just keep it in the living room!\u201d <i>I\u2019ve already made it so clear. If Suyang still doesn\u2019t understand, he\u2019s an idiot. </i></p><br/><p>As expected, Suyang understood instantly. He quickly pushed my luggage into his room. Then, he ran out and spun me into the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cPut me down!\u201d I was a bit scared. My hands were tightly wrapped around Suyang\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one holding onto me. How can you accuse me of not letting you go!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve released my hands but you still haven\u2019t released me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has been three years. I have to hug all my years\u2019 worth!\u201d Then, Suyang spun a few more circles. He took the opportunity to bring me into his room and dropped me onto the bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I could sense the tense atmosphere as I gazed at Suyang, \u201cDo you have dirty thoughts again? Let me warn you. Today, I\u2019m not drunk. In fact, I\u2019m very sober.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang immediately kissed my lips to stop me from talking. We continued to kiss until I was about to suffocate from a lack of oxygen. Then, I shoved him away.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you stopping?\u201d Suyang opened his eyes and changed positions. He laid on his side and supported his head with one arm. He seemed dissatisfied.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot today!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not? It was great yesterday\u2026.!\u201d Suyang whined.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo bad!\u201d I sat up and fixed my messy hair. \u201cWhere am I sleeping tonight? I need to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang pressed me down with one arm. He stuck to me like a baby, \u201cOf course you\u2019re sleeping with me! We\u2019re back to being in a sweet relationship!!\u201d He smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m not going to sleep next to you! Who knows what you\u2019re going to do?\u201d I was half serious half joking.</p><br/><p>Suyang put his chin on my shoulder and blinked his huge eyes, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. If you say no touching, I won\u2019t touch\u2026 unless you think you can\u2019t hold back.\u201d He had a sly grin on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d My face was starting to burn up. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be able to hold back?! You\u2019re nuts\u2026.\u201d I smacked him, \u201cI\u2019m going to shower now. Don\u2019t lust after my beauty and peek!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang snorted and flung his non-existent hair, \u201cYou dare to talk about beauty in front of me? Anyone with eyes could tell who the beauty is!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes yes yes\u2026. !\u201d I nodded and went to the bathroom. After taking a shower, I realized I had forgotten to bring my pyjamas. I couldn\u2019t find a long bathrobe either.</p><br/><p><i>I can\u2019t just use two towels and come out like this, right? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang\u2026are you asleep?\u201d I tested. If he was asleep, I\u2019ll just run out naked to get my pyjamas.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026.why are you calling me?\u201d Suyang\u2019s voice came from the living room, \u201cDo you need my help?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>How does he know\u2026..? Whatever.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026 could you go through my luggage and grab my pyjamas? Then, give it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang didn\u2019t respond. The air remained silent for a long time. Suddenly, I heard items falling down.</p><br/><p>I had a very bad feeling about this. \u201cSuyang, you better not dump all my stuff on the ground! Be gentle! Gentle!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>I could see Suyang\u2019s fuzzy figure outside the frosted glass door. I was so shocked that I began to back away. Suyang was trying to break open the door. His speed of his voice was 4x faster than his usual pace, \u201cOpen up! Don\u2019t you want me to deliver the pyjamas? Open!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I open the door for you when I\u2019m in this state?\u201d I kicked the bathroom door, \u201cJust leave the pyjamas outside and you can leave.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I remained fixated at my spot.</p><br/><p><i>It wasn\u2019t a scary looking grieving ghost from 12 years ago, right? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cMerciful Buddha! Merciful Buddha!\u201d I began to pray internally.</p><br/><p>*Squeak* Once again I heard the sound that made my scalp turn numb.</p><br/><p><i>I\u2019m going to go insane!</i></p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t dare to make a single move.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne step\u2026two step\u2026\u201d I concentrated all my senses to my ears and cautiously listened as the steps grew louder. <i>Wait a second. This was the first time I\u2019ve heard the footsteps of a ghost!?</i></p><br/><p>I breathed a sigh of relief. I had a rough idea what was going on.</p><br/><p>After I calculated the \u201cghost\u201d\u2018s movements, I suddenly turned around and screamed, \u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>I scared the \u201cghost\u201d so much that he fell down on his bottom.</p><br/><p>\u201cPretending to scare me as a ghost, eh?!\u201d I pressed my hand against Shen Shaoqian\u2019s head to punish him. In addition, Suyang secretly came out of his hiding spot. I proudly stated, \u201cI saw through your crafty schemes. Can we leave now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come it didn\u2019t work?\u201d Shen Shaoqian scratched his head; looking confused. \u201cWhere did I gave myself away?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour mistake? Your footsteps were too loud. Ghosts don\u2019t have footsteps!\u201d <i>If ghosts had footsteps, I wouldn\u2019t have been accidentally spooked so many times in my life. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know? You\u2019ve seen ghosts before? How do you know that ghosts do not have footsteps?\u201d Suyang leaned against the wall as he asked.</p><br/><p><i>He was still trying to test me?</i> I didn\u2019t want to answer him, so I turned around to help Shen Shaoqian stand up. I wanted to leave this place now. But the moment I crouched down, I sensed something terrible.</p><br/><p>I immediately lifted my head and stared at the very end of the corridor. There was a blurry figure swaying towards us\u2026.. It was really dark, so I couldn\u2019t see the figure clearly. But I could tell it was getting closer and closer towards us.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys didn\u2019t set up anything else to scare me right\u2026.?\u201d I swallowed down my saliva as I held up Shen Shaoqian and turned back to look at Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, why do you ask?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cR-really?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the figure had passed by a brighter area. I could see him now. It was a man. To be more precise, it was a \u201cman\u201d walking towards us with his head crooked to the side.</p><br/><p><i>If he wasn\u2019t part of Suyang and Shen Shaoqian\u2019s plan, then\u2026.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cHurry! Run!\u201d I screamed on top of my lungs. I grabbed Suyang by one hand and dragged Shen Shaoqian with the other. Then, I ran for entrance on the first floor.</p><br/><p>The aura of this ghost was very dangerous. Even a rookie like me could tell.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-what happened?\u201d Shen Shaoqian was confused. He turned around but obviously couldn\u2019t see anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk! Just run! There really is a ghost in this hospital!!!!!!\u201d I shouted.</p><br/><p>The faster we ran, the faster the ghost chased after us.</p><br/><p>As the saying goes, \u201cTwo legs cannot compare to four.\u201d <i>But how could we compare to no legs?!! </i></p><br/><p>The man\u2019s face was visible to me now. He had burnt scars on his face.</p><br/><p>Just as he was about to overtake us, I used the last bit of my arm strength and pulled us out of this hospital.</p><br/><p>I finally felt secure when the sunlight spilled over us. I looked up at the blue sky and sighed. <i>I was still alive. How amazing\u2026</i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck is going on?\u201d Shen Shaoqian was panting like a dog, \u201cHow did you suddenly become so strong?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026. I was frightened. I wanted to go home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! So you and Suyang are on equal levels! Both of you are chickens!\u201d Shen Shaoqian ruthlessly laughed. I was in a bad mood. Most likely, it was because of Shen Shaoqian\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d Shen Shaoqian stared at his empty hands. Then, he smacked his head, \u201cI left the camera inside\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Shen Shaoqian was about to turn around.</p><br/><p>I used my entire body to block him, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to get the camera\u2026.. The camera isn\u2019t mines. It\u2019s Suyang\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang was flabbergasted, \u201cIt\u2019s my camera?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, you lent it to me last time. I never returned it. I was planning to give it back today\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang looked down and his face darkened. Shen Shaoqian were standing on one side and we could hear him grinding his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! You can\u2019t go back!\u201d I glanced at the direction of the hospital. There was a black shadow that was facing us.</p><br/><p><i>He wouldn\u2019t actually come out, right?</i></p><br/><p><i>Seriously?! </i></p><br/><p><i>F**k!</i></p><br/><p><i>The ghost actually came out!!!</i></p><br/><p>Suyang and Shen Shaoqian couldn\u2019t see him. But underneath the sunlight, the burnt face looked even more vicious. He opened his ruptured mouth as he stared at me with his empty eye sockets and floated towards us.</p><br/><p>\u201cS-stay away!\u201d I couldn\u2019t hide my fear anymore. I furrowed my brows and backed away. It was as if the ghost knew I was the only one who could see him. He was only after me and totally neglected Suyang and Shen Shaoqian.</p><br/><p><i>He was about to slam into me!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cAh!!! No!!\u201d At the very last second, I shut my eyes and covered my face with my two hands. I remained at the same spot, but the very next second, I was wrapped in a warm embrace.</p><br/><p>At first, I thought it was the ghost. But just as I was wondering how could a ghost\u2019s hug be so warm, I secretly took a peek and realized it was Suyang hugging me instead.</p><br/><p>A blast of coldness went through us.</p><br/><p>Suyang\u2019s hand was gently patting my head. He had no expression on his face, but his eyes revealed his satisfaction. He opened his red and luscious lips. \u201cYou finally admit to it?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Damn, I was caught</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>My head rested against Suyang\u2019s chest. On the side, I could see the ghost.</p><br/><p>He did come over but directly went through us\u2026. Now he was spinning around like a housefly.</p><br/><p><i>Oh yeah, he was merely a ghost</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck!?!\u201d Shen Shaoqian gave us his lonely single killer eyes as he coldly humphed and returned back inside the hospital to retrieve his camera.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that thing still here?\u201d Suyang asked.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t hide it anymore, so I nodded, \u201cYes\u2026 it\u2019s spinning around us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I said this, Suyang\u2019s body stiffened.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you hugging me?\u201d I snuggled up against him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI could see how scared you were. But now\u2026 I-I\u2019m the one who\u2019s scared. Let\u2019s leave when the thing is gone!\u201d Suyang stuttered and finally told the truth. He stared around his surroundings with caution; as if he could see what was going on.</p><br/><p>If he had my abilities, he would be able to see that the ghost was currently standing behind me; making face-to-face eye contact with him.</p><br/><p>I hid my disgust and stood up from Suyang\u2019s arms and coughed twice.</p><br/><p>I lied to him and said, \u201cUmm\u2026 we can go now. The ghost is gone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Suyang immediately grabbed my hand and ran towards the car.</p><br/><p>While we were on the road, we vaguely heard Shen Shaoqian\u2019s voice yelling behind us.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! I found the camera! What the heck! You guys called me here but left without me?!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

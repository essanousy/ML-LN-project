No, wait. Door press?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you now\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you believe in fate?\u201d Suyang\u2019s left arm had completely blocked my path. Most importantly, his shirt was still unbuttoned. <i>Seriously\u2026 </i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you suddenly asking me this?\u201d I asked as I shut my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter our meetup today, I feel like Mi Fan is the type of woman who matches what I am looking for in a spouse. Based on an esthetic point of view, we are similar. Our systems of values are basically identical too. When we chat, it\u2019s very satisfying. I don\u2019t feel the slightest annoyance I usually do when talking to the common people.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>So is he purposely trying to force me to listen to his praise on Mi Fan? Are you kidding me?</i></p><br/><p>I secretly made up my mind: <i>Since you think Mi Fan is so amazing, I will dig through her dirty laundry and reveal it at all cost! </i></p><br/><p>I coldly laughed as I opened my eyes and made direct eye contact with Suyang, \u201cIs that why you came home so late? So what happened? You went to find Mi Fan? Your perfect spouse?\u2026 Was she terrified from what happened today? Were you able to comfort her? You two\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before I could finish, Suyang covered my mouth as he sighed, \u201cGoldfish\u2026 let me finish first.\u201d</p><br/><p>I pushed Suyang\u2019s hand aside, \u201cBoss, what are you trying to say? If you think after you two get together and she doesn\u2019t like the idea of you having a female assistant\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, I paused to readjust my emotional state. I had to say it. If not, Suyang will think I\u2019m the type that had no shame.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you think it\u2019s inconvenient, I will leave. But first, you have to wait until I find a place. I can\u2019t just leave whenever I want. I don\u2019t have the apartment from before anymore. So you have to give me some time\u2026.but I want to tell you that I\u2019m not a sweet syrup candy that refuses to budge. You\u2019re the boss and I\u2019m the assistant. Whatever you say, I will most definitely comply with.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying though?\u201d Suyang shook his head as he pressed his forehead against mines. I was so astonished that I shrank back.</p><br/><p>I secretly observed Suyang. His eyes were closed and his alluring eyelashes were trembling a little. He slowly opened his mouth, \u201cI already told you to let me finish. But from the start, you keep talking to yourself. When are you going to listen to me? And you say you would comply to my wishes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know how to refute his argument. <i>But what was with him today? </i></p><br/><p><i>One moment, he was praising Mi Fan. The next moment, he was making moves on me. Whenever he made these questionable moves, I would find it so difficult to breathe. Was he doing it on purpose or not?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cFirstly, ever since I came back from the coffee shop, I had been home the entire time. I didn\u2019t go searching for Mi Fan.\u201d Suyang didn\u2019t seem like he was lying.</p><br/><p><i>But why was he telling me this?</i></p><br/><p>Suddenly, I realized that I knew very little about Suyang. He had always been a very egocentric type of person. He never considered other people\u2019s feelings when making decisions.</p><br/><p>In the past, I was often surprised by his intimate gestures. Once in awhile, I would wonder, \u201cDoes he like me?\u201d But after thinking deeply, he was probably like this with every female. I\u2019m only one of the bunch. I was just overthinking.</p><br/><p>So now, I used all my strength to shove Suyang away from me.</p><br/><p><i>I don\u2019t want to be a fool anymore. If I keep assuming he likes me, I\u2019ll just look more and more like an idiot. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cYou have very few experiences with female, right? As your assistant and as a woman, I want to kindly remind you, boss, that you shouldn\u2019t make questionable moves on others. After all, men and women should keep a distance from each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you misunderstanding?\u201d Suyang had no expression on his face. The fact that I couldn\u2019t read his mind at all was quite frightening.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is\u2026 I\u2019m still a woman. It\u2019s not good if you\u2019re going to keep getting close and embracing me. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only woman who thinks this way. Other women probably feel the same as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no other woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think of Mi Fan?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Mi Fan? Mi Fan again?! Why is he still bringing her up at this moment? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cCan you stop bringing Mi Fan up in front of me? From a woman\u2019s perspective, she\u2019s not that likeable. If you honestly want someone to discuss and listen to your praises on Mi Fan, then go find Shen Shaoqian. You guys can have your bonding time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, I want to hear your opinion.\u201d Suyang heatedly stared at me. It was as if he had to dig something out of me today.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. You want to know my thoughts on Mi Fan?\u201d I went over to my bed and dragged my laptop over. I showed the news articles that I had just been reading, \u201cThis is what I think of her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is the rapist case from last year. Why are you reading about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I haven\u2019t known Shen Shaonu for a long time, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a child who cannot decipher between what is right or wrong. Mi Fan must have done something terrible in order for her to be so hostile towards her. In addition, the boy that had attempted to pour sulfuric acid on Mi Fan is the suspect Lu Wenxue\u2019s son, Lu Zhengyang. Don\u2019t you think there is something fishy about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Zhengyang is only a child. He thinks Mi Fan is the reason why his dad was imprisoned. So naturally, he must despise her. He\u2019s still young, so he might not totally understand what is right or wrong. Plus, he lost his father during the teenage rebellious period. So it\u2019s quite likely\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>I honestly didn\u2019t understand why Suyang was saying these things. It seemed like he was trying to use specious arguments. Suddenly, I felt like I didn\u2019t know him anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will find out the answer! I am going to personally figure it out. Unlike you, who just stands and believes what everyone thinks is the truth. When the truth comes out, we\u2019ll see who\u2019s right or wrong. You will know who Mi Fan truly is!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou cannot investigate Mi Fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not? I\u2019m going to do it regardless of what you say. If you think I\u2019m assaulting her, what are you going to do? Stop me?\u201d I screeched.</p><br/><p>Today, I was determined to fight Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is not someone you can mess with. She has someone supporting her from the background. It\u2019s a person you can\u2019t even imagine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe has a supporter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang smiled at me as he patted my head. He softly whispered, \u201cYou think Shen Shaoqian will let his 50k go just like that? Shaonu stole 50k from Shen Shaoqian because of Lu Zhengyang.\u201d</p><br/><p>I already knew about this from the Shen siblings\u2019 fight this morning.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t meet up with Mi Fan for a blind date. It was Shen Shaoqian\u2019s request. He wanted me to find out what happened between Lu Zhengyang and Mi Fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>I could barely suppress the joy in my heart. I didn\u2019t expect such a sudden turn of event.</p><br/><p>I forcefully pressed my lips together to stop myself from smiling as I shrugged my shoulders and mumbled, \u201cWell, you\u2019re the boss. Why do you have to explain yourself? It\u2019s not like I care\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d Suyang smiled as he gazed steadily at me. \u201cInitially, I wasn\u2019t going to tell you. But I didn\u2019t expect you to be so mad. So, I\u2019m being honest right now.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Wow\u2026how awkward!! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m not mad! Haha?! You must be seeing things?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang continued to smile, \u201cOriginally, I wanted to test you. I didn\u2019t think you would care so much! But at the end, I\u2019m the only one being honest\u2026 so weird\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

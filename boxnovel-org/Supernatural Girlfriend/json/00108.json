It was so unexpected that I flinched.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Suyang sensed my abnormal movement.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d I was hesitant to share. Although Suyang was aware that I could see ghosts, Shen Shaoqian had no idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat?\u201d Suyang vaguely asked.</p><br/><p>I nodded and used my eyes to indicate that Wen Yufan was next to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you two talking about? What that?\u201d Shen Shaoqian fixed his posture and sat upright. He was probably uncomfortable with our strange conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing, we\u2019re not talking to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah! My friend also found out something shocking. Apparently, Gao Jialan and Wen Yihan were high school classmates!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Suyang and I both exclaimed at the same time. <i>Based on how they were acting that day, they totally did not seem like ex-classmates! Plus, Wen Yihan wanted to\u2026</i></p><br/><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t assume Wen Yihan will let her go so easily. Based on what their ex-classmates said, they didn\u2019t interact. They were pretty much strangers.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Were they really strangers?</i> I turned to gaze at Wen Yufan. He didn\u2019t seem surprised by the news at all.</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan must be hiding something from us.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Shen Shaoqian, there\u2019s a box of mooncakes in your car. Can we eat it?\u201d I happened to feel hungry.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Today, my parents wanted me to go deliver some mooncakes to our relatives. We ended up exchanging mooncakes and I even have an extra box. Go ahead!\u201d</p><br/><p>So, before our arrival, I ate two pieces of mooncakes (they are usually sliced into 8 pieces). Suyang also had a piece. Since Shen Shaoqian was driving, Suyang fed him a piece.</p><br/><p><i>Sometimes, I feel like Suyang and Shen Shaoqian would make a great couple. They seemed to be a much better match compared to me and Suyang. Was my fujoshi side kicking in? </i></p><br/><p>After Shen Shaoqian parked the car in a relatively hidden area, we walked out.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come I can\u2019t see the villa?\u201d I asked in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis piece of land is owned by Wen Yihan. He fenced up everything. Now, it\u2019s like a sealed off prison.\u201d Shen Shaoqian explained.</p><br/><p>After we passed by the underbrush, we came to the fenced area. Suyang and Shen Shaoqian easily leaped over the railing. But for my height, it was a bit too high\u2026</p><br/><p>I was able to climb up, but I hesitated at the thought of jumping down.</p><br/><p><em>But if I didn\u2019t jump, I would become Suyang\u2019s burden</em>\u2026 so I felt very anxious. My mind was telling me yes but my heart was saying no. My feet wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Jump down and I\u2019ll be here to catch you.\u201d Suyang reached both his hands in the air to comfort me.</p><br/><p><i>Aiya! There was no time to waste! </i>I shut my eyes and jumped. Fortunately, I fell into Suyang\u2019s open arms.</p><br/><p>Suyang smiled lovingly, \u201cI told you I would catch you!\u201d</p><br/><p>While I was feeling touched, Shen Shaoqian released his single dog resentment again, \u201cWhat the hell!? Why do I always feel like such a lightbulb around you two now? UGHHHhh.. Stop showing so much public affection in front of me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Shen Shaoqian\u2019s complaint, Suyang put me down. We didn\u2019t dare to \u201cshow off\u201d our love anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place is huge! How would we know where Gao Jialan is hidden?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are three of us. We can split up to search. Are you guys prepared to split up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang and I shook our heads. <i>We didn\u2019t mention about splitting up earlier</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you\u2019re unprepared, we still have to do it! If one of us gets caught by security, do not tell them anything even if they beat you up. Try to find an opportunity to text for help. The secret code is, potato! Whoever that is left will go save Gao Jialan and then call the cops to save the person caught. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d I nodded. <i>Why does Shen Shaoqian\u2019s plan seem so unreliable?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then. The mission starts now!\u201d Shen Shaoqian immediately dropped down in the bush and laid flat on his stomach.</p><br/><p>Suyang and I were shocked. We thought a security guard had caught us as we quietly crouched down to ask Shen Shaoqian, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you guys crouching? I just wanted to enter by crawling through the bush\u2026. It seems cooler\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Shen Shaoqian could finish, Suyang fixed his outerwear and stepped on Shen Shaoqian. He coldly stated, \u201cI\u2019m heading that direction.\u201d And then he left without turning around.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll go that way.\u201d I pointed to the opposite direction of Suyang. I also stepped on Shen Shaoqian before departing.</p><br/><p>Shen Shaoqian muttered in resentment, \u201cYou two\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>We decided to follow the plan so the three of us went on our separate ways. I was responsible for a nearby warehouse. There weren\u2019t anyone guarding the area, so it was easy to approach.</p><br/><p>I searched the whole area and didn\u2019t find anything suspicious. Just as I was about to alert Suyang and Shen Shaoqian through text, Shen Shaoqian sent a text that said: potato.</p><br/><p><i>What? It has only been a few minutes and he was already caught? </i></p><br/><p>I stared at Shen Shaoqian\u2019s text and felt very scared. I noticed there was a person coming towards me, so I quickly hid in the bush.</p><br/><p>After observing more closely, I realized it was Wen Yufan. He was standing and waving in front of me.</p><br/><p><i>Was he here to tell me where Gao Jialan was located? Oh yeah! He\u2019s a ghost! It must be super easy for him to find out. I should\u2019ve followed Wen Yufan from the beginning. Oops, my mistake..</i></p><br/><p>Wen Yufan managed to help me avoid the security guards. He brought me in front of a black door.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs she here?\u201d I whispered.</p><br/><p>Wen Yufan directed me the passcode for entry. I copied his fingers and the door opened.</p><br/><p>I had no idea what will happen when I enter, so I was quite nervous.</p><br/><p>I walked in on tiptoes. Then, I immediately slid down on the icy cold floors because I was afraid some type of surveillance camera would discover me. I imitated Shen Shaoqian\u2019s movements and slid across the shiny floors .</p><br/><p>It took a lot of work before I was able to get to the flight of steps that would lead me to the second floor. I looked up and could see a door that was semi-opened. There was some faint lighting coming out from it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it here?\u201d I pointed towards the lighted area as I quietly asked Wen Yufan.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t respond. Instead, he disappeared in the darkness.</p><br/><p><i>What? He left me by myself? </i>I looked around and could no longer see Wen Yufan\u2019s ghost. The silence and darkness was causing me to feel more anxious. The strangest thing of all was that there didn\u2019t seem to be anyone else in here\u2026</p><br/><p>I straightened my body and bravely stood up. I took off my shoes and began to crept up the stairs. I tried my best to minimize any sound.</p><br/><p>I was getting closer and closer towards my destination. Just before heading in, I leaned against the wall and secretly tried to peek inside.</p><br/><p>It seemed to be a study room. But I didn\u2019t see Gao Jialan\u2019s figure..</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, this environment was quite nice. Wen Yihan was probably not mistreating her. <i>I guess it may be because they were classmates? </i></p><br/><p>I lowered my guard and bent down to lightly push open the door with my finger. Again, I tried not to make any noise. Then, I courageously entered the room as I whispered, \u201cGao Jialan\u2026.are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you looking for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>A familiar masculine voice rang from behind me. I was so shocked that my hand slid off the doorknob and I nearly fell down face first. I knew I was in trouble. There was no time to freak out. I harshly whipped my head around and saw Wen Yihan standing behind me with a cup of milk in his hand.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

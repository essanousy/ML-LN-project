Based on Xiao Xin\u2019s condition, the operation had to be done two months ago. By delaying until now, his cancer cells have already spread to his organs. At this stage, we are honestly powerless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Xin was pushed away. During the process, a nurse accidentally knocked the fake Xu Weishan aside and she fell down like a fallen leave. I ran over to hold onto her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Despite knowing she wasn\u2019t, I still asked.</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if she heard me. Currently, the fake Xu Weishan was like a robot. She stared fixedly at the ground without blinking. It was as if she wanted to burn a hole through the floor.</p><br/><p>After a long time, she harshly shoved me away as she held onto the wall for support. Then, she swayed out of my sight with her black high heels.</p><br/><p>Her rear view was so lonely. All of a sudden, she appeared very insignificant. Could someone so evil have a soft side as well?</p><br/><p>Under the current circumstances, I actually pitied the fake Xu Weishan.</p><br/><p>Even if she was a murderer, at this moment, she was Xiao Xin\u2019s sister Bei.</p><br/><p>In order to prevent her from hurting herself, I decided to silently follow her. Sure enough, the fake Xu Weishan stared straight ahead and walked into the midst of the traffic. She disregarded all the cars that were passing by horizontally on both sides.</p><br/><p>Some drivers swooshed by her, while some were so afraid that they desperately pressed on their emergency brakes. All of a sudden, the intersection near the hospital became congested.</p><br/><p>A driver rolled down his car window and shrieked, \u201cYou want to die? Then die further away! Don\u2019t bring me bad luck!\u201d</p><br/><p>The fake Xu Weishan didn\u2019t seem to care as she continued to proceed forward.</p><br/><p>At this rate, either she\u2019ll die in a car accident or she\u2019ll get beaten up to death by furious drivers.</p><br/><p>I apologized to the drivers left and right as I ran towards the fake Xu Weishan who appeared to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I grabbed and pulled her onto the sidewalk.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to die?\u201d I completely lashed out at her, \u201cIf you were struck by a car and died on the streets, who will take care of Xiao Xin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Xin\u2026..Xiao Xin is going to die soon. If I\u2019m dead, I can accompany him.\u201d Xu Weishan whispered soullessly as she shoved me aside and wanted to dash back into the middle of the streets like a crazy person.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you please wake up?!\u201d I hollered.</p><br/><p>I had to wrap my arms around the fake Xu Weishan\u2019s waist in order to stop her. Deep down, I lamented. Why was she so strong? It took tremendous amounts of strength and effort before I was able to drag her to a safe place; somewhere a bit far from cars and people.</p><br/><p>I was honestly at my wits\u2019 end. I didn\u2019t know what else to do at this moment except to firmly slap her across the face.</p><br/><p>After getting slapped, the fake Xu Weishan seemed to regain some of her spirit as she bitterly glared at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Xin isn\u2019t dead yet. There isn\u2019t just one hospital. Why are you foolishly giving up already? Do you know what Xiao Xin said to me just before he lost consciousness? He said, he really misses sister Bei. He told me I had the same shoes as sister Bei. So he wanted me to find sister Bei and tell her that he really wanted to see her. If he wakes up and finds out you\u2019ve disappeared, how disappointed would he be? How sad would he be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Silu\u2026.you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Weishan seemed to recall something and didn\u2019t continue her sentence. Instead, she covered her face and crouched onto the ground as she burst into tears of anguish.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you still want to seek death, that\u2019s your choice. I\u2019m not going to stop you anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stayed by the fake Xu Weishan\u2019s side for a very long time. I witnessed her entire process from start to finish. She went from bawling vehemently to whimpering softly after she had exhausted all her strength. Fortunately, it appeared her sanity had returned.</p><br/><p>It seemed like she had made up her mind. The fake Xu Weishan ignored me and went back to Xiao Xin\u2019s ward. I silently stood behind her as I watched the fake Xu Weishan gently hold onto Xiao Xin\u2019s deathly pale hand.</p><br/><p>It was like watching a scene from the movies -a sister and brother reunites after standing at the blink of life and death. It was touching and depressing at the same time.</p><br/><p>It was difficult for me to imagine Xiao Xin\u2019s sister Bei as a killer.</p><br/><p>Yet, the real Xu Weishan who stood next to me was a constant reminder that she was.</p><br/><p>I have done enough tailing for today. It was too sad, and I was exhausted.</p><br/><p>At this moment, I received a text message from Suyang, \u201cBuy a book for me. It\u2019s called <i>A suspect\u2019s hoot</i>.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, I\u2019m sick. My head hurts. I just went to the hospital to get medication. The doctor told me to rest and not move so much\u2026..\u201d I texted back.</p><br/><p><i>Oh no! Suyang caught me skipping work!</i> But I was so tired, I didn\u2019t want to run around. Hence, I created a lie. <i>I wasn\u2019t completely lying though, because I was really at the hospital! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re not sick. The fact that I\u2019m not investigating on your whereabouts is already merciful of me. If you do not return within thirty minutes, I\u2019m going to deduct from your salary.\u201d Suyang sent me another text message.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, money was too powerful. \u201cDon\u2019t! I\u2019m returning right now! Please wait a short moment, boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>I speedily returned his text and rushed to a bookstore.</p><br/><p>I saw \u201cA suspect\u2019s hoot\u201d the moment I walked in. I guess it was a best seller. But when I gazed at the cover, it seemed to be related to a massacre. It must be about a psycho. It was definitely not something I would want to indulge in.</p><br/><p>On the cover, a man was holding a dagger with his right hand. On his left hand, he was smiling savagely as he held onto a strange looking mask near his chest. But the strangest thing of all was that he had tears on his face.</p><br/><p>What the hell? He had tears coming out yet the corner of his mouth was curled evilly upwards? The atmosphere was self-explanatory.</p><br/><p><i>Why does he want to read something like this? He definitely has strong taste\u2026</i></p><br/><p>I clicked my tongue twice and bought a copy of the book home.</p><br/><p>By the time I had returned, I was mentally and physically drained. The moment I entered the apartment, I saw Suyang lying on the couch playing a game and drinking an iced watermelon beverage simultaneously.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, I felt like Suyang was a second rich generation who had nothing better to do. But on the account of meeting Grandmother Meng, he didn\u2019t seem to match that image either.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, here is your book!\u201d I placed the book in front of him as I dragged my feet. I was planning to return to my room and sleep because I had gone through too much today. I needed to recuperate; especially from the Xiao Xin incident.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop right there!\u201d Suyang called out, even though his eyes were still on the screen, \u201cWhere were you earlier?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

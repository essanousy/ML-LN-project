I can be your spy! I will tell you what Suyang and Shen Shaoqian are up to. I\u2019m actually a lot more useful than you may think, little sister\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why do you want to help us? Suyang brother is supposed to be your boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn brief, I can\u2019t stand Mi Fan. Also, I like meddling in other people\u2019s affairs, ok?\u201d</p><br/><p>With my graceful words, I managed to convince Shen Shaonu. After a moment, she nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can take you to see Zhengyang. But I\u2019m not sure whether or not he will accept you.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Kids were sure troublesome\u2026. Clearly I was helping them. Rather than thanking me graciously, it was as if I were begging to take part instead. Ugh\u2026 forget it. I didn\u2019t want Suyang to continue meeting Mi Fan again and again. I\u2019m also doing this for myself. Hence, it was crucial that I get to the bottom of this case as soon as possible.</i></p><br/><p>Shen Shaonu said Lu Zhengyang worked at a BBQ meat store everyday after school.</p><br/><p>Now that I think of it, Lu Zhengyang was a poor child. His father was beaten up to death in his jail cell. He was filled with so much hatred at such a young age. In addition, he had no one else to rely on\u2026</p><br/><p>Actually, Shen Shaonu could be considered his reliance, right? After all, she lent him 50k.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you come?\u201d Lu Zhengyang looked at Shen Shaonu and briefly glanced at me without saying anything.</p><br/><p>It appeared he had forgotten about me. <i>What the heck? Was my existence level so low? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cDo you still remember me? Last time, I was also present when you went crazy at the coffee shop.\u201d Even if my chances were one in ten thousand, I still wanted to know.</p><br/><p>Hearing my words, Lu Zhengyang nervously looked around his surroundings. He was afraid other people had heard what I said. After all, he knew what he did wasn\u2019t anything he should be proud of.</p><br/><p>A few moments later, he replied, \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026you really don\u2019t remember me! I heard about your situation and I want to help you. When are you off work? I\u2019ll wait until you\u2019re done. Then, we can talk in more details.\u201d I sat down on a customer\u2019s seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm.. I have to go for tutoring, so I won\u2019t be staying. Today, I only came to lead her the way.\u201d Shen Shaonu stated and then hugged her backpack as she hastily left.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you know that made you want to help me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t actually know anything, but because the person I trust wants to help you, I have decided I want to help you as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person you trust? Is it Shaonu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess\u2026 although I haven\u2019t known her for long, I can tell she is a good child.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid Shaonu ask you to help me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, why? Many people try so hard to avoid muddy water. Why are you taking the initiative to step into it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you have so many questions?\u201d I was impatient as I happened to notice a customer with her hand raised. I indicated to Lu Zhengyang, \u201cYou should go serve your customer before she puts a complaint about you. Go work. We\u2019ll talk about the specifics after you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since I had to wait for Lu Zhengyang, I ended up having dinner at the store.</p><br/><p>After four hours later, he was finally finished his shift. The owner of the store was glaring at me the entire night because all I had ordered were a dish of barbecued meat and a can of coke. Yet, I sat there during their peak hours as well. Most likely, he was crumbling on the inside.</p><br/><p>When Lu Zhengyang sat down in front of me, I pushed the menu towards him. \u201cAfter working for so long, you must be hungry, right? What do you want to eat? This one is on me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to buy me dinner?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYup. Order!\u201d This BBQ meat store had reasonable common people prices. It was affordable for me to treat a person.</p><br/><p>Lu Zhengyang stood up, \u201cIf you want to pay for my dinner, I don\u2019t want to eat here. Let me take you elsewhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pick an expensive place! This older sister is merely an average assistant with an average income. Don\u2019t pick something too expensive!\u201d I warned.</p><br/><p>I followed Lu Zhengyang. He took us to the food stall outside.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t expect the punk to help me save so much money, so my impression of him increased a few levels. But it was too loud here. Everyone around were drinking and yelling.</p><br/><p>Actually, in the past, there were a few times where I had wanted to try out places like this. But I had no one to go with. If I came alone, it seemed odd and out of place in this type of atmosphere. So, I never ended up coming.</p><br/><p>Who would\u2019ve thought that this child would grant my wish today. He ordered some skewers, a few small dishes, and two bottles of beer.</p><br/><p>Just as Lu Zhengyang was about to open the beer, I stopped him. \u201cEhhhhh, aren\u2019t you in senior high school? You\u2019re not allowed to drink!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m already an adult. I can drink. Plus, in the world of adults, don\u2019t they drink and chat? If we don\u2019t drink, how are we going to chat?\u201d</p><br/><p>I had my left hand pressing down on the beer bottle, and my right smacking his head, \u201cYou punk, why are you acting? Who told you, you can\u2019t chat without drinking?\u201d</p><br/><p>I seized the opportunity to take the two bottles of beer from him, \u201cOwner, please take these beers back. We don\u2019t need it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d Lu Zhengyang seemed annoyed by my actions but he didn\u2019t say anything else.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen we were at the BBQ meat store, you had a lot of questions you wanted to ask me right? Go ahead and ask. I will answer them all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have too many questions to ask, but right now I cannot remember any of them. I\u2019m thankful you want to help me. But I must tell you something ahead of time. This is a\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTroublesome issue.\u201d I cut off Lu Zhengyang\u2019s words, \u201cI know your situation isn\u2019t a simple dispute. But I\u2019m the type that\u2019s curious. The more troublesome it is, the more I want to help out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what happened to me?\u201d Lu Zhengyang revealed a crestfallen expression that was appropriate for his age.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only read bits and pieces from the web. But I assume 80% of it is false?\u201d Seeing how depressed he was, I honestly felt bad for making him think back about his past. But I had no choice, so I tested him, \u201cIf it\u2019s ok with you, can you tell me about your father?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want me to tell you? I don\u2019t know how I should begin. Everything happened too suddenly. While I was clueless, my father had been accused of an inauspicious, horrid crime and died innocently in prison.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know the mastermind behind this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Zhengyang shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what was their motive for accusing your father?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Zhengyang shook his head again.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you actually believe I want to help you? Or are you afraid that I\u2019m a bad person they\u2019ve sent from the other side?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Zhengyang coldly laughed, \u201cRegardless of the commotion I make, they ignore me\u2026 why would they purposely send a person to get close to me?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>That\u2019s true\u2026</i></p><br/><p>\u201cBut if you don\u2019t know anything, then you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy father is innocent!\u201d Lu Zhengyang hollered as he slammed onto the table. His youthful face was flushed, \u201cI know what type of person he is because he is my father! As his son, I believe him. So I must help him redress an injustice! The only person I know is involved is Mi Fan. She and some people had joined forces and put the criminal charges on my dad! It\u2019s obvious that my father didn\u2019t do anything. All he did was try to help his student who was lying on the streets!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing how furious Lu Zhengyang was, I felt kind of guilty. I wasn\u2019t sure how to comfort him. But suddenly, a half transparent figured appeared behind him.</p><br/><p>While I was trying to figure out whether I was hallucinating or not, Lu Wenxue had already sat down next to Lu Zhengyang as he lightly patted his back. Currently, the father and son\u2019s expressions were very similar. They both had a sorrow that words couldn\u2019t describe.</p><br/><p>Most likely, my chat with Lu Zhengyang had evoked all his buried emotions from within. After we were done eating, he was bawling his eyes out on the way home.</p><br/><p>It was difficult to calm him down. Eventually, his sobs became silent tears. After I walked him home, I didn\u2019t waste any time and directly confronted Lu Wenxue to reveal my ability.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

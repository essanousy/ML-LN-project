At least, I can understand him now! I\u2019m so smart! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cLet me think\u2026 do you plan to stay by Gao Jialan\u2019s side forever?\u201d</p><br/><p>Left hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t plan to stay with her forever? So, until she gives birth?\u201d</p><br/><p>Left hand.</p><br/><p><i>What? My guesses were wrong? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026 was your car accident an accident?\u201d Hearing my question, Wen Yufan appeared to hesitate. He stared at both his hands and couldn\u2019t decide.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it. It\u2019s better I don\u2019t know. Even if I know, there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. I\u2019m not going to ask anymore. Don\u2019t tell me!\u201d I closed my eyes. After a long pause, I sneaked a glance at Yufan. I didn\u2019t fully open my eyes until I was certain that Yufan wasn\u2019t going to respond.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya!\u201d I sighed aloud, \u201cI feel like you and Gao Jialan are like those couples from romance novels\u2026 you know, the type when a rich young master falls in love with a poor Cinderella. You guys must have gone through a lot of obstacles in order to end up together, right? Poor you. Now, you guys are separated by yin and yang\u2026.\u201d The moment those words slipped out, I regretted.</p><br/><p><i>As the saying goes, the more you say, the more mistakes you make! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cI was just making a casual comment. Please don\u2019t take it to heart!\u201d I quickly apologized to Wen Yufan.</p><br/><p>It just so happened that the security guard who had previously blocked me from entering was heading towards my direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it now? I already said I\u2019m not entering the television station. You\u2019re still dissatisfied? Is the road part of your company\u2019s territory? Do you have a certificate to show me? Property of ownership?\u201d I irritably crossed my arms.</p><br/><p>I was the type that held grudges.</p><br/><p>Who would\u2019ve thought the security guard\u2019s attitude would turn a 180 degree? He had his hands politely on top of each other in front of him. In addition, he even smiled at me, \u201cNo. You\u2019ve mistaken\u2026. I am here to tell you that you may enter, Miss. Someone has requested for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can enter?\u201d I excitedly look around. Then, I placed my hands down and calmly asked, \u201cWhy are you suddenly letting me in now? Who is requesting for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA large stockholder of the television station. You will find out once you\u2019re inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLarge\u2026stockholder?\u201d I had a bad feeling about this. I made eye contact with Wen Yufan and recalled that his family was a large stockholder of this television station. <i>They have already investigated and found out about me? </i></p><br/><p><i>Wen Yihan? </i></p><br/><p>Suddenly, I began stretching and slowly backed away as I carefully watched the security guard\u2019s every move. I lightly stated, \u201cI just remember I have some emergency errands to run\u2026umm\u2026 I don\u2019t need to go in anymore\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I wanted to escape, but there were already other security guards blocking my path behind me.</p><br/><p><i>Was this considered walking into a trap? I can\u2019t believe I was the one who screwed myself over!? Initially, I didn\u2019t think I would be so unlucky to bump into Wen Yihan. That was why I was so fearless when I came</i>\u2026</p><br/><p><i>We had never interacted before. If he wanted to see me, it must be because he discovered that I\u2019m the vine that will lead him to the melon\u2026</i></p><br/><p><i>I really don\u2019t want to get into another battle with the wealthy</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you guys trying to do in broad daylight?\u201d Although I was afraid, I must hide it. This was a public place. If I didn\u2019t want to leave, they couldn\u2019t forcefully drag me away, right?</p><br/><p>I was prepared to create an unreasonable scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, our large stockholder has specifically invited you to his office. He has something to say to you.\u201d A security guard wearing a pair of black sunglasses solemnly stated.</p><br/><p>I shook my head, \u201cI don\u2019t know any large stockholder. I refuse to go!\u201d</p><br/><p>The only thing I could do right now was to drag the conversation out as long as I could to buy myself more time. Then, I must find an opportunity to flee.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, please don\u2019t make my job difficult\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem? Why do you keep referring me as Miss? I have a name. Want to bet I will write a complaint about you if you keep doing this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, your name\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy should I tell you my name? I don\u2019t know you. Do you tell your name to random strangers?\u201d I snapped.</p><br/><p>The security guard: \u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a hot summer day, yet a group of men is trying to surround me. Is that appropriate? No! Go away! Go go go! If not, I\u2019m going to scream sexual harassment!\u201d I lifted my finger up to threaten.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, I suggest you to go upstairs to see our large stockholder. If not, he will come down very shortly.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Oh my goodness. I forgot one crucial point. Wen Yihan could move! Even if I don\u2019t go see him, he can still come see me\u2026. No\u2026 there was no time left. I must escape as soon as possible!</i></p><br/><p>Just as I was racking my brain thinking of an escape plan, I heard a familiar voice that puts me at ease. The corners of my mouth curved into a smile. As expected\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you security guards trying to do to my girlfriend?\u201d Through the gaps of the security guards, I could see Suyang with his hands in his pocket. His face was stern as he walked over coolly with swag.</p><br/><p>Then, in front of everyone, Suyang shoved a security guard away and pulled me into his arms. He raised my chin, \u201cAre you being bullied at the television station?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIgnore them. Let\u2019s go\u2026.\u201d I quietly whispered to Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur large stockholder wants to see this lady. Or perhaps, Sir, you can come with us too\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSee what large stockholder?\u201d <i>I don\u2019t know where Suyang learnt how to be so gangster. But he was pro. Did he watch a lot of gang movies?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know any stockholder, but they won\u2019t let me leave!\u201d I began to pull on Suyang\u2019s clothes as I whined like a victim.</p><br/><p>While I was speaking, the security guards made their moves. This time, Suyang was also surrounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cUghh\u2026 so troublesome. We can\u2019t meet this stockholder?\u201d Suyang asked me.</p><br/><p>I shook my head. <em>Definitely not!</em> I didn\u2019t know how to explain it to him. But there was no time to explain anyway.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm.. we can\u2019t meet him\u2026.\u201d Suyang lowered his head and thought about it for a second. Then, he transmitted a message to me with his eyes, \u201cIf we cannot meet him, there\u2019s only one method we could take!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I whispered anxiously.</p><br/><p>Suyang held onto my hand. His thumb was tapping in a predictable rhythm, \u201cOne, two, three!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he got to three, Suyang forcefully shoved a security guard and we hurriedly broke through the space and ran as fast as we could.</p><br/><p>I disregarded the weather and my image as I ran with Suyang. Although I could save some energy since he was dragging me along, it was still not an easy task to maintain the same speed as him.</p><br/><p>In a few minutes, I was already out of breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not run anymore. No more! They\u2019re gone!?\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure how many streets we had passed by, but I was so exhausted, I could barely catch my breath. I had to stop Suyang, \u201cI can\u2019t run anymore\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of us found a safe spot to rest. I secretly peeked at Suyang. His complexion didn\u2019t look good. Suddenly, Suyang gazed at me very intently. I was so surprised that I quickly avoided his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there something you want to ask me?\u201d I mumbled like a guilty child. I didn\u2019t dare to raise my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are a lot of things I want to ask you. You know why? Because you hide so much from me!\u201d Suyang roared.</p><br/><p>I remained silent. I wondered what he was going to say next.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to know why the stockholder wants to meet you, yet you refuse to meet him?\u201d Suyang pressed me against the wall. His arms were on my left and right side; preventing me from escaping. His eyes were flashing.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm.. he\u2019s someone I don\u2019t know\u2026. It\u2019s related to Gao Jialan\u2026\u201d I muttered.</p><br/><p>Suyang couldn\u2019t hear what I said and asked me to repeat it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s related to Gao Jialan. I don\u2019t have the right to talk about it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang placed one hand on my shoulder and the other on my chin. He lifted my chin to make me look at him in the eye. I could tell he was trying to suppress his anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, Gao Jialan is living with us. If there is something going on, I should have the right to know. You have always been hiding so much from me. It really bothers me.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

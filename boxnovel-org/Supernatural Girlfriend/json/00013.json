You think I would come back and wait for the cops to catch me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang\u2019s reaction surprised me. I didn\u2019t expect him to be so calm seeing me all bloody like this. In comparison to the taxi driver, whose soul had nearly left his body, Suyang was clearly abnormal.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t human.</p><br/><p>\u201cPsssh.. With your slow personality? You were probably fighting someone randomly on the streets and got stabbed?\u201d Suyang rubbed his chin with his right hand as he made a guess.</p><br/><p><i>He has a personality issue and he dares to say I do?! </i></p><br/><p>I coldly snorted, \u201cI don\u2019t have the vitality of a cockroach. If I had been stabbed, do you think I would be able to stand in front of you right now? Don\u2019t worry. I didn\u2019t stab anyone and no one stabbed me. But a police officer saved me, and now she is in the ICU\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I took a bottle of water from the fridge and planned to return to my bedroom.</p><br/><p>Before I went inside, I purposely glared and warned Suyang. \u201cI have something really important to do. Don\u2019t come bother me. It\u2019s late, so go back to your room and sleep!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I walked inside my room, Sheyu was hanging upside down by the window next to the mistress. I quickly closed the curtains and said, \u201cDon\u2019t follow bad examples. That is her hobby.\u201d</p><br/><p>I sat down on the bed and gestured Sheyu to come over.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, if it weren\u2019t for you, I probably, no, I would have been dead for sure.\u201d I wanted to grab onto Sheyu\u2019s hand, but all I was able to do was grab onto air.</p><br/><p>I forced a smile on my face as I tried to comfort Sheyu, \u201cBased on my intuitions, you are not dead. It\u2019s just that your spirit has temporarily left your body. Have you seen it on television? The spirit separated from the physical body?! That\u2019s you right now\u2026 aiya, honestly I don\u2019t know too much. Basically, you still have a chance to survive, so don\u2019t give up!\u201d</p><br/><p>I jabbered on and on. Sheyu\u2019s face remained emotionless. Suddenly, my bedroom door cracked open. Suyang was leaning by the door and surveying my room with an alert expression. He was baffled, \u201cWho are you talking to?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho let you in?\u201d I retorted, \u201cDidn\u2019t I say not to bother me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang had thick skin as he fully returned my critical look. \u201cI didn\u2019t come in. Can\u2019t you see I\u2019m standing outside?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want? If you have something to say, say it all now. I\u2019m very busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang raised his hand and knocked on my door twice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe door is already opened. Just come in yourself. What?! Do you need me to carry you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang ignored the fact that I was pissed. He knocked twice again. \u201cSay you\u2019ll let me come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>I realized something as I curved into a smile, \u201cSuyang, if I do not say come in, does it mean you won\u2019t come in?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang was caught off guard. Although it only lasted for a second, I caught it with my quick eye.</p><br/><p><i>Oh!! So turns out Suyang does have a weakness. If I do not say he can enter, he wouldn\u2019t come into my personal space. </i></p><br/><p>That was my assumption.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you talking to? The contract clearly stated that if you want to bring friends over, Party B, which is me, must approve\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang pointed to himself as he continued to look around my room.</p><br/><p>\u201cFriend? Do you see anyone else in here?\u201d I waved my hand and strongly rebutted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to enter in order to confirm. Let me come in.\u201d He grumbled.</p><br/><p><i>Am I dreaming? The almighty Suyang was cutely throwing a tantrum? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cThe door is opened. No one is blocking you.\u201d I refused to say the two words Suyang wanted to desperately hear. I want to drive him nuts! Drive him insane!</p><br/><p>Suyang placed his hands on his waist, \u201cYou\u2019re doing this on purpose, aren\u2019t you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>I pretended to be innocent as I batted my eyes, \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re talking about. But if you don\u2019t take action soon, I\u2019m going to shut the door and continue talking to myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang was so furious that his face was turning red and green. I was starting to worry that he will kick me out at this point. I better quit while I\u2019m ahead.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease enter.\u201d</p><br/><p>To Suyang, those two words were like the opening gunshot that allowed athletes to begin the race. Suyang immediately entered my room. \u201cIf I find someone here, you\u2019re dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFeel free to look around, but if you can\u2019t find anything, I am not going to willingly allow you accuse me!\u201d I knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to see Sheyu, so there was nothing I had to be afraid of.</p><br/><p>As expected, Suyang couldn\u2019t see or sense Sheyu even though she was in front of him. He directly passed by her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI swear I heard you talking to someone\u2026.\u201d Suyang muttered under his breath as he began to flip through my wardrobe. He even cautiously explored underneath my bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, you went as far as eavesdropping outside my door? You have no class!\u201d I rolled my eyes at him as I watched him try to drill himself underneath my bed.</p><br/><p>I turned away and decided to ignore him as I took my bloody top off and looked for a clean top to wear.</p><br/><p>Suyang got up from the ground and noticed I only had a tank top on. Right away, he covered his eyes and turned around as he stuttered nervously, \u201cY-you\u2026.why did you take off your clothes? Are you crazy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy clothes are covered in blood, of course I have to change! What do you expect? You want me to wear this to celebrate the New Years*?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang\u2019s extreme reaction was quite interesting to me.</p><br/><p>He was \u2026.so\u2026.pure?</p><br/><p>Suyang was speechless.</p><br/><p>After being silent for a moment, he pointed towards me as he hotly stated, \u201cIn the contract, it states that you must not expose yourself in a public space. Did you forget? You want to go against the contract?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBro. Is this a public place? This is my bedroom! And I\u2019m not naked. Can\u2019t you see this tank top?!\u201d I smacked Suyang on the back.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, Suyang jumped as if I had stabbed him with needles. He closed his eyes and hopped off my bed as he ran out. Before he closed the door, he also crashed against the wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you would take off your top in front of a man. You pervert!\u201d Suyang yelled from the other side of the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d I violently pulled my door open as I glared at Suyang. I crossed my arms and held it at the bottom of my tank top; pretending to pull it up.</p><br/><p>As expected, Suyang couldn\u2019t handle it. He instantaneously bolted back into his room.</p><br/><p><i>Psssh, you want to fight me? </i></p><br/><p>I slapped my hands and grinned victoriously. I turned around and closed the door as I gave Sheyu a victory sign. \u201cI found the annoying goblin\u2019s weakness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that I got rid of Suyang, I continued our previous discussion. But we couldn\u2019t come up with a solution. So I turned on my laptop as I researched about spirits that have left the bodies.</p><br/><p>Sadly, most of the results were useless. The more I searched, the more hopeless I felt. I had the mindset of barking up to any tree possible in my desperation, and left a question on a forum roughly seeking for advice on how to return a spirit back into the body.</p><br/><p>After waiting for many hours, someone finally responded, but he was mocking me\u2026</p><br/><p>A few moments later was another response. But it was either a sarcastic comment or some weird advertisements. I felt like my method had failed. As I pondered deeply once again, I suddenly thought of something. I excitedly slammed my hand down, \u201cSheyu, let\u2019s return back to the hospital!\u201d Then, I put on my jacket as I was about to leave the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have seen it on TV before. Since your spirit exited through your body, why can\u2019t it enter it again? Scientifically, your physical body is still living. You should be able to return\u2026. Regardless of the result, we must go back to the hospital and attempt!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was anxious and eager at the same time as I tried to open the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Strange\u2026 how come I can\u2019t open the door?\u201d</p><br/><p>I increased my strength and twisted the knob left to right, but it wouldn\u2019t budge at all. I swear, it was fine earlier when I was teasing Suyang\u2026</p><br/><p>I came to a realization as I banged the door and shouted, \u201cSuyang! What the hell are you doing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>No response.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang! I know you did something to my door! You better let me out! I have something urgent I have to do!\u201d I didn\u2019t understand why he was locking me in.</p><br/><p>A few moments later, a note entered through my door crack.</p><br/><p>It said: \u201cConsidering what you went through today, I am not going to investigate your abnormal behaviour and punish you for violating the contract. As a kind-hearted roommate, I have decided to let you rest well to show my considerate side.\u201d</p><br/><p>*In the Chinese culture, it is common to wear red to celebrate the New Year. Red is considered a lucky colour.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

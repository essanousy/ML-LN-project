Without warning, she stood up with her fists clenched as she glared at me with her bulging eyeballs.</p><br/><p>Her extreme reaction surprised me and I was scared. But fortunately, this was the hospital. She couldn\u2019t do anything to me in a public space.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the fake Xu Weishan\u2019s cell phone rang, and it shattered the tense atmosphere between us. She picked up her phone and gazed at it for a few seconds. Then, she let out a sigh and seemed to have calmed down. After hesitating for a bit longer, she finally made up her mind and reached for her jacket as she turned to me, \u201cLet\u2019s go out and have a talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing her initiate made me panic a little. Was it because of her cell phone?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t we talk here?\u201d I mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are people here. We need to go to a quieter place. After all, our conversation isn\u2019t something that should be broadcasted to the public.\u201d</p><br/><p>I gulped down my saliva and tried to remain calm. <i>Quiet place\u2026.. what type of quiet place? </i></p><br/><p>I was hoping to find a noisy area. For example, the food market.</p><br/><p>As for Xu Weishan, the type of quiet place she was referring to was a coffee shop near the hospital.</p><br/><p>I guess that was fine. Although there weren\u2019t many customers at this hour, at least there were service workers there. If something happened to me, I could be saved. Plus, I was close to the hospital.</p><br/><p>On our way to the coffee shop, the fake Xu Weishan was shaking a lot. I was honestly worried she will lose consciousness. So the moment we arrived, the first thing I did was to order a dessert for her. She had been taking care of Xiao Xin endlessly, I was certain that she hadn\u2019t eaten.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay here with you for too long. I need to take care of Xiao Xin.\u201d The fake Xu Weishan\u2019s voice was barely audible.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. I won\u2019t take too much of your time. Just the time it takes for you to finish the cake. After you\u2019re done eating the cake, our talk is over.\u201d The dessert had arrived, and I pushed it towards her direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cEver since the first time I met you, I already knew you were different from the others.\u201d The fake Xu Weishan took a fork as she jabbed it through the cake. The silky smooth chocolate from within flowed out repeatedly.</p><br/><p><i>I really wanted to eat it\u2026.</i></p><br/><p>I attentively gazed at Xu Weishan as she took her first bite. I held onto my breath and asked, \u201cWhat type of feeling was it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike it was meant to be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeant to be? Your encounter was destined\u2026.is it sweet and soft??\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d The fake Xu Weishan was confused by my words, \u201cWhat is sweet and soft?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026.\u201d I sluggishly stared and pointed at the cake, \u201cIt\u2019s very delicious, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>*Pa!* The fake Xu Weishan slammed her cell phone in front of me. I was so intimidated that I was instantly pulled out of my chocolate cake world and brought back to reality. I glanced at her cell phone; confused. I began to shift my body backwards, \u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fake Xu Weishan unlocked her cell phone in front of me. Then, she opened her latest text message. It was the one she was reading earlier. Kevin had sent her something:</p><br/><p><i><strong>I think Bai Silu knows something. She came with Weishan\u2019s bracelet. We must be prepared.</strong></i></p><br/><p><i>W-\u2026.what!?!!??!?!!? </i>I felt like I had been betrayed by Kevin. I was so stunned that I couldn\u2019t close my mouth. <i>K-Kevin knew all along this Xu Weishan was fake!? They were working as a duo!?!? I-I was fooled?!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cAre you here to represent my sister? Represent the real Xu Weishan to demand repayment?\u201d Xu Weishan gave me a bitter smile. It was very different from her usual strong attitude.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on? What does Kevin\u2019s words mean?\u201d I tightly gripped onto my coffee cup. I needed security. After seeing Kevin\u2019s text message, I felt all the blood in my body running cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a story. It\u2019s about a pair of twins. Do you want to hear?\u201d The fake Xu Weishan lightly tapped her drinking glass and a clear crisp sound rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy real name is Hong Xiaobei\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like that, I began to listen to the twin\u2019s true story.</p><br/><p>During the Spring of 21 years ago, a pair of twins was born in this city. To most families, this would be a great news to celebrate. But to the mother of the twins, this was like thunder from a clear sky. Originally, she was already a single mother. Yet, now she had two children to raise. For a jobless woman like her, this was undoubtedly a very heavy burden.</p><br/><p>Not long after giving birth, a financial backer said to her, \u201cAs long as you\u2019re willing to give up your children and follow me, I\u2019ll take care of you for the rest of your lives.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because of this line, two infants were left crying outside of the city\u2019s orphanage underneath a broken umbrella on a rainy night.</p><br/><p>It was fate.</p><br/><p>The younger sister was first adopted by an average family. A week later, the older sister was adopted by a wealthy family. The Sun rose and set. Spring left and Autumn came. One of them carried an old backpack and enjoyed eating snacks at a vendor stall after school, while the other carried the latest brand name bag and enjoyed the attention and love of all the influential business people of the world. The two sisters lived under the same city without knowing each other\u2019s existence for 19 years.</p><br/><p>The older sister\u2019s name was Xu Weishan, while the younger one was Hong Xiaobei.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

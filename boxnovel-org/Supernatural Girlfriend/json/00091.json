What\u2019s so dangerous about it?\u201d I sped up even more and reached the highest part of the bridge. Then, I turned around and made a face at Suyang. \u201cI told you, it\u2019s fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing how I was alright, Suyang looked relieved.</p><br/><p><i>Eh?</i></p><br/><p><i>Wait a second. I wasn\u2019t moving, but why was I going backwards? And it was going faster and faster?!?!</i></p><br/><p><i>Ahhhhh!! </i></p><br/><p>I kept trying to press on the brakes, but it wasn\u2019t working.</p><br/><p>So now, I was on the wheelchair sliding backwards. It was to the point where I couldn\u2019t stop it anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhh! So scary! Mother! Ahhhh!\u201d In order to save myself, I leaned forward and covered my face. I prayed that when I fall, it wouldn\u2019t be face first.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoldfish!\u201d Suyang realized I was no longer able to control my wheelchair and quickly ran towards me. But there was still quite a distance between us. By the time he will arrive, I would already have fallen off.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Suddenly, there was a female voice called out from behind me and the person gripped onto my wheelchair.</p><br/><p>At least, she managed to stop it and I didn\u2019t end up falling off.</p><br/><p><i>So I guess I was still invincible? Errrr\u2026haha. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cThank you so much!\u201d I turned the wheelchair around and wanted to sincerely thank the kind soul for saving me, \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know who you are, I\u2019m\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Before I could complete my sentence, the woman sat down in front of me in slow motion. Then, she laid down and made an \u201cohhhhhh\u2026\u201d sound.</p><br/><p><i>Was she moaning? Did I hit her? Her acting skills were too exaggerated though!</i></p><br/><p><i>I swear she had steadily stopped the wheelchair herself. That was the reason why I wasn\u2019t injured. So, I couldn\u2019t have hit her?!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cGoldfish, are you alright?\u201d Suyang ran over and instantly examined to see if I was hurt anywhere.</p><br/><p>I faced Suyang with a stupefied expression as I pointed at the motionless woman. She appeared to be in her early 30s. In addition, her clothes seemed quite high class. <i>So why was she trying to scam me?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cYou crashed into her?\u201d Suyang asked.</p><br/><p>I shook my head and whispered, \u201cShe laid there herself. Do you think she is from the legendary scam association?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScam?\u201d Suyang was about to go over to assist the woman. But I couldn\u2019t remain still in my wheelchair.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, Auntie?! Can you get up? I didn\u2019t even hit you. Quit pretending?!\u201d I confronted the woman.</p><br/><p>Hearing my words, the woman opened her eyes and stared at me from the corner of her eyes, \u201cLin Yixin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know who I am?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>What? She came prepared? She even knows my identity? This world is too dangerous!</i></p><br/><p>But the Auntie smiled at me, \u201cYou\u2019re still the same as you were back then. I\u2019m Gao Jialan. You don\u2019t remember me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGao Jialan?\u201d I tried scanning through my memories, but I had no impression. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were from the same orphanage! I\u2019m older than you by seven years. I\u2019m your Lanlan sister. You don\u2019t remember?\u201d The woman was trying very hard to stimulate my past. But sadly, I still couldn\u2019t recognize her.</p><br/><p>After scanning her up and down, I asked, \u201cDo you really know me? Then why are you lying there and refusing to get up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not refusing to get up. I just need a favour from you. Considering we had a past together, please help me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! I haven\u2019t been able to confirm we know each other. Also, I have left the orphanage many years ago. I don\u2019t remember much about my past.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me make it clear now. If you want me to lend you money or be your guarantor, it\u2019s an automatic no!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d Gao Jialan didn\u2019t seem to have any intentions of getting up. She was still lying on the ground as she crooked her head and asked, \u201cI just want you to let me stay with you for a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet you stay with me? What do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm.. could I borrow and stay at your home for a few days?\u201d Gao Jialan pressed her palms together as she pleaded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I do that? You don\u2019t have a home to live in? I don\u2019t have space for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was speechless. Originally, I wanted to get some fresh air, but I ended up encountering such a strange woman. She seemed to know me but I didn\u2019t remember her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not? Don\u2019t worry. I promise that I won\u2019t interrupt your romantic world. I only need a few days. I\u2019m begging you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I firmly refused.</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan sighed, \u201cFine! If you won\u2019t help me, I\u2019ll continue lying here and create a scene. Then, I\u2019ll tell people you crashed into me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? You\u2019re the one who helped stop my wheelchair! I never even touched you\u2026 oh my goodness\u2026.I\u2019m speechless\u2026 fine! Continue lying here if you want! I don\u2019t care! Go tell others a wheelchair crashed into you. Let\u2019s see who gives a shit!\u201d</p><br/><p>I linked arms with Suyang and was about to drag him away. Surprisingly, Suyang flung off my hand and helped Gao Jialan get up. He gently stated, \u201cI am ok with you temporarily staying with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d I hurriedly pulled Suyang away, \u201cIs your brain fried? You\u2019re letting a stranger live with us? Do you think you\u2019re a hero or something? Do you come out at the cry of any injustice? You need to choose your battles!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStranger? She is one of your companions from the orphanage. Also, she\u2019s an older sister. Plus, look at how pitiful she is. How could you reject her like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>I was flabbergasted. Suyang helped Gao Jialan up and they chitchatted as they walked away.</p><br/><p><i>What\u2019s going on?</i></p><br/><p><i>My boyfriend abandoned me for a woman who supposedly knows me?! </i></p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you explain to me what you\u2019re doing?\u201d I had my arms blocking the door frame as I glowered at the two villains who wanted to enter \u2013</p><br/><p>Suyang and Gao Jialan.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet her in. Be good.\u201d Although Suyang was using a nice tone, in reality, he was forcefully trying to pull my arm away from the door.</p><br/><p>Since I was physically weaker than Suyang, I switched to another defensive position. I pressed my butt against the left side of the door, while I had my legs and arms on the right side of the door. I was blocking the entire door. No matter what, I refused to let them inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re being like this, don\u2019t blame me!\u201d After Suyang said those words, my heart pounded. Before I could interpret his meaning, Suyang directly bent down half way and seized my waist as he lifted me up horizontally.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, my legs were waving in the air and my hair had covered my entire face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh! Suyang! Put me down!\u201d My legs were fluttering but it was no use. Just like that, I was taken away by Suyang. I watched as Gao Jialan entered my bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! If you dare to enter my room, I\u2019ll never forgive you!\u201d I pointed at Gao Jialan as I gritted my teeth and gave out my last warning. But it was ineffective.</p><br/><p>She shut the door in front of my face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d After Suyang threw me onto the couch, I resentfully questioned, \u201cWhy are you letting her enter my room? Do you know her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why are you letting her live here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf not, where will she live?\u201d Suyang gave me a \u201cyou should have expected this\u201d kind of face. I was feeling more enraged by the second.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you let random strangers stay at your house? Suyang, I\u2019m starting to feel more confused by your actions\u2026. Are you really Suyang? Or do you have another identity?\u201d</p><br/><p>I was about to rudely \u201cunmask\u201d his face, but he shoved my hand away.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s someone you know in the past. She doesn\u2019t have a place to stay right now. We can\u2019t leave her on the streets. We must help others and become virtuous human beings. That way, we can go to Heaven after we die.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Go to Heaven?</i></p><br/><p><i>Oh yeah\u2026 I need to do good deeds! Or else I might end up like the mistress who hung outside the window; getting blown by the wind, burnt by the sun, and drenched by the rain. Such hardship\u2026</i>.</p><br/><p>But my gut intuition told me Suyang was acting abnormal. I narrowed my eyes and interrogated him. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you! You must have some sort of motive! Based on my own understanding, you\u2019re not the type to sympathize with others. State your motive now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang gave me a smile but not a smile. Now, I was even more certain he had some type of conspiracy theory up his sleeves.</p><br/><p>Except, I still had no idea what he wanted to do\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to back up ten thousand steps, but the most I can tolerate is letting her stay here. She can\u2019t sleep in my room though.\u201d I patted the couch, \u201cLet her sleep on the couch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a guest. How can you allow a guest to sleep on the couch?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo are you telling me to sleep on the couch?\u201d I raised my voice in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not\u2026\u201d Suyang patted me like he was trying to comfort a dog. But I coldly shifted away from him, \u201cYou will stay in my room, ok? Plus, there are some things I need to be honest with you about\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you talking about your fictional world of anime, comics and games?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang froze, \u201cYou\u2019ve been inside my room before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat time when Shaonu stormed in looking for you\u2026. Don\u2019t worry about it! All men have some secrets they don\u2019t want others to find out. It\u2019s not that embarrassing\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I was saying this, when I envisioned Suyang\u2019s room, I wanted to laugh to the point where tears fall out.</p><br/><p>The moment Suyang heard that the main culprit was Shen Shaonu, he weakly leaned against the couch. It seemed like he was having a hard time accepting the truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyhow, why would you rather sleep on the couch just to allow this woman stay with us? Why? Tell me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang innocently gazed at me, \u201cWho said I was going to sleep on the couch?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

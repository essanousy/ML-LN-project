You want to sleep in the bathroom? Hahahaha!\u201d Suyang began to chuckle.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d I was so mad, \u201cFine! I\u2019ll open just a crack. But if you dare come in, you\u2019re dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know! I know!\u201d He sounded so impatient. I could tell he really wasn\u2019t listening.</p><br/><p>I sighed as I unlocked the door and pressed my back against the wall. I stuck out my left hand and said, \u201cHand it over now!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was feeling the air but didn\u2019t feel the pyjamas at all. So, I lost patience and poked my head out. I noticed Suyang was leaving the door open with one foot. Then, a second late, he forced himself inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d I screamed. I didn\u2019t think he would actually come in.</p><br/><p>Clearly, Suyang came in unprepared. He was just staring at my body without saying a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhhh!!!\u201d I grabbed a random towel and threw it over Suyang\u2019s head. Since it was too slippery, I fell down on Suyang. I was still screaming, \u201cNo! No!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026..\u201d Suyang was trying to break out but I wouldn\u2019t allow him open his eyes. Then, I stomped on his body and ran to the bedroom with my pyjamas.</p><br/><p>By the time Suyang came in, I had already changed into my pyjamas. I was glaring at him from the bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in you.\u201d I had my arms on my waist, \u201cHow could you lose to your desires?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang ignored my anger and showed me a charming smile. Then, he took out his hair dryer and said, \u201cLet me help you blow dry your hair. Or else, you\u2019ll have a headache.\u201d</p><br/><p>I took the hair dryer from his hand, \u201cNo need. I can do it myself. You are sleeping on the couch tonight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya!\u201d Suyang sat down next to me and nudged me with his shoulder, \u201cWhy are you so shy? Last night, we\u2019ve already seen each other naked. If you still think it\u2019s unfair, I\u2019ll sacrifice myself and let you see again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Suyang began to undress himself. He took off his top.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Just as he was about to take off his pants, I had to yell.</p><br/><p>\u201cTurn around and let me help dry your hair.\u201d Suyang took the hair dryer from me and turned it on. A blast of warm air began to spiral above my head. Suyang\u2019s movements were gentle and pleasant.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you cut your hair short?\u201d Suyang asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think long hair is too annoying. Doesn\u2019t this look much neater and clean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue. You also look younger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you implying that I didn\u2019t look young before?\u201d I growled.</p><br/><p>Suyang didn\u2019t say anything. Instead, he blasted the hair dryer higher.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d I was so mad I couldn\u2019t talk.</p><br/><p>Since I had short hair, it was dry in no time. I could feel the weight of my hair turning lighter and lighter. Soon, Suyang switched off the hair dryer and smoothly rolled himself onto the bed with the blanket wrapped around him.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo sleep on the couch!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang pretended not to hear me. He turned his head the other way.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not going, I\u2019ll go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as I was about to head to the living room, Suyang suddenly grabbed my wrist and pulled me into his arms.</p><br/><p>Suyang lowered his face and sleepily murmured, \u201cIn this household, you\u2019re not allowed to sleep anywhere else aside from this room. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t do anything to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d After the bathroom incident, I basically had zero faith in Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm. We still have to go to work tomorrow. Let\u2019s go to bed earlier\u2026.\u201d Suyang enveloped his arms around me and placed me onto the other side of the bed. Then, he closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>I was speechless\u2026. <i>Tomorrow we still have work. Let\u2019s go to bed earlier? Did that really come out of Suyang\u2019s mouth? </i>I still had no trust in him, so I purposely went to a far corner and secretly peeked as I observed his back view.</p><br/><p>I was feeling uneasy\u2026 <i>Is Suyang really going to bed?</i></p><br/><p><i>Wait! What am I hoping for? Isn\u2019t it good that he\u2019s well behaved? This is for the best! Stay like this! Then, we can both get through this night in harmony. </i></p><br/><p>Time slowly passed by, but rather than feeling sleepier, I felt more and more awake. I reached out my hand to take a look at my cell phone. It was already 11pm.</p><br/><p>I honestly couldn\u2019t sleep. So, I began to poke Suyang\u2019s still back with my finger, \u201cAre you asleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm hm\u2026.\u201d Suyang sounded weak and helpless.</p><br/><p>\u201cLiar. If you were asleep, you wouldn\u2019t have responded. If you\u2019re still awake, turn around and let\u2019s chat!\u201d I was talking to Suyang\u2019s back. He was topless.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d Suyang didn\u2019t turn around. He was still using his weak voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to know how you entered the company. I\u2019m talking about the Xu Clan Corporation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already told you. Granny knows someone from the company. That\u2019s how I got in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me the person your granny knows is the current Director, Yao Youfan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>The current Director?! Really? </i>I instantly sat upright and was practically climbing on Suyang. My hands were tightly holding onto his strong arms. I could see his eyes were tightly shut.</p><br/><p>I was a bit hysterical as I yelped, \u201cReally? Yao Youfan and Grandmother Meng knew each other? Oh God!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang suddenly opened his eyes but didn\u2019t respond to my question. Before I could react, he seized my arm and wrist and flipped me over. He pressed me down and panted, \u201cCan\u2019t you tell I\u2019ve been trying to suppress myself this whole time? Stop trying to seduce me! Or else I can\u2019t guarantee I\u2019ll be able to hold back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang\u2019s face looked a bit pink, but I could care less, \u201cAre you very close to Yao Youfan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you asking about her? Could she be the reason why you entered the company?\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, Suyang figured it out with one guess.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that. It\u2019s confidential.\u201d It wasn\u2019t my fault. Before conducting any business, a confidential agreement was always signed between parties.</p><br/><p>Suyang went back to his original side and laid flat on the bed, \u201cIf you won\u2019t tell me the reason why you entered the company, I\u2019m not going to tell you anything about Yao Youfan either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so stingy!\u201d I whined.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about this\u2026\u201d I suddenly thought of a great idea. I wasn\u2019t sure if it would work though, \u201cDue to some reasons, I can\u2019t tell you my purpose for being here. But you could guess! Make use of your super great imagination you had when you were an author. When the timing is right, I\u2019ll give you hints.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026let me think about it.\u201d Suyang gazed at me with his lips pursed, \u201cYou definitely didn\u2019t enter the company based on your abilities. Someone of authority must have somehow gotten you in. As for why you\u2019re here, it\u2019s because it\u2019s to make your job easier. You must need access to something. As for why you\u2019re arranged into my department, the person knows that my sudden appearance has something to do with Yao Youfan. This means that the person behind you probably wants you to go through me to attack or accuse or find out something about Yao Youfan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang was going through one layer at a time, \u201cBased on the recent news, the person who would be interested in going against Yao Youfan would probably be related to the Chairman Xu\u2019s will. The allocation of his estate was quite strange. So\u2026 the person behind you is Xu Chuqiao?\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded and clapped, \u201cI didn\u2019t even have to give you any hints! My dear, you\u2019re a genius!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, just a bit. How did Xu Chuqiao find you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI forgot to introduce myself. I\u2019m Lin Yixin of the Ghost Firm. Our firm specializes in all sorts of cheating, tracking, investigation sort of affairs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGhost Firm?\u201d Suyang instantly shivered. Then, he gave me a look of disdain, \u201cAre you trying to get me to be your client in bed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! No! Don\u2019t misunderstand!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGhost Firm? What sort of name is that?\u201d Suyang seemed to be confused by the name of my firm.</p><br/><p>I explained, \u201cGhost? It\u2019s the literal meaning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..Ah! I get it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyhow, now that you\u2019ve guessed most of it, you know my purpose for being here. Can you help me out?\u201d I leaned against Suyang\u2019s arm as I began to blink my sparkling eyes at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you an investigative firm? Investigating shouldn\u2019t be a difficult task for you. Why must I help you?\u201d Suyang continued to act cool and collected.</p><br/><p>I shook my head at Suyang, \u201cBut it would be faster with your help\u2026. Time is money! Can\u2019t you help me? You can\u2019t help me at all?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

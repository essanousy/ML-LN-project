My eyes were like peach blossoms; red lips and white teeth. My appearance had an unspeakable charm to it. People often say that makeup artists had superior craftsmanship. Today, I finally believed it. This was comparable to plastic surgery!</p><br/><p>\u201cCustomer, someone is looking for you outside.\u201d The worker came in to notify me.</p><br/><p>Just as I was about to get up to show Suyang my look, the makeup artist stopped me. He smiled and asked, \u201cDo you want to surprise your boyfriend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFollow me.\u201d The makeup artist secretly led me to an area behind a curtain. He said, \u201cYou only have to sit here and be pretty. In a bit, I\u2019ll play music for you and the curtain will fall down to surprise your boyfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>I liked his idea</i>\u2026 so I obediently listened to him and remained behind the curtain. I shifted my body around and tried to figure out the pose that would accentuate my beauty the most.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, there was an odd yet touching melody playing in the background. My emotional state instantly adapted to the context and I subconsciously played my character.</p><br/><p>The curtain fell and Suyang was standing right in front of me. He froze.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d Suyang was only able to utter one word; everything else was replaced by astonishment.</p><br/><p>I had no idea where the photo studio got the cherry petals from, but they were fluttering in the air like snow. It wasn\u2019t until later that I found out the lyrics to the Japanese song that was playing in the background.</p><br/><p>The general translations were :</p><br/><p><i>After farewell, everything passed by like water.</i></p><br/><p><i>When will we meet again?</i></p><br/><p><i>The result of years led to collapse of beauty.</i></p><br/><p><i>The only thing that dragged me down was my longing.</i></p><br/><p><i>Today, the moon was round again. </i></p><br/><p><i>The cherry blossoms fell and piled up upon the resentment.</i></p><br/><p><i>When will my dream reach the Heavens?</i></p><br/><p><i>I reflected as if my husband was in front of me</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>The melody started off soft, but then it became very sad. Afterwards, it took a different turn. It seemed to give the listener a glimmer of hope, before pulling them back to reality.</p><br/><p><i>Oh yes, my man was right in front of me. </i></p><br/><p><i>I had never separated from Suyang, but why was I able to relate to the song? It felt like a story about me.</i><i>Perhaps, as a woman, I was too sentimental. </i></p><br/><p>Suyang slowly walked towards me. He lightly bent his waist and offered his right hand. At that moment, I reenacted my role again.</p><br/><p>I took Suyang\u2019s hand, but since the head ornament and my outfit were too heavy, I tripped and fell right into Suyang\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>This was Suyang\u2019s first complete sentence. The long makeup was definitely worth it.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know until today?\u201d I retorted.</p><br/><p>Suyang smiled and shook his head, \u201cNo, I knew early on. I already knew the first time we met.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerfect! We\u2019re done!\u201d The worker had terrible timing and broke off our sappy moment. When I heard her voice, we returned back to reality and awkwardly separated. Then, our eyes wandered around the studio.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done?\u201d I had no idea when the pictures were taken.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur photographer thought the moment you two shared was truly beautiful, so he snapped all the shots already.\u201d The worker brought the laptop over to show us.</p><br/><p>She was correct. The truest emotions were always unplanned. After a long time, I still couldn\u2019t choose a picture out of the ten. Seeing how difficult it was for me, Suyang simply told the worker to print them all.</p><br/><p><i>Having a rich boyfriend was great</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know I wanted them all?\u201d I was curious to know how Suyang always seemed to have the ability to read my mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can I share that with you? That\u2019s my Dao of survival.\u201d Suyang grinned as he looked down at his watch, \u201cBy the way, Shaoqian and Shaonu are waiting for us in the coffee shop. Hurry and remove your makeup so we can go find them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRemove my makeup?\u201d I was reluctant. <i>It was rare that I could look so pretty</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to walk out like this?\u201d Since Suyang was urging, I followed the worker back into the makeup room. When I entered, the makeup artist was busy tidying up.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday was great experience. Thank you so much!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you liked it.\u201d Then, he stopped tidying up and asked, \u201cDo you want me to help you remove your makeup?\u201d</p><br/><p>I was so happy with myself for finding such a great photo studio. So, I made a solemn oath and declared to the makeup artist, \u201cIn the future, if I come to Japan again, I\u2019ll definitely return!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d He laughed like a child as he helped me remove the head ornament and makeup. \u201cIn the future, if your friends plan to come to Japan, don\u2019t forget to recommend our studio to them!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Friends\u2026?</i> I wanted to tell him that the closest people to me were already on this trip. But it sounded kind of awkward so I simply nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, just mention my name and they\u2019ll give you a discount!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah, I don\u2019t know your name\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnson.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnson!\u201d I was worried I\u2019d forget, so I repeated once more.</p><br/><p>The makeup artist smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s right. My name is Anson.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Ever since we returned from Japan, all of Suyang\u2019s inspiration appeared. The moment we got back, he immediately began to type nonstop. He said the day at the photo studio gave him a lot of inspiration.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere!\u201d One day, Suyang handed me a walkie-talkie.</p><br/><p>Initially, I was pleasantly enjoying my wonderful weekend. But the moment I saw Suyang, I had a bad gut feeling. I stared at the walkie-talkie and was too afraid to accept it from him. I was scared it was a prank.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is related to my inspiration. As my assistant, it is time for you to do your job.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>I had nearly forgotten that I was his assistant\u2026 recently, I\u2019ve been living as Suyang\u2019s girlfriend. I forgot that I had to cooperate with him at all levels when he writes his novels.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do I have to do this time\u2026.?\u201d I was a bit worried as I shrunk my body on the couch.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very simple. Just carry this walkie-talkie and be on standby on the 30th floor. I will be on the 1st floor. When you hear my command, run down as fast as you can. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>I understood but I was confused at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want me to run down from the 30th floor? Do you think I\u2019m Superwoman?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you to fly. Just run. I want to know how long it would take.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you run, I\u2019ll be the timer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMen and women have different build. I want to test the female stamina.\u201d Suyang giggled. He knew it was a tough task but still forced me do it. Suyang stuffed the walkie-talkie into my hand.</p><br/><p>Then, he nudged me with his arm, \u201cLet\u2019s go. After the experiment, we\u2019ll go out to eat dinner. My treat, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>I glared at Suyang, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m the type of woman who only requires a meal to be satisfied?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think\u2026.\u201d Suyang avoided eye contact and I knew what he was thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are we having for dinner?\u201d I frowned. Although I was somewhat unwilling, this was part of my job as an assistant.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>I got up from the couch and took a deep breath, \u201cLet\u2019s go do this before I starve to death!\u201d Then, I went over to the entrance to put on my running shoes.</p><br/><p>\u201cOk!\u201d Since I agreed, Suyang smiled and quickly followed along. The two of us waited for the elevator. I went up to the 30th floor, while he went down to the 1st.</p><br/><p>I held onto Suyang\u2019s walkie-talkie and stood in the passageway; in a runner\u2019s position. I had no idea how the inspiration from the Japan Edo photo studio could lead to this experiment. <i>What a qualitative leap. What was he doing on the computer these past few days?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d I could hear Suyang\u2019s fuzzy voice from the walkie-talkie.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m ready.\u201d I stared at the long and endless staircases and sighed and waited for his command.</p><br/><p>\u201cStart!\u201d</p><br/><p>I began to run down as fast as I could. Deep down, I was glad that Suyang wanted to find out how fast it would take to run down the stairs instead of up\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as I get down as fast as I can, it\u2019s okay, right? I don\u2019t have to run\u2026\u201d I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy literal meaning!\u201d I smiled and began to slide down from the handrail. Back when I was in Primary School, it was very common amongst children. Who would\u2019ve thought that it would come of use in the future?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich floor are you on?\u201d Suyang asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no idea\u2026 I wasn\u2019t counting!\u201d I casually responded and continued my method. It saved me a lot of energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Yixin.\u201d Suddenly, I vaguely heard someone whispering my name.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

This guy\u2026.was afraid of ghosts? The corner of my mouth curved into a sinister smile. I evilly gazed at Suyang and vowed that I must make him lose his mind before I quit.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, do you believe in ghosts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are no such thing as ghosts!\u201d Suyang straightened his chest and spoke in his clear, shaky voice. But it didn\u2019t seem like he was saying it to me. It sounded like he was trying to self-hypnotize himself.</p><br/><p>Now that I was certain Suyang was afraid of ghosts, I slowly got up from the couch and swayed my way to his side. I adopted a frightening expression and whispered, \u201cGhosts\u2026.are things that you cannot see! Perhaps, there is one hanging by your living room window right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>I calmly lifted my hand and pointed towards the living room window that had no ghost.</p><br/><p>Suyang followed the direction of my finger and stared. I clearly noticed his pupils widening.</p><br/><p>\u201cAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d Seeing him like this, I couldn\u2019t help but burst out into laughter. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re scared of ghosts!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang solemnly looked at me, \u201cWho said I\u2019m afraid of ghosts? I already told you. There are no such things as ghosts in this world! Why would I be afraid of something that doesn\u2019t exist?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes yes yes. There are no ghosts in this world. No need to worry\u2026\u201d I patted Suyang\u2019s back in a comforting manner.</p><br/><p>If I were honest and told him that his apartment was already the home of many ghosts, he would probably be scared shitless. In addition, I was afraid he would kick me out. So after scaring him a bit, I hopped back to my room.</p><br/><p>I stared at my bedroom window for a long time. There wasn\u2019t a ghost in the living room, but there was one in my room.</p><br/><p>After I was certain I had locked the doors, I moved my chair over and sat by the window to observe the mistress.</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, tell me what\u2019s the point of being a ghost? You can\u2019t carry weight on your shoulders. You can\u2019t raise your hands to strike. You can\u2019t even touch a person you want to touch. What\u2019s the point of staying in this world? Why don\u2019t you leave? Is there something you miss too much and want to hold on too?\u201d? Suddenly, I asked the mistress all the questions that had been going through my mind after all these years.</p><br/><p>Her lifeless pupils became alert, and the mistress fixedly glared at me like she wanted to say something. However, since she opened her eyes too wide, bright red blood was spilling out from the rim of her eyes.</p><br/><p>By now, I was accustomed to seeing fierce-looking ghosts, so it didn\u2019t affect me much anymore. \u201cAre you crying? See? As a ghost, you can\u2019t even speak and express yourself. I can\u2019t guess what you\u2019re trying to say\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing my words, her pupils became lifeless again. She vented, and now she had to suppress her thoughts again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard from Grandmother Meng that ghosts stay in this world due to resentment. Something about their so-called aura makes it impossible for them to leave. Could this be you too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know your spirit has not dispersed because you were shoved off the balcony. But you chose to be the home-wrecker first! Plus, the woman who caused your death had been seized and locked up already. I feel like you shouldn\u2019t continue to hold to a grudge but release instead\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Somehow, my topic changed to persuading the mistress to accept her fate and free herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think my words are true?\u201d I tested.</p><br/><p>The next second, the mistress disappeared.</p><br/><p>Huh? My words were effective?</p><br/><p>I stood up and opened the window as I lightly poked out my head and looked to my left and right. The mistress was gone. This was the first time she had left my apartment window. It was honestly a good thing, but I was a bit worried. Where did she go?</p><br/><p>Was she gone forever?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d Was this what mothers feel when they urge their kids to go to school? Yet, when they finally do go, there is a sense of loss?</p><br/><p>While I was searching for the mistress all over my room, a document was trying to slid its way through my door crack.</p><br/><p>I went over and yanked open the door to catch the crouching Suyang clumsily trying to push the document through.</p><br/><p>He lifted his head and blinked his deep huge eyes at me as he stood up. Rather than trying to stuff the document through my door crack, he thrusted it into my arms instead.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d I grabbed hold of it. I had a bad premonition the moment I saw the A4 paper document.</p><br/><p><i>Employee Contract</i>.</p><br/><p>I was flabbergasted when I saw these two words on the first row.</p><br/><p>Was he specialized in manufacturing contracts?</p><br/><p>I was too lazy to guess and directly asked Suyang, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmployee Contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can read the words. I\u2019m asking you why you\u2019re giving an employee contract to me. Are you sure if it\u2019s for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter much consideration, I have realized you are very useful in helping me gain inspiration for my creation. So, I would like to hire you as an assistant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou. Want. Me. To. Be. Your. Assistant? Don\u2019t joke around with other people\u2019s occupation. It is not funny.\u201d There was a lack of faith and distrust in all my words.</p><br/><p>Suyang ignored my skepticism and continued, \u201cYou don\u2019t have a job right now, and I need an assistant. This is a win-win for both of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know why Suyang was so determined to have me as his assistant, but I wasn\u2019t going to give up on such a good opportunity. However, I pretended to hesitate because I wanted to remain reserved. \u201cHmmm\u2026Let me think about it. After all\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to know the specifics, your monthly wage would be 10000 rmb. Meals and accommodations are provided.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay! I\u2019ll do it!\u201d The moment I heard how much he was willing to paying me, I no longer cared to remain reserved.</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t explained the contract yet\u2026\u201d Suyang appeared stunned by my reaction. He didn\u2019t seem to realize how alluring the salary was.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. In any case, I\u2019m sure it is clearly stated in the contract. I\u2019ll slowly go through it later. Where do I sign? Last page, right?\u201d I was worried Suyang will renege his offer, so I quickly grabbed a pen. Just as I was about to sign my name on it, Suyang stopped me.</p><br/><p>Did he regret already? I was startled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to read this before signing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m very talented and capable of many things. Whatever you want me to do wouldn\u2019t be much of an obstacle for me.\u201d Then, I elbowed Suyang and swiftly signed my name and urged him as well.</p><br/><p>Suyang casually signed his name on the contract as he sighed at me. \u201cConsidering how you didn\u2019t seriously go through the contract, I feel like it is necessary for me to tell you as my assistant, your most important job is to guide me to the correct state of mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuide you into a state of mind\u2026what do you mean?\u201d This is the first time I heard of such a role.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember the first time we met? Do you remember what Shen Shaoqian and I were doing? Something like that. In order to create impactful writing, I need to personally live the character\u2019s life. I need to be in his exact mood in order to write vividly.\u201d</p><br/><p>I somewhat understood as I nodded, \u201cSo I have to act? I have to act whatever role you want me to act?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang nodded. He seemed proud of my understanding, \u201cYes. Acting. I also need it to be realistic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk. Acting is no problem. When I was young, I often lied. So now, I\u2019m very experienced at pretending.\u201d I effortlessly boasted. Suddenly, Suyang got very close to me and forced me to back up against the wall.</p><br/><p>He bent his waist, and there was only the distance of a fist between our faces. Although he looked very sloppy at the moment, it couldn\u2019t conceal his natural beauty.</p><br/><p>I pulled back my neck and was at my wits\u2019 end.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang\u2019s eyes twinkled like stars as he pursed his mouth and smiled gracefully. He slowly spoke, \u201cMy next creation is related to love.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

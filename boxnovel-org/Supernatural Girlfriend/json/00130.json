I had no idea that things would progress so quickly. Last night, I was still playing around with Suyang. Less than 24 hours had gone by, but I was about to part with him permanently.</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t concerned about Suyang\u2019s safety. Anson did all this because he really loved him. <i>He probably loves him even more than I do? </i>I was satisfied as long as he was safe and happy.</p><br/><p>It was rather strange.<i> When did I become so sacrificial? In the past, I was never a high-level thinker? I was unwilling to let go especially when it came to Suyang. If anything, I wanted to stick to him for the rest of my life. Yet, I was so at peace with letting go now</i>\u2026.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, I recalled the photoshoot scene in Japan. Anson must have purposely played that song when the curtain dropped. It was probably an advanced farewell notice; I just didn\u2019t realize it.</p><br/><p>Loneliness surrounded me as I sat on the bench and hummed the song. \u201cLala\u2026.lala\u2026.humhum\u2026.\u201d I forgot the tune and the lyrics. I was just randomly making up tunes.</p><br/><p>Beside me, I could hear a couple\u2019s interaction. \u201cBabe, look! It\u2019s snowing outside!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so odd about that? It\u2019s almost Winter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. But tonight, the snow looks better than usual. Let\u2019s go out so you can help me take some pics!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026. the plane is going to leave soon.\u201d The guy did not want to get up from his seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe still have more than an hour before departure! There\u2019s enough time. Come on!\u201d The girlfriend whined.</p><br/><p>The boyfriend shook his head. He looked very unwilling. His expression read \u201cDamn this snow! Why must it snow tonight out of all days? What if the flight is delayed because of it?!\u201d</p><br/><p>His girlfriend forcefully dragged him and they both left the airport. I also couldn\u2019t hold it in and decided to take some pictures of the snowy scenery as a souvenir to look back upon.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a huge snowfall, but it wasn\u2019t weak either. It kind of reminded me of the springtime when cotton wadding would be blowing in the air.</p><br/><p>I watched the heavy traffic of the airport entrance. There were so many people walking in and out. It was actually quite depressing. It wasn\u2019t until I was about to leave that I realized how sad an airport was. Each day, it had to witness so many farewells\u2026</p><br/><p>On this snowy night, the weather was low. I blew into my frozen hands as I tried to warm them up.</p><br/><p>The couple from earlier were nearby making memories. I also wanted to participate so I took out my cell phone and began to snap countless of shots.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat guy is so hot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh Heavens! I found a stud\u2026.!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe way he holds the camera is so manly! Wah!\u201d</p><br/><p>I could hear many ladies praising me. <i>Was this the first time I\u2019ve ever heard people praise me on my looks? Too bad it wasn\u2019t my actual face.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, could you take a picture with me?\u201d A girl shyly came up to me.</p><br/><p>The girl was quite young. <i>Wow. These days, girls are so bold! How could I be cruel enough to reject? </i></p><br/><p>Since my arm was longer, I directly took her cell phone and took a selfie with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHot guy, let\u2019s turn this angle!\u201d The young girl suggested. \u201cLet\u2019s not use the airport as the background. The snowy scenery is much better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d I made an 180 degree turn and now I was facing the airport while the background was the snow.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will press it on the count of three. One\u2026two\u2026\u201d While I was about to take the picture, I noticed a tall and blurry figure heading towards us. The person\u2019s facial features looked very familiar. He was walking at a very quick pace.</p><br/><p>\u201cThree!\u201d Just as I was about to press the button, a strong force pulled me away. I turned but before I could react, the person with the same height as mines pressed his lips against mines.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!!!!!\u201d The young lady yelped.</p><br/><p>\u201cY- you\u2026! You!\u201d My eyes were wide and I was in shock. <i>What the heck was going on?</i></p><br/><p>When Suyang kissed me, I felt as if my soul nearly flew out of my body.</p><br/><p>The man that was wearing the slim-fit windbreaker was the love of my life. Right now, he had his hands in his pockets as he observed me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think you could secretly leave me like this? You think I wouldn\u2019t figure it out?\u201d Suyang put his arm around my waist and pulled me closer.</p><br/><p>The girls around me began to shriek!</p><br/><p>Then, there was a moment of silence and the applause began.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two are so compatible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations! I wish you two all the best!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope you guys will live happily forever after!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, they all left as they discussed amongst each other.</p><br/><p><i>As expected, this was a fujoshi society! When I was Lin Yixin, no one ever told me I was compatible with Suyang. But now that I am Anson\u2026. No! I\u2019m not going to think of that now!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what you are doing?\u201d <em>I was the same height as Suyang now. It felt really weird to meet him eye to eye.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cI know. I was confirming whether you\u2019re the person I think you are.\u201d Suyang kindly smiled, \u201cNo matter what you turn into, I will recognize you.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Suyang\u2019s words</i>\u2026.</p><br/><p>I pushed him away, but my face was already all red, \u201cI\u2019m a man. Who would\u2019ve thought that the famous author Su is a GAY? What a pity. I\u2019m not!\u201d</p><br/><p>Logically speaking, Suyang shouldn\u2019t have recognized me. I never said or hinted a thing. In my opinion, I didn\u2019t do anything to give it away.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember what I said at the television station? I said if you\u2019re fat, I would like fat. If you\u2019re skinny, I would like skinny. If you\u2019re tall, I would like tall. If you\u2019re short, I would like short.\u201d Suyang placed his two hands on my shoulders and made me face him. \u201cBut I never thought you would make it so hard for me and become a man.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang lowered his head and chuckled. Then, he held my hand and said, \u201cI guess I can only like a man now.\u201d</p><br/><p>His hand was so warm. He made it hard for me to pull away. \u201cYou have the wrong person.\u201d <i>I had to lie. If I admitted I was Yixin, Suyang will definitely not allow me to leave. If I don\u2019t leave, how could I save Grandmother Meng?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cIf I recognized the wrong person, then why is your face so red? Your blush confirms that you\u2019re the person I\u2019m searching for.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cB-bullshit! If you were randomly kissed by someone of the same sex, would you not turn red?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t turn red!\u201d Suyang responded confidently. <i>As expected, he was the overlord of thick skin</i>\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m not the person you are trying to find. I have to go catch a flight. Bye!\u201d I shoved Suyang and turned to head back to the airport.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Suyang grabbed onto my hand again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d I was pretending to be furious but I saw his depressed face. He looked like a child who did something bad and was asking me not to abandon him.</p><br/><p>Suyang hauled me around. His voice was much lighter than before, \u201cYou are really leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t voluntarily become like this. But you still want to leave despite the fact I recognize you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019ve already decided early on\u2026\u201d I avoided Suyang\u2019s eyes; I was scared to get burn. I didn\u2019t want additional chains to my feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that your final answer? Is that the answer you decided on after a night?\u201d Suyang sounded like he was trying to suppress his anger. His breathing was erratic.</p><br/><p>I decided to be truthful with Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, Grandmother Meng is under Lin Yixin\u2019s hands. I made a deal with her. After confirming my departure, she will release Grandmother Meng. So I have to go, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re leaving because of granny\u2026 it doesn\u2019t have to do with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPartly. To be honest, I already decided to leave you yesterday. Grandmother Meng is correct. If you stay by my side, bad things will happen to you. I don\u2019t have the ability to protect you. So by leaving, it is for everyone\u2019s benefit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I just an item to you? I don\u2019t have a choice to decide on anything? You were planning to give me to someone else without my consent. At least tell me the truth so we could face it together! If I hadn\u2019t sensed it was you, you would have made me into a fool my whole life!\u201d Suyang roared.</p><br/><p>\u201cSadly, you\u2019re not a fool. If so, you would be much happier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Yixin!\u201d Suyang grabbed onto my collar and yelled, \u201cWhat gives you the right to determine my happiness? I guess you don\u2019t know me after all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Suyang released me. Deep down, I assumed he must hate me to death by now.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, we\u2019re done talking. I\u2019m going to board now.\u201d I couldn\u2019t bare to look at his face again. I lowered my head and turned my back against him as I walked away with difficulty.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnson! Anson! Ah! No! Lin Yixin! Stay right there! Don\u2019t go!\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt like Xialing was calling me. She should be back from buying the items now. I didn\u2019t dare to turn around, so I slowed down and waited for her to catch up to me.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, Xialing ran over and grabbed my hand. She was out of breath, \u201cYou can\u2019t go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just received Yuxiang\u2019s call. Anson never had any intentions of letting Grandmother Meng go. H-he\u2019s lying to you!\u201d Xialing had her hands around her waist; panting. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you positive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! I just got off the phone with Yuxiang. She told me directly. Aiya! There is no time to explain now. We must get in the car and hurry!\u201d Xialing dragged me with her.</p><br/><p>Along the way, she noticed the stunned Suyang. She glanced at him, \u201cOh! Isn\u2019t it Suyang brother?! Let\u2019s go! I have something to discuss with you too!\u201d</p><br/><p>So Suyang and I were stuffed in the car while we were both somewhat confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, so why is Anson backing out on the deal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the specifics. But that\u2019s the truth. So we need to figure out how to save Grandmother Meng now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know where my granny is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But I know who does.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYuxiang!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I stared at Suyang. \u201cWhy would you come?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you overreacting? I\u2019m fired anyways. There\u2019s nothing for me to do in City A. Why can\u2019t I go to your city and see how you\u2019ve been living? Unless you have some secrets you don\u2019t want me to know about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop stop stop! You\u2019re creating scenarios in your head! I\u2019m just surprised. So are thinking of becoming an author again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I want to find inspiration, going to your city is the best way. When your location changes, your mood naturally changes. Anyway, book me a ticket as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so stubborn\u2026.\u201d I muttered with resentment. Nonetheless, I included Suyang on the flight.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>So, on a bright sunny day in April, Suyang and I flew to City B together. The moment the flight landed, I received Xialing\u2019s pressuring call. \u201cHave you arrived? Where are you now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm. I just landed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want Zhou Zhen to pick you up? He\u2019s around the airport area right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s fine. Suyang and I came back together. We\u2019re going to take a taxi. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! Suyang is back too!?!\u201d Xialing screeched so loud that she nearly shattered my ear drums. \u201cW-why is he back? What is he doing here? Why didn\u2019t you tell me in advance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you reacting so dramatically? He\u2019s just here to take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Got it! Return to the firm first.\u201d Xialing rushed to hang up. I listened to the disconnected beeping sound and blinked. Then, I turned to Suyang. \u201cHave you offended Xialing before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of strange. I feel like the punk quite dislikes you. Anyhow, just be prepared. We\u2019re heading to the firm first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang disregarded my warning. \u201cShe\u2019s a punk. What could she do to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what we thought. However, when we arrived at the firm, Suyang and I were astonished by the bright red banner that was hanging by the door. On it were the words: <i>Ghost and Suyang are not allowed in.</i></p><br/><p><i>Wow\u2026 how awkward</i>\u2026.</p><br/><p>I gazed at Suyang. Contrary to me, he was much more relaxed. It was like he wasn\u2019t affected at all. He totally ignored it and casually asked, \u201cIs this your firm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm..yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad! Let\u2019s go in.\u201d Suyang grabbed my hand and walked in like it was his own office.</p><br/><p><i>I wonder why Xialing has such a deep hatred towards Suyang. She actually created this banner within the hour that it took us to get here. This is the first time she has ever been so efficient. Normally, it would take her half an hour just to get me a cup of water\u2026.. What happened between them? I was quite curious.</i></p><br/><p>The moment I pushed open the door, I saw Xialing standing there with her arms crossed. She puffed out her face like a bun as she pointed at Suyang. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to visit my girlfriend\u2019s workplace environment.\u201d Suyang ignored Xialing\u2019s hostility and calmly replied.</p><br/><p>I was turning red because Suyang was holding onto me in front of all my staff members. It was a bit embarrassing and it felt unnatural to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYixin sister\u2019s boyfriend?\u201d Jia Wenwen and Zhou Zhen seemed to sense the scent of gossip as they pounced over. \u201cAre you really Sister Yixin\u2019s boyfriend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Immediately, Suyang was surrounded by those two and I was pushed aside.</p><br/><p>I went over to Xialing and nudged her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Why are you so moody for? Are you that mad Suyang is here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Xialing still looked pissed. \u201cWhy did you bring him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang said he wants to take a look at where I work, so I brought him here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo if he said he wants to leave, are you going to leave with him too? Yixin, be honest with me. Are you planning to leave with Suyang and move to City A forever?!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Oh that silly girl. So that was what she was worried about.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will remain in City B. This is where I work. You guys are here as well. I won\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what will happen to you and Suyang? One of you will have to leave your city to accommodate the other person, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xialing brought up a very good point that I\u2019ve been neglecting. My heart thudded but I didn\u2019t make it obvious. During dinner, we ate together as a group. The whole time, Jia Wenwen kept taking selfies with Suyang. Zhou Zhen was using his hunting dog traits as he tried to piece up my story with Suyang from the very beginning.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve never seen them so proactive. Usually, Zhou Zhen wouldn\u2019t even ask about my own birthday.</p><br/><p>After the hearty meal, Suyang and I walked home together. We were walking on a path where cherry blossoms were blooming from both sides. When the wind blew, the petals would gently fall down. It made the atmosphere very romantic.</p><br/><p>On the way, I asked Suyang the question Xialing had asked me earlier. \u201cUmm.. are we going to continue with a long distance relationship?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs in, you remain in City A while I remain in City B? Is that really ok?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang smiled and held onto me. \u201cI thought it was another question\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t smile! This is a serious question! What do you think\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026. I am going to deal with this issue right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before I could process what Suyang was saying, he took out his cell phone and made a call. \u201cHey, Shaoqian. It\u2019s me. I want you to help me with something. Clear out my stuff and rent out my apartment. I\u2019m in another city now. I won\u2019t be returning. Yes. You can clear out the stuff tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t believe what Suyang was doing. Even after he hung up, I was still in disbelief. By the time I snapped out of it, Suyang was already ahead of me by quite a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Solving the problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? No, how could you rent out your apartment so easily? What are you going to do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to live with you! I\u2019m an author, so I can work anywhere. From now on, I\u2019m just going to rely on you and stay at your place. Be prepared!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026..\u201d <i>The issue that caused me stress for the entire afternoon was solved by a 30 second phone call?</i></p><br/><p>Suyang suddenly grabbed my hand and put it in his pocket. \u201cWow. Why is it so cool on an April night? Aren\u2019t you cold?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!?\u201d While I was replying, Suyang seemed to be fidgeting with my hand. It felt weird. I forcefully pulled it out from his pocket and noticed there was a dazzling ring on my finger.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck? Don\u2019t you know you can\u2019t just put any ring on the ring finger?\u201d I tried to pull the ring out, but it seemed to be stuck.</p><br/><p>I was not pleased. \u201cAre you trying to propose right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should give up. I purposely got a size smaller! Hahaha!\u201d Suyang proudly showed off his ring on his finger as well. He hugged my reluctant body. \u201cThanks for accepting my proposal! If you want to take the ring off, go lose some weight first!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did you buy the ring?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t buy it. It\u2019s been handed down from generation to generation.\u201d</p><br/><p>I broke out of Suyang\u2019s grasp and began to punch him. \u201cYou have no candles, no champagne, no flowers, no sweet words\u2026 and you proposed? Who would accept this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang covered his mouth with his fist. \u201c*cough cough* Please understand that I\u2019m shy. Plus\u2026 if you want flowers, there\u2019s a whole bunch here!\u201d Suyang lifted his hand and caught a bunch of cherry blossom petals and displayed it in front of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho wants this?\u201d I heartlessly blew the petals away. \u201cAren\u2019t you usually very good at saying mushy stuff? Why are you so shy today? What kind of person proposes so sloppily?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou may be complaining with your mouth, but you haven\u2019t rejected me!\u201d Suyang saw through me and cunningly smiled. \u201cIf you really want to hear sweet words, then I\u2019ll purposely tell you a bunch tonight\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Based on his pervy expression, I knew he was thinking dirty again, I covered my ears. \u201cI\u2019m not listening! I\u2019m not listening!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cC\u2019mon! How about I tell you now then?\u201d Suyang began to pester me from behind. \u201cWhat do you like to hear? Do you want me to tell you how cute you are? Or how sexy? Or how much I love you? Or perhaps, we should take turns. Each of us say one loving line back and forth. I think that\u2019s fair.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya! I said I\u2019m not listening!! Shhh! Don\u2019t say anything!\u201d I covered my ears. Although I sounded annoyed, deep down, my heart was beaming like a flower. However, I didn\u2019t want to let Suyang see, so I began to run wildly ahead of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen listen listen!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI love you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShhhh! We\u2019re on the streets\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI love Lin Yixin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!!! Other people are watching!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang loves Lin Yixin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI got it. Let\u2019s go home!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey\u2026stop running! How could your short legs run so fast\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The End</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>Thank you so much for reading until the very end!!

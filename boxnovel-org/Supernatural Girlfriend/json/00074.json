I guess I\u2019m not really awake yet. My head still feels sleepy\u2026 I\u2019m going to sleep a bit more\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuit pretending. It\u2019s no use.\u201d Suyang pinched my waist, \u201cIf you\u2019re honest, I\u2019ll be lenient. If you resist, the consequences will be severe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026 since this was a task that you assigned me, I wanted to be precise and put some effort in it. So, I was talking to those aquarium people for quite some time to find out more about the fishes.\u201d I felt guilty as I avoided Suyang\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>There was no response. After a moment, I carefully took a peek. <i>Ah! We made eye contact! Do I seem extremely guilty right now? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious to know what you have been discussing with the aquarium people?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already written down all the information in the powerpoint. Boss, you took a look yourself. Good night!\u201d I leaped up from the couch and wanted to escape. But Suyang grabbed hold of my collar.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou saw Mi Fan today, didn\u2019t you? And then you followed her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were spying on me?\u201d <i>How did Suyang knew what I was doing? Earlier, when I had called him, he was clearly still sleeping!</i></p><br/><p>Suyang coldly laughed, \u201cWhy would I be bored enough to spy on you? I know Mi Fan went to the aquarium for work purposes today, so I made a guess. And it looks like I guessed correctly\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Damn it! I shouldn\u2019t have admitted so soon! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if I was following Mi Fan? That\u2019s none of your business. I finished the mission you assigned me. I did not neglect my work!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t give up so easily. When are you going to listen to me?\u201d <i>Suyang wasn\u2019t as angry as I thought he would be. Could it be\u2026..</i></p><br/><p>\u201cBoss! Guess who I saw after I followed Mi Fan?\u201d I decided to share my findings with Suyang, and then I\u2019ll try to convince him to team up with me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Rui! He\u2019s the director of the luxurious Jingrui hotel! The son of Chairman Jicheng!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you see him?\u201d</p><br/><p>I rummaged through my memories. Actually, it was purely an accident that I had encountered Director Rui. But the moment I recall him taking advantage of me, I was furious.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not important. What\u2019s important is that I know some stuff. Do you want me to tell you?\u201d I raised my eyebrows at Suyang to evoke his curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d Based on Suyang\u2019s hesitant expression, he didn\u2019t seem to trust me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you agree to team up with me, I\u2019ll tell you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam up?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to share my findings with you for nothing. Plus, we\u2019re both investigating Mi Fan for Lu Zhengyang, right? Since we have the same goal, we might as well work together to combat evil! What do you think?\u201d I clasped my hands together and made a praying gesture.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho told you I\u2019m getting close to Mi Fan for Lu Zhengyang?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>What?!</i> My voice raised an octave, \u201cDo you actually like Mi Fan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing this because Shen Shaoqian has been begging me. He said he cannot let his 50k go to waste\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>I sighed a breath of relief. Suyang almost scared me to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, our ultimate goal is the same, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did you become so enthusiastic and determined? Usually, you\u2019re always trying to slack off. Yet, you\u2019re so proactive with something like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m naturally a kind person. If I notice injustice, I will stand up to it when necessary!\u201d I placed my hand on my chin and pretended to look righteous as I innocently blinked at Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. Forget it. Even though I don\u2019t want you to take part, you\u2019re still taking part. If you\u2019re going to put yourself in danger, you might as well be with me -at least I might be able to protect you.\u201d Suyang finally gave in and looked helpless.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re agreeing to team up with me?! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!\u201d I yelped happily and spun a circle. I was acting cocky in front of Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuit moving around and tell me what your findings are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, I accidentally overheard Director Rui and Mi Fan\u2019s conversation. I found out that Mi Fan has been helping the Chairman\u2019s family all along. Mi Fan is the one who has been hiding all the news that are unfavourable to the Jingrui corporation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? Can you tell me something I don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>What? Suyang was looking down at me? </i></p><br/><p>I cleared my throat. Suddenly, I felt like I wasn\u2019t doing this to reveal the truth, but to gain Suyang\u2019s approval. \u201cThe report that Mi Fan made previously on Lu Wenxue was to conceal the true murderer of the case. Chairman Jicheng is the murderer\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m suspecting that the actual murderer is Chairman Jicheng!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you get this information from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026..\u201d<i> I can\u2019t tell him that Lu Wenxue was the one who told me, right?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Also, I heard that initially Chairman Jicheng was going to provide financial aid to Lu Wenxue\u2019s school. But afterwards, Lu Wenxue found out about the chairman\u2019s ulterior motives and kicked him out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also found out some info about Chairman Jicheng. If your guess is correct, then the chairman must\u2019ve ordered Mi Fan to push the crime onto Lu Wenxue and made him as a scapegoat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t understand why they had to put the charges on Lu Wenxue? Even if Chairman Jicheng was the real murderer, based on his influence and power, he could\u2019ve easily suppressed all the news. Why must he purposely make this into such a big deal to shift the blame on Lu Wenxue?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the murderer is really the chairman, then this is the first person he must get rid of. Since Lu Wenxue believed it was him, he must destroy him before any evidence can be discovered. Perhaps this was his plan all along. Maybe he has a grudge against him, and this was the best way to eliminate his enemy\u2026.\u201d Suyang analyzed. Then, he went to his room to grab a pile of material and handed it to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d I took the pile from him as I glanced at the first page. There was a photo of Lu Wenxue\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d; Chairman Jicheng\u2019s subordinate.</p><br/><p>I continued to flip through the pile and saw the photos of the victim\u2019s parents, Mi Fan, Lu Zhengyang, and some other people I did not recognize.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d As I flipped through the pile, I praised, \u201cNot bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is what I have researched for the past few days. They\u2019re all the people who are related or associated with this case.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang specifically introduced each person to me. \u201cThis is Lu Wenxue\u2019s ex classmate; Chairman Jicheng\u2019s subordinate. Ever since the Lu Wenxue incident, he has been demoted. This guy is probably the one who introduced Chairman Jicheng to Lu Wenxue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I wasn\u2019t sure how Suyang got hold of these photos, I felt like we were both on the right track and around the same level. I was quite impressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are the victim\u2019s parents. It\u2019s quite obvious that Lu Wenxue didn\u2019t touch their child, but the parents stuck to their statements that Lu Wenxue had previously harassed their child. If what you say is true, then Chairman Jicheng must have bribed them to give a false testimony.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re the child\u2019s biological parents!? How could they do something like that to their child?!\u201d <i>How could parents be so cruel??</i> I was very skeptical with what Suyang said, \u201cAfter all, a cruel tiger will not devour its cubs. Even if the parents are obsessed with money, they wouldn\u2019t compromised the death of their child, right? Perhaps they\u2019ve been deceived.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too naive. According to the report, there was a cloth fragment by the victim\u2019s body. But during the autopsy, there was no fiber found within the child\u2019s fingertips. This meant that the child probably didn\u2019t pull the fabric off. Instead, someone purposely placed it there. But the police overlooked it and directly convicted Lu Wenxue based on the parents\u2019 testimony.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

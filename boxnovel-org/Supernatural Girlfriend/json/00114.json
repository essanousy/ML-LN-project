Today is the final deadline. You can\u2019t remain here any longer. Suyang and I will think of something. Wait here while I contact him.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>In the end, I was the one who gave in. I couldn\u2019t bear to let her go like this.</i></p><br/><p>While I was about to dial Suyang\u2019s number, someone knocked on the door.</p><br/><p><i>Speak of the devil. I mentioned him and he was back.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cCome in and let\u2019s discuss\u2026\u201d After opening the door, I didn\u2019t turn to see who it was. But when I noticed Gao Jialan\u2019s white face, I whipped my head back.</p><br/><p>It was Wen Yihan.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday is the final deadline. I came to pay a visit.\u201d Wen Yihan smiled. There was a killer aura in the air.</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan dropped the luggage on the floor. Wen Yihan crooked his head and solemnly stated, \u201cIt looks like I came at the right time. Or else, you would\u2019ve ran away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Wen Yihan stared at me with disappointment. \u201cI guess you\u2019re not on my side after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet Gao Jialan to make her own choices\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one week deadline is over. You\u2019ve chosen to help her, so you can\u2019t bargain with me.\u201d Wen Yihan\u2019s face darkened and he waved his hand in the air. Then, two bodyguards came out from behind him and grabbed hold of Gao Jialan left and right. They were going to forcefully take her away.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this! This is kidnapping!\u201d <i>As a weak woman, how could I prevent these two tall beefy men from taking her away?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cKidnapping? This isn\u2019t the first time. What is there to be afraid of?\u201d Wen Yihan coldy laughed. \u201cThanks for taking care of her for a week. Now, I will take over from here.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>How could I hand her over to you when you have such a dark and scary expression?</i> Deep down, my heart trembled. Since I couldn\u2019t stop them, I followed them down the elevator.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you following us?\u201d Wen Yihan gave me a look of disdain.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to take her away by force, I will seriously call the cops!\u201d I threatened as I took out my cell phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cUp to you. I still have other things to deal with at the company. I don\u2019t have time to waste on you.\u201d Wen Yihan was about to get in the car, but I blocked him.</p><br/><p>Then, I found an opportunity to drill myself inside as I shamelessly stated, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to go, bring me along as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wen Yihan didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. He waved his hand in the air and his subordinates understood. They opened the door and forcefully dragged me out. They definitely didn\u2019t know how to treat the fairer sex as I ended up falling harshly on my bum.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! You guys can\u2019t take her away!\u201d I grabbed hold of the car door and screamed.</p><br/><p>Just as I thought all hope was lost, from a distance, a luxurious car was arrogantly heading towards us. It stopped right in front of Wen Yihan\u2019s group of cars; preventing them from departing.</p><br/><p>I was still holding onto the door. For some reason, I had a feeling the luxurious car was good news.</p><br/><p>The driver\u2019s seat opened, and Suyang came out.</p><br/><p><i>What? When did Suyang buy a new car?</i></p><br/><p>While we were all looking shocked, Suyang ran over to the other side and opened the passenger door for someone else.</p><br/><p>An old man came out of the car. Although he looked very old, from the way he carried himself, it was clear that he was no regular citizen.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather\u2026\u201d Wen Yihan was stunned as he bowed respectfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you sitting on the ground? Get up!\u201d Suyang ran over to help me up and then introduced the person to me. \u201cThis is the chairman of the Wen clan. Chairman Wen Yuan.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>I couldn\u2019t believe Suyang managed to find this Wen Yuan guy? Could he have predicted my chat with Gao Jialan?</i></p><br/><p>I instantly gave Suyang a look of admiration.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Chairman\u2026.\u201d I whispered. <em>Every time I see dignified rich people, I always feel very inferior. My aura would turn weak.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cI heard from this young fellow that my grandson\u2019s wife is pregnant? He is part of the Wen clan, so I came to take a look. What is going on, Yihan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather\u2026.\u201d Wen Yihan was speechless. Now, it looked as if Gao Jialan and her child could be saved.</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan was taken by Wen Yuan. Before they left, I saw Wen Yufan following them as well. In the end, his wish didn\u2019t come true\u2026. But since he loves Gao Jialan, he probably respects her decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you use this move on me?\u201d Wen Yihan angrily gripped on my collar. There was fire burning in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Suyang seized Wen Yihan\u2019s arm and warned him. \u201cLet go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said, let go.\u201d Suyang repeated one more time. Then, he pulled Wen Yihan\u2019s hand off me and punched him without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d I didn\u2019t expect Suyang to hit anyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you now. Even though you told my father, Gao Jialan\u2019s child cannot stay in this world.\u201d Wen Yihan bitterly snapped. He had his hand on his injured face as he furiously glared at Suyang and me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you say to us anymore. You will have to convince the chairman.\u201d I hid behind Suyang as I countered. <em>It was great when you have a boyfriend to protect you.</em></p><br/><p>Wen Yihan resentfully left without saying another word.</p><br/><p>After Wen Yihan left, I felt a breath of relief. I patted Suyang\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHow did you know to bring the chairman here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI happened to bump into him while fishing\u2026.so we chatted for a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFishing?? Seriously? Such a coincidence?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang knocked me on the head. \u201cOf course not. It is much more complicated than your goldfish brain. I just thought more like a man. I wanted to turn a big problem into a smaller problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>I had to clap. \u201cYou\u2019re too amazing! But what if I had decided to support Wen Yihan instead? If you had invited the chairman, wouldn\u2019t it have messed everything up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I know you well. I know you want Gao Jialan to abort the child but ultimately, you would feel too guilty. If Gao Jialan really needed your help, you would still help her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like you saw right through me. It feels kind of strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, I sniffed and scrunched up my nose. \u201cWhat\u2019s that smell on you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat smell?\u201d Suyang also began to sniff. \u201cMaybe a fishy smell? I told you, I went fishing today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFishy smell?! Ewww\u2026 go and shower!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so disgusted? You\u2019re a goldfish\u2026 yet you\u2019re afraid of a fishy smell?\u201d Suyang teased.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like that, we bickered back and forth and went home. I wasn\u2019t sure what happened with Wen Yihan and Gao Jialan, but they were no longer in my life.</p><br/><p>Although I had a lonely past, now, I could smile and let go. The reason was because I\u2019ve found this man\u2026.a man who would always pretended to avoid me, but would only smile at me.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

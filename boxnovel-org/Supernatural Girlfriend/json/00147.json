Yao Youfan was granny\u2019s client. So it\u2019s true that I entered the company with her assistance. Alright? But that\u2019s it for our relationship. I don\u2019t know anything about her and Xu Chuqiao\u2019s family issues.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how about based on your interactions together? What type of person do you think she is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what type of person she is? Aren\u2019t you here on commission? How could you not know anything and ask me instead?\u201d Suyang was starting to question my work abilities.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame me! Who would\u2019ve thought I would encounter you on my first day of work! I freaked out so much, I didn\u2019t do any investigation! Instead, I came running to find you today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Now that you mention it, I\u2019m feeling a little touched\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act so smug! If it weren\u2019t for what happened last night, I wouldn\u2019t have wavered.\u201d I said with thick skin.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what are we going to do? You\u2019re sent by Xu Chuqiao. On the outside, I\u2019m on Yao Youfan\u2019s side. Doesn\u2019t this mean we\u2019re against each other?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally, if I could see Chairman Xu\u2019s ghost, I would be able to figure out the truth. But I think he has already reincarnated. I haven\u2019t sensed or seen his presence at all. Can you give me an opportunity to see Yao Youfan? Ideally, it would be best if I can spend some time with her one on one\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to granny, you went to learn spiritual techniques. How did that go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUse your imagination. Guess!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you keep telling me to guess?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho told you to be so intelligent? It\u2019s not my fault!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot guessing. I could tell you\u2019ve learnt well.\u201d</p><br/><p>I grinned, \u201cYou have sharp eyes. I\u2019m no longer the Lin Yixin from the past!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, if you want to see Yao Youfan, there\u2019s a company event happening in a few days. All the people with high authorities will be there along with everyone else. On that day, I\u2019ll help create an opportunity for you to spend some alone time with Yao Youfan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?!\u201d I was surprised, \u201cAs long as I can have some alone time with Yao Youfan, I\u2019ll be able to figure out what happened to her. I\u2019ll know everything and finish half my job! But how are you going to let me see her one on one? There will probably be a lot of people that day\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. A wise man always has his ways.\u201d Suyang declared.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang, after Xu Chuqiao and Yao Youfan\u2019s case is over, bring me to see Grandmother Meng. I want to pay her a visit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm. Ok.\u201d Suyang nodded solemnly. But a second later, there was an unknown object grabbing my chest.</p><br/><p>My face turned black and I glared at Suyang, \u201cMove your hand away!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI helped you with such a big task! Shouldn\u2019t I receive some sort of reward?\u201d Suyang had a crafty smile on his face, \u201cI guess you still haven\u2019t figured it out. Never try to tease a man in bed\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t\u2026.\u201d Before I could finish my sentence, Suyang\u2019s lips covered mines. The atmosphere became super intense right away. I couldn\u2019t see anything except for the man that filled me with desire.</p><br/><p>It was another sleepless night\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>I spent the next few days at work shaking to the core. It was a constant battle of the wits. Once again, it was prove that I wasn\u2019t suitable to be in a workforce environment.</p><br/><p>Deep down, I decided to never personally take on a case if I had to work under a disguise for a company.</p><br/><p>During the morning meeting, rather than paying attention to the CEO\u2019s month end summary, Suyang kept peeking at me with a serious expression. I was sitting at the farthest end.</p><br/><p>After giving him several warning glares, Suyang finally paid attention at the meeting. But when it was his turn to speak, instead of looking at Xu Chuqiao, he kept looking at me. At the end, he even directed a question to me, \u201cAm I correct? Lin Yixin?\u201d</p><br/><p>I had zoned out the whole time he was speaking. When I lifted my head, I could see everyone\u2019s eyes on me. So, I could only respond with thick skin as I smiled and nodded, \u201cYes. The manager is correct. I totally agree with the manager\u2019s words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Also, whenever Suyang headed to his office, he would come by my cubicle and secretly pinch my face. Then, he would try to electrocute me with his charming eyes.</p><br/><p>He was always in a great mood. On the contrary, I was always living in fear that someone would discover our relationship.</p><br/><p>To stop him from misbehaving, everyday, I would tell him hundreds of times to stop playing around.</p><br/><p>Another issue was Guo Zijun. He was still trying to challenge me from time to time. I honestly wanted to tell him straight up that I was only there temporarily. I wasn\u2019t there to compete with him for the job.. He needs to calm his ass down and stop trying to pick fights with me.</p><br/><p>I honestly had no idea how he has so much time to start shit.</p><br/><p>After enduring several days, it was finally the day of the company event.</p><br/><p>Normally, at 8pm, the work building would be empty with its lights on. However, today, it was especially noisy. The event was held in one of the banquet halls. I wore the same black formal dress I had bought from last time and searched for Suyang amongst the crowd.</p><br/><p>In order to avoid suspicion, we purposely left at different times. He left 20 minutes before I did. Logically speaking, he should already be here.</p><br/><p>While I was searching for Suyang, Xu Chuqiao\u2019s secretary stood from afar and made eye contact with me. Then, I received a text message: <i>CEO Xu is waiting for you on the 23rd floor. </i></p><br/><p>I nodded to indicate that I had received her message and took the elevator to the 23rd floor.</p><br/><p>Compared to the banquet hall, the 23rd floor was eerily quiet. The lighting was very dim and there were no one on this floor. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if a ghost suddenly popped out.</p><br/><p>\u201cCEO Xu?\u201d I pushed open the door of the conference room. I didn\u2019t dare to enter until I made sure there weren\u2019t anything freaky or strange.</p><br/><p>For some reason, I felt like the atmosphere was abnormal. While I was hesitating whether I should back out, rushed footsteps suddenly appeared behind me.</p><br/><p>I turned around in alarm, but before I could scream, I was forcefully shoved against the table. My head also struck against the table and I was very dizzy. My hands were tightly locked and I couldn\u2019t fight back at all.</p><br/><p>I had no idea why he was acting like this. I fearfully stared at him, \u201cCEO Xu, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chuqiao had a vicious expression on his face. His scarlet eyes were glaring at me. He looked like he could see through me. He hollered, \u201cSpeak! Who are you!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t understand what he meant. I wasn\u2019t sure what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I couldn\u2019t even get up, \u201cWhatever it is, let\u2019s talk about it in a proper manner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill acting? This whole time, I thought you were hired by me. Who would\u2019ve thought that you\u2019re part of Yao Youfan\u2019s team? Tell me what she wants you to do! Did you purposely get close to me to find out my weakness? Then, you\u2019ll force me out of my position?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think there\u2019s some misunderstanding going on.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure why Xu Chuqiao was acting like this, but I definitely couldn\u2019t allow this misunderstanding to continue, \u201cI\u2019m not from Yao Youfan\u2019s team! Release me first and we can talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chuqiao coldly snorted, \u201cYou\u2019re still denying it? My people told me you and the marketing manager Suyang are in a relationship. How dare you lie about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of logic is that? Where did you hear this from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have photos as proof. Someone snapped a shot of you two entering the same apartment building together. I urge you to explain yourself while I still have patience. Or else, I am not going to go easy on you even though you\u2019re female!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chuqiao began to tighten his hands around my neck. I was having trouble breathing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

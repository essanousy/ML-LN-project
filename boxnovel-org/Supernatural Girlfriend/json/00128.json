Huaze Yuxiang is one of his people? Including everyone we dealt with in Japan? At the time, you guys were already planning to swap my soul with Anson\u2019s?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xialing shifted her shoulders and avoided my eyes, \u201cActually\u2026 we have been monitoring you and Suyang for quite some time. We just didn\u2019t make a move until Japan.\u201d Xialing honestly admitted.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t believe we had walked right into a trap. I was clueless and had no idea that our lives were being monitored.</p><br/><p>Xialing continued, \u201cAnson possessed the person who drew the winner. He changed the winner to Suyang and lured you guys to Japan. Then, after you two had arrived, he possessed another woman to get closer to you. Remember? The Caucasian Anna. That was actually Anson.\u201d</p><br/><p>The truth was brutally slapping me across the face. I felt pathetic and useless. <i>My life was actually part of Anson\u2019s plan? I was being controlled like a puppet. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cSo Anson can control anyone he wants? Doesn\u2019t that mean he could control the whole country?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, but he isn\u2019t interested in doing that. He is only interested in Suyang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what are we going to do now? Anson is so powerful\u2026.\u201d I gazed at the mirror and looked at my reflection. It was Anson\u2019s face. <i>How do I get my body back? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cBefore we go another further, you mean, what should you do!? Not us! Next, I do not know how to swap souls. It is too advanced for me. Why don\u2019t you just live as Anson for the rest of your life? He is so hot. You\u2019re not really losing anything\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I gave Xialing a dirty look. She could tell I was annoyed and quickly smiled apologetically, \u201cHehe! Just kidding! I could tell you\u2019re very uptight so I was trying to help you loosen up!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no time for me to loosen up. I mumbled again and again, \u201cSwap souls\u2026swap souls\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Oh yeah! Grandmother Meng could swap souls! She had helped me twice already. The ghosts entered my body. That\u2019s pretty much the same idea, right? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cXialing. Let\u2019s go find Grandmother Meng. She might be able to help me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous to leave right now. I\u2019m certain Yuxiang already knows we have escaped. She\u2019s probably hunting us down with a bunch of subordinates as we speak.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re dead if we do, we\u2019re dead if we don\u2019t. Why not just go offense and attack?! No matter what, I must get my body back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xialing shook her head. \u201cI really don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so stubborn. Based on appearances, you actually look better now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at me! I\u2019m a MAN right now.. A MAN\u2026 do you understand?\u201d I yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Xialing exclaimed, \u201cYou\u2019re afraid your current boyfriend won\u2019t want you anymore because you\u2019re a guy now, eh?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Thank God. She finally got it.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cAiya! Why does that matter?!\u201d Xialing violently smacked my back, \u201cIt\u2019s already the 21st century! It\u2019s fine. If it\u2019s true love between you guys, this is nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>While Xialing was speaking, I could see her eyes sparkling. Was this the legendary fujoshi? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cI can take you to see Grandmother Meng if you want. But I have tiny request!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat request?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xialing pressed her palms together and crooked her head as she stared at me perversely. \u201cPlease kabedon me!\u201d</p><br/><p> This is kabedon. It\u2019s very popular in Japanese manga/anime?! I found this picture on google to give you guys a better idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d <i>What type of ridiculous request was that? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cPlease pleaseeeee! Just once! This is an extremely rare opportunity! You\u2019re Anson and obedient right now. Just kabedon me! Once!!!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have a crush on Anson\u2026.?\u201d I was beginning to doubt my trust towards Xialing. <i>If she likes Anson, why would she betray him? </i></p><br/><p>Xialing shook her head, \u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand! I don\u2019t like him! I\u2019m purely being shallow and lusts after him for his looks! He\u2019s \u2026you know. So he\u2019s not interested in women! Honestly, this is the first time I\u2019ve ever gotten so close to Anson\u2019s face. He looks hotter and hotter\u2026as expected of a gay man!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xialing still had her palms pressed together as she gazed at me with her peach blossom eyes. She was practically sticking her face against mines. It was making me feel very uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop stop stop! You know I\u2019m Lin Yixin, right??? I\u2019m a woman!\u201d I pushed her away and rejected her with both my words and action.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. But can you stop reminding me of this cruel truth?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Alright, fine. It\u2019s just kabedon. She saved me, so I should at least repay her.</i></p><br/><p>So, I began to imagine myself as a guy. I crooked my head and loosen the first button of my shirt. Then, I pressed Xialing against the wall. Lastly, I smacked my right hand against the wall and gazed down at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this good enough?\u201d I raised my eyebrows and used the teasing tone that Suyang often used on me.</p><br/><p>Xialing nodded her head like a maniac. Her face was as red as a tomato. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect! I\u2019m going to faint!\u201d Xialing sighed as she continued to dreamily gawked at me.</p><br/><p><i>The only time I\u2019ve ever been admired was when I turned into a man</i>\u2026 I hopelessly shook my head, \u201cNow can we go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><br/><p>After satisfying Xialing\u2019s wish, the both of us rushed to Grandmother Meng\u2019s apartment. Along the way, I was actually very worried. Grandmother Meng was very against my relationship with Suyang, so I wasn\u2019t sure if she would help me. But even if she didn\u2019t want to help me, I have to let her know Anson\u2019s plan so she could protect Suyang.</p><br/><p>Of course, ideally, I hope she would help me.</p><br/><p>When walking through the corridor, it was creepy as usual. But since my physical appearance was no longer Lin Yixin, I was less afraid.</p><br/><p>The moment I arrived at the entrance, I knew something was wrong. Usually, there would be two ghost bodyguards watching the door. But today, there was nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother Meng\u2026.\u201d I pushed the half opened door. It was a complete chaos inside. Obviously, something bad had happened. Xialing and I glanced at each other knowingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Xialing asked, \u201cAnson\u2019s subordinates had already taken her away\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, they\u2019re fast\u2026 we must go save her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSave her? We can barely save ourselves! We\u2019re supposed to hide from Anson. How can we save her? He can sense us as long as we\u2019re within 500m of his proximity. You don\u2019t believe me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot only is Grandmother Meng the only person who could help me, she\u2019s also Suyang\u2019s grandmother. I can\u2019t let her get hurt\u2026 wait\u2026. Anson loves Suyang, so he wouldn\u2019t hurt his grandma, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hard to say! Apparently, back then, Suyang\u2019s parents died because of Anson. This time, it\u2019s a granny. So, who knows? As a friendly reminder, Anson is 100% insane.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xialing\u2019s words made my heart even more unstable. <i>What should I do now?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you leave?\u201d Xialing suddenly suggested, \u201cAfter all, Anson\u2019s only goal is to stay by Suyang\u2019s side as Lin Yixin. As long as you do not appear in front of him or hinder him in any way, he won\u2019t do anything or hurt anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I leave, everything will be fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLogically speaking, yes. Initially, Anson was planning to send you to a mental institution in Japan. But if you don\u2019t want to go, you can go to United States, United Kingdom, Canada\u2026 etc. He won\u2019t come hunt you down to kill you! Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>It was that simple?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as I don\u2019t appear again, Suyang, Grandmother Meng, Shen Shaoqian\u2026.will all be ok?\u201d I mumbled to myself. Deep down, I was calculating the pros and cons.</p><br/><p>Ultimately, I came to the conclusion that the pros far outweigh the cons. \u201cI\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I was about to reply to Xialing, someone interrupted me from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Suyang walked over.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh oh! We\u2019re caught\u2026\u201d Xialing whispered, \u201cGood luck solving this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, she ran out and left me and Suyang in the same room together. When Suyang came closer, I realized we were around the same height.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Suyang repeated again. Then he looked around the apartment, \u201cWhere\u2019s my grandma?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

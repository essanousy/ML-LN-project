Then he speedily drove away and took her to his apartment.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! I have came here before! I remember fried chicken. Mmm where is fried chicken? I want to eat fried chicken\u2026.\u201d Hong Xiaobei was on the floor hugging Kevin\u2019s table as she foolishly grinned. She was drooling.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Kevin shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, so gross.\u201d He picked Hong Xiaobei up and brought her to his room. After putting her on his bed, he began to straddle over her and loosened his clothes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Hong Xiaobei asked with no expression as she stared at Kevin.</p><br/><p>As Kevin removed his clothes, he calmly explained, \u201cCan\u2019t you tell? I\u2019ve thought about it. From the way you\u2019re acting, one day while I\u2019m not around, you\u2019re going to get raped. If that is the case, why don\u2019t we have sex first? So in the future when you think back, you won\u2019t have any regrets.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Are you crazy? I\u2019ve told you before. If you\u2019re going to do something strange to me, I will\u2026.\u201d Hong Xiaobei didn\u2019t really believe Kevin would do anything. She thought he was joking around. So she only pointed her finger to warn him. But before she could complete her sentence, Kevin grabbed her hand and their lips touched.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d She couldn\u2019t hide the shock from her voice. Kevin\u2019s other hand was busy untying Hong Xiaobei\u2019s clothes.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelease me!\u201d After struggling, Hong Xiaobei managed to free her hands as she began to continuously pound on Kevin\u2019s back. She realized Kevin was not joking with her.</p><br/><p>Hong Xiaobei was very frightened. Due to the lack of oxygen, her brain wasn\u2019t able to function well. She began to tremble. Just as she was about to surrender to Kevin, she suddenly became sober. In a moment of desperation, she bit Kevin\u2019s mouth and then kicked him off the bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d Kevin yelled as he touched his lips. There was blood seeping out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who is crazy!\u201d Hong Xiaobei shouted. She took a pillow from the bed and threw it at Kevin, \u201cHow can you do something like this to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them glared at each other without saying a word. One of them sat on the bed with her hair in a mess; while the other stood with his clothes in disarray.</p><br/><p>After a long period of silence, the two gradually calmed down from their impulsive behaviour. Kevin brought the medical box over and handed Xiaobei an ice bag to apply it on her left face. As for Hong Xiaobei, she poured the rubbing alcohol onto a cotton swab and began to help Kevin disinfect the wounds on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you seriously going to continue living like a zombie?\u201d Kevin was the first to break the silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Hong Xiaobei thought her life was a joke. What is she going to do from now on\u2026? She had never thought about it. Every night when she closed her eyes, it was as if she could see her future -a pitch of darkness.</p><br/><p>\u201cLast month, Xu Weishan returned from England. She\u2019s the person who looks exactly like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>For a long time, Hong Xiaobei didn\u2019t respond. Kevin continued, \u201cAren\u2019t you curious about what happened? After I met up with her, she actually confessed to me. What a joke. I haven\u2019t seen her for so many years, yet suddenly\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kevin was observing Xiaobei\u2019s expression. \u201cWhen we were little, she often bullied me\u2026\u2026perhaps I have became too handsome. I guess it\u2019s normal that she\u2019s smitten by me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kevin\u2019s words caused Hong Xiaobei to coolly laugh, \u201cSo what? Are you two together now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope. I told her it was too sudden. She said she will give me time to consider.\u201d At this moment, Kevin pinched Hong Xiaobei\u2019s chin as he flirtatiously gazed at her, \u201cTell me, what should I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hong Xiaobei\u2019s eyes flickered for a moment, but it quickly vanished, \u201cWhy are you asking me? If we look the same, it means she\u2019s naturally pretty. Plus, she has a good family background. A talented lady from England matches a rich master like you. No?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre these your true thoughts?\u201d Kevin seemed disappointed. He didn\u2019t get the answer that he was hoping for.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Although we\u2019re twins, we have different lives. Whatever that is happening in her life is not related to me. At the end of the day, we\u2019re only two strangers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never thought of meeting her? In any case, both of your adopted parents are dead. You have no one else you can rely on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy reliance\u2026.\u201d Hong Xiaobei continued to repeat the words like she was possessed. Her eyes gradually turned dim. \u201cForget it, she has her own life and I have my own. I\u2019ll just pretend I don\u2019t know anything. We\u2019ll go our separate ways. Also, I\u2019m already an adult. I can figure out how to live on my own. Right?\u201d</p><br/><p>That was what she said, because deep down, Hong Xiaobei didn\u2019t want to reveal her weakness to Kevin.</p><br/><p>However, the creditors began to arrive like a swarm of bees. Hong Xiaobei had just finished paying for her mother\u2019s medical bills and funeral. What money did she have left? Since she had no other options, she went to find Xu Weishan.</p><br/><p>That was the first time she met up with her twin sister. Xu Weishan was shocked. After hearing Hong Xiaobei\u2019s story, she realized she was also adopted, and Hong Xiaobei was her younger sister.</p><br/><p>Their meetup was very touching. They both took turns telling each other their stories and life experiences. But the one who was deeply moved was Xu Weishan. After hearing Hong Xiaobei\u2019s story, she felt very sorry for her little sister.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister, can I borrow 100k from you? Currently, I have no more money to pay the creditors. I\u2026.\u201d Hong Xiaobei really hated how she had to beg; especially since this was the first time they met up. It should be a touching moment, yet she was awkwardly asking for money.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to say anything else. I can help you pay your debts.\u201d Xu Weishan grasped Hong Xiaobei\u2019s hand to give her strength. \u201cYou\u2019ve suffered so much all these years. Now that we have reunited, you can share all your sadness and stresses with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time Hong Xiaobei experienced family warmth ever since her foster parents had passed away. She was thankful God had not abandon her and allowed her to meet such a kindhearted sister.</p><br/><p>As for Xu Weishan, she decided to keep Hong Xiaobei\u2019s existence a secret. She never brought up the adoption topic to her parents. She wasn\u2019t an idiot, and knew what was best for both parties.</p><br/><p>Eventually, while they were together, Hong Xiaobei found out from Xu Weishan that she was currently dating Kevin. They haven\u2019t been together for long; only two months.</p><br/><p>Hong Xiaobei sighed and silently calculated. It was probably around the time when she had put down her pride and contacted Xu Weishan.</p><br/><p>After a season has passed and their relationship had stabilized, Xu Weishan finally decided she wanted Hong Xiaobei to meet Kevin. Although she hid it from her parents, she didn\u2019t want to hide it from Kevin.</p><br/><p>But thinking of their past, Hong Xiaobei was worried that Xu Weishan will be hurt from it. So Hong Xiaobei firmly rejected Xu Weishan\u2019s request to meet Kevin.</p><br/><p>Throughout the past year, thanks to the money that Xu Weishan had given her, she was able to clear all her family\u2019s debts. Perhaps the money wasn\u2019t a big deal to Xu Weishan, but to Hong Xiaobei, it saved her life. Xu Weishan was the one who had rescued her from the edge of Hell. So how could she appear in front of Kevin?</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that she thought highly of herself, but just in case. <i>In case Kevin\u2019s mouth slips\u2026..in case he wavers\u2026.</i></p><br/><p>Surprisingly, Xu Weishan didn\u2019t tell her in advance and invited her to the coffee shop. It had been a year, and once again, Hong Xiaobei saw the person sitting by the window.</p><br/><p>From time to time, she would think of him\u2026.</p><br/><p>Hong Xiaobei quickly ran out of the coffee shop. The next day, she personally contacted Kevin.</p><br/><p>Their meeting was not warm or sweet. They didn\u2019t even say hi.</p><br/><p>Hong Xiaobei instantly declared her position and concerns. \u201cLet\u2019s pretend we don\u2019t know each other. I don\u2019t think we should ever see each other regardless of how strongly my sister pushes. If we meet, it\u2019ll bad for everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kevin massaged the side of his head. Hong Xiaobei\u2019s words had triggered a headache. He bitterly responded, \u201cAfter a year, you purposely contacted me only to say this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid that we might accidentally meet one day. So I wanted to discuss with you first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not as stupid as you think I am!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh really? I forgot\u2026.well, I\u2019m going to go now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Kevin held onto Hong Xiaobei, \u201cAre you cutting all ties with me now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should cut all ties with me. I don\u2019t want my sister to misunderstand us. After all, you two are together now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMisunderstand? What is there to misunderstand? Since you guys have reunited, I can also bravely tell you the truth. I like you. Clearly, I liked you first. I\u2019m only with her because you never gave me a reply and kept ignoring me. What? Now, I am going to tell her that for the past year, you were her replacement!\u201d Kevin hollered.</p><br/><p>Hong Xiaobei didn\u2019t know why Kevin had became so enraged all of a sudden. But hearing his shameful words truly worried her. \u201cShut up! I\u2019m going to pretend I never heard what you said. Don\u2019t ever say something so ridiculous again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still kept my number. Doesn\u2019t that show something? If you really didn\u2019t want to remain in touch with me, then why didn\u2019t you delete it?\u201d Kevin angrily retorted.</p><br/><p>Kevin had actually inserted his number into Hong Xiaobei\u2019s phone without her knowledge. Hong Xiaobei realized it after she got home last year when she noticed his number in her contact list.</p><br/><p>Originally, she was going to delete it. But ultimately, she never ended up pressing the delete button.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong Xiaobei, I\u2019m not afraid to tell you. Yet, you\u2019re afraid to admit it. I give you my true heart yet you refuse to see it. I\u2019ve had enough. For the past year, the whole time I\u2019ve been with Xu Weishan, she had always been your shadow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hong Xiaobei\u2019s appearance was like an explosive device. Without warning, all of Kevin\u2019s hidden thoughts erupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, I\u2019m begging you not to say these things. And please, I\u2019m requesting you to treat my sister well.\u201d It sounded like a pleading and warning at same time.</p><br/><p>After this, Hong Xiaobei left. Kevin didn\u2019t stop her.</p><br/><p>As Kevin gazed at Hong Xiaobei\u2019s rear view, he felt very depressed.</p><br/><p>They both thought it was their last time meeting, but unexpectedly, their conversation was overheard by Xu Weishan. She had been following Kevin.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

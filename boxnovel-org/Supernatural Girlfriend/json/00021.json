Deep down, I was a bit hopeful. My eyes were beginning to light up again.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026!\u201d Suyang suddenly grabbed both my hands and placed his on top. His eyes were bright and full of expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay it! Hurry!\u201d I wondered if my guess was correct. Currently, my emotions were stirring and I was very excited. I didn\u2019t even dare to blink because I was afraid I would miss this precious moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember what you said about letting me see the homicidal maniac\u2026?\u201d Suyang tried to read my reaction.</p><br/><p>The moment he opened his mouth, I felt my heart sank. Today, I had suffered through too many psychological blows. Is going negative really ok?</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t the homicidal maniac die from the gunshot? I can\u2019t bring him back to life and order him to discuss how he had developed his abnormal mindset, you know?\u201d Although I could see the homicidal maniac if I wanted to, I didn\u2019t want to see him again.</p><br/><p>Suyang shook his head, his eyes were filled with longing, \u201cHe\u2019s not dead. He\u2019s just wounded. I need you to speak to the police department. I really want to see him. If possible, ideally, I would like to take part in the interrogation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to do that? Interrogating the criminal happens internally! We are commoners. We cannot take part!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re different! Not only were you one of the victims, you also contributed greatly in this case. If you personally ask, they should be fine with it.\u201d Suyang confidently stated as he grabbed both my shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, that\u2019s for me to watch. What does it have to do with you?\u201d I pulled from Suyang\u2019s grasp as I exercised my muscles and lied back in bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can follow you! Don\u2019t forget. You promised me this. If you go back on your words, I will\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat will you do?\u201d I arrogantly raised my chin and gazed at Suyang.</p><br/><p>In one second, Suyang went from a ferocious face to a smiling face. He stroked my head like I was a puppy. \u201cOur goldfish is so pretty. She will definitely keep her promise, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Goldfish?\u201d I glared at him.</p><br/><p>Suyang quickly waved his hands, \u201cNo! It\u2019s Yixin! Our Yixin is so pretty. She will definitely not go back on her words\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Oh God. He\u2019s so desperate to see the homicidal maniac that he doesn\u2019t even care about his pride anymore? He praised me!? Wait, what\u2019s that supposed to mean? It\u2019s a bit odd\u2026</i></p><br/><p>\u201cFine fine fine. I\u2019ll speak to the police officers. But I can\u2019t guarantee they will let me. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you can do it!\u201d Suyang was degenerating. He acted more pleased than a three years old receiving a candy. His smile was so big, it was practically drawing to the back of his head.</p><br/><p>I honestly couldn\u2019t understand how he could be so excited to see a person that was mentally unstable.</p><br/><p>Right before he left, he stroked my head again and smiled. \u201cGet well soon. I\u2019ll come see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt like Suyang had changed a lot since the first time I\u2019ve met him. Initially, I thought he was the iceberg from Titanic. Now, I\u2019ve realized he could also be a considerate cotton-padded jacket.</p><br/><p>Is it because I was starting to like him?</p><br/><p>I leaned against the bed as I guarded the empty room and warned myself.</p><br/><p><i>Don\u2019t you dare think crookedly! If he discovers you\u2019re interested in him, he might think you have an ulterior motive to live with him. Who knows? He might kick you out before the renovations are complete! Or perhaps he\u2019ll make you live elsewhere. Aaaaiii, secretly crushing on someone is so depressing\u2026.</i></p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen can you be discharged from the hospital?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you contacted the police?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe homicidal maniac woke up today. He is temporarily in custody.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe interrogation is happening soon. What are your thoughts on it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyday, Suyang nagged me like a broken record. I couldn\u2019t handle his belligerent saliva attack. So the first thing I did after I was discharged from the hospital was to contact Sheyu to ask if it was alright to bring Suyang with me to see the homicidal maniac.</p><br/><p>Although Sheyu had no recollection of our past together, she agreed to let Suyang accompanied me to the detention center to interview the killer due to my identity and contribution to the case.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to come too?\u201d Suyang sounded a bit concern as we stood by the entrance of the meeting room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Don\u2019t forget. He wouldn\u2019t have been caught if it weren\u2019t for me.\u201d Although those words came out of my mouth, deep down, I was very conflicted. On one hand, I didn\u2019t want to see the homicidal maniac. On the other, I was curious about what he was like now that he had been taken in custody. For some reason, I felt like seeing him suffer would make me feel much better.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the murderer being arrested, Huang Zhiwen and Xu Ming also woke up from their comas.</p><br/><p>I went inside with Suyang as we sat and waited. At the corner of the meeting room was a crouching ghost that was as thin as a match. His face was deathly pale as he stared at us. Most likely, he didn\u2019t know I could see him as he quickly lowered his head again.</p><br/><p>The clothes ghosts have on were the last items they were wearing before their deaths. Based on what he was wearing, he was a death penalty criminal.</p><br/><p>Approximately a few minutes later, the homicidal maniac was brought out with handcuffs around his hands. The moment he saw me, he had a jeering expression on his face. He confidently sat down and leaned against the back of his chair with his legs opened wide. His two eyes narrowed and he stared at me like he was a ravenous wolf and I was his prey.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the wolf fell for the prey\u2019s trap and ended up becoming a locked up dog.</p><br/><p>I blankly looked at him. I didn\u2019t want him to see me cower to one side. Suyang broke the silence, \u201cDo you know who we are?\u201d</p><br/><p>The homicidal maniac slowly shifted his attention and pupils towards Suyang. He used his usual devilish tone as he growled, \u201cI don\u2019t know who you are, but I know her. Thanks to her, I am like this right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you. You will be punished for your actions. From now on, you should expect retribution. Sadly, even if you die thousands of times, the innocent victims that you\u2019ve killed will never be able to return.\u201d I bitterly interrupted. There was still more I wanted to say, but Suyang stopped me by tapping my hand on the table.</p><br/><p>I restrained myself as I held in my breath. Then, I turned my head and stared at the floor and no longer uttered a sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am a journalist that is here to interview you.\u201d Suyang began to fabricate. \u201cApparently you have pleaded guilty to all ten crimes. Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>The homicidal maniac coldly laughed, \u201cWhat? Is it not enough that I pleaded guilty? Are you implying I shouldn\u2019t have?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m merely curious. The police department only has proof that you are related to this particular case. They do not have proof to accuse you as the killer for the other nine cases. So why did you voluntarily reveal everything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I was caught, that was the true me. Do you understand?\u201d The homicidal maniac leaned forward as he overlapped his hands and pressed them against the table. \u201cBecause of people like you, I am able to have a rebirth. Why would I renounce my masterpiece to drift and live without purpose? This perfect masterpiece only belongs to me!\u201d He screeched.</p><br/><p><i>You psycho! Pah! </i></p><br/><p>I silently berated.</p><br/><p>As of now, he has not shown any signs of regret or made any apology. This was completely opposite to what I had expected. I didn\u2019t want to hear him speak anymore and got up in a whoosh.</p><br/><p>I turned to Suyang, \u201cI\u2019m going to wait for you in the car.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang gave me his car keys and I left the meeting room without turning back.</p><br/><p>Before the door was shut, I heard the homicidal maniac screaming behind me, \u201cLittle girl. You think you\u2019ve won? You were only able to prevent my actions. But you will never be able to stop my hidden worshippers that I have influenced! One day, you will also receive retribution!\u201d</p><br/><p>Despite not wanting to, I still heard the homicidal maniac\u2019s threat. I hurried and left the detention center and returned to the car.</p><br/><p>After locking all the doors and closing all the windows, I adjusted my seat and attempted to relax.</p><br/><p>I felt like I was trying to hold resentment back, but it would continuously punch me in the pit of my stomach; making it hard for me to breathe.</p><br/><p>I waited in the car for a very long time. I had no idea what Suyang and the homicidal maniac could be talking about for so long.</p><br/><p>I haven\u2019t had lunch yet, and my stomach was beginning to grumble.</p><br/><p>Around 3pm, someone suddenly knocked against the window and woke me up from my nap. I jumped a little as I opened my eyes and noticed Suyang trying to peek inside of the window. Since he was looking so aimlessly, I knew he couldn\u2019t see me from the outside.</p><br/><p>I reached out my finger and drew the outline of his face on the car window. Ultimately, I ended at the tip of his nose.</p><br/><p>I thought it was rather fun, and took awhile before I finally let him in. I pretended I had just woken up as I stretched my body, \u201cWhy did you take so long?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

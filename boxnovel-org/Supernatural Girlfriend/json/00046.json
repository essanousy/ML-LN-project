Fortunately, I had Xu Weishan\u2019s bracelet.</p><br/><p>I patted my bag. With this item, Kevin should believe my words.</p><br/><p>When I was almost at the building, I saw Kevin leaping off from the second floor.</p><br/><p>I covered my mouth as I froze on the spot. I watched the underbrush that Kevin had fallen into. A few seconds later, there was movement and he came out.</p><br/><p>Thanks to his adolescent body, he managed to jump off from the second floor unscratched. It was still rather difficult for me to calm my suspending heart though. So when I walked over to Kevin, I spoke in a criticizing manner, \u201cHow could you leap off from such a high place? What if you got hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kevin\u2019s expression was a lot colder than his regular self. He was glaring at me and I felt shivers up my spine.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Do I have something on my face?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d Kevin disregarded my protest as he dragged me to the basketball court.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, there was no one in sight. Once we were inside, Kevin locked the doors behind us and my heart made the same *thud* sound as the door. Today, his behaviour was very abnormal.</p><br/><p><i>What does Kevin want from me? </i></p><br/><p>I looked around the basketball court and began to walk further inwards. Regardless of what Kevin wanted to say, I must maintain a safe distance between the two of us for safety measures.</p><br/><p>By the time he was done locking the doors, I had already dashed to the furthest basketball stand. I acted like nothing was the matter as I knocked on the pole and murmured, \u201cOhh\u2026.quite sturdy. Not bad\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>*cough cough* I watched as Kevin slowly approached me, \u201cWhy did you bring me here? Don\u2019t tell me you want to battle? Hahaha! I don\u2019t know how to play basketball. Haha! You found the wrong person\u2026.haha\u2026! Ha\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Whenever I was nervous, I would speak a lot of rubbish.</p><br/><p>Kevin\u2019s face was still gloomy as he began to increase his pace.</p><br/><p>\u201cSlow down!\u201d I lifted my hand to stop him from proceeding forward. I wanted to attempt to maintain a distance of five metres between us. \u201cWhatever you want to say, say it from where you are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Kevin halted his steps as he sharply gazed at me. It was as if he could see through me.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t understand what he meant, so I didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>While I was thinking of what to say, Kevin couldn\u2019t wait anymore. He took out a crumpled piece of paper from his bag and threw it onto the ground, \u201cI\u2019m asking you who you are!\u201d He roared.</p><br/><p>I was confused as I picked up the piece of paper. I composedly uncrumpled it and realized it was the application form I had submitted to the basketball association. Underneath the name column, I had written my real name -Lin Yixin.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour name is Lin Yixin?\u201d Seeing my astonished expression, Kevin asked.</p><br/><p><i>It\u2019s over! I knew the name Bai Silu wasn\u2019t suitable for me\u2026</i></p><br/><p><i>It\u2019s all Suyang\u2019s fault. Why didn\u2019t he use my real name to apply for the University? Why must I have to be some Bai Silu? Because of him, I\u2019m always being misunderstood\u2026</i></p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Currently, my mouth was dry and I had my head lowered as I hurriedly tried to come up with an excuse. By the time I had lifted my head, Kevin was already in front of me. Before I could say another word, he forcefully shoved me into a corner. He had his two arms against the wall, giving me no way out.</p><br/><p>I withdrew my body and pressed it against the cold wall behind my back. I felt goosebumps all over my arms.</p><br/><p>The light was behind Kevin and his face was so dark. I didn\u2019t understand why he was so furious. <i>Could the fake Xu Weishan have said something to him? </i></p><br/><p>I must leave this place immediately! I silently told myself.</p><br/><p>But my current situation didn\u2019t allow me to leave at my leisure. The only thing I could do now was act stupid. After all, I came to this University with an intent to help Suyang. Plus, I was secretly doing an investigation on the fake Xu Weishan.</p><br/><p>Kevin\u2019s irregular breathing was very noticeable in this quiet basketball court. He shifted a step closer.</p><br/><p>As I braved the danger, I had a sudden thought.<i> Could this brat want to kiss me? </i></p><br/><p>While I was being a narcissist, Kevin opened his mouth again and repeated the question that I didn\u2019t respond to. \u201cWhat is your intention? Who are you? Bai Silu or Lin Yixin?\u201d</p><br/><p>I placed my hand against Kevin\u2019s arm, indicating I didn\u2019t want him to get any closer. \u201cAlright. You want to know? I\u2019ll tell you. I\u2019ll tell you everything. But please stand further away.\u201d I slightly tested and used a bit of strength to push Kevin away, \u201cYou\u2019re too close to me, and it\u2019s making me very uncomfortable if you want me to be honest with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kevin appeared to be thinking over my words. After a bit of hesitation, he took a few steps back. But his face remained on me the entire time. It was as if he was afraid I would run off.</p><br/><p>After there was a safe distance between us, I took out the school resignation form I had just completed and revealed it to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026.\u201d His eyes screened through the form, \u201cYou\u2019re not studying here anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m already so old, why would I be studying at an University?\u201d I sadly sighed as I showed him my real identity card.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already 25?!\u201d Kevin yelped. His mouth was opened so wide that I could fit an egg inside.</p><br/><p>I was slightly offended as I glared at Kevin. <i>I\u2019m letting you see, so you should just see. Don\u2019t talk about my age!? Even if you know I\u2019m older than you, keep that thought to yourself. Why must you say it aloud? Clearly, this child has never experienced the real society\u2026 </i></p><br/><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s your intention?\u201d Kevin seemed to be more confident about his confrontation after seeing my ID.</p><br/><p>I had no choice. If I don\u2019t take this out, most likely, I wouldn\u2019t be able to leave today.</p><br/><p>From my bag, I took out the real Xu Weishan\u2019s bracelet and displayed it in front of Kevin, \u201cIs this familiar to you? Do you know what this is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Shanshan\u2019s bracelet. Why do you have it?\u201d Kevin took it from me and backed up a few steps. He was staring at the bracelet in astonishment as he carefully examined it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI found it. And I know that this is a gift you gave to Xu Weishan not too long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that I could tell Kevin\u2019s anger had dissipated, I felt relieved and sat down cross legged. I patted to the spot next to me and indicated for him to sit down. Then, I lifted my head and stated, \u201cI have a story I want to tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026.\u201d Kevin didn\u2019t say a word as his lips were tightly pursed. He was tightly gripping onto the bracelet.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t care that he didn\u2019t care and began to share the story that I had formulated in my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cA long time ago, there were a pair of twins.The moment they were born, they were abandoned by their parents and left in an orphanage. The older sister was adopted by a rich family and from then on, she never had to worry about any of her basic necessities. She had a great personality, lots of friends, and became a very cheerful and optimistic girl. As for the younger sister, she was adopted by an average family. Slowly, the family\u2019s income did not cover its expenditures. Her family began to hide from creditors, and they were constantly on the run. Her days were very difficult and she gradually began to associate with a lot of bad people. Her personality became cruel and malicious. Somehow, the evil sister found out that she had another sister who looked exactly like her but was living a completely opposite life. Her older sister had a happy, easy life, so she tried her best to approach her. After succeeding, she began to extort money from her sister. Since her older sister was a kindhearted woman, she always gave her younger sister what she wanted because she felt like she owed her. Just like that, the sisters continued to meet secretly and repeatedly without anyone else knowing. But one day, the older sister declined lending her younger sister money, and the younger sister brutally murdered her. The younger sister destroyed her older sister\u2019s body and took over her life. After all, they were twins and looked identical. From then on, the younger sister lived contently with the older sister\u2019s parents and dated her older sister\u2019s boyfriend. It was as if the older sister had never existed in this world\u2026.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

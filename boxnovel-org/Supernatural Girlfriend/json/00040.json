She came with me, was it ok she didn\u2019t return with me? Being a ghost was sure easy. She could get to places in a whoosh.</p><br/><p>Shortly after, Suyang entered the car.</p><br/><p>On our way home, we didn\u2019t say a single word to each other. I honestly couldn\u2019t take the silence, so I pressed down on a radio station to listen to a broadcast.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>The host\u2019s voice just came on, but Suyang turned it off.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like listening to broadcasts.\u201d Suyang responded.</p><br/><p>He had reverted back to being the cold Suyang again. He was no longer the warm and smiley Suyang that patted my head. How could a person change so quickly?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that.\u201d Perhaps Suyang was uncomfortable by my resentful gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a pity?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a pity?\u201d</p><br/><p>I was truly defeated by him, \u201cUm\u2026becoming a professor and enrolling me into the University. It must have required a lot of work for you to get us this far. Are you actually ok if I quit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo are you implying you want to continue going to school?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no no! Misunderstanding! Misunderstanding!! That\u2019s not what I meant\u2026I\u2019m just curious, and wanted to ask.\u201d I violently shook my head back and forth. I didn\u2019t expect my casual sentence would push me so close to the overhanging cliff.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe school had invited me awhile back to be the literature visiting professor. It isn\u2019t as complicated as you may think.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was stunned, and decided to ask all the questions necessary to get things cleared up. \u201cBoss, based on your age, you shouldn\u2019t have completed a Ph.D degree yet. How could you be a visiting professor at an University? Also, boss, what type of author are you? I went on the web to search your name, but I couldn\u2019t find anything\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou went on the web to search my name?\u201d Suyang raised his brow as he looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand! I was only curious! That\u2019s why\u2026!\u201d I blurted. I tried my best to make myself seem less pathetic.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, who says I don\u2019t have a Ph.D degree?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut your age\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang snorted, \u201cHumph, you still can\u2019t accept the fact that I\u2019m a genius? I received my doctoral degree at the age of 24. Ha, commoner\u2026.\u201d Then, he shot me a glance.</p><br/><p><i>Oh, sorry! My clumsy eyes failed to see you were a genius.</i> I thought to myself. As expected, there was only a step of a difference between a genius and a madman.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel very relieved hearing you say this. I was afraid if I resigned from school, I would have wasted all your efforts\u2026 little did I realize you are such a <i>man of talent</i>!\u201d I sarcastically emphasized the words \u201cman of talent\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that you know your boss is a genius. From now on, you should treat me better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026.on Monday, I\u2019m going to resign from school!\u201d I couldn\u2019t conceal my smile; the main reason was because I could quit school, the other was due to Suyang\u2019s excessive self confidence in himself. It was quite amusing.</p><br/><p>He probably had no idea how ridiculous he looked when he praises himself!</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, I have something else I need to do. You go home and rest first. Can you take care of yourself? Do you want me to call Shen Shaoqian over?\u201d Suyang asked as the car entered our city.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call him! I\u2019m fine. Also, I\u2019m your assistant. Why can\u2019t you tell me what you\u2019re doing? I can\u2019t come with you?\u201d I carefully pressed.</p><br/><p>Suyang didn\u2019t budge, \u201cNo need. You go home first. This is your boss\u2019s command. Plus, don\u2019t you always want to slack off?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026.\u201d I mumbled quietly. Then, I swallowed down the words that I had wanted to say.</p><br/><p>Suyang was being considerate of me. But whenever it came to the details of things other than his work, he would always maintain a distance between us. Although I was his assistant, he only gave me permission to deal with the trifle matters of his life.</p><br/><p><i>Was he too cautious? Or in his eyes, I wasn\u2019t deemed as trustworthy? </i></p><br/><p>After he had taken me home, I curled up on the sofa by myself as I watched my ghost cat and dog fight each other. All the window curtains were pulled up and it was a dusky kind of atmosphere. The setting allowed me to deeply contemplate on my thoughts.</p><br/><p>For some reason, I felt like there was an invisible screen called \u201cno trust\u201d between us. I was Suyang\u2019s assistant, yet I wasn\u2019t allowed to ask or know anything above his work.</p><br/><p>My teeth were restless as I began to chew on my fingernails. My eyes turned towards Suyang\u2019s bedroom.</p><br/><p>Suyang had never allowed me to enter his bedroom. What was inside? What secrets do Suyang have hidden? I had no idea.</p><br/><p>Then, I snapped out of my zone. When did I start to care so much about these things?</p><br/><p>I recalled reading from a book: When you fall for someone, you will notice everything about him. You will notice how he treats you, the methods he\u2019d use, his attitude, and so on. That was my current situation.</p><br/><p>As I thought about it, I felt like there was a fire burning from within me. I couldn\u2019t set it free, neither could I suppress it.</p><br/><p>While I was feeling very fretful, a pair of empty eyes stared at me from across the kitchen door. It was Xu Weishan. She was currently lying behind the door and secretly peeking at me from the gap. <i>Huh? When did she become so modest? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why are you watching me?\u201d I quietly asked.</p><br/><p>Xu Weishan appeared to hesitate a bit. Then, she floated towards me and looked very conflicted. After a few moments later, she floated towards the entrance and signaled at me to follow. I think she wanted to take me somewhere.</p><br/><p>I sighed. Since I had promised to help her, I must keep my words even if I had to beg others.</p><br/><p>After putting on a thin jacket, I followed Xu Weishan and walked for a long time under the chilly night. Then, we took the public transportation for an hour and arrived at a deserted area.</p><br/><p>I looked around my surroundings and noticed there was only darkness around me. There were also some unknown insects making their insect noises. It was awfully frightening.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are we here?\u201d I shivered as I timidly asked.</p><br/><p>Xu Weishan disregarded my question and continued to lead the way. There were no streetlights around, so even though I didn\u2019t know her motive, I could only continue to follow her.</p><br/><p>Xu Weishan suddenly stopped and pointed at the ground beneath her feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I followed her hand gesture around her ear as I blinked my eyes and came to a realization, \u201cYou want to tell me there is something here!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Weishan slowly nodded. She shifted over to give me room so that I could attentively observe the area.</p><br/><p>I turned the flashlight on from my cell phone and noticed the soil at that particular spot was indeed softer than the soil around its area. Using the flashlight, I could see that there weren\u2019t any plants or weeds growing on top of it.</p><br/><p>I crouched down as I asked Xu Weishan, \u201cIf I had known earlier, I would have brought some tools with me. You want me to dig this with my bare hands?!\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t reply for a long time, so I gave up. I rubbed my hands together and then lifted up my sleeves. Then, I began to dig with my hands. Fortunately, whatever that was buried under was not buried too deeply. After digging a hole of around ten centimeters deep, I felt a hard object.</p><br/><p>I borrowed the light from my flashlight as I picked up the item with my hand. It was a silver bracelet.</p><br/><p><i>It looked so familiar. Have I seen it somewhere?</i> I scrutinized it. <i>Ah! I remember now!</i> When I was possessed in Xu Weishan\u2019s body, I had seen it before. This was the silver bracelet that Kevin gave her!</p><br/><p>I looked on the inside of the bracelet. Sure enough, Kevin and Xu Weishan\u2019s names were engraved on it.</p><br/><p><i>If the silver bracelet was here? Does that mean Xu Weishan\u2019s body was also here? So, after she killed her older sister, she brought the body to this desolate area and then attempted to destroy the corpse? </i></p><br/><p>The more I thought about it, the colder the breeze felt from behind me. This was a good place to get rid of corpses. If I end up encountering an evil spirit, that would be bad.</p><br/><p>I hesitated as I swallowed down my saliva and turned to discuss with Xu Weishan, \u201cHow about we come back tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>She shook her head.</p><br/><p><i>Fine, I\u2019ll follow her instructions and find her corpse. </i></p><br/><p>There were two reasons why the fake Xu Weishan had still not been discovered. Firstly, she looked exactly the same as her twin sister. Secondly, the real Xu Weishan\u2019s body hadn\u2019t been found.</p><br/><p>The moment I realized Xu Weishan\u2019s body may be under my feet, I began to feel very shaken and uneasy.</p><br/><p>I found a random wooden stick around me and began to dig at the same spot that I had discovered the silver bracelet. After digging for another twenty centimeters or so, the wooden stick struck a metal box. There was a \u201cka\u201d sound.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I was afraid to trigger him more. If I managed to live through this, I\u2019m definitely putting this on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. <i>I was once held hostage by \u201cme\u201d. \u201cI\u201d pressed a gun against my brain. Who else would\u2019ve experienced something like this? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Suyang couldn\u2019t see what was happening with me and Anson, so he was anxious. He began to harden his grip on my hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang, don\u2019t freak out. I just want to scare her a bit. Sadly, it doesn\u2019t seem to be very effective. Your huge reaction is making me rather upset though.\u201d Anson pressed the gun harder against me.</p><br/><p><i>Anson assumed my lack of reaction was an indication I wasn\u2019t afraid\u2026but the truth was, I was freaking out</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>From the corners of my eyes, I analyzed the muzzle of the gun. For some reason, I stated, \u201cYou dare to shoot?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I said that line, I regretted it. I shouldn\u2019t be triggering him even more. <i>It was as if I was saying, \u201cHahaha! If you have the ability, then shoot me?! You are a chicken!\u201d</i></p><br/><p>\u201cYixin!\u201d Suyang shouted to stop me. But it was too late.</p><br/><p>I explained, \u201cRight now, my body is Anson. If you kill me, you kill Anson.\u201d</p><br/><p>Anson clapped, \u201cThat\u2019s true! But now I\u2019m Lin Yixin. Anson is useless to me. Why would I care whether he\u2019s dead or alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you plan to live as Lin Yixin forever? Suyang already knows your plan. I don\u2019t think you can remain by his side!\u201d I blurted.</p><br/><p><i>Oh my goodness\u2026. I was triggering him again. Shouldn\u2019t I keep my mouth shut? Perhaps that would be safer</i>\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me!\u201d Anson hollered. The hand he was holding the gun with began to shake. In my opinion, he had already lost his sanity.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnson!\u201d Suyang could sense that things were quickly turning sour so he rushed to distract him. \u201cI want to know why you decided to go through such a big circle rather than directly meeting me with your true self.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShhhhh! Dear, you\u2019re saying the wrong name. I\u2019m Lin Yixin; not Anson. I\u2019m warning you! If you say it wrong again, the punishment won\u2019t be light!\u201d Anson purred.</p><br/><p>Anson walked over to a spot where Suyang and I could both see him. Then, he spun around and pointed at me, \u201cCompared to you, don\u2019t you think I\u2019m more suitable to be Lin Yixin? I can completely control this body now.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Who would\u2019ve thought I would have to fight over someone to be the useless Lin Yixin?</i> \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not very happy with myself, Lin Yixin is me. You only stole the exterior. It doesn\u2019t hide the fact that you\u2019re a madman.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Why won\u2019t I shut up? Every line I\u2019m saying is pushing me closer towards death</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDear, you\u2019re the one who is insane. Look in the mirror. You\u2019re the Anson that Suyang despises. I\u2019m the one he loves; Lin Yixin.\u201d Anson turned to Suyang and crooked his head, \u201cRight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang didn\u2019t respond. Anson was annoyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswer me!\u201d He screamed as he pointed the gun at Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did I ever say I despised Anson?\u201d Suyang responded calmly.</p><br/><p>Suyang\u2019s line caused Anson\u2019s eyes to grow big. His lips began to quiver, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>I was also shocked by Suyang\u2019s words. <i>He actually didn\u2019t hate Anson?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did I say I despised Anson?\u201d Suyang repeated again, \u201cThat\u2019s what you came up with yourself. I never said anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLiar! You\u2019re lying to me! I -, no, Anson caused the death of your parents! How could you not hate him? You\u2019re just lying because you want me to let you guys go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHate!\u201d Suyang crisply replied, \u201cI once hated you! But that happened so many years ago. What\u2019s the point? Plus, you were only a child back then. You didn\u2019t know any better. So when I thought of that, I couldn\u2019t hate you anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLiar! How could you not hate me? Even I cannot forgive myself\u2026.\u201d Anson\u2019s voice was turning weaker and weaker.</p><br/><p>\u201cI went to Japan. Doesn\u2019t that already prove a lot?\u201d Suyang firmly made eye contact with Anson. This was the first time I\u2019ve ever heard Suyang talked about the incident. To be honest, I was quite stunned.</p><br/><p>Anson slowly lowered his gun.</p><br/><p>Suyang continued, \u201cAll these years, Anson never once appeared in front of me and never stated he wanted me to forgive him. You\u2019re using the wrong method to reunite with me. It\u2019s still not too late to turn back\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Anson became emotional again, \u201cTurn back?! How can I turn back? Exchange souls with her again so you two can live happily ever after?!\u201d He snarled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you need to exchange souls and face me as Anson and tell me all the things you have been wanting to say to me all these years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late! It\u2019s too late!\u201d Anson\u2019s nose trembled as he choked with emotions, \u201cI started off on the wrong path, so I can only continue from there. There\u2019s no backing out.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Not that I want to ruin the atmosphere, but Anson happened to be wearing non-waterproof makeup. Now, his tears were making my face look like a mess. </i></p><br/><p><i>I look so funny. But how could I laugh during such a serious moment? This was the moment that will determine whether we\u2019ll live or not! Hold it! I can do it! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cSo what are you going to do now? Kill us all?\u201d Suyang coldly continued the conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t kill you! You\u2019re the person I love and care about the most. I would never hurt you.\u201d Anson murmured. Then, his eyes hardened, \u201cI don\u2019t exactly know what I\u2019m going to do yet. But first, get rid of him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to kill me again? I told you! This body is yours! You can\u2019t hurt yourself\u2026\u201d I sighed. <i>Why doesn\u2019t this child understand? </i></p><br/><p>Anson laughed hysterically as he shook his head, \u201cI just thought of an amazing idea! I know how Anson can stay with Suyang forever!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>I had a very bad feeling about this. </i></p><br/><p>Anson seemed to have made up his mind. Suddenly, he pointed the gun at his head (well, \u201cLin Yixin\u2019s head\u201d). He began to back away.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang, you decide! If I die, you will remain with Anson\u2019s physical body forever. If he dies, you will forever remain with Anson\u2019s spirit. Which one will you choose?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>They say that the cruelest heart belonged to a married woman. But in my opinion, this man\u2019s heart was much crueler than any married women! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not choosing either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine! I\u2019ll chose for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I shouted. I could see that Anson was determined to kill. He was about to kill \u2018Lin Yixin\u2019. If my physical body dies, I\u2019ll become a ghost!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d Anson started laughing like a maniac, \u201cYou\u2019re finally scared. I guess I made the right choice.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>I was scared all along, dude. Don\u2019t make it sound like I\u2019m brave</i>\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so emotional. Let\u2019s talk this over.\u201d Since I was anxious, I have been secretly trying to untie the rope behind me. But a man\u2019s hands were too big, I couldn\u2019t do anything.</p><br/><p>My wrist was starting to hurt; I must have scraped my skin.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yes, there is something I want to know. Suyang, how did you know I wasn\u2019t Lin Yixin? It\u2019s her face\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy intuition! You were too intense when you kissed me. That isn\u2019t something Lin Yixin would do. She had never once shown so much initiative.\u201d Suyang replied honestly.</p><br/><p><i>What? Kiss? Ugh! </i>A fire immediately lit up inside me.</p><br/><p><i>Wait, does that count? When Anson kissed Suyang as Lin Yixin\u2026was that Anson kissing Suyang or Lin Yixin kissing Suyang?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cBut how did you figure out who was Lin Yixin? She even changed sex.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy intuition.\u201d Suyang looked at me, \u201cA man\u2019s 6th sense is quite accurate. If you love her enough, regardless of what she turns into, you\u2019ll be able to sense her original aura based on her movements.\u201d</p><br/><p>Anson clapped, \u201cWell said. I\u2019m sad and jealous at the same time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnson, I already told you as a child that we weren\u2019t possible. I will never love you as a lover.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re normal. I know you won\u2019t like men.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has nothing to do with your sex. I just can\u2019t be lovers with you. You\u2019re my childhood best friend. Even if you shoot and kill Lin Yixin\u2019s physical body, the one I love is Lin Yixin\u2019s soul. So please, put down the gun. Doing this will not help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuyang\u2026.\u201d I couldn\u2019t stop my silent tears from running down my face. The time we had spent together had nourished this deep-rooted love.</p><br/><p>\u201cI had already fallen deeply in love before I could prepare myself. If only I had realized this sooner\u2026\u201d Suyang whispered to me.</p><br/><p>His voice sounded like the world\u2019s last gramophone record.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to see how you guys can continue being in love with my face\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, a gunshot rang in the air. *bang*!</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!!!!\u201d I screamed in despair. I watched as \u201cI\u201d fell onto the ground, \u201cNooooooo! You can\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Was \u201cI\u201d about to die? I don\u2019t want to have Anson\u2019s face for the rest of my life! I\u2019m Lin Yixin! Lin Yixin is me! </i></p><br/>\n</div>"}

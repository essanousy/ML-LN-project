Bang! Bang!\u201d I pounded on the door like I was going to break in. I wasn\u2019t in the mood to knock nicely. Enough is enough. Maybe an uncle can hold it in, but this aunty cannot. \u201cOpen up! Hurry and open your door!\u201d</p><br/><p>After knocking for awhile with no response, I increased my strength. \u201cHey! I\u2019m from downstairs. Do you have a swimming pool in your apartment? My ceiling is damaged and submerged because of you!? Hurry up and open the door. We need to talk!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was still no activity coming from within. It didn\u2019t seem right. I wondered if something happened inside. So I quietly plastered my face against the door.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the door suddenly opened. I was caught off guard as I staggered to catch myself. I nearly fell head first into the room. The man who opened the door was an uncle with a face full of beard. He unleashed an aura of death as he glared at me. Having shivers down my spine would be an understatement.</p><br/><p>He reminded me of a psycho of a show I enjoyed to watch. It was a psychological criminal type of shows, and the character was a homicidal maniac that had a mental disorder.</p><br/><p>Before I could open my mouth, he lifted me like a little chick and effortlessly flung me into the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Hey! What are you doing?!\u201d I acted like an arrogant bully. But deep down, I was already calling for my mommy.</p><br/><p>The moment I set my foot inside, the water level was already at my ankle. When I stared around the room, I realized the entire 2705 room was filled with water. No wonder the water was soaking into my ceiling!</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, Uncle. But are you really trying to create a swimming pool? If your water pipe is broken, then repair it! Your entire apartment is filled with water!! \u2026..wait. No. Do you realize the water from your apartment is soaking into my ceiling?! Soon, the water is going to cave into my apartment!\u201d</p><br/><p>As I complained, I walked further into the room. Suddenly, the extremity of my foot kicked something soft.</p><br/><p>The window curtains were tightly shut, so there wasn\u2019t any light in the apartment room at all. Since it was so dark, it was naturally very difficult to see. There was also a moldy smell emitting through the air.</p><br/><p>My entire body froze. Then, I slightly took a step back as I gulped down my saliva and anxiously looked down. I wanted to see the object that I had just kicked.</p><br/><p>It was a person. A person that didn\u2019t move at all. He was lying in the water.</p><br/><p>I was not stupid enough to assume he was willingly lying there\u2026 I heard the steps coming closer and closer towards me. Both my hands were clenched into fists and my heart beat was gradually increasing. I wanted to run, but within three steps, something assailed my nostrils and my attempt to cry for help was caught in my throat. My consciousness was slipping and I was getting more and more dizzy.</p><br/><p>Ah\u2026 it turns out I am the fool who would recklessly go towards the mountain while knowing it has tigers\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm\u2026.mmmm\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Fighting was no use. My eyelids became heavier and heavier. Finally, I lost consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>By the time I woke up, my hands and feet were tightly tied up around a chair. I couldn\u2019t make a single move.</p><br/><p><i>Wow. I\u2019m so unlucky. I\u2019m actually so unlucky that I\u2019m going to be a victim of homicide</i>.</p><br/><p>I was still feeling the drug effects, so I was very groggy. The killer uncle was sitting across from me; motionless.</p><br/><p>We were staring at each other. After being in silence for two minutes, he finally couldn\u2019t take it anymore and spoke up in his raspy voice. \u201cDo you know why I\u2019m treating you like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>I calmly nodded my head. After pondering about my life for the past two minutes, I realized throughout my 25 years, my life was meaningless aside from being able to communicate with ghosts. <i>Wow. I was always encountering ghosts. Now, I\u2019m going to become one too. </i></p><br/><p>Then, I thought about it a bit more. My life was so meaningless that there wasn\u2019t much difference between being dead or alive.</p><br/><p><i>Wait, that\u2019s not true! Maybe I\u2019ll be like the mistress hanging by my window! I\u2019ll probably be floating around. Would I still possess this supernatural power? I definitely wouldn\u2019t have to worry about finding work. I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about money either. Honestly, to me, there wouldn\u2019t be substantial changes I would have to adapt to.</i></p><br/><p>Thinking of this, I immediately felt a lot more optimistic. I gave the uncle a brilliant smile.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t guarantee my smile was \u201cbrilliant\u201d under the uncle\u2019s eyes; as I haven\u2019t smiled for a very long time. But the uncle gave me a look as if he had stepped in shit. I guess it wasn\u2019t as brilliant as I thought.</p><br/><p>Aii, he was deeply affecting the self-esteem of a person who was preparing for death.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re going to die soon, right?\u201d The uncle was probably reminding me because he thought I didn\u2019t understand my situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. You want to kill me to silence me. I totally understand.\u201d I composedly replied. \u201cI have a small request. I hope you will agree to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is your request?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am extremely afraid of pain. Could you make it quick?\u201d</p><br/><p>The uncle stood up as he roughly pinched my chin. \u201cThose are your last words?\u201d</p><br/><p>It appeared he wasn\u2019t satisfied by my fast acceptance of being killed.</p><br/><p>I solemnly nodded. \u201cPlease and thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have anything else you want to say? No reflection? Mood? No views you want to express?\u201d The uncle\u2019s words reminded me of my University professor who prompted me with my paper\u2026mood? Views? Who gives a shit when they\u2019re about to die?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Since you\u2019re not in a rush, unhand me first. I do have a request.\u201d After hearing my words, the uncle untied my hands.</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if it would hurt his feelings, but I had the mindset of a dying person, so I had to say it, \u201cUmm.. could you move further away from me? Your body odour\u2026is a bit..strong..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The uncle was stunned. I guess my words did hurt him. Honestly, that wasn\u2019t my intention. I was already trying to be discreet.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he reached out and grabbed my hair. He pulled it so hard that my scalp hurt as he leaned his filthy face over. \u201cIs this rubbish all you want to say? Young lady, when you turn into a lonely ghost, don\u2019t come find me. If you want to blame someone, just blame yourself for your bad luck. Who told you to ring the\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I crinkled my brows. I really couldn\u2019t take his gibberish, so I cut him off. \u201cUncle, could you stop with the bullshit? If you want to kill me, then just kill me. You talk too much garbage. If I was a person determined to live or run, you would be screwed! Haven\u2019t you seen it on TV or movies? Whenever the bad guys are talking too much, the main character will find a way to KO them!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

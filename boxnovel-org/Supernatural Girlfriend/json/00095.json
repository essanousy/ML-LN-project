But anyone who paid attention could tell that it was a miserable smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it turns out Author Su already has a girlfriend. I guess all the female fans must be a bit disappointed. Alright, let\u2019s move onto the next segment\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>During this interval, Suyang made eye contact with me and then burst his brilliant smile.</p><br/><p>While we continued looking at each other, my fists were tightly clenched because I was so anxious. It was as if time had stopped.</p><br/><p>The young girl next to me had an unfathomable expression on her face as she stared at me. She appeared to want to say something and then hesitated. It was as if she was going to use profanity the very next second\u2026</p><br/><p><i>Great. Now, I was the public enemy of all the women in the room. </i></p><br/><p>The television station atmosphere became very silent. I temporarily lacked the ability to deal with such emergencies. The girl beside me was still watching me from the corner of her eyes. I felt like I could no longer stay here.</p><br/><p>It took me three seconds to react. I remembered I was sitting closest to the exit. So I rushed to stand and dash. I immediately bolted through the door.</p><br/><p>I ran out so dramatically that I crashed into a handrail.</p><br/><p>I was way too stressed to keep an eye out on Suyang\u2019s performance. I held onto my injured thigh as I limped towards the television lounge.</p><br/><p>I turned around to ensure that no one had followed me. After confirming my safety, I halted my steps and leaned against a television to catch my breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cUghh.. he still said it in the end.\u201d I sighed. <i>Great. Now, I was the public enemy of millions of fans\u2026 </i></p><br/><p>\u201cBad hand! Bad mouth!\u201d I began to slap my mouth. I shouldn\u2019t have picked up that call.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, please do not lean against the TV\u2026.\u201d A uniformed lady walked over as she kindly reminded me, \u201cThere is a coffee shop where you can rest over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>I bounced like a spring and sincerely apologized, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t do it on purpose.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Awkward\u2026.</i></p><br/><p>At this moment, the news was being broadcasted. Since there was still quite some time before Suyang\u2019s interview was over, I might as well remain standing and watch the news in the meantime.</p><br/><p>The television hosts spoke in a standard Mandarin accent that couldn\u2019t be more perfect. In addition, they also looked extremely attractive. Clearly, the standards for TV hosts were getting higher and higher.</p><br/><p>Today marked the one month death anniversary of the Wen clan corporation\u2019s chairman\u2019s son\u2019s family of three. A month ago, the son\u2019s family had passed away from a huge car crash on the expressway. The Wen clan\u2019s corporation\u2019s chairman\u2019s son Wen Wenhan, his daughter-in-law Jiang Jing, and his grandson Wen Yufan were the casualties. In order to commemorate his son\u2019s family, the chairman specifically created a Wen Yufan charitable foundation under his grandson\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>At the end of the day, wealthy people were not excused from the fate of humankind (to be born, to grow old, to get sick, and to die). <i>What\u2019s the point of having so much money when your family\u2019s all gone?</i> I shook my head. <i>Everything was temporary. </i></p><br/><p>I continued to watch the TV broadcast Wen Yufan\u2019s past live coverages. He was approximately 25 years of age, slender, had neatly trimmed short hair, gentle smile, and a mole on the corner of his left eye. Subconsciously, my pupils began to enlarge.</p><br/><p><i>Why does this man look so familiar?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cW-\u2026..Wen clan corporation\u2026 Wen Yufan?\u201d If it was really the Wen clan corporation, the television station I was currently in also held their stocks. I\u2019ve seen them occasionally on the news.</p><br/><p>Sources say that after the car accident, there was a period of time when the corporation had some internal disorder. Just like a drama, suddenly, an illegitimate child of the chairman came into the scene. He was Wen Wenhan\u2019s younger brother, and Wen Yufan\u2019s uncle, Wen Yihan.</p><br/><p>This Wen Yihan person was only older than his nephew by five years. Through some skillful methods, the Wen clan corporation recovered once again.</p><br/><p><i>As you\u2019d expect of a prestigious family, it has plenty of friends and foes. </i></p><br/><p>But now was not the time to focus on that.</p><br/><p>Currently, the most important issue was Gao Jialan\u2019s previous line. <i>That\u2019s my husband</i>. It had never left my mind. If I guessed correctly, it would pertain to another epic drama of the wealthy.</p><br/><p>Even if there was no drama, something worse might occur\u2026</p><br/><p><i>Speaking of which, the news didn\u2019t mention anything about Wen Yufan\u2019s wife? </i></p><br/><p>I felt like I had been shocked by lightning. My entire body felt numb and I couldn\u2019t move. It was as if I had symptoms of a paralysis.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch coincidence could not exist, right?! Yeah. It\u2019s not possible. It\u2019s not possible.\u201d I began to pat the area around my heart to calm my emotions. \u201cThe woman in the apartment is not related to the Wen clan corporation! The ghost is not connected to the Wen clan! If he was connected to the Wen clan, he wouldn\u2019t be wandering around the streets, right?! Stop scaring yourself. You were seeing things! Yes! You have mistaken! They just look similar. It\u2019s fine\u2026 fine.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Was it related to stock shares?! </i>The TV wouldn\u2019t stop broadcasting the Wen clan\u2019s news. The more I watched, the more afraid I became. I couldn\u2019t help but began to back away. Deep down, I prayed that my assumption and guesses were false. Everything just happened to seem like they were connected\u2026</p><br/><p><i>Why couldn\u2019t the people or ghosts that I encounter be more pure? </i></p><br/><p>There was a commotion behind me. I turned around and noticed everyone\u2019s eyes were on the man who had just entered.</p><br/><p>A man with nice facial features dressed in a suit walked by me. His eyes remained fixedly ahead. At the moment, the news was still in the midst of reporting the Wen clan corporation.</p><br/><p>His aloof attitude emitted a cold aura as he passed by me.</p><br/><p>\u201cRecently, the newly appointed CEO of the Wen clan corporation, Wen Yihan, represented the chairman at the talks with Russia\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I stared at the person on the television. Then, I turned around and looked at the man who had just passed by me. I stared at the person on the television again. Then, I turned to look at the man who was already far away from me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWen Yihan?!\u201d I silently wondered.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

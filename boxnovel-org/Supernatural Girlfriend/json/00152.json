Stop being so stingy! Let me use it too!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>I could see through Suyang\u2019s plan. Why would I let him get his way?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cThen put on your clothes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? How do you know I\u2019m not wearing clothes? Were you secretly watching me this whole time?\u201d Suyang teased. He was trying to show that he was winning.</p><br/><p>I justified, \u201cWho is peeking at you? If you don\u2019t want people to stare, then stop acting like a psycho. Put some clothes on! The living room is public space!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this is my apartment!\u201d Suyang boldly declared, \u201cI would suggest you not to look. But if you want to, go ahead!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was speechless. <i>How could he be even more shameless than he was three years ago? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cYou can decide for yourself whether you want to look or not. I\u2019m just going to sit here and watch TV. I\u2019m not leaving.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>No. At this rate, I\u2019m going to suffocate from being underneath the blanket for too long. </i>I lifted the blanket just enough so I could get some air but not see Suyang.</p><br/><p>But the moment I lifted the blanket, Suyang came over without restraint and started to invade my territory. He began pacing back and forth naked!</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and irritably poked my head out to yell, \u201cDo you have to be like this?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou started it first!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this rate, I was going to lose for sure. After being harassed by Suyang, I wasn\u2019t sleepy at all. So, I used my feet to poke him, \u201cAre you tired?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot at all! I\u2019m super awake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go out then!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo out? Where?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to see Grandmother Meng. We talked about this before. After Yao Youfan and Xu Chuqiao\u2019s case was over, you would take me to see her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>I poked him again, \u201cWhy are you not answering?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit too late to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat. Are you afraid?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoing to a cemetery late at night seems\u2026.\u201d Suyang was hesitant.</p><br/><p>I sighed, \u201cWe\u2019re going to see your granny. What are you afraid of?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAside from granny, there are so many other graves!!! And it\u2019s quite late. Don\u2019t you find that spooky?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Suyang always acts cocky around me but three years later, he was still scared of ghosts. When it came to this stuff, he was the complete opposite of his usual self. </i></p><br/><p>However, I was stubborn and determined to go. So, I began to push, \u201cLet\u2019s go! Have you forgotten what my occupation is? I can protect you!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, Suyang gave in and took me to see Grandmother Meng\u2019s grave. But the moment we got off the car, Suyang clutched onto my sleeve.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t really blame him. The moment we got off the car, there was a cold breeze. In addition, the crickets were making \u201czi zi\u201d sounds. Suyang was having a mental breakdown.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! You can\u2019t stand behind me. I don\u2019t know where her grave is! Go lead the way!\u201d I grabbed onto Suyang and pushed him ahead of me. Then, I began to chuckle behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can see ghosts, right? How many are there now?\u201d Suyang\u2019s voice was trembling; once again proving how scared he was.</p><br/><p><i>1, 2, 3, 4\u2026 there were 8 sitting on their own graves alone. But I couldn\u2019t tell Suyang this. If I did, he would be too scared and run back to the car. So, I did what a smart person would do. I lied. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cNone. There isn\u2019t a single ghost here so calm down and lead the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, we arrived at Grandmother Meng\u2019s grave. Initially, I thought I had a lot of things I wanted to say. But when I arrived, I realized the words were stuck in my heart. I held onto Suyang\u2019s hand and pulled him down to sit with me. Suyang appeared a bit confused, \u201cYou came here to sit?\u201d</p><br/><p>I lifted my head and gazed at the round moon, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. But regardless of what we do, Grandmother Meng won\u2019t see it. In the letter she mentioned that she was going to reincarnate immediately. She didn\u2019t want to dwell on Earth. I think I just wanted to confirm by coming here. For some reason, Grandmother Meng\u2019s death seems like a lie to me. I keep hoping it\u2019s false.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too. I wish granny was still by our side.\u201d Suyang tightly wrapped his hand around mines. Our ten fingers intersected. I wasn\u2019t sure if he agreed with my thoughts or he was just too spooked by the environment.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, out of curiosity, I asked Suyang, \u201cDo you think when we\u2019ve turned into dust, we\u2019ll meet again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But if death could not be avoided, I would want to leave in front of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You want to abandon me? I would be so lonely by myself. You selfish\u2026.!\u201d Usually, when it came to death related questions, a person would rather die first than to experience losing his or her loved ones.</p><br/><p>Suyang brushed his hand on my nose, \u201cSilly, you could see ghosts, right? I could be by your side as a ghost. But if you die before me, then we would truly be separated by yin and yang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! I see\u2026\u201d I nodded. He had a point.</p><br/><p>So, Suyang and I sat in front of Grandmother Meng\u2019s grave for the whole night. We shared what we went through the past three years. Through our stories, we realized that although we were busy with our own lives, our hearts had never once drifted apart.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cSister! Boss! President! Lin Yixin!\u201d I hadn\u2019t even opened my eyes yet, but the moment I picked up the phone, Xialing\u2019s loud voice exploded on the other side. It was more effective than any alarm clocks!</p><br/><p>When I opened my eyes, I saw Suyang sleeping like a baby next to me. I couldn\u2019t help but smile. This was the effect of Suyang. He had the ability to make me feel amazing in the morning.</p><br/><p>I flipped over and hugged him. I used his arm as a pillow and quietly muttered, \u201cWhat is it\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? You don\u2019t feel bad for asking? Xu Chuqiao\u2019s money came in a week ago! Why are you still not back? Do you know how busy the firm is right now? The three of us are working like mad!\u201d</p><br/><p>I secretly grinned, \u201cYou punk! Now you finally know what I go through when I tell you guys to work, eh!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes yes yes! I know. Now can you please hurry up and come back!?\u201d</p><br/><p>From Xialing\u2019s voice, I could imaging her gritting her teeth. I couldn\u2019t help but tease, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take me a bit longer. You guys hold on, ok? I\u2019m hanging up now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! No! If you dare to hang up, I\u2019m going to get on a plane and fly to City A to seize you! Boss!!! If I say it, I can do it! Tell me how long it\u2019s going to take for you to come back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xialing\u2019s voice woke Suyang up. He rubbed his eyes and mumbled, \u201cWho\u2019s calling so early\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>I pulled the phone away and gave him a reassuring kiss, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Did it wake you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?! I hear a man\u2019s voice!!!!!\u201d Xialing\u2019s ears were sharp. She began to shout, \u201cIt\u2019s Suyang, isn\u2019t it?! I knew it! You\u2019re taking forever to return because of him! Let me talk to him!\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t even need to put her on speaker phone, she was so loud that we could both hear her perfectly fine.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is there to talk about?\u201d I rejected. But Suyang took the phone from me and impatiently yelled, \u201cIt\u2019s so early right now. You\u2019re not letting people sleep! Who are you!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXialing! I\u2019m Xialing! If you don\u2019t want me to bug you guys, then send my boss back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour boss?\u201d Suyang had a crafty smile on his face as he made eye contact with me, \u201cYour boss won\u2019t leave on her own. I can\u2019t kick her out\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d I covered Suyang\u2019s mouth immediately, \u201cWhat are you saying!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, can you two show some mercy? The firm is insanely busy. You can\u2019t just be like this and let us die. Lin Yixin, if you\u2019re going to be like this, we\u2019re going on strike!\u201d Xialing threatened.</p><br/><p>Alright, I won\u2019t tease her anymore, \u201cFine. I know. I\u2019ll return by tomorrow, ok?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? You better!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, for my hardworking Zhou Zhen and Wenwen, I will return tomorrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xialing coldly humphed, \u201cFor Zhou Zhen and Wenwen? What about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have time to call and bug me, you must be quite free. Anyway, I\u2019ll be back tomorrow. We\u2019ll talk then.\u201d I hung up the phone and realized my other hand was still covering Suyang\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Suyang was glaring at me with resentment. I removed my hand and patted his head like a dog, \u201cBe good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really leaving tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say I was unwilling to leave? Now that I\u2019m leaving, you should be happy!\u201d After teasing Xialing, it was time to tease Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was just kidding! Are you really going to leave me? I don\u2019t want to be home alone!\u201d Suyang covered his chest with the blanket and tried to act pitiful.</p><br/><p>I shook my head and pretended to sigh, \u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. I\u2019m a very busy person. Without me, the firm will go nuts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStay for a few more days! You know how painful long distance relationships are!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNah. Thinking about it, I\u2019ve actually stayed here for quite too long. I can\u2019t let my staff suffer. I must be responsible and head back.\u201d I stood up and put on my clothes. Then, I walked out of the bedroom as I took my cell phone and began looking for flights back to City B tomorrow.</p><br/><p>Suyang stormed out behind me, \u201cYou\u2019re going to leave me by myself at home?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped\u2026\u201d I looked up. But when I saw Suyang\u2019s naked body, I quickly turned around, \u201cI\u2019ll call you daily! And can you put on some clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang boldly laid on the couch and shook his head, \u201cWhy are you pretending to be modest? Aaai.. the pain of a long distance relationship\u2026 the boyfriend that gets ditched\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>I threw a blanket at Suyang and continued to search for flights. From time to time, I would glance at him. Suyang wasn\u2019t saying anything but his pupils were rolling around. I knew he must be up to no good.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you think about now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYixin, did you bring your household registration booklet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI asked if you brought you household registration booklet!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not. Who would bring that stuff with them on a business trip? Why do you need it?\u201d I rolled my eyes at Suyang. Suddenly, I thought of something, \u201cCould it be that\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang punched the couch, \u201cWhat a pity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat pity?\u201d I punched Suyang\u2019s head, \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it. I have no plans to settle down yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no longer young. It\u2019s time.\u201d Suyang suddenly spoke to me with a granny tone, \u201cHow old are you now? You\u2019re still not thinking about it? You won\u2019t be able to find a better candidate other than myself. You should cherish and seize your opportunity!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPssssh\u2026 you think you\u2019re the only young one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not young either. I want to find someone to get married with!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang put his head on my shoulder but I shoved it off, \u201cI\u2019m not a good person. I thought you knew this already!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to get married with an old woman.\u201d Suyang leaned on my shoulder again. This time, I wasn\u2019t as heartless and let him remain for a bit.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Suyang asked, \u201cAre you booking your flight right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBuy for two!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming too.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I noticed a bunch of properly dressed workers sitting particularly straight. They were filled with youthful energy. Most likely, they had just graduated and were the new hirees.</p><br/><p>I silently went over and stood next to them. Who would\u2019ve thought I would be mixed with these young students again? I confidently patted my hair. Ever since I had cut my hair short, my complexion had dramatically improved. Furthermore, I had taken extra measures to maintain my youthful looks. Who could tell I was nearly 30?!</p><br/><p>Now that I was making a lot of money, I naturally cared more about my appearances. After all, I was a woman. Skincare and beauty salons were part of a regular routine.</p><br/><p><i>Hmm\u2026strange\u2026the atmosphere around the new hirees wasn\u2019t what I expected at all. Why do they all look so guarded? Aren\u2019t they colleagues now? What the heck</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>A few moments later, a woman dressed in a suit came out and stood in front of the new hirees. \u201cI\u2019m the one in charge of leading you guys. My name is Luo Zhen. Based on how fresh you all look, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a young batch. In the future, call me Sister Luo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Zhen arrogantly swept her eyes over everyone. Then, she flipped open her agenda and continued, \u201cIn a bit, I will be taking you around the building so you can get familiar with it. After you learn who your superiors are, you will be split into different departments. When you arrived at your assigned department, there will be another superior to help you. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe understand.\u201d Everyone responded in unison.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, all of you are on probation right now. Three months later, only five of you will be given permanent positions. So, don\u2019t you dare slack off. The people around you are your colleagues, but also your competitors.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Oh\u2026. no wonder these kids have these looks on their faces. What a cruel world</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>Then, Luo Zhen took us on a tour around the building. Aside from Xu Chuqiao\u2019s office on the 21st floor, the 1st to the 43rd floor were part of the corporation. This comprised all sorts of departments.</p><br/><p>For the entire morning, we didn\u2019t do much aside from walking around and exploring the building. I didn\u2019t really pay attention to what Luo Zhen was saying since I wasn\u2019t truly going to work here. The only issue I cared about was whether I was getting blisters on my feet from walking too much.</p><br/><p><i>I shouldn\u2019t have wore high heels</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>I was limping and ended up at the very end of the line. With difficulty, I managed to last until 11:30 am.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. The tour is now complete. Now, you guys can report to your departments; just in time for lunch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Luo Zhen left confidently and at ease. She left all of the new hirees to stare at each other.</p><br/><p><i>Why weren\u2019t they moving? Was it because they didn\u2019t know their departments? I couldn\u2019t move now. If I moved, it would be obvious that I had gotten the job from an insider. I didn\u2019t want to get bullied by the group. </i></p><br/><p>Since no one moved, I remained still as well. As the psychological anxiety grew inside of me, I looked around and observed my surroundings.</p><br/><p>Just as I was figuring out my next move, a guy suddenly left the group and headed towards the elevator. Then, everyone else went to their designated departments.</p><br/><p>I finally understood. It wasn\u2019t that they didn\u2019t know their departments. It was because the atmosphere was too unfamiliar to them, so they were hesitant\u2026</p><br/><p>When I arrived at the marketing department, the guy that had left ahead of me was there too.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two are the only new hirees for the marketing department. I am the secretary for the marketing manager. My name is Luo Jing.\u201d A guy with glasses stood in front of us. His face was like a stiff emotionless robot.</p><br/><p><i>Another person with the surname Luo? Could all the Luos be undertaking the new hirees? It was also the first time I\u2019ve seen a male secretary. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cNow, I\u2019m going to bring you guys to see the manager. After meeting the manager, I will tell you guys the specific workflow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Jing led the way and we headed towards the marketing manager\u2019s office.</p><br/><p><i>Xu Chuqiao wanted me to keep an eye out for this person\u2026 he said he appeared out of nowhere and most likely had been hired by Yao Youfan. If I am able to investigate this person thoroughly, it would probably help me out a lot. </i></p><br/><p>Thinking of this, I put on my best game face. Luo Jing knocked on the door and a voice from inside echoed, \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Jing pushed open the door, and me and the guy followed closely behind. He stated, \u201cManager, the new hirees are here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The manager was sitting with his back facing us. As a result, we couldn\u2019t see his actual face. However, he gave me the impression that he was very cocky. He was definitely not a person I would want to mess with.</p><br/><p><i>Why does he have to show off his superiority to newbies? I\u2019ll give him 100% for putting on his act. </i>I tried to scan his desk to find out his name. But I didn\u2019t see a name sign anywhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cI welcome you guys to our marketing department. I\u2019m your superior.\u201d Suddenly, the marketing manager slowly turned his chair around. Then, he placed his name tag aggressively on the table. He had it in his hands the whole time.</p><br/><p><i>What kind of introduction was that</i>\u2026. I secretly felt a disdain towards him. But out of curiosity, I couldn\u2019t help but lift my head to look up at my new boss.</p><br/><p>However, the moment I made eye contact, I breathed out cold air and took a step back.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026..?\u201d</p><br/><p>The new worker and Luo Jing both turned to give me criticizing looks. <i>Hey, you can\u2019t blame me</i>\u2026.</p><br/><p>I stared at the man who made me tongue tied. <i>That face</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>My first reaction was to bow and apologize. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I think I\u2019m too excited from getting hired. Hence, I slept very poorly last night. I am hallucinating at the moment. Could I exit and re-enter again?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other new hiree secretly nudged me. It was as if he wanted to remind me, \u201cHow dare you try to talk about conditions with the marketing manager when you\u2019re a nobody?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou may.\u201d The familiar face was smiling. Then, he gently nodded, \u201cExit and re-enter again then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you! Thank you!\u201d I continuously bowed as I left the office. Then, I viciously slapped myself on the face twice, \u201cLin Yixin! You must pull yourself together! You cannot hallucinate again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne, two, three!\u201d I closed my eyes and counted on the inside. Then, I knocked on the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnter.\u201d</p><br/><p>I gritted my teeth and stomped on the ground. Next, I closed my eyes as I pushed the door open. I imagined my hallucination disappearing. The whole time, my mood was very heavy and my head was lowered. After taking a deep breath, I raised my head and stared at the marketing manager.</p><br/><p><i>There was no change\u2026. Was I sick to the point of no return? </i></p><br/><p>Last night, I had already dreamt of his fuzzy face. Now, his face was clearly in front of me. The smiling face was exactly a duplicate of Suyang\u2019s.</p><br/><p><i>It was that same face. The face that once made intense eye contact with me. It was the same high nose bridge that I touched while we were playing around. And the same lips I once kissed\u2026 it was exactly the same from three years ago. </i></p><br/><p>He stood up with a ridiculous amount of confidence and walked towards me. Although he was less than three metres away, I felt as if I had stepped across a light-year.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you more clear-headed now, Miss. Lin Yixin? Earlier, you were outside so you didn\u2019t hear my introduction. Allow me to re-introduce myself. I\u2019m the marketing manager for the Xu Clan Corporation, Suyang.\u201d</p><br/><p>I could feel Suyang\u2019s burning gaze despite having my head lowered. My mouth felt dry and breathing was difficult. My hands were tightly clenched into fists. There was a fire alarm going off in my head. Aside from the chaotic buzzing in my ears, I couldn\u2019t hear anything else.</p><br/><p>Time, space, air all seemed to have paused.</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what I was feeling, but it wasn\u2019t the joy of meeting an old friend. In fact, I felt like I had been caught in a hopeless manner.</p><br/><p><i>Wait a sec! What\u2019s going on?! \u2026..this is wrong! I haven\u2019t prepared myself for a reunion. W-why did we encounter each other here?</i> Regardless of how I rubbed my eyes, I couldn\u2019t believe Suyang was the marketing manager of this company. He was my superior!</p><br/><p>After I confirmed that I wasn\u2019t hallucinating from a lack of sleep, I remained still like a frozen piece of ice. I couldn\u2019t move at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss. Lin Yixin, could it be that you\u2019re surprised the marketing manager is myself? I guess you recognize me?\u201d Suyang murmured.</p><br/><p><i>No! I lifted my head up in fear. I gave him a warning glance: Suyang, you can\u2019t expose our relationship here! Or else\u2026.or else everything will be even more complicated!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cThis type of situation occurs quite often. I guess you must be one of my fans!\u201d Suyang lightly patted my back. \u201cAlthough I was an author two years ago, I\u2019ve retired from that field. I entered this company because I have a Masters of Finance. So now, I\u2019m just an ordinary office worker. Hope we will get along great!\u201d</p><br/><p>Based on the new hiree\u2019s confused expression, I was positive he had no idea Suyang was an author previously. I never thought that Suyang would be the person that Xu Chuqiao wanted me to investigate. <i>This was the first time we met in three years, and now I have to investigate him?</i></p><br/><p><i>I never wanted this to happen</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>Although I had no idea what he went through these past few years, I knew Suyang was a schemer. I was not up to his par. <i>What am I going to do? I just started a new job and I have already encountered a blockage.</i>..</p><br/><p>\u201cI have nothing else to say. You guys may go and do your job now.\u201d Suyang turned around and returned back to his seat.</p><br/><p>That sentence gave me so much relief. It was like being told I was getting released from a life-imprisonment sentence. Obviously, I couldn\u2019t show how I truly felt. I had to keep all my emotions hidden.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I turned around and wanted to get out of the office as soon as possible. I really couldn\u2019t handle the awkward and strange atmosphere. I needed to breathe in fresh air. If I stayed here any longer, I was worried I would suffocate\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Yixin candidate, please remain here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang\u2019s command caused me to heavily sink to the bottom of the ocean. It was as if my four limbs were made of lead.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

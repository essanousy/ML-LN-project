For him, I die.</b></p><br/><p>Director Rui pinched my chin as he tilted my head up to face him.</p><br/><p>I knew that the more afraid I acted, the more disadvantaged my position was. However, my legs couldn\u2019t help but shake, and my lips were turning dry. Even if I wanted to, I couldn\u2019t conceal it.</p><br/><p>Director Rui began to lower his head slowly. He was minimizing our distance, and his breathing was getting closer towards me as well.</p><br/><p>*Pa*</p><br/><p>Time seemed to froze.</p><br/><p>Somehow, I found enough courage to actually slap Director Rui across the face.</p><br/><p>The slap caught him by surprise.</p><br/><p>While he was in shock, I lowered my head and began to run.</p><br/><p>But before I could leave the garden, suddenly, two men in black leaped out of an underbrush and blocked my path.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Director Rui was holding onto his face as he menacingly walked towards me.</p><br/><p><i>Alright! This time, he\u2019s really mad\u2026</i></p><br/><p>\u201cTake her away!\u201d He commanded the two men in black. That was the last line I heard before I lost consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p><i>Whatever that was beneath me felt so soft. Was I dead? Am I in Heaven? </i></p><br/><p>*Hua la la* The sound of water interrupted my thoughts. I bounced up from the bed and inspected my body. I was still alive, and my clothes were intact\u2026</p><br/><p>My intuition told me I had to get the hell out. But the entrance was by the bathroom, and I had no idea who was showering. Hence, I was hesitant to move. I dug for my cell phone and wanted to give Suyang a call. It was then I realized I already had over ten missed calls from him.</p><br/><p>Based on the time, most likely the event had ended ages ago. Suyang couldn\u2019t find me, so he was anxious.</p><br/><p>I hid behind the window curtain and quietly dialed Suyang\u2019s number. I kept my eyes on the bathroom door the entire time.</p><br/><p>Suyang picked up the moment the call went through. Immediately, he began to lecture me, \u201cI already told you not to run off! Where did you go? Do I seriously have to buy a chain and tie it around your neck in order to watch over you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang\u2019s voice volume was too loud. I hurriedly lowered the volume of my phone to the lowest degree possible. Then, I whispered and sought for assistance, \u201cI was discovered by Director Rui, come save me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you now? I\u2019m coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 I think I\u2019m inside a hotel room. There is someone showering inside the bathroom. I think it\u2019s Director Rui.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk, whatever you do, get out of the room as soon as possible. I\u2019ll figure out a way to locate you. And remain on the phone with me, got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>I began to reflect on my thoughts. Wouldn\u2019t Suyang\u2019s position be revealed if he comes to rescue me? If that\u2019s the case, then all his efforts of getting close to Mi Fan would have been wasted.</i></p><br/><p>Thinking of this, I decisively hung up and stuffed the phone back into my pocket.</p><br/><p><i>Lin Yixin! You must rely on yourself under these circumstances! </i></p><br/><p>I came out from the curtains and tiptoed towards the entrance. As I walked by, the water in the bathroom suddenly halted. I literally stopped breathing from where I was. My eyes couldn\u2019t help but stare at the bathroom door. Three seconds later, the water turned on again. I felt relieved as I increased my speed towards the exit.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make any noise! Don\u2019t make any noise!\u201d I prayed from within. I pressed down onto the horizontal bar as gently as possible \u2013</p><br/><p>*BEEP BEEP BEEP* The ear piercing sound of the alarm began to sound and the water in the bathroom came to a grunting stop. There was no time to waste. I quickly ran out before Director Rui could come out.</p><br/><p><i>Who would\u2019ve thought he would put an alarm on at the door? </i></p><br/><p>I ran towards the emergency exit with all my might. I could see victory ahead of me. Unexpectedly, a hand reached over and covered my mouth; then I was dragged backwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmmmm\u2026.\u201d I fought as hard as I could. Even my high heels came off. But the strength of a man was too much. How could I resist him? I could see the room again.</p><br/><p>I wanted to cry for help, but I wasn\u2019t able to make a sound.</p><br/><p>I aggressively scratched his arms and I could see the bloody scars that I made. Director Rui only breathed a sigh of cold air, but there was no indication that he was going to release my mouth.</p><br/><p>Ultimately, Director Rui brought me back to his room and flung me onto the bed. He used so much strength that I rolled over a few times and ended on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d I rubbed my shoulder. I felt like it had been dislocated as I tried to climb up with difficulty. In front of me was Director Rui with only a towel around his lower part of his body.</p><br/><p>Without his glasses, he seriously looked like a pervert.</p><br/><p>He placed his hand on my arm and coldly laughed, \u201cSweetheart, this is the price you have to pay for what you\u2019ve done!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he began to lean towards me. I was so frightened that I ran to the other side of the bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-\u2026.y-y- you, don\u2019t come near me!\u201d For some reason, I began to stutter as I flung the pillow towards Director Rui. I turned around once again and attempted to escape the second time.</p><br/><p>But my short legs only managed to take a few steps before I was caught again\u2026</p><br/><p>Director Rui grabbed onto my two hands and made me face him. Then, he narrowed the distance between as and locked me down onto the soft, big bed.</p><br/><p>Due to his restraint, I wasn\u2019t able to move at all. My heart was a mess. Suddenly, I wanted to cry. <i>I shouldn\u2019t have came. I regretted not listening to Suyang. Also, I was disgusted by the person in front of me\u2026.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cI have never failed to get any woman that I wanted!\u201d It was as if he was making a last announcement. Director Rui began to remove my outerwear.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop! You beast!\u201d I was struggling and cursing at the same time, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just kill me? Kill me!!\u201d I pleaded desperately.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill you?\u201d Director Rui sneered as he paused his actions, \u201cI will. But prior to that, I\u2019m going to enjoy myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>He seemed so experienced. I wondered how many times he had done something like this. In only a few moments, my clothes were torn. I could see faintly see my bra and underwear.</p><br/><p>Tears became to roll down uncontrollably. Internally, I was thoroughly defeated. I was so upset at how weak and useless I was\u2026.</p><br/><p>Just as I were planning to bite my tongue and commit suicide to maintain my innocence, I felt the heavy weight being lifted off me. By the time I snapped out of it, Director Rui was on the ground.</p><br/><p>I watched Suyang punched and kicked Director Rui and I stopped crying. In my eyes, his movements appeared to be in slow motion. I felt like he was a hero.</p><br/><p>I wrapped the blanket around my body as I staggered off the bed. But I had no intentions of stopping Suyang.</p><br/><p><i>Punch him a few more times! Who told him to bully me??! </i></p><br/><p><i>Yeah! Like that! Left foot! Right foot! Right foot! Left foot! Hehe!</i></p><br/><p><i>Beat him! Beat him! Beat him\u2026..</i></p><br/><p>Okay, things were starting to get out of hand. Suyang didn\u2019t seem like he had any intentions of stopping. Directo Rui was defenseless against Suyang\u2019s fierce attacks.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I think it\u2019s enough!?\u201d I rushed to stop Suyang, but he shoved me aside.</p><br/><p><i>Was I the one bullied or him?</i> I was confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s enough! Let\u2019s go!\u201d I tried to ignore the pain on my shoulder as I used all my strength to grab onto Suyang\u2019s arm. I realized his eyes were scarlet.</p><br/><p>Before Director Rui could directly see Suyang\u2019s face, I rushed to drag him towards the exit.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two!\u201d I heard Director Rui screeched. Then, he lowered his head and took out a gun from a cabinet next to him. He pointed it at Suyang and me, \u201cGo die!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, aside from me, it was as if time stopped.</p><br/><p>Ever since meeting Suyang, I began to care more and more about my life. Because of him, I began to have an excuse to live on. But if I had to give up my precious life today, the only reason would be for Suyang.</p><br/><p>For him, I live. For him, I die.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

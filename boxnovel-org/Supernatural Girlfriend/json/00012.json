After all, her parents probably despised me right now\u2026but since she gestured, I did as she wanted. I went over to Sheyu\u2019s mother and crouched down as I lightly helped wiped the tears off her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, auntie. Your daughter will be ok.\u201d I softly whispered. It was a lie, but as long as I could comfort her distressed mother, I would do it.</p><br/><p>The policewoman\u2019s mother lifted her head and looked at me. Her eyes were brimming with fresh tears. After staring at me for a few moments, she tightened her grip on my hand and embraced me as she sobbed.</p><br/><p>As she weeped in my arms, she began to cry louder and louder.</p><br/><p>Although she wasn\u2019t resentful towards me, but through her tears, I felt a responsibility that I couldn\u2019t deny.</p><br/><p>The surgeon came out and everyone stood up surrounding him.</p><br/><p>I felt like there was something blocking my heart. I remained where I was as I waited for the surgeon to announce the grievous news.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor now, the patient\u2019s life is preserved, but she is still unconscious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for preserving her life! Thank you, surgeon! When will our daughter wake up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is hard to say\u2026it could take a day, or a month, or even a year. We already did everything we can. Now, it will depend on the patient\u2019s will to survive.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I listened to the surgeon\u2019s words, I stared at Sheyu\u2019s ghost; confused.</p><br/><p>The surgeon implied that Sheyu was still alive? But I could see her spirit right here!</p><br/><p>Sheyu was pushed out of the emergency room and brought into the intensive care unit. I was still confused as I stood there foolishly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt your convenience, we will need you to come with me to the police station to record an oral statement.\u201d The policeman told me.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! I\u2019lI get the discharging paperwork done and come with you now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no. You\u2019ve misunderstood. I\u2019m not trying to rush you. I just\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re not trying to rush me. But I also want to leave an oral statement as soon as possible to help you guys find the criminal. It\u2019s not only for me. I also want to do it for the policewoman. We need to capture this psycho as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your cooperation! I will help you with the discharging paperwork. Just wait inside your room. I will pick you up after.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the policeman disappeared like a wisp of smoke. As I stared at his rear view, I could tell that he wanted me to leave the hospital as soon as possible so that I can provide information to the police to arrest the killer.</p><br/><p>After all, his colleague nearly lost her life. It must be traumatic for their police department.</p><br/><p>When I returned back to my room, I changed back into my own clothing that was covered in Sheyu\u2019s blood. Sheyu the ghost was waiting for me by the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it. You\u2019re already a ghost, but why did the surgeon say you\u2019re still alive?\u201d I asked Sheyu, but did not get a response.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, that is not focus right now. Perhaps your spirit is only temporarily separated from your physical body. Maybe you will return soon. Currently, the most important task is to capture the psycho. Don\u2019t worry. I am going to head to the police department to make an oral statement now. Do you want to come with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sheyu nodded.</p><br/><p>By the time I had finished precisely regurgitating everything that I knew at the police station, it was already midnight.</p><br/><p>Within ten steps, I was surrounded by a crowd of reporters.</p><br/><p>Countless amount of blinding flashes made it difficult for me to open my eyes. I heard \u2018ka cha\u2019 left and right. Everyone was striving to be the first to question me. They raised their voices and all the sounds clashed against each other. The quiet night was now replaced by a crazy crowd that was damaging my eardrums.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the chain homicidal maniac\u2019s 10th victim and lucky survivor. How do you feel right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see what the chain homicidal maniac looked like?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould you give us the general idea of what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRumours say a police officer had been injured. Is it true?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>How did they know I had encountered the chain homicidal maniac?! Who spread the news? Uggh. F**k. What am I supposed to say?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing?\u201d A few police officers stormed out and barged through the group of reporters. They encircled me and block the reporters from touching me. A police officer softly whispered in my ears, \u201cGo now.\u201d</p><br/><p>I saw my opportunity and slipped through the gap they had created for me. Without turning back, I entered a taxi.</p><br/><p>Since the police officers blocked them, the reporters couldn\u2019t get to me. I sighed a breath of relief as I leaned back against the seat. Along the way, the taxi driver kept peeking at me through his rear mirror. There were a few times where we made eye contact. I could understand how he felt. It was in the middle of the night and his passenger was covered in blood; anyone in his position would be afraid.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, don\u2019t be scared. This is not my blood\u2026\u201d I attempted to comfort him.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the moment I said those words, the driver dramatically braked. He appeared even more frightened.</p><br/><p>I guess he misunderstood my words\u2026.the car began to move again. The more I said, the more mistakes I\u2019d make. We remained silent all the way until my destination.</p><br/><p>Since, Sheyu was a ghost, only I could see her. So I brought her along with me. When my hot bodyguard saw her at the entrance, he kept turning around to stare at her.</p><br/><p><i>Ohhh! You like this policewoman because she is pretty, eh? Hummpt! So swallow!</i></p><br/><p>Deep down, I secretly looked down on him.</p><br/><p>Anyhow, I figured Suyang would have been asleep long ago. I didn\u2019t want to wake him up by making too much noise, so I tried my best to open the door as softly as possible. I was trying to avoid conflict at all cost.</p><br/><p>I gently pushed the door open. I was so silent that the detector couldn\u2019t even detect me and the light didn\u2019t naturally turn on. I took off my shoes, and just as I was about to walk through the entrance hall, I noticed Suyang sitting in the dark.</p><br/><p>Suyang was on his chair with his legs spread and arms crossed. His head was lowered and he was facing the entrance.</p><br/><p><i>It looks like he fell asleep.. Was he waiting for me the entire time\u2026in that position? </i>I pointed towards my door and indicated for Sheyu to head there and wait for me.</p><br/><p>After Sheyu left, I lightly shoved Suyang, \u201cHey. Wake up! Wake up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang slightly shifted but there was no more movement afterwards. I pushed him again; this time, with more strength. \u201cDon\u2019t sleep here! You\u2019ll easily get sick. Return to your room.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Suyang grabbed my hand and slowly opened his eyes. I was shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you go? Why did you come back so late?\u201d Wow, this reaction was totally not what I had expected. Suyang wasn\u2019t using his usual annoying and arrogant tone. Instead, he was being abnormally gentle.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t scare me. Even Suyang is acting weird\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d Suyang stared at my bloody top.</p><br/><p>\u201cTalking should remain talking. Can you let go of my hand?\u201d I attentively stared at my hand that Suyang had been holding on so tightly, \u201cMen and women should keep a proper distance from each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing my words, Suyang released my hand like a reflex as he got up and his chair wheeled backwards. He appeared flustered as he tried to explain himself, \u201cI didn\u2019t intentionally grab you. But when you suddenly woke me up\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>I put on my slippers and walked over to him as I tapped his shoulders and attempted to sound as natural as possible, \u201cI know you didn\u2019t do it on purpose. No need to explain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t answered my question. What happened to you?\u201d Suyang pointed at my bloody clothes as he leaned closer towards me and cautiously looked to the left and right. He whispered in my ears, \u201cDid you commit murder?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

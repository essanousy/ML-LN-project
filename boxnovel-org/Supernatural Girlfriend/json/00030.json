She placed it in front of me. \u201cThere is a way to communicate with ghosts\u2026.I can help you. But beyond a doubt, this method has a risk factor. I urge you to think it clearly beforehand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat type of method\u2026.?\u201d I was totally driven by my curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can allow the ghost to enter your body. Once you are both using the same body, she will know whatever you\u2019re thinking and you will know whatever she\u2019s thinking. This is called exchanging consciousness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll know about her life?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour thoughts will be interconnected. It\u2019s sort of like an internal exchange. But I cannot guarantee what you\u2019ll find out is the truth. If the ghost decides to lie to you, everything you\u2019ll know will be a lie.\u201d</p><br/><p>I roughly understood Grandmother Meng\u2019s words as I turned around to shoot a glance at the Xu Weishan ghost that was standing outside. She had stretched her neck in as she anxiously waited for me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought spirits that can enter the bodies were made up in movies!\u201d I was hesitant; unsure of whether I should do it.</p><br/><p>Grandmother Meng coldly chuckled, \u201cMost people believe ghosts are made up, but you can see them, right?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Oh, that\u2019s true. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cIf I let her come inside me, will there be any side effects? Would it be like the movies\u2026.where in the end, it isn\u2019t me? Would my spirit be replaced?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you need a professional like myself to guide you so that you can prevent ghosts with bad intentions from harming you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, does this mean you promise to help me?\u201d I gave Grandmother Meng a coquettish gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t help you, who else can help you?\u201d Suddenly, Grandmother Meng took out a kitchen knife from her drawer and turned to me. \u201cIf you want my help, then let\u2019s quit the chit chat and start. Later, I have some personal matters to deal with. So let\u2019s get this done quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Now? So sudden? I\u2019m not ready yet\u2026.\u201d I began to recoil my body; mainly because the kitchen knife looked too frightening in her hand. It looked like the type of knife that people used to chop up bones. I wonder what she was going to use it for? Is it because she wants to kill me?</p><br/><p>Seeing how I was backing away, Grandmother Meng shook her head and forcefully came over to grab my hand as she raised the kitchen knife and slit my forefinger. Fresh blood instantly gushed out.</p><br/><p>I stared at the blood coming out of my finger and yelped, \u201cYou! My hand! Blood! Blood! It\u2019s bleeding!\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmother Meng disregarded my yelling and dragged me back to the table. She used the bowl to catch the continuous blood that was flowing from my finger. After a few moments later, she flung me some gauze and told me to wrap my finger myself.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t disinfect the knife, right?\u201d I sorrowfully held onto my forefinger as I glared at Grandmother Meng. At the same time, I didn\u2019t want to make it too obvious. So, I used the gauze to tie a simple knot around my injury as I sobbed, \u201cSo painful\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy time is very precious. Let\u2019s settle your matters now!\u201d Grandmother Meng didn\u2019t feel the slightest pity for me. She pointed at the multi-coloured bed and said, \u201cGo and lay there.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Was this actually going to work? Would there be any problems?</i> Deep down, I was beginning to have a lot of doubts.</p><br/><p>But since I had already entered a pirate\u2019s boat, it was too late to get off.</p><br/><p>I lay on the bed and Grandmother Meng placed an eye mask on me. First, I heard the tick tock sounds of a timer. Then, everything around me began to turn very blurry.</p><br/><p>By the time I opened my eyes again, Kevin was standing in front of me.</p><br/><p>You\u2026.</p><br/><p>I wanted to speak, but I couldn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t even able to control my movements.</p><br/><p>Kevin was smiling. <i>What does he want from me? How come he\u2019s getting so close? Huh? Eh? His whole face was on mines! He was kissing me? How come I don\u2019t feel anything? </i></p><br/><p><i>Could this be the exchange of thoughts? I\u2019m in Xu Weishan\u2019s memory?</i></p><br/><p>I kept trying to get my body to move, and the scenes before my eyes kept changing. I was quite certain that everything I was seeing was from Xu Weishan\u2019s past.</p><br/><p>She was taking me to see her past life.</p><br/><p>There didn\u2019t seem to be any noticeable differences between the old Xu Weishan and Kevin and the new Xu Weishan and Kevin. They looked like the typical boyfriend girlfriend relationship. They roamed around the park, watch movies, hug, kiss\u2026.all their past moments were flashing in front of my eyes. I was able to relive their experiences once more.</p><br/><p>They were so in love. <i>Couldn\u2019t Kevin feel that his girlfriend was a different person? He had never questioned the current Xu Weishan? </i></p><br/><p>While these thoughts were running through my mind, there was a letter that had appeared in front of \u201cme\u201d. The content was as follows:</p><br/><p><b>Please go to the National Art Gallery alone. I have something important to inform you. </b></p><br/><p>When I arrived at the National Art Gallery, the fake Xu Weishan was there. She was Xu Weishan\u2019s twin sister.</p><br/><p>Next, it was the clich\u00e9 sister we-have-finally-met moment. However, as far as I know, in Xu Weishan\u2019s memories, she had never told anyone about her twin sister\u2019s existence. If she had, perhaps the future tragedy could have been avoided.</p><br/><p>From then on, Xu Weishan\u2019s life revolved around her younger sister and boyfriend. Aside from going on dates with her boyfriend, she would occasionally meet her younger sister and give her some pocket money.</p><br/><p>Based on what the fake Xu Weishan was wearing, she was probably not living very well.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister, didn\u2019t I tell you not to tell anyone about my existence? Who do you want me to meet?\u201d The fake Xu Weishan said to \u201cme\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know when you see him.\u201d \u201cI\u201d smiled at the fake Xu Weishan and led her to the corner of a coffee shop. I pointed at Kevin, who was sitting by the window. \u201cThat is my boyfriend, Kevin. To me, you two are the most important people in my life. After giving a lot of consideration, I want to introduce you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I say not to let people know about me? Why are you\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t told him yet. I\u2019m seeking for your opinion right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to meet him.\u201d Then, the fake Xu Weishan shoved me a bit and said, \u201cGo focus on your date. Don\u2019t think about introducing us.\u201d</p><br/><p>She shoved \u201cme\u201d out and Kevin happened to see, so he waved. Since he waved at \u201cme\u201d, I had no choice but to walk towards him by myself.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you feeling today? It looks like there\u2019s a lot on your mind.\u201d Kevin asked me.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing. What are you reading?\u201d \u201cI\u201d switched the topic as my eyes floated towards the fake Xu Weishan. She was still watching us from afar.</p><br/><p>In my opinion, at the time, the fake Xu Weishan\u2019s eyes were already kind of unstable. But perhaps in \u201cmy\u201d eyes, she was just curious.</p><br/><p>The weather was great on this lovely weekend afternoon. A handsome boy and a beautiful girl was facing each other in a romantic coffee shop. Their happy interactions would have been perfect if there wasn\u2019t an extra pair of restless eyes at the corner.</p><br/><p>From then on, whenever \u201cI\u201d mentioned Kevin, there would be some type of unclear emotions lingering in the fake Xu Weishan\u2019s eyes. I wonder if the real Xu Weishan was stupid. Why would she keep mentioning Kevin to her younger sister?</p><br/><p>On a blistering hot summer day, while the Sun was hanging right in the sky without any clouds blocking, I received a text message:</p><br/><p><b>Elder sister, today at 3pm, meet met at the outskirts of the car factory. Just us two. I have something very important to tell you. </b></p><br/><p><i>Don\u2019t go! </i></p><br/><p>I screamed from within. <i>What a suspicious and meticulous place! Only a fool would go!</i></p><br/><p>But regardless of how loud I shrieked, the body still moved on its own.</p><br/><p>Xu Weishan made the biggest mistake in her life. She was already at the abandoned car factory.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister.\u201d The fake Xu Weishan suddenly appeared and scared \u201cme\u201d. After I carefully gazed at her, I noticed the fake Xu Weishan had bruises on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister, this time you must help me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without saying anything further, she directly got down on her knees and pleaded, \u201cI honestly have no other choice but to come to you, elder sister. I won\u2019t be able to live on.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

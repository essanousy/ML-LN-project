I shouldn\u2019t be the one to tell you about it\u2026please don\u2019t be mad\u2026.\u201d I lightly tugged Suyang\u2019s sleeve as I tried to look pitiful.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t followed you today, what would\u2019ve happened?\u201d Suyang\u2019s tone had improved a lot. Now, he sounded gentle instead of critical.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were following me the whole time? Then, why didn\u2019t you come over to help me get in? I was waiting at the entrance like a fool!\u2026that\u2019s why the security guard caught me\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang smacked my head lightly, \u201cSince you can\u2019t tell me about Gao Jialan, I can at least ask about you, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d I was confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw you at the television entrance talking to air; waving your hands around\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I already knew what he wanted to say. Before Suyang could finish his sentence, I hastily grabbed onto my chest and furrowed my brows. I dramatically sat down, \u201cAiya! Aiyaya\u2026! I\u2019m in pain\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Suyang held onto me, \u201cIs it your old wound?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I ran too fast, so it affected the gunshot wound. Oh noooo. I am in too much pain! I can\u2019t handle it!\u201d I limply laid in Suyang\u2019s arms as my brain spun around like a whirlwind, thinking: <i>Oh no! Suyang caught me talking to Wen Yufan! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really in pain?\u201d Suyang was a bit suspicious.</p><br/><p>I tried my best to look like I was suffering and nodded like mad.</p><br/><p><i>If only I could squeeze a few tears out right now\u2026 damn it! My acting skills need work!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go to the hospital. Climb up!\u201d Suyang turned around and bent down for me to climb onto his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go to the hospital. Let\u2019s go home\u2026.\u201d I carefully whimpered as I slowly scrambled onto Suyang\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>While Suyang was carrying me, I could clearly see the green veins popping out around his neck and his bulging Adam\u2019s apple. It was an extremely hot day. It must be quite a strenuous task to carry me. I used my hands to wipe the sweat off Suyang\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>But after wiping his neck, I couldn\u2019t control my hands and they landed on Suyang\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple.</p><br/><p>Suyang froze on the spot.</p><br/><p>Two seconds later, he replied, \u201cAre you actually in pain or are you pretending because you want to change the topic?</p><br/><p>I instantly removed my hand and rested my head weakly on Suyang\u2019s shoulder. I moaned about my imaginary illness, \u201cI am in pain\u2026. My chest is hurting. Let\u2019s not talk and hurry home!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, I smacked my right leg against Suyang\u2019s butt and went, \u201cGo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang couldn\u2019t help but smile, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, we\u2019re not done with this talk! After we get home, I\u2019m going to have a chat with you. Don\u2019t you dare think of escaping\u2026.\u201d After a pause, he suddenly changed the direction of the conversation and smiled cunningly, \u201cBut if your chest is hurting too much, I can take a look at it for you when we get home\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>I smacked Suyang on the head, \u201cWhy is your mind always filled with dirty thoughts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re the only one who can tease me? I\u2019m just reciprocating this type of behaviour!\u201d Suyang retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou and your fallacious reasonings!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you argue with me, I can\u2019t guarantee you won\u2019t fall off!\u201d Suyang threatened as he tilted his body towards one side.</p><br/><p>I thought I was about to fall, so I held on tight like I was holding onto my dear life. Then, Suyang straightened his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play around like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang loudly sighed, \u201cI can\u2019t tell who\u2019s the boss and assistant anymore. It\u2019s such a hot day, and I have to carry you! Go lose some weight. You\u2019re too heavy!\u201d</p><br/><p>I ignored Suyang\u2019s words as I continued to rest on his back. But I placed my hands above his eyes to help him shield from the Sun.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe ran too far. We\u2019re so far from the car\u2026.\u201d Suyang depressingly stared into a distant space. He was acting as if we had to cross the Sahara Desert.</p><br/><p>Along the way, he continued to mutter in resentment. From time to time, he would criticize my weight. I just secretly giggled on his back.</p><br/><p><i>Thank you for accommodating me. Thank you for trusting me\u2026.in every way\u2026</i></p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>Although I managed to diverge the topic, I couldn\u2019t guarantee I would be able to use the same tactic next time. If I didn\u2019t think of a solution now, I was afraid that Suyang will question me again.</p><br/><p>In terms of Gao Jialan\u2019s personal issue, I asked her to personally explain it to Suyang. After she told him what was going on, Suyang\u2019s face darkened. Most likely, he was mad because I hid something so important from him\u2026</p><br/><p>As a result, I had to sleep on the couch for two continuous nights\u2026</p><br/><p>We were like a married couple; I was the husband that got kicked out.</p><br/><p>During our cold battle, Suyang wouldn\u2019t say a single word to me. Each time I tried to get closer to him, he would automatically leave the area. At the same time, I was afraid if we conversed, he would question me about that day again\u2026</p><br/><p>But avoiding was not a solution. After all, we haven\u2019t gotten together for a long time. I felt like the so-called honeymoon period was like an eraser. Due to the mistakes I have made, it was disappearing with time.</p><br/><p>For the past few days, Gao Jialan and I were carefully surviving by observing Suyang\u2019s behaviour. The atmosphere at home was very uncomfortable now.</p><br/><p>\u201cKa\u2026.ka\u2026.ka\u2026.\u201d I was afraid that if I chewed my apple too loudly, it would affect Suyang. So I first bit my teeth into the apple and gazed at Suyang for his reaction. Then, I used the least amount of sound and the slowest tempo to chew.</p><br/><p>After I was halfway through, I suddenly felt a cold aura.</p><br/><p>It felt like there was a ghost coming near me\u2026. No! It was more frightening than a ghost.</p><br/><p>I slowly turned around and saw Suyang staring right behind me.</p><br/><p><i>Awkward\u2026. </i></p><br/><p><i>My teeth had already sunk into the apple. If I pull it out, it would be kind of gross. But if I didn\u2019t, I would just leave it there because I didn\u2019t dare to take a bite while he was watching me\u2026.</i></p><br/><p><i>It was tough holding on. I could feel the drool coming out\u2026</i></p><br/><p><i>Was he going to say something or not? What\u2019s his intention? Is he about to question me again? Or does he want to continue the cold battle?</i> I slowly got my hand ready. I was prepared to act again\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter you\u2019re done eating the apple, tidy up. We\u2019re going to go somewhere today.\u201d Then, Suyang went to his room.</p><br/><p><i>He finally spoke to me! And it was a normal interaction! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cI will do as you bid!\u201d I happily saluted and devoured the rest of my apple. Then, I ran to my bedroom to pick out some clothes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you heading out?\u201d Gao Jialan must have heard Suyang speaking to me. She quietly tiptoed towards me as she held onto the door frame.</p><br/><p>\u201cYup!\u201d I nodded confidently.</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan was relieved, \u201cSuyang is finally speaking to you. Are you guys ok now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d After selecting my outfit, I was experiencing mixed feelings. I was aware that lately Gao Jialan had been quite worried about my relationship with Suyang. So in order to lower her stresses, I lifted my spirit and gave her a brilliant smile. \u201cWe should be ok. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you guys are ok, then that\u2019s good. Or else, I will feel very guilty because it was my fault\u2026.\u201d Gao Jialan looked down in shame as she touched her stomach.</p><br/><p>I stared at her little bump. <i>There\u2019s a life inside\u2026.damn..it\u2019s so magical.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cToday, you\u2019re probably going to eat by yourself. Are you ok with that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a child, of course I am!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p><i>After thinking about it, this should be my first official date with Suyang?! It was a date, right? I wasn\u2019t sure</i>\u2026.</p><br/><p>I tried my best to do my makeup and then got Gao Jialan to evaluate. She gave me a helpless look and wiped everything off. She wanted to help me redo it.</p><br/><p><i>Was she the Leonardo Da Vinci of the makeup world?</i> Today, I finally learned something. But no matter how I looked at it, Gao Jialan\u2019s creation did not seem natural at all\u2026. I was quite unsure about myself as she pushed me out into the living room.</p><br/><p>When Suyang made eye contact with me, I could instantly sense his shock. His body trembled a little, and then he slowly stood up. His voice was raspy, \u201cLet\u2019s go\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I touched my red powdered cheeks and flushed. The redness could be compared to those who remained high up on the Tibetan mountains for a week; lacking oxygen.</p><br/><p>But although I hesitated, I still left the apartment like this because I didn\u2019t want to hurt Gao Jialan\u2019s feelings.</p><br/><p>When my ghost bodyguard saw me, his eyes almost popped out. He placed his hands around his cheeks; as if he wanted to tell me \u2013<i>your cheeks look really weird like this</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>I was walking behind Suyang. So I shook my head at my ghost bodyguard and mouthed the words, \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault\u2026.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

No need to be so dramatic. Tell me naturally. What happened to your face\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister, please lend me 200k! I owe people money. If I cannot return it, I\u2019ll be dead for sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c200k?!? Where would I get so much money from? You\u2019re only a student! How can you owe someone 200k?!\u201d \u201cI\u201d was stunned that my younger sister had requested such a huge amount. Deep down, Xu Weishan was thinking whether she had this amount.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time to explain right now. I really\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>While I was listening to my sister\u2019s excuse, suddenly everything turned black.</p><br/><p>I also felt a cool sensation from my head down to my toes.</p><br/><p>So chilly!</p><br/><p>I tried to move my fingers, it worked!</p><br/><p>I have returned back to reality?!</p><br/><p>I took off the eye mask and saw a restless Grandmother Meng pacing back and forth. When I took a look at myself, I realized I had been splashed with a bucket of cold water. My entire body was soaked.</p><br/><p>*Ahhh choo!* I sneezed. Before I could ask Grandmother Meng what had happened, she was rushing me off the bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet up! Get up!\u201d It was as if she was on fire as she smacked me. Next, she anxiously placed all the tools she had taken out back inside a huge trunk. Her movements were smooth; as if she had done this a couple hundred times before.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I wiped some water off my face and hair. I wanted to scold her, but seeing how busy she was, I didn\u2019t know how to begin.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry! Hurry up and help me! He\u2019s almost here! Quickly, help, and pull down all the black curtains.\u201d Grandmother Meng\u2019s sentences were all over the place as she urged me.</p><br/><p>Although I was confused and didn\u2019t know what was going on, I obediently followed her instructions since she was behaving so frantically. I began to pull down all the black curtains that were blocking the light from entering the room.</p><br/><p>Intense lighting began to pierce through the room. Since I was in the dark the entire time, it made it somewhat difficult for me to adjust.</p><br/><p>Now that I could see the apartment, it actually looked quite ordinary. It was only strange because Grandmother Meng had purposely hid all the sunlight and used some special lights to make a creepy effect.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Air conditioner! Turn off the air conditioner!\u201d Grandmother Meng was panicking so much that she pressed the warm breeze button on the remote control instead.</p><br/><p>At this moment, someone suddenly knocked on the front door. Both me and Grandmother Meng froze. Then, we heard the sounds of a door unlocking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis! Put all the curtains into the drawer! Hurry!\u201d There was no time to waste. Grandmother Meng rolled all the curtains into a ball and threw it at me. After I caught it in my arms, Grandmother Meng pushed me into a room, \u201cRemember, regardless of what happens, do not come out. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like that, I was kicked into the bedroom. I was so confused. <i>Could it be a bad guy knocking the door? Was Grandmother Meng in debt of some sort? Was it dangerous for me to be here? </i></p><br/><p>All types of worrying scenarios began to emerge from my mind. I held onto the curtains as I placed my ears on the door and attempted to hear the activity from outside.</p><br/><p>There were no sounds at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya\u2026wei\u2026\u201d I sighed. Then, I left the door and stuffed the curtains into the drawer. Afterwards, I sat down cross-legged on Grandmother Meng\u2019s bed as I analyzed the Xu Weishan\u2019s situation.</p><br/><p>Based on what she had shown me, she was killed by Xu Weishan in a fury because she didn\u2019t lend her money. So does that mean the fake Xu Weishan was a very dangerous person?!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, I recalled how she had threatened me a few days ago; it truly gave me chills. I have never faced such a vengeful person before\u2026</p><br/><p>My luck was very bad these days\u2026</p><br/><p><i>But if the fake Xu Weishan had replaced the real Xu Weishan for so long, Kevin should have definitely sensed something by now, right? </i></p><br/><p><i>Then again, which normal person would think of replacing their sister\u2019s identity? </i>\u2026.perhaps if I could guide Kevin a little, he will be able to connect the dots.</p><br/><p>He seems rather bright.</p><br/><p>But what the heck was going on with Grandmother Meng?</p><br/><p>I was starting to feel impatient from sitting on the bed. Plus, I was currently drenched from head to toe. She didn\u2019t even give me a towel\u2026</p><br/><p>Grandmother Meng was so cruel. Not only did she ruthlessly cut my finger, she splashed a whole bucket of cold water on me -there wasn\u2019t a single drop left.</p><br/><p>Couldn\u2019t she have used a more humane gentle method to wake me? For instance, a slap or something?</p><br/><p>I indistinctly heard a man\u2019s voice from outside. Once again, I quietly tiptoed towards the door as I bent an ear to listen.</p><br/><p><i>It was a man! A man\u2019s voice! </i></p><br/><p>I opened my mouth wide; in shock.</p><br/><p>I made a big assumption. <i>Could it be Grandmother Meng\u2019s boyfriend?</i></p><br/><p>Whoever the person is, based on how jittery Grandmother Meng was, this person definitely didn\u2019t want her to play around with eccentric spiritual things.</p><br/><p>Hmm, I shouldn\u2019t speak badly of her; since I am part of this group as well\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were playing with those messed up things again, weren\u2019t you?\u201d <i>Oh, she was caught? Hmmm, surprisingly, the man\u2019s voice sounded younger than I thought.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cNo! See? There\u2019s nothing here!\u201d Grandmother Meng quibbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll search! If I search and find something, then what?\u201d The man exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my wonderful grandson, now that you have grown up and you have ability, you speak to Grandmother in such a forceful tone. I can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t trust me. When you were little, if it weren\u2019t for me\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you not bring up that incident every time we argue? Don\u2019t you have any other tactics?\u201d The man irritatedly grumbled. However, he did seem to abandon the thought of searching for suspicious articles.</p><br/><p>Ohhh, so it turns out Grandmother Meng\u2019s grandson had arrived. He didn\u2019t want his grandmother to play with ghosts and demons. Hence, Grandmother Meng was so nervous.</p><br/><p>But, I still couldn\u2019t understand why she splashed water all over me. After her grandson leaves, I will definitely get a fair deal from this! Hm, maybe I\u2019ll tell her to give me 50% off for this appointment.</p><br/><p>I carefully planned it out in my mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother, you often have difficulties sleeping, right? I bought you a pillow that should help with sleep. I\u2019m going to put it in your room!\u201d The man called. I could hear his footsteps approaching closer and closer.</p><br/><p><i>Ah?! He was going to come in here?</i> I stared blankly at the door. My legs were beginning to tremble.</p><br/><p><i>Oh no! What should I do? Where can I hide?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cAh?! Xiao Su. Don\u2019t go inside the bedroom. I can bring it in later!\u201d I could hear the desperation in Grandmother Meng\u2019s voice as she tried to stop him. But it was too late\u2026</p><br/><p><i>Huh? Xiao Su? </i>That name sounds so familiar\u2026</p><br/><p><i>No wonder the man\u2019s voice sounded so familiar. Could it be? </i></p><br/><p>No, I can\u2019t sit here and wait for death. It was better if I run out! Thinking of this, I took off my jacket and covered my head with it. Deep down, I planned to count to three and storm out.</p><br/><p>After rushing for two seconds, turning right would lead me straight to the main exit. Lin Yixin! You can do it! I mapped out my entire route as I cheered myself on.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne, two, three\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>I ran up to the door, just as I was about to grip and push the handle, someone from outside had already opened the door.</p><br/><p>I totally lost balance and fell forward. The person in front of me promptly avoided me and I fell down flat on the ground\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026!\u201d Three people\u2019s voices rang in the air.</p><br/><p>One was a horrified yell; another was a guilty yelp, and lastly was a painful wail.</p><br/><p>I fell flat on my face. Then, I stealthily arched my back and looked up. Through my cowering body, my jacket revealed my eyes. I made eye contact with the handsome and familiar face.</p><br/><p>Grandmother Meng had already covered her eyes because she was too afraid to witness the following situation.</p><br/><p>The male MC that I had collided with scooped down and scrutinized me. Then, he pulled the jacket off my head and shockingly exclaimed, \u201cGoldfish?!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

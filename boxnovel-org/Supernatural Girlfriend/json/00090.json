I\u2019m gaming!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoldfish, pour a cup of water for me. I\u2019m thirsty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoldfish, turn the A/C on. It\u2019s too hot in here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoldfish, turn the A/C off. It\u2019s too cold\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>I honestly couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Before Suyang could finish his sentence, I aimed the cushion at his head and threw it at him. Surprisingly, he caught it and turned around with a pitiful expression, \u201cWhy must you treat me this way\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>My face was grim as I glared at him, \u201cWhat do you think? Hello?! I\u2019m a sick patient. How could you ask someone in a wheelchair to do things for you? Have you no shame?\u201d</p><br/><p>Currently, I was still considered a disabled person. Initially, I was anticipating how Suyang would take care of me. I thought I was finally going to experience what it was like to be taken care of. But it turned out\u2026.</p><br/><p>Since we\u2019ve arrived home, Suyang was adamant that using the wheelchair was much more efficient than manual labour. As a result, I was assigned more chores and tasks prior to my injury.</p><br/><p>Now, it was to the point where aside from eating his meals and using the washroom, I had to help him with everything else.</p><br/><p>\u201cGold\u2026..fishhhh\u2026\u201d Suyang deliberately stretched out my nickname. He sounded a bit whiny.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d I covered my ears and weakly leaned my head against the back of my wheelchair, \u201cSuyang. Stop calling me. Nowadays, each time I hear you say the word \u2018goldfish\u2019, I feel unwell. My brain is filled with goldfish, goldfish, goldfish, goldfish!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing this for your own good! You\u2019re always home, so you need to do more physical exercises! It\u2019s good for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>I shook my head, \u201cPreposterous! That is a preposterous argument!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, do you want me to take you out?\u201d Suyang walked over and threw a bag of chips and blanket on me. This time, it\u2019s my turn to serve you, ok?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget what you said!\u201d All of a sudden, I felt re-energized. I unfolded the blanket neatly over my knees. Then, I ripped open the bag of chips and began to chew, \u201cI\u2019m ready. We can go now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang lowered his head and chuckled a little. Then, he lifted his head and sighed hopelessly, \u201cI really don\u2019t know what to do with you\u2026 alright, Miss, let\u2019s set off!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>We had barely moved a step when Suyang made that questionable sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I turned around. Suyang\u2019s five facial features were scrunched together. He looked like he was suffering or something.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d Suyang roared. I was frightened. <i>Was he being possessed by a ghost or something? </i></p><br/><p>Just as I was about to freak out, he stopped the sound he was making and looked solemnly at me, \u201cTell me the honest truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang was acting so strange. I was seriously beginning to worry, \u201cAlright. Ask me. What\u2019s the question?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoldfish, did you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you secretly devour the 10kg of pork from the freezer? How could you be so much fatter? I can\u2019t even push the wheelchair\u2026 hahahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Suyang spoke, he couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing. Soon, he had to hold onto his stomach as he crouched down.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d I realized Suyang was teasing me. So, I smoothly turned the wheelchair around as I pinched his face, \u201cYou\u2019re calling me fat? Which part of me is fat, huh? Tell me! Tell me! I\u2019m really thin, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeeee, yesss..\u201d Since I was pinching Suyang\u2019s face, he had difficulties pronouncing the words. But he was still laughing hysterically.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop laughing! You\u2019re not allowed to laugh! Hurry up and let\u2019s go! No laughing!\u201d I pretended to be mad as I placed my hand near my chest area, \u201cOh, so painful. My injury is hurting\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>That stopped Suyang\u2019s laughter immediately. He hastily got up to examine my injury. \u201cWhat? It\u2019s hurting again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope! I tricked you!\u201d I began to tickle Suyang. This was my comeback to him for calling me fat, \u201cIs it funny? You think it\u2019s fun to tease me? Take this! Ha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Alright. No more messing around.\u201d Suyang embraced me in a warm hug. My head was leaning against his stomach. \u201cAlright, I\u2019m going to take you out now. Ok?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I looked up at Suyang with doubt, but I couldn\u2019t hide my smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, let\u2019s go!\u201d Suyang lifted my face and gave me a light kiss. Then, he turned my wheelchair around and slowly began to push me forward.</p><br/><p>Finally, we arrived at the park near our home. I greedily breathed in the fresh outside air. It had been such a long time since I\u2019ve left the apartment. In addition, I had a personal driver too! This lady is feeling great!</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been outside for so long. I am so happy!\u201d I munched on the potato chips as I smiled at Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at you! Your mouth is all oily now.\u201d Suyang wiped my mouth with his hand. Then, he wiped his oily hand on my clothes. I watched this terrible act unfold in front of my eyes. Yet, Suyang pretended as if nothing had happened. He leaned his head in and said, \u201cGive me a chip!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I shoved his head away, \u201cYou\u2019re my subordinate right now. Which master would feed their subordinates?\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, it was finally my turn to switch from being a peasant to a master. I was so emotional that I felt warm tears in my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. Don\u2019t give it then. You cheap ass! Don\u2019t forget, I\u2019m your boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCurrently, it isn\u2019t my working hours. You\u2019re not my boss. You\u2019re my boyfriend. You need to do what it takes to be a qualified boyfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Suyang stopped pushing and bent down to kiss me, \u201cLike this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! Who told you to do this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn books. Usually, couples whisper a lot of sweet nothings to each other. Weren\u2019t you secretly hinting for me to kiss you?\u201d Suyang gave me his most naive expression. He was truly gifted at making up bullshit.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could you connect everything I say to kissing? Do you really want to kiss me that badly?\u201d I joked around.</p><br/><p>The corners of Suyang\u2019s mouth curved into a cunning smile. But before he could make another move, I secretly pressed down on my wheelchair and backed away.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go off on my own. You remain where you are and kiss yourself! You kissing demon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go off on your own. There\u2019s a bridge up ahead. It\u2019s quite dangerous.\u201d Suyang said as he followed behind me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already been shot. Why would I be afraid of a bridge? This lady here has escaped death and is now invincible!\u201d I loudly yelled as I increased the speed of my wheelchair. I was heading straight towards the bridge over the lake.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoldfish, wait for me! It\u2019s too dangerous for you to go there by yourself!\u201d Suyang was shouting from behind me.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

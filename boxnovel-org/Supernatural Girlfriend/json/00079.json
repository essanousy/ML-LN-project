She innocently smiled and assumed I was a server as she exchanged her wine glass with a champagne glass while she continued her conversation with her husband.</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Wenxue\u2019s student\u2026.\u201d I quietly whispered into her ear. Then, I acted as if nothing happened and rushed away.</p><br/><p>I was afraid she would reveal a frightened expression as it would make others question my identity. So, I quickly headed to an area where there were no one else around. If she wanted to chase after me, we could have a chat one on one.</p><br/><p>I headed towards the female washroom.</p><br/><p>As expected, in a few moments, Mo Xiaotian joined me as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Although this wasn\u2019t exactly the ideal place to meet, at least we were alone. I didn\u2019t immediately respond to Mo Xiaotian\u2019s question. I made sure to check to see there were no one else in any of the stalls before I opened my mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi. My name is Lin Yixin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know Teacher Lu? What is your relationship with Teacher Lu? And what is your motive for talking to me?\u201d Mo Xiaotian coldly questioned me. She appeared very guarded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it clear. I need your help. In order for you to trust me, I\u2019m willing to answer all your questions one by one. First of all, I know Lu Wenxue, and I know his situation isn\u2019t as simple as it may appear. If you are willing to accept me, I\u2019ll continue with more details. Secondly, I am only a person who wants to help Lu Zhengyang. I do not have much of a relationship with Lu Wenxue. I know ever since the incident, most of his students try to conceal the fact that you guys were his students. But it\u2019s true that you were his student; even if you deny it. One day, you\u2019ll know that being his student is a thing to be proud of. Lastly, the reason why I\u2019m approaching you is because I want to borrow your name and power in society.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry about what happened to Teacher Lu\u2026. but that\u2019s already the past. He has already died. There isn\u2019t anything else I can do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Xiaotian\u2019s words gave me a glimmer of hope.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me ask you. Do you believe your teacher killed someone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if I do? What if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe it, then stand by my side and help clear his name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Xiaotian dryly laughed as she lightly touched her wedding ring with her left hand. \u201cYou view me too highly. I\u2019m only a woman who relies on her husband to survive. I honestly have no ability to help you. Don\u2019t you know that those who have relationships with Teacher Lu are being treated coldly? I\u2019m not going to take that risk. You may say that I\u2019m selfish and cruel. Let\u2019s pretend we\u2019ve never met today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Mo Xiaotian turned around to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you\u2026\u201d I clenched my fist as I yelled at her rear view, \u201cAs his ex student, you\u2019re not willing to help him clear his name? Don\u2019t forget. If it wasn\u2019t for him, how would you have left that small town of yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Xiaotian paused and remained still.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, I realized my words were a bit too much. I sounded quite resentful. It wasn\u2019t my intentions to sound so bitter.</p><br/><p>But based on the exchanges I had with Xuduo, I was aware how big of a shock this incident had on his students. There was a lot of societal pressure that has caused him to behave the way he did.</p><br/><p>Sadly, despite saying such harsh words, Mo Xiaotian didn\u2019t look at me again as she rushed out of the washroom.</p><br/><p><i>I guess that was a refusal? </i></p><br/><p>I weakly leaned against the wall. It was as if something was stuck in my heart and made it difficult for my energy to circulate. I forcefully smacked my chest to get rid of the feeling, but it didn\u2019t seem to work.</p><br/><p><i>Initially, I thought it was a rather simple task. But ultimately, I wasn\u2019t able to do it\u2026 I have failed Suyang. How am I supposed to face him now? </i></p><br/><p>I left the washroom sulking. Suddenly, Suyang grabbed onto me and pressed me against the wall. He lowered his voice as he anxiously asked, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cObviously I had to sneak in\u2026since you wouldn\u2019t bring me\u2026\u201d I whispered. I didn\u2019t dare to make eye contact with him. I hung down my head and stared at my tippy toes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you not to come?\u201d Suyang\u2019s tone sounded very annoyed. Without looking at his face, I could tell he was furious. There was a long silence after that.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he growled, \u201cLook at me!\u201d</p><br/><p>I quickly lifted my head and stared at the face that couldn\u2019t be any darker.</p><br/><p>\u201cB-boss\u2026.surprise?\u201d Originally, I had planned on scaring Suyang with my appearance. Yet, it turned out it was the other way around. I tried my best to smile to prevent the atmosphere from getting worse.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, please do not give me such a scary look. This is a public place. It\u2019s not good if others see\u2026.\u201d I looked around my surroundings. Deep down, I hope someone will appear so I could sneak away.</p><br/><p>Suyang\u2019s face remained dark. He grabbed my hand and dragged me towards the men\u2019s washroom.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!? Are you crazy?\u201d My voice was still quiet but higher pitched. I watched as he pulled me closer towards the forbidden place. But I was physically too weak to resist. Out of desperation, I closed my eyes, \u201cWhy are you bringing me here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOpen your eyes. There\u2019s no one here.\u201d</p><br/><p>I cracked my eyes open a little. After confirming that there were no one else around, I attempted to escape from Suyang\u2019s grasp. But he caught my hair loop.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey hey hey! Use your words! Not your hands!\u201d I kindly reminded him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you the one who was afraid of being seen by others? That\u2019s why I brought you in. How did you get here?\u201d Suyang seemed to be quite upset with my arrival. The atmosphere was awkward and serious. I didn\u2019t know how to answer him. But silence wasn\u2019t ok either.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was following your instructions, boss! Didn\u2019t you say that Mo Xiaotian and Ye Lili will be here? I wanted to complete my mission and convince them\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou listened to this mission. But I said more than that. I told you I was going to be responsible for them. As an assistant, do you pick and choose what you want to hear?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d Alright. I had no comeback, \u201cI just wanted to help you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang took a deep breath. \u201cDo you know why I refused to let you come?\u201d</p><br/><p>I pouted and shook my head like a drum rattle.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you check to see who the host of this event was? Director Rui will also be here. Haven\u2019t you already encountered him before? What if he recognized you and has his eyes set on you?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Oh yeah\u2026why didn\u2019t I think of that? I didn\u2019t realize the danger I was in until Suyang brought it up. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave right away!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you going to leave? It\u2019s already late. Do you have a car?\u201d Suyang crossed his arms as he asked me.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I walked here. I can walk back.\u201d I lightly said. But the moment I imagined walking through the two hour mountainous road, my mind began to expand.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou walked up here?! There is no public transportation on this road?!!\u201d Suyang exclaimed as his brows crinkled, \u201cYou\u2019re really something else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to laugh, then go ahead. I won\u2019t blame you. Actually, after I climbed up here, I feel like I\u2019m missing some muscles. Why do I always cause suffering upon myself\u2026.\u201d I mumbled.</p><br/><p>Suyang rubbed my head, \u201cForget it. Go find a silent spot and hide while you wait for me. After I\u2019m done, I\u2019ll take you home with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re taking me home, how about Mi Fan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Suyang spread out his arms, \u201cBut Mi Fan isn\u2019t as stupid as you. She is not going to walk home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a few male voices could be heard.</p><br/><p>The two of us gazed at each other frantically for a second. Then, it was as if our minds connected and we ran to hide into the furthest stall.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Finally, my cheesecake came. It dissolve the awkwardness between us.</p><br/><p>Suyang stared at the cheesecake and macchiato. \u201cAre you under a lot of stress lately? That\u2019s a lot of sugar intake.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was about to take a bite out of my cheesecake, but my hand hovered in mid air.</p><br/><p>I tried making sense of what Suyang said. <i>Was it a harmless question? Or was he implying something?</i></p><br/><p><i>No, that\u2019s not possible. Why would he?</i> These days, I\u2019ve been overly suspicious of everything. I convinced myself that it was just a random question.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t females like to eat sweet desserts? Although I have to cast aside my gender as a reporter, I will not abandon desserts.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was trying to tell a joke as I continued the conversation.</p><br/><p>For some reasons, I felt like there was someone watching me from outside. I turned towards the window. I wanted to know where that strange feeling was coming from.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look!\u201d Suyang suddenly grabbed my hand. \u201cDon\u2019t look out the window. Be natural and exchange conversation with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there something outside?\u201d His behaviour and tone of voice evoked my curiosity. I tightly my grip on my fork.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy assistant is hiding behind a bush outside the window. I don\u2019t want her to know that we\u2019ve discovered her. I want her to get more mosquito bites.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang had a crafty smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do you want to talk about? Don\u2019t you find our atmosphere really awkward?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about the case you were responsible for. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that I\u2019m a speculative online author. Usually, I\u2019m very interested in criminal cases. They trigger and inspire my creation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should be asking the police for this sort of stuff. Why are you asking a small reporter like myself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSmall reporter? You\u2019re a reporter that knows more than the cops! Am I right?\u201d Suyang slightly leaned forward as he smiled deeply at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think too highly of me. I wonder, which case are you interested in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am\u2026.\u201d Suyang\u2019s facial expression suddenly changed as he rushed to pull me out of my seat. Then, I heard the sounds of shattering glass.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d I could hear Suyang\u2019s voice from above my head.</p><br/><p>By the time I snapped out of my daze, I was already in his arms. Everyone else were screaming and the atmosphere had turned very fearful and chaotic.</p><br/><p><i>I was the target of the attack. But why was I the calmest one?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I re-adjusted my breathing and stared at the main culprit of this act; Lu Zhengyang. This wasn\u2019t the first time he had tried to attack me. In reality, he had attacked me so many times that I\u2019ve lost count.</p><br/><p>Lu Zhengyang still wanted to do something, but he was subdued by Suyang.</p><br/><p>Two girls clumsily rushed in. <i>One of them should be Suyang\u2019s assistant? The girl wearing a school uniform looked too young. So most likely, it was the other one\u2026</i></p><br/><p>I observed Suyang lecturing her. Right now, she was the only one in his eyes.</p><br/><p>As a reporter, I had a good sense of intuition.</p><br/><p>Lu Zhengyang continued to verbally abuse me. I listened to it all over again. After he was done, I pretended not to care as I proudly left the coffee shop.</p><br/><p>When I got into my car, I locked the doors and had both my hands gripping on the steering wheel. Every time I see the vengeful Lu Zhengyang, Lu Wenxue\u2019s face would appear in my mind and remain there.</p><br/><p>His case was my most serious, exceeding general knowledge, and terrifying case.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t because it was naturally vile or that he had committed a terrible crime.</p><br/><p>It was because I was the one who created his crimes.</p><br/><p>This was the first time I had experienced what it was like to step on someone in order to climb up.</p><br/><p>As someone in the media field, I knew how to attract readers\u2019 attention. I knew how to trigger the public. The chairman\u2019s family told me that the Lu Wenxue case was my best case.</p><br/><p>Because not only was I able to control the mass, I was also able to control their judgment. It was already beyond the abilities of what an average reporter could do. I was a very capable person.</p><br/><p><i>Exceeded beyond a reporter\u2019s scope of work?</i> What a joke. Reporters were supposed to report real news. <i>What have I turned into?</i></p><br/><p>The Lu Wenxue case was already something I couldn\u2019t reverse. And something I didn\u2019t dare to touch. I was even afraid to show my remorse.</p><br/><p>The sinful plant growing inside my heart was constantly torturing me. Whenever I saw Lu Zhengyang, it was at its worse.</p><br/><p>I was a normal human being who had a lot of self-interest. I knew the higher I climbed, the harder I\u2019d fall.</p><br/><p>A few days later, Suyang personally gave me a call.</p><br/><p>I was pleasantly surprised.</p><br/><p>But I was still logical. After our date, I hired a private detective to find out more about Suyang. As expected, it wasn\u2019t a waste.</p><br/><p>After the investigation, I was certain that Suyang came to me in regards to Lu Wenxue\u2019s case.</p><br/><p>Logically, I should\u2019ve told the chairman about Suyang and his little assistant so that he could\u2019ve helped me gotten rid of them. But I never said anything.</p><br/><p>When the assistant had tailed me to the hotel, it was practically catching a turtle in a jar. Yet, I still let her off.</p><br/><p><i>When did I become so kind?</i></p><br/><p>Suddenly, I felt as if I was able to poke out my head from the sludge and take a breath.</p><br/><p>There was a rope in front of me.</p><br/><p><i>Was it an indication that it will pull me ashore?</i></p><br/><p>It was like a fish bait. But I wasn\u2019t sure if a delicious meal would await me or the pain of a hooked lip.</p><br/><p>After hesitating again and again, I decided to hold onto the rope.</p><br/><p>So, early on, I already told Suyang everything. That way, he wouldn\u2019t have to pretend or act around me. The man\u2019s charm was my bait.</p><br/><p>Actually, Suyang\u2019s appearance was more like my path to redemption. Because of him, I was finally able to express what I have hidden all of last year. By telling him all this, I was basically handing my life to him.</p><br/><p><i>How could I have so much trust in a man I barely knew?</i></p><br/><p>Afterwards, I realized it wasn\u2019t because I trusted Suyang. At that moment, regardless of who had thrown me the rope, I would have taken it. I was fortunate that Suyang pulled me back ashore.</p><br/><p>Later on, I understood something else. I wasn\u2019t actually evil beyond cure. It was that no one had ever tried to stop me\u2026</p><br/><p>I placed the early photo of me as a reporter next to my mother\u2019s grave. I no longer deserved to keep it. So, I shall allow it to accompany my mother\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Once, the person who hated my guts and wanted to pour sulfuric acid on me had been smiling proudly next to me. Those days were gone forever.</p><br/><p><i>We always tend to reminisce the past\u2026.</i></p><br/><p>This is my redemption.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

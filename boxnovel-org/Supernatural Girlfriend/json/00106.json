It took us forever before we managed to get to the front door entrance.</p><br/><p><i>He was clearly a chicken, yet he still wanted to know</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHere?\u201d Suyang squealed as he shrunk his shoulders and pointed all around him. His voice was shaky but he wanted confirmation, \u201cHe\u2019s next to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>I shook my head and gazed at the smiling bodyguard underneath Suyang\u2019s feet. \u201cNo, you\u2019re stepping on him! He is probably a M (masochist)\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment those words escaped my mouth, Suyang dramatically leaped and hopped behind me. He wouldn\u2019t release my shoulders as he tensely turned his head left and right; hollering, \u201cWhere? Where? Where!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe enjoys lying across the door entrance. Basically, you would step on him whenever you enter or exit the apartment. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d I tried to console Suyang and patted his hand with one hand and entered the passcode with the other.</p><br/><p>I demonstrated to Suyang on how to avoid stepping on the ghost bodyguard. \u201cIf you copy my movements, you won\u2019t step on him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder you always walk in so awkwardly\u2026. I thought\u2026.\u201d Suyang mumbled to himself as he imitated my actions. But I immediately froze on the spot when I saw the person inside the apartment.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t block me\u2026.!\u201d Half way through, Suyang also paused. He noticed the unwelcome guest as well.</p><br/><p>On the couch was Wen Yihan. Currently, he was sitting comfortably with his suit on. It would appear that he was waiting for us. When he saw that we had returned, he politely smiled.</p><br/><p>On the contrary, Gao Jialan looked like she was completely lost; standing at a far distance.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t even bother taking off my shoes as I directly stormed into the apartment and stood in front of Gao Jialan, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan nodded. Her expression warmed a little. She probably felt much better now that Suyang and I had returned. I followed her gaze and landed on Wen Yihan again. My brows remained furrowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you two for quite awhile. Please accept my apology for coming without an invitation.\u201d Wen Yihan stood up and brought along his deep hoarse voice to our side.</p><br/><p>I quickly placed Gao Jialan behind me and glared at Wen Yihan with no fear in my eyes.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, our intense eye contact was cut off by Suyang. He stood in between Wen Yihan and I and coldly stated, \u201cI wonder why CEO Wen Yihan is paying us a visit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wen Yihan took out his hand, \u201cAuthor Su, I\u2019ve been looking to meet you for a very long time. I saw the interview that you participated in our television station. Who would\u2019ve thought that the person I\u2019ve been searching for all this time was actually living with you\u2026. Isn\u2019t the world such a small place?\u201d</p><br/><p>I could sense the tight handshake from both parties. Neither of them were willing to demonstrate any weakness.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also didn\u2019t think that someone such as you, the CEO of the Wen clan, would personally pay a visit to our place.\u201d Suyang responded with the same level of power.</p><br/><p>Wen Yihan looked past Suyang and gazed at me. He began to speak slowly, \u201cThe reason why I was waiting for you two is because I didn\u2019t want to take her away while you guys weren\u2019t here. It would have been awfully impolite of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no one you can take away here.\u201d I took a huge step forward and stood next to Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be Miss Lin Yixin, am I correct? From the same orphanage as Jialan? Who would\u2019ve thought that you would manage to find connections from eight hundred years ago\u2026\u201d Suddenly, Wen Yihan\u2019s face turned cold. He was speaking to Gao Jialan.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease leave my home immediately. Or else, we\u2019re going to call the cops. If the police gets here, you would be the person to lose face, Mr. CEO.\u201d I began to threaten as I waved my cell phone in the air.</p><br/><p>Wen Yihan lightly laughed. \u201cLooks like Miss Lin Yixin is still clueless about the current situation. You should have found out more before you randomly allowed someone to live with you\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Why does Wen Yihan\u2019s words make me feel so disturbed? </i>I secretly poked Suyang\u2019s back with my finger and gave him a concerned look. <i>What should we do now?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cLook at the document on the table. You\u2019ll understand what I mean after you see it.\u201d Wen Yihan rubbed his chin confidently. He stared at Gao Jialan in a very proud and arrogant manner. I hated people with his type of attitude.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, originally, that day, I was going to give you the document from my office. But you refused to come in, so I had to personally deliver it here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Wen Yihan mentioned the document, Gao Jialan\u2019s face turned white. I went over to take a look.</p><br/><p>I pulled out the paperclip and saw that it was a mental evaluation report. The document stated that Gao Jialan had displayed early signs of abnormal brain activity. Her psychological state was unstable and under the agreement of her guardian, she should be hospitalized for treatments.</p><br/><p><i>I\u2019ve spent many days with Gao Jialan. If she had mental issues, Suyang and I would\u2019ve already noticed it. Anyone with a brain could tell that Wen Yihan had this document fabricated. He definitely had an ill intent. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cShe secretly left the hospital. As her guardian, I\u2019m responsible to take her back for treatment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re her guardian? What\u2019s your relationship with her? What gives you the right to be her guardian?\u201d I threw the document on the ground and interrogated Wen Yihan.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is Yufan\u2019s wife. She is part of the Wen family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBullshit! Feel your consciousness. Has the Wen family ever accepted her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you mean. If she wasn\u2019t part of the family, why would I make so much effort to pick her up? Plus, she is a person with split mental disorders and pregnant with a child. The Wen family must take responsibility for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps you are just relentlessly pursuing her to get rid of the child.\u201d Suyang walked over and picked up the report from the ground. \u201cHow do we know this isn\u2019t fabricated?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will leave the report here with you. You two can take your time to verify it. I have to take her for treatment now.\u201d Then, Wen Yihan shoved me away and was about to forcefully seize Gao Jialan.</p><br/><p>I lost my balance but I managed not to fall over by gripping onto the coffee table. Just as Wen Yihan was about to touch Gao Jialan, Suyang quickly grabbed his hand. \u201cShouldn\u2019t the CEO comply with the person involved in this situation? You haven\u2019t asked Gao Jialan what she wanted yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe report already stated that she has a split mental disorder. She cannot make her own choices. The guardian decides for her.\u201d Wen Yihan curtly stated.</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet you made it up!\u201d I shouted as I slammed my hand on the coffee table.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already told you that you can take your time to verify it. I am going to leave with her now. Let go.\u201d Wen Yihan made intense eye contact with Suyang. A few seconds later, Suyang slowly released him.</p><br/><p><i>Why are you letting go?!</i> I anxiously yelled from within.</p><br/><p>I wanted to save Gao Jialan, but Suyang stopped me. He gave me a stern look to indicate that I shouldn\u2019t make a move.</p><br/><p>Gao Jialan had not said a sentence since Wen Yihan\u2019s arrival. From her eyes, it was obvious how terrified she was towards him.</p><br/><p>At this moment, there was nothing we could do except watch Gao Jialan be taken away. Just before she exited the door, Gao Jialan turned around and looked like she wanted to say something to me. But ultimately, she didn\u2019t open her mouth.</p><br/><p>My ghost bodyguard had his arms opened wide to block them. But it was no use. Wen Yihan and Gao Jialan walked through his body of nothingness; he couldn\u2019t stop anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you stop me?\u201d When they were no longer in sight, I yelled at Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t keep her. Wen Yihan has the report analysis. If he called the cops, we might be the ones charged for keeping an unstable patient around.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t just let him take her away! We all know Wen Yihan wants to harm the child. Now that Gao Jialan is in his hands, can the child even live? What if he goes insane and kills her too!?!?\u201d The more I thought about it, the more I began to panic. I was afraid to keep going.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that Wen Yihan is a very firm and ruthless person. I\u2019m afraid that\u2026\u201d Suyang lowered his pupils and didn\u2019t finish his sentence. But I could more or less figured out what he was going to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I must save her!\u201d I wanted to run out, but Suyang blocked me again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of you going now? They\u2019re gone. You don\u2019t even know which direction they went. How are you going to save her?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

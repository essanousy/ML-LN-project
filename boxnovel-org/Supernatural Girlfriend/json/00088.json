I\u2019m a reporter.</p><br/><p><i>When exactly was it when everything changed? </i></p><br/><p>I became used to insomnia every night. I\u2019ve repeatedly asked myself why? There were numerous times where I had wanted to refuse and start over, but sadly, I\u2019ve already stepped onto this road.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t break free. I could only cover my eyes and proceed forward.</p><br/><p>This was similar to the feeling that I experienced when I had played on the beach. I was being very careful because I was afraid to dirty my shoes.</p><br/><p>But unexpectedly, a fish leaped up from the waters and dirtied my pure, white shoes.</p><br/><p>The dirt was extra conspicuous on my white shoes. It bothered me tremendously, yet I was helpless.</p><br/><p>After some consideration, I decided that since my shoes were already dirty, I\u2019ll just clean it when I get home.</p><br/><p>So, I became more fearless and waded deeper into the waters.</p><br/><p>Weeds and mud covered the soles of my shoes, but I was oblivious to it.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until my knees had submerged into the waters did I question myself why I was in this filthy water? I could no longer see my shoes; even my legs were muddy now.</p><br/><p>I was stunned, and hastily tried to get back on shore. Surprisingly, it was as if there were something in the waters was holding me back. It wouldn\u2019t allow me to turn around. It had a death grip on me; as if it wanted me to remain in this filth with it forever.</p><br/><p>No one came to save me. I watched as my sight of vision became lower and lower.</p><br/><p>The beautiful scenery I once saw gradually disappeared from my view.</p><br/><p>I was submerged.</p><br/><p>I had been captivated by the sludge. I violently fought to keep my eyes open and noticed a filthy, stinky, greedy monster waving at me.</p><br/><p>I desperately shouted for help, but no sounds came out.</p><br/><p>Instead, the sludge entered my body from my mouth and I was ultimately devoured by the river.</p><br/><p>Then, I concealed myself underwater as I looked up and anticipated for the next person to sink and accompany me.</p><br/><p>\u2014-</p><br/><p>Suddenly, I awoke from this suffocating dream.</p><br/><p>I had cold sweat running down my entire body. I warily turned to the alarm clock next to me.</p><br/><p><i>It was already 9am? How could I have slept in so much? </i></p><br/><p>My body felt very heavy. I took a hot shower and checked my schedule for the day.</p><br/><p><i>Oh yeah, today I have a blind date. </i></p><br/><p>I silently laughed.</p><br/><p>I finally agreed to it because my aunt wouldn\u2019t shut up. <i>24 hours wasn\u2019t even enough for my job. And I still had to find time to go on a blind date? </i></p><br/><p>Thinking of this, I was quite moody\u2026</p><br/><p>I chose the most simplistic outfit to meet my match. From others, I was aware that my match was an online author.</p><br/><p>The location we were meeting in was a very cozy and quiet coffee shop.</p><br/><p>It had the type of atmosphere I enjoyed.</p><br/><p>Because I woke up late, I was approximately 30 minutes late.</p><br/><p>When I arrived at the entrance of the coffee shop, I saw a man who was reading.</p><br/><p>He was very slim and had distinct facial qualities.</p><br/><p>He was very deep into his novel\u2026</p><br/><p>I was quite certain he was the guy. Subconsciously, the corners of my mouth curved into a smile.</p><br/><p>I walked in and approached him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, my name is Mi Fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>I gave him my professional smile and waited for him to stand up to pull out my chair.</p><br/><p><i>He wasn\u2019t what I had imagined? Umm\u2026 he didn\u2019t seem to look forward to this meeting as much as I had thought. </i></p><br/><p>When he saw me, he lightly closed his book and politely greeted me, \u201cHi, I\u2019m Suyang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since he didn\u2019t show any indication he was going to get up, I pulled out my chair myself and sat down across from him.</p><br/><p><i>Was it because I was late? </i></p><br/><p>I felt like the atmosphere was a bit strange. It was totally not what I had expected.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn regards to my lateness, I would like to first apologize. Normally, I\u2019m quite\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Suyang. What would you like to eat?\u201d Suyang cut me off and directly called the waiter over.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you what you would like to eat. We can\u2019t just sit here and not order?\u201d Suyang smiled at me.</p><br/><p><i>But why didn\u2019t the words and smile align? </i></p><br/><p>I looked at the table. <i>He didn\u2019t order anything either?! </i></p><br/><p>He had already called the waiter over. I couldn\u2019t say anything else. Since I hadn\u2019t eaten breakfast, I might as well combine lunch and breakfast together.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a cheesecake and a cup of caramel macchiato.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a cup of water.\u201d</p><br/><p>I think I got the message now. His family probably forced him to come. So, he didn\u2019t want to set a good impression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you come?\u201d I got straight to the point. He was forced and I was forced. It was unnecessary for both of us to pretend.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did I come?\u201d Suyang thought about it. Then, he casually responded, \u201cBecause of my assistant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour assistant? It wasn\u2019t your family that forced you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope, it\u2019s because of my assistant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did your assistant do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t stop me, so I came.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was the strangest reason I\u2019ve ever heard. <i>Because his assistant didn\u2019t stop him?</i></p><br/><p>I began to feel curious towards this man.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

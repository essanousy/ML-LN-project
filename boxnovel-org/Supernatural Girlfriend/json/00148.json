It was a position that could easily be misinterpreted if another party were to see.</p><br/><p>I calmed down and gasped, \u201cPlease release me so I can explain to you. I can\u2019t run anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chuqiao considered my suggestion and turned on the lights of the conference room. When the light was on, I closed my eyes because it was hard for my eyes to adjust. I vaguely saw someone rushing in. Before I knew it, Xu Chuqiao was pulled off me and knocked down with a punch.</p><br/><p>I opened my eyes and realized it was Suyang.</p><br/><p>Just as Suyang was about to strike Xu Chuqiao again, I rushed to hold onto his fist, \u201cYou can\u2019t hit him! He\u2019s my client! And he is CEO Xu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang appeared to be very agitated. I let him calm down while separating the two of them so that there was a safe distance between them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Suyang held onto my face as he inspected for injuries, \u201cAre you hurt anywhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I shook my head. By now, the misunderstanding was probably even bigger.</p><br/><p><i>Darn it! If Xialing knows that a client is suspecting me because Suyang and I got back together, she would definitely laugh to death! As the owner of the firm, I have no face left! </i></p><br/><p><i>Unprofessional, lack of ethics, a love fool, etc\u2026. I could already foresee all the criticisms</i>..</p><br/><p>\u201cNow you can\u2019t defend yourself anymore, huh!?\u201d Suyang\u2019s punch was so harsh that Xu Chuqiao\u2019s left cheek bone was green. He staggered to get up from the ground. Then, he took out a pile of photos from his pockets and threw it in front of me.</p><br/><p>They were photos of me and Suyang embracing each other on our way home.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour request to hire me to investigate your late father\u2019s will is not fake. It is unrelated to my personal life.\u201d I picked up the photos from the ground, \u201cThese pictures are meaningless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you admit it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI admit we are in a relationship, but that is not related to Yao Youfan. I\u2019m hired by you. I\u2019m on your side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m a 3 year old child who you can easily fool?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cListen to my explanation! Suyang isn\u2019t who you think he is. He doesn\u2019t know the internal battles between you and Yao Youfan. In addition, he doesn\u2019t care either. Our relationship will not affect my investigation with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chuqiao tried getting closer but Suyang stopped him, \u201cYou can stay where you are. We can hear you from here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m still going to trust you? You\u2019ve been fired.\u201d Xu Chuqiao glared at me with hatred. It was as if he had fire was coming out of his eyes.</p><br/><p><i>My mind began to buzz. I was fired?! I have never been fired from my new job before\u2026 it magnified all the criticism I had imagined a few moments ago. </i></p><br/><p>Just as Xu Chuqiao was about to leave the room, my mind came up with another idea. I cannot lose this client. Without thinking, I blurted, \u201cXu Chuqiao, if you dare to leave this conference room, I will tell Yao Youfan you\u2019re investigating her!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I said those words, I began to reflect.<i> I was threatening a client\u2026 Lin Yixin! What are you doing?! </i></p><br/><p>Surprisingly, my words were very effective. Xu Chuqiao stopped and faced me, \u201cYou are on her side!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll prove it to you with my action that I\u2019m not from Yao Youfan\u2019s side. Give me a day and I\u2019ll tell you everything you want to know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to trust you anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust give me a day. Tomorrow, by the end of work, I\u2019ll have everything ready.\u201d I sincerely ensured Xu Chuqiao.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, this deepened his misunderstanding towards me. \u201cIt only takes a day? If it was that simple, then what have you been doing for all this time? Are you going to run to Yao Youfan to discuss tactics with her now?\u201d He sneered.</p><br/><p>\u201cPromise her and tomorrow I\u2019ll hand you my resignation letter along with her report.\u201d Suyang suddenly spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d<i> I didn\u2019t understand why he would involve himself in this.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cIf you think I\u2019m on Yao Youfan\u2019s side, then it means you have one less enemy if I quit. Right?\u201d Suyang calmly analyzed.</p><br/><p>Xu Chuqiao didn\u2019t respond for a long time. He was probably considering it.</p><br/><p><i>If Suyang loses his job because of me, I would feel so guilty\u2026 but if Xu Chuqiao agrees to this condition, then I will have the opportunity to clear my name. I definitely can\u2019t lose this client! </i></p><br/><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll give you a day and see what type of story you can come up with!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Yes! I still have a chance! Thank God! </i>I sighed a breath of relief and confidently stated, \u201cTomorrow, I\u2019ll have everything figured out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chuqiao left the conference room in anger; leaving us by ourselves. I collapsed on the chair, \u201cSorry for causing you to lose your job\u2026. But do you know where Yao Youfan is right now? I seriously have no time to waste anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem like you\u2019re racing against time. Look how listless you appear.\u201d Suyang crouched in front of me, \u201cI didn\u2019t like this job to begin with. I don\u2019t mind quitting. Plus, if you lose Xu Chuqiao as a client, you won\u2019t be the only one who\u2019ll be stressing. I\u2019ll also have a headache.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just lost my job, so you\u2019ll have to feed me! If you lose your client as well, who is going to feed me?\u201d Suyang shamelessly exclaimed.</p><br/><p>I began to stare into space as my vision became blurrier, \u201cOh yes\u2026 my pretty boy, I can\u2019t lose Xu Chuqiao. Or else, my firm will lose its reputation and I\u2019ll be a joke. Then, we\u2019ll both starve and die on the streets\u2026.\u201d I mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cC\u2019mon! Gather your energy!\u201d Suyang grabbed onto my shoulders and began to shake me, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you want to see Yao Youfan! You\u2019ll be able to finish half your job if you can get some alone time with her?! Let\u2019s go find her now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToday is our last chance\u2026.\u201d I weakly stated. We got up and left the conference room. Suyang took me to the 40th floor to Yao Youfan\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>Yao Youfan was a bit drunk from drinking and was resting against a chair at the moment. She seemed a bit annoyed by the interruption, but the moment she saw Suyang, she smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! It\u2019s Suyang! Why are you here?\u201d It was obvious that Yao Youfan was fond of Suyang. But it wasn\u2019t like the opposite sex type of attraction. It was more like a motherly son type of care.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, chairman. I\u2019m a new hiree, Lin Yixin!\u201d I introduced myself in a simple manner. But Suyang added, \u201cI heard from the secretary that you\u2019ve drunk quite a lot and refuses to go home. So, I decided to bring someone to massage you to help you relax and get you out of your drunken state.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Massage can help you when you\u2019re drunk? That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard of something like that\u2026.\u201d Although Yao Youfan was skeptical, she agreed to it because I was recommended by Suyang. So, I began to massage her back.</p><br/><p>After successfully getting into contact with Yao Youfan, I only had to patiently wait until she becomes sleepy. Once her mind is at the weakest moment, I\u2019ll be able to get into her consciousness and go through her memories.</p><br/><p>Suyang decided not to hinder me and went out to keep watch; leaving Yao Youfan and I by ourselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cChairman, if you\u2019re drunk, why don\u2019t you want to return home?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I said those words out loud, deep down I was thinking,<i> good think you didn\u2019t go home! Or else, where would I have gotten this one on one opportunity!</i></p><br/><p>I was just making a casual comment but Yao Youfan responded, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go home! It\u2019s too empty at home. I like companionship. Being at work is good!\u201d Yao Youfan sighed and then slowly fell into a slumber.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>Slowly, I entered Yao Youfan\u2019s consciousness and went through her memories. Right now, the scene before me was the day that Xu Chuqiao\u2019s father passed away.</p><br/><p>Xu Sen was lying in the VIP room. Next to him were countless of machines that were keeping him alive. It was obvious that he didn\u2019t have much time to live.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Xu Sen\u2019s eyes were shut as he struggled to speak. Due to the ventilator, Yao Youfan couldn\u2019t hear him. Yao Youfan gently raised her hair and leaned towards Xu Sen\u2019s ear as she whispered, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 I\u2026.I\u2019m\u2026\u201d Xu Sen was struggling as he squeezed out each word from his teeth. He was in tremendous amounts of pain.</p><br/><p>Yao Youfan seemed to know what Xu Sen wanted to say. She held onto Xu Sen\u2019s bony left hand with her left hand as she lightly patted Xu Sen\u2019s chest with her right hand. She seemed to be comforting him, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to say anymore. I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xu Sen lightly nodded.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the machines made a sharp, piercing beep. There was a straight horizontal line being displayed. Xu Sen\u2019s life was over. From what I could see, before Xu Sen died, he was still holding onto Yao Youfan\u2019s hand up until the very last second.</p><br/><p>Perhaps Xu Sen wanted to apologize, but knowing that Yao Youfan wasn\u2019t resentful towards him allowed him to rest in peace with no regrets.</p><br/><p>Strangely, Xu Chuqiao was nowhere to be seen. Perhaps, during this time, Yao Youfan was always the one who accompanied Xu Sen. She may have made up for Xu Chuqiao\u2019s absence since he was so busy. I wouldn\u2019t eliminate the possibility that perhaps Xu Sen willingly decided to leave his entire estate to Yao Youfan.</p><br/><p>The machines coldly announced the end of life. However, Yao Youfan did not sob or scream. She was abnormally calm as she sat quietly next to the deceased Xu Sen. She didn\u2019t even call the doctor.</p><br/><p>In my opinion, this woman wasn\u2019t heartless. Instead, her pain was the type that couldn\u2019t be described in words.</p><br/><p>After a long time, Yao Youfan finally opened her mouth, \u201cOld Xu, you must be tired. Now you can finally rest. Don\u2019t worry, I will take good care of our son. Trust me.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

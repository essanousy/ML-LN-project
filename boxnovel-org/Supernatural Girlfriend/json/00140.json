Before they left, I had to try to save myself. I definitely didn\u2019t want to be alone with Suyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there something important you need help with, manager?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter seeing your r\u00e9sum\u00e9, there are some parts I am curious about. I want to ask you individually. Is that not alright with you?\u201d Suyang responded smoothly. He must have figured out my response ahead of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not\u2026.\u201d I was speechless. After all, he was currently my superior. I couldn\u2019t go against him in front of the secretary and the new hiree.</p><br/><p>Suyang glared at the two other men. He seemed a bit annoyed, \u201cAre you guys not going to leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The two of them swiftly exited. The new hiree probably thought I was going to get scolded. Before he left the room, he secretly peeked at me and had a crafty smile on his face.</p><br/><p><i>F**k that child! Why is he rejoicing in my misfortunes? And ugh, why does Suyang want to keep me here? I\u2019m so nervous. Is he going to question why I left without saying a word three years ago? Or does he want to get revenge? Or maybe\u2026</i></p><br/><p><i>Wait, we are working in the same company right now. He probably won\u2019t do anything. Lin Yixin. You can do this. Stop freaking out.</i></p><br/><p>My thoughts were spinning in my mind like mad. Suddenly, Suyang closed all the window blinds and the room turned pitch black. I recoiled my body and stared at Suyang with caution.</p><br/><p>Suyang seemed to be abnormally calm. Then, he pressed a switch and the room was lit. He comfortably sat in his boss chair as he took out my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, \u201cLin Yixin job candidate, where have you worked previously?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think where I have worked previously is important. The most important thing is that I\u2019m part of the company now.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Oh? So Suyang wanted to act like we didn\u2019t know each other? That\u2019s fine with me. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. But if your superior is asking you a question, you must answer it, no?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>How dare he try to threaten me? </i>On the inside, I rolled my eyes countless of times. But on the outside, I appeared strong, \u201cIn the past, I\u2019ve worked at Day Mountain Trading Company.\u201d</p><br/><p>I told him the job I last held four years ago. You can\u2019t blame me. Ever since I was fired, I was Suyang\u2019s assistant. After that, I never worked another white collar job again. The only thing I could use or say was the Day Mountain Trading Company.</p><br/><p>\u201cDay Mountain Trading Company? How come I have never heard of it?\u201d Suyang muttered as he rubbed his chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course you haven\u2019t. Or else, you wouldn\u2019t be asking. Do you have any other question? If not, I\u2019m going to go leave now.\u201d I coldly replied and tilted my chin up. My eyes landed on a painting behind Suyang\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>On the wall was a painting of a sunflower that had a missing a petal. The golden yellow hue gave its viewer a misconception of warmth. But if one looked closely at the missing petal, they would see that the flower was weeping. Its head was lowered like it was drowning in regret.</p><br/><p>Suyang suddenly stood up and blocked my view. His expression was solemn, \u201cWhy are you in such a rush to leave? You don\u2019t want to be in the same space as me?\u201d</p><br/><p>I immediately denied, \u201cNo, I\u2019m only a job candidate. I must quickly get used to the area.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang leaned against his office desk as he played around with an item in his hand, \u201cI noticed your age, Lin Yixin job candidate. You\u2019re already 29. You\u2019re much older than the other hirees. What do you have to say to that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think a person\u2019s age should determine whether a person is qualified for a job or not. If you want to assess an employee, you should be judging based on his/her abilities, decision making, and how diligent they are.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang clapped, \u201cGood. I agree with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cManager, do you have any other questions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Suyang tilted his head as he grinned like a child, \u201cIt has been three years. Have you missed me?\u201d</p><br/><p>That smile brought me back to three years ago. He always had this smile whenever he leaned against my leg or buried his head against my neck.</p><br/><p>To me, the three years were nothing. My love for him didn\u2019t lessen at all. But it was impossible between us. Honestly, I wanted to rush over and embrace him. I wanted to ask him whether he missed me. I wanted to know if he was dating someone else. I wanted to know how he was doing. And while he was thinking of how to respond, I wanted to give him a deep, passionate kiss\u2026</p><br/><p>But, I was able to hold back my powerful desires. During these past three years, this ability was something I was most proud of. Although my heart longed for him, I was able to act emotionless.</p><br/><p>As for Suyang\u2019s question, I wasn\u2019t sure how I should respond.</p><br/><p>I still loved him. But for the past three years, I have been very busy working. I had almost no time to miss or think of Suyang. Even if I did have time, I would control myself so that I wouldn\u2019t think of him. Since I have already decided we had no future together, I had to crush all my thoughts.</p><br/><p>But it was strange. Suyang became something non-concrete in my heart. He was someone that I didn\u2019t want to remember but couldn\u2019t forget.</p><br/><p>\u201cManager, what is that supposed to mean? Today is the first time we\u2019ve met\u2026..\u201d <i>I\u2019m going to continue playing dumb; even if it was the stupidest idea. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure that is your final answer?\u201d Suyang\u2019s smile suddenly became dim. \u201cI\u2019ll give you one more chance. If you reply badly, I will investigate why you entered this company and tell the chairman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d I panicked and glared at Suyang.</p><br/><p>He reacted very excitedly as he clapped. \u201cYes. This is the Lin Yixin I know. Terrible temper and easily provoked. Comes whenever she feels like it and doesn\u2019t care about how others feel. That is your style!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>As expected, Suyang was bitter towards my departure. Should I explain myself? But honestly, I couldn\u2019t think of anything that could clear my crime. Forget it. It\u2019s probably better that he hated me. </i></p><br/><p>\u201cI know your motive for entering this company isn\u2019t pure. You better answer my question.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u201d Before I could continue, someone knocked and saved me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m busy!\u201d Suyang snapped. He sounded like he didn\u2019t want the person to come in.</p><br/><p>\u201cManager, the chairman is looking for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell her I\u2019m busy. No time.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Wow, he even dared to reject the chairman. Suyang was still unruly like he was three years ago. What was his relationship with Yao Youfan?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cThe chairman says it\u2019s urgent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI got it. I\u2019ll come now.\u201d Suyang finally gave in. He gave me a dirty look as he walked by me. Then, he whispered in a low voice, \u201cThe future is long. We have ample of time later to chat.\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, he confidently walked out of the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew\u2026.\u201d After Suyang left, I quickly ran out and found an empty seat to sit down. I held onto my beating heart as I tried to calm down. I gazed at Suyang\u2019s office and thought to myself, <i>What am I going to do if he wouldn\u2019t let me go? At this rate, how can I do further investigation</i>\u2026..?</p><br/><p>My head began to hurt and I started to mess with my hair. The new hiree noticed and sneakily came up beside me. He mumbled, \u201cWhat did the manager say to you? Are you in trouble?\u201d</p><br/><p>He tried to hide it, but I could still see his upward smile. Clearly, he wanted me to look bad. I looked down and noticed the worker ID around his neck. His name was Guo Zijun.</p><br/><p>I said what he wanted to hear and pretended to act miserable. \u201cYes, the manager scolded me. He said I had to be alert during my work hours. If I continue acting like this, there is no need to return back to work.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guo Zijun seemed pleased by what I said. \u201cOh yeah, Secretary Luo said there is a welcome ceremony for all the new hirees tonight. After we\u2019re done work, we have to go home and change before we attend.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>What\u2019s going on? He\u2019s actually nice enough to notify me?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome ceremony? Will we see the chairman too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows\u2026? I guess it depends if we\u2019re lucky. I doubt the chairman would come to a regular event like this though.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>If Yao Youfan shows up, this event would be a good excuse to get close to her. After all, if it\u2019s a party, there will definitely be drinking. People are the least guarded when they are drunk. Perhaps I\u2019ll be able to find out some stuff through her spirit and figure out whether she made the will up. </i></p><br/><p>Suddenly, an unknown number appeared on my phone. I hesitated but decided to pick it up, \u201cHello?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss. Lin Yixin. It\u2019s Xu Chuqiao. This is my personal cell phone. In order not to arouse suspicion, I\u2019ll be using this phone to contact you from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Is there an issue?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you were called in by the marketing manager. Is everything ok?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s my own issue. No need to worry.\u201d<i> For now, it\u2019s fine. But soon</i>\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. If there\u2019s anything, call this number.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d <i>You can\u2019t solve my problem!</i> I made a depressing face at my phone and shook my head. <i>I swear my life was a joke.</i></p><br/><p>So, I lingered around the office for the rest of the day until work was over. Initially, I thought being a job candidate would be very busy, but Guo Zijun wanted to show off so badly that he fought to do everything. So because of him, I had a lot of free time. That was good. I didn\u2019t have to do anything.</p><br/><p>After work, I purposely went to buy an outfit for tonight\u2019s event. When I swiped my credit card, my heart ached.<i> I hadn\u2019t even made money and now I already had to go negative</i>\u2026</p><br/><p>When I arrived at the company, it wasn\u2019t the type of party I had imagined it to be. The only people that were standing in front of the building were the new hirees from this morning. <i>Was this the event that Guo Zijun mentioned?</i></p><br/>\n</div>"}

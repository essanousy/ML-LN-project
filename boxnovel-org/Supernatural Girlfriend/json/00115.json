One by one, they had begun to fall off the tree. The yellow leaves weren\u2019t able to hold on as they spun together in the breezy wind. After spinning around, they eventually dropped to the ground and concluded their lives on this world.</p><br/><p>In no time, it was already Autumn. Suyang was on break the entire Summer. Recently, he had been compiling and editing his work. It was a sensitive period and Suyang had locked himself inside of his room. He wouldn\u2019t eat nor see anyone.</p><br/><p>Ever since Gao Jialan left, I had moved back to my bedroom. Speaking of which, I haven\u2019t seen Suyang in seven days. It was like he was deliberately trying to avoid me. He only came out while I was asleep.</p><br/><p>Usually, by the time I woke up, the kitchen would be a mess.</p><br/><p>In all honesty, Suyang was not unbeatable. Although he may be able to write best sellers, it didn\u2019t mean that he had a body of metal. He was still made from flesh and blood.</p><br/><p>At this rate, I was afraid he will get sick\u2026</p><br/><p>By the way, I had never read any other novels of Suyang\u2019s. I\u2019ve only read that one book he had forced me to. It was odd because in his room, he only had anime, comics, games and action figures. He didn\u2019t have any of his novels inside.</p><br/><p>When I had moved in, Suyang made me sign a contract stating that I must not interrupt him during his creative phrase; even if he was dead in his room.</p><br/><p>Although our relationship was a lot closer now, I must still abide by the contract. Hence, I didn\u2019t dare to knock on his door. I texted him multiple times but Suyang didn\u2019t respond to any of them. It was as if I was the only person living in this apartment. It felt so empty and quiet. But, if I really perked up my ears, I could vaguely hear Suyang typing like a mad man.</p><br/><p>I was flipping channels with the remote control. There was nothing that really interested me\u2026</p><br/><p>Every day, time was moving by so slowly that I felt as if I was rotting. Today was no different. It was so boring.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, my phone began to vibrate. It was almost like a miracle.<i> Someone was actually calling me?! And it wasn\u2019t Suyang? </i></p><br/><p>I picked up very hesitantly, \u201cHello?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, customer. Congratulations! You have been chosen as the winner for the 2nd prize of our department store\u2019s 20th anniversary event. You won the 5 days family trip to Japan \u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I heard this, I was disappointed. It was a swindler\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of you guys trying to scam people? I\u2019m telling you, your methods are already outdated. Do you think I\u2019m an idiot? Do you honestly believe I would fall for cheap tricks like this?\u201d I yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cCustomer, you have misunderstood\u2026\u201d The person on the phone sounded a bit surprised. <i>Humph! She was probably speechless because I saw right through her!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know that the news have been broadcasting all these cheap tricks of yours? Soon, you\u2019re going to ask for my credit card number, right? Then, you\u2019re going to find an excuse to get me to pay for all these random fees. I\u2019m not going to fall for it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, please calm down\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know how hard it is for people to earn money? You have arms and legs. Why can\u2019t you go find a proper job instead of scamming people on the phone on a daily basis? You\u2019re evil and disgusting! I\u2019m telling you! People like you should be arrested and taken on a parade around the streets so others could throw eggs and vegetables at you! Let\u2019s see if you still have the courage to do this after that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, I didn\u2019t give her a chance to counter and directly hung up the phone.</p><br/><p><i>How dare she try to trick this old aunty?! I\u2019m already letting her go easy. Department store? I\u2019ve never been to a department store my entire life. Their products are so expensive\u2026 how could I afford it?! </i></p><br/><p>After a bit, there was some movement coming from Suyang\u2019s room. I stretched out my neck like a weasel as I stared attentively at the door and rushed to stand up.</p><br/><p><i>Was he finally coming out of his hibernation?!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cYixin.\u201d The door slowly opened as Suyang spoke with a raspy voice. He poked his head out and he looked like a homeless dude. He had not shaven for over a week and was wearing thick glasses. \u201cDid someone give you a call just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 yeah, a scammer called so I was a bit emotional. Did I interrupt your train of thought?\u201d I carefully asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Suyang was holding on his phone, \u201cThe department store also called me.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>What? Swindlers are so high tech now? They could tell Suyang and I live together? Or was it purely a coincidence? </i></p><br/><p>\u201cIs she bothering you? Give me the phone. Let me help you lecture her!\u201d I furiously stated. But deep down, I was also a bit thankful for the phone call because now I could finally see Suyang face to face.</p><br/><p>Suyang shook his head, \u201cA few days ago, I went to the department store to buy a new washing machine. I left them with your phone number.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d <i>Then\u2026</i></p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I still wasn\u2019t able to process, \u201cYou went to the department store to buy a new washing machine and left them with my phone number? How come I wasn\u2019t aware of this\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t home at the time. I was using the washing machine but it suddenly failed on me. So, I went to buy a model that was exactly the same as this one.\u201d Suyang calmly explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me, we actually won the contest?\u201d I covered my mouth in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. The department store said they called you but was misunderstood. So they called me instead. They want us to go pick up the reward later.\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t believe my ears. Ever since meeting Suyang, I knew that my luck had turned for the better. But I didn\u2019t think it would be to a point where we would win trips!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, are you\u2026\u201d <i>It was Suyang\u2019s creative phrase right now. Would he go?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026.\u201d Suyang looked very hesitant.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go! It\u2019s a trip to Japan! It would be good for you to relax! Maybe you\u2019ll find some inspiration there!\u201d I ran as quickly as an arrow towards Suyang\u2019s room as I knelt down and pleaded like a good child.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026Japan\u2026..\u201d Suyang\u2019s eyebrows were crinkled and he looked a bit bothered.</p><br/><p>I thought he was worried about the progression of his novel, so I immediately reassured him, \u201cYou can bring your laptop with you! Isn\u2019t it common for authors to gain inspirations from trips?! Let\u2019s go! Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a speculative author. How could trips give me inspiration?\u201d Suyang rubbed my head.</p><br/><p>I worked very hard to blink my eyes as I wished a tear would squeeze out. \u201cPlease! Please! Let\u2019s go to Japan! This will be the first time I\u2019ve ever left the country\u2026. I really want to go! Pleaseeeeeee!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang didn\u2019t say anything else but nodded slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou promised?! We\u2019re going to Japan!\u201d I raised both my hands in the air, \u201cYay! Trip! Trip! To Japan! To Japan!!!!!!\u201d I squealed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have to be this excited?\u201d Suyang looked at me as he shook his head helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best!\u201d I got up and grabbed Suyang\u2019s head as I kissed him. The beard stubble on his cheek made me so itchy.</p><br/><p>I was in such a good mood that I didn\u2019t care Suyang was looking down on me. I bounced back to my room and hummed a song as I began to look up the major attractions of Japan.</p><br/><p>It was late fall; the perfect time to watch the leaves.</p><br/><p><i>Oh yeah! If I am going to Japan, I need to apply for a passport. Would that take a very long time?</i> I was a bit concerned.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really that excited? Your leg is bouncing nonstop\u2026\u201d Suyang came out of his room as he leaned against the door frame and observed me.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? You\u2019re finally willing to come out?\u201d I spun a few circles in my seat. \u201cOf course! Aren\u2019t you excited?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 more mature than you are.\u201d Suyang pursed his lips, \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen are we going to get the prize from the department store? By the way, why is your luck so good? You randomly went to purchase a washing machine and won second prize?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang appeared to be deep in thought, \u201cPerhaps my character is too good.\u201d</p><br/><p>I pretended to bow to Suyang, \u201cYes yes yes, our Suyang young master\u2019s character is one of the very best. Since Suyang young master has finally came out of his small black hut, please go to the washroom to take a shower!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t look good right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that you don\u2019t look good.\u201d I shook my head as I shoved a small mirror to his face and smile, \u201cYou look very bad! Take a look!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang took the mirror from me and then analyzed his face from left to right. Initially, I thought he would be ashamed of his appearance. But he turned out to be addicted to his reflection.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I ought to keep a beard. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, our Suyang young master\u2019s self lover scale was in operation 365 days a year.</p><br/><p>My reaction was very cold, so Suyang made another self proclaimed cool pose as he said in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019m handsome, right? I feel like I give off such a mature manly aura\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is your age, mature man?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Suyang suddenly came over as he grabbed me by the waist and pressed his face towards mines. He purposely wanted to poke me with his beard.</p><br/><p>Suyang came from the left, and I dodged to my right. He tried to come in from the right, and I dodged to the left. He loved playing these immature games.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdmit it now! Say I\u2019m good looking!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Aren\u2019t females usually the ones asking their boyfriends whether they\u2019re pretty or not?</i></p><br/><p>Since I had nowhere else to run, I could only suppress my laughter and avoid his eyes. I nodded continuously. \u201cGood looking! You\u2019re the most handsome man I know! Is that good enough for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! You didn\u2019t look at me in the eyes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><i>So many requirements! But the moment I look at his face, I wouldn\u2019t be able to hold in my laughter.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cSay it while looking at me. Or else, I won\u2019t let you go today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since I couldn\u2019t beat him, I had to try to hold in my laughter. I lifted my head and made eye contact. But within a second, I burst out laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it really this funny?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Your beloved is going to help you fix your beard and cut your hair. Then, your world will be shining.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

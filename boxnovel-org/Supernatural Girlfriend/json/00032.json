It was completely quiet.</p><br/><p><i>If a person was absolutely needed to break the silence, I\u2019ll sacrifice myself! </i>I bravely said on the inside.</p><br/><p>But when it came to actually saying something, I didn\u2019t know what to say. At the end, I ended up uttering, \u201cUh\u2026.good afternoon, boss\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I watched Suyang\u2019s cold expression, I anxiously crawled back up. He gave me the feeling of a huge force suppressing me. Subconsciously, I backed up a bit to maintain a safe distance between us.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to know why she\u2019s here?\u201d Suyang turned his eyes towards Grandmother Meng. Grandmother Meng was avoiding his glance. So, Suyang approached me, \u201cSince my grandmother won\u2019t reply, you answer. This morning, you told me you had something to do and took half a day off. So tell me, why is my assistant at my granny\u2019s home?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss\u2026.you have so many apartments! I can see you make quite a lot of money\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt a terrible atmosphere pushing me down, so I was speaking some rubbish. Then, through an interval, I tried to make eye contact with Grandmother Meng to request help.</p><br/><p>She turned away from me.</p><br/><p><i>Is she expecting me to deal with this alone? Don\u2019t abandon me! Grandmother Meng! We are on the same boat!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare try to skimp me. Answer properly. Why are you here?\u201d Once again, Suyang interrogated me. He extended his hand, I thought he wanted to hit me. So, I dodged like an automatic reflex. \u201cStop moving!\u201d Suyang\u2019s big hand touched my hair, \u201cWhy is your hair wet?\u201d</p><br/><p>I was so scared that my neck remained at a crooked angle as I stood there foolishly. I didn\u2019t expect him to comment on my hair.</p><br/><p>Immediately after, I turned and decided to run to the washroom. Along the way, I went by Grandmother Meng and grabbed her arm as I whispered, \u201cWhat are we going to do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know my Xiao Su?\u201d Grandmother Meng asked quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is my boss\u2026.\u201d I wasn\u2019t used to hearing Suyang being referred to as Xiao Su, but since Grandmother Meng was actually Suyang\u2019s granny, I guess the nickname wasn\u2019t too weird.</p><br/><p>Grandmother Meng\u2019s pupils were spinning continuously. I think she was trying to use her brain.</p><br/><p>As for me, I watched restlessly as Suyang headed towards the direction of the washroom. I began to rush, \u201cHave you thought of a good explanation yet? I don\u2019t want to participate in this battle between the grandson and the grandma. Please let me leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve thought of a good explanation.\u201d Grandmother Meng clapped, \u201cWe\u2019re ready!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure what her explanation was going to be. She was ready? I was still in a clueless state.</p><br/><p>Suyang returned with a towel in his hand. I maintained my awkward smile as I sincerely reached out my two hands to take the towel from him. But it was as if Suyang didn\u2019t see my hand at all. He directly placed the towel on my head and began to wipe it dry.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need\u2026.\u201d I wanted to faintly refuse, but when I saw his eyes, I didn\u2019t dare to utter a sound.</p><br/><p>I was definitely not accustomed to Suyang\u2019s action. He was practically tearing the hair off my scalp. My head felt numb, but under these circumstances, I was too afraid to speak up. I could only sacrifice my hair and suffer in silence.</p><br/><p>Deep down, I saw it as a life trial I had to go through. God was giving me a test, and He specifically sent the Su descendants to torment me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t answered my questions. Why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told her to come.\u201d Just as I was about to crumble from pressure, the great Grandmother Meng finally spoke up for me, \u201cI know this lady knows you. Grandson, it has been so long since you\u2019ve last came to see me. Grandmother misses her grandson. I want to know what my grandson has been up to, so I told her to come!\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded crazily like those nodding dolls. Inside, I was thinking, \u201cRight, right! Grandmother Meng is right! From now on, she is always right!</p><br/><p>\u201cGranny, if you want to find out about me, you can always give me a call. Why do you need to find her?\u201d <i>Suyang actually believed her? Was he normally tricked this easily? </i>Slowly, I felt like I could put down my hanging heart.</p><br/><p>Grandmother Meng was beginning to act as she spoke in a tearful voice; it was totally the tempo of winning an Oscar. \u201cI\u2019m a lonely 70+ years old granny that is left all alone in a home. You don\u2019t appear for ten days to half a month. When I call you, you always say you\u2019re busy. Granny wants to know how her unfilial grandson is doing! Since I know this lady knows you, I asked her to come chat with me. I want to find out what you are up to, is that not ok?\u201d</p><br/><p>I chimed on the side as I covered my mouth with my hand and pretended to look sorrowful, \u201cThe old lady just feels lonely by herself\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The circumstances have reversed! Suyang\u2019s expressions were gradually turning calm and a bit guilty. \u201cGranny, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to see you. I\u2019m just too busy with work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWork your ass\u2026!\u201d I quietly mumbled as I lowered my head, \u201cAren\u2019t you gaming everyday?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoldfish! What did you say to my grandma?\u201d Suyang heard me and scolded me.</p><br/><p>I instantly lifted my head and shook it nonstop, \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything. Uh\u2026now that Suyang is here, I\u2019m going to go now! I don\u2019t want to disturb your Su descendant reunion.\u201d</p><br/><p>My current wish was to say farewell to these Su descendants. I\u2019ve never wanted to go home so badly before. Just as I was about to slip out, Suyang blocked me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cH\u2026h-ome! You two have a good talk! I don\u2019t want to bother you guys.\u201d I gave him a big smile.</p><br/><p>I tried to slip out from the other side, but Suyang blocked me again. He grabbed onto my collar, \u201cStay here. We\u2019ll head back together after dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? No need, no need! Boss, you should stay with granny. I don\u2019t want to bother you two.\u201d</p><br/><p>Deep down, I was thinking, \u201cJust release me\u2026big bro!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, perhaps she has something important to do. Even though she is your assistant, you can\u2019t take up all her personal time!\u201d Grandmother Meng was supporting me on the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have something very important to do? Don\u2019t you have no friends? So you should be quite free after work, right?\u201d Plus, your job is 24 hours. There is no such thing as \u2018after work\u2019. Your every minute and every second belongs to me!\u201d Suyang\u2019s tone sounded like he will eat me if I dared to leave. So how could I leave?</p><br/><p>When did he turn so stubborn?</p><br/><p>I swallowed my saliva. Darn it. I was screwed either way.</p><br/><p>I tugged my sleeves uncomfortably a few times, Suyang suddenly dragged me and brought me to the bedroom. He closed the door and locked the two of us in the room.</p><br/><p>I began to panic, \u201cGrandmother Meng is outside. What are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour clothes are wet. Pick one of granny\u2019s outfits and change into it. Also.\u201d Suyang forcefully pulled on my arm and hauled me in front of him. He said in a low voice, \u201cDon\u2019t think I actually believed what granny just said. When we get back home later, you better tell me the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>I curled my lips. I knew Suyang wouldn\u2019t be tricked so easily. He was a sharp guy.</p><br/><p>Since I was changing, Suyang temporarily left.</p><br/><p>I look through Grandmother Meng\u2019s clothes and randomly selected a set. When I looked into the mirror, I felt like I had aged thirty years. The moment I walked out, Grandmother Meng snickered, \u201cThis suits you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang handed me all the groceries he had brought, \u201cGo cook!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s work together!\u201d I frustratedly blurted as I stared at Suyang. He was on the couch watching TV.</p><br/><p>\u201cNah.\u201d Suyang was watching a stupid variety show as he replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you allow a guest to\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmother Meng was about to speak up for me again, but Suyang cut in, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. She is used to it. Plus, she is my hired 24 hours assistant. That means I\u2019m spending money on her every second. So, she should be doing this type of work. Am I correct, Goldfish?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much is your monthly salary?\u201d Grandmother Meng\u2019s face suddenly changed as she crossed her arms and asked me.</p><br/><p>\u201cTen thousand\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmother Meng appeared to be shocked by the amount. She quickly went over and smacked Suyang, \u201cYou damn child! You have so much money, you don\u2019t know where to spend it? You hired an assistant for 10k?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

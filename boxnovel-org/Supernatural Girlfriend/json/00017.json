Go figure out the rest on your own! Also, if you have any other troubling issues in the future, you can always come find me. This place is rather quiet. Not many people come here and I\u2019m really bored\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked around my surroundings and my mouth twitched. Deep down, I thought to myself, \u201cWhy would anyone want to come here? If they come, they would probably be like me or even weirder.\u201d</p><br/><p>But I was still thankful for Grandmother Meng\u2019s help. At least now I have a general idea of what to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d I gave Grandmother Meng a deep bow and then quickly left. I didn\u2019t want to come back to such an eerie place ever again.</p><br/><p>The moment the elevator door opened on the first floor, Huang Zhiwen was standing in front of me.</p><br/><p>How did he know where I was?</p><br/><p>But since he came to find me, it meant he had already made up his mind.</p><br/><p>It was an unnecessary step, but I decided to ask anyway, \u201cHave you decided to unite with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Zhiwen nodded and floated in front of me.</p><br/><p>I steadily followed behind him. My intuition was telling me that he was going to lead me to the killer.</p><br/><p>Initially, I thought he was going to lead me back to that smelly and dirty alley with garbage piling up like a village deep in the mountains. Surprisingly, after walking for a long time, our destination was poles apart from what I had imagined it to be.</p><br/><p>It was Spring and its prime blooming time. I didn\u2019t know the breeds nor the names. However, there were all sorts of flowers along the paths, alleys, and the parks. They were all trying very hard to stand out amongst each other during their short seasonal lives.</p><br/><p>There was a college nearby and many couples would often be enticed to come over for pictures. To the left and right were peach blossom trees. When the wind blows, the petals would gently fall down onto the pedestrians\u2019 back.</p><br/><p>Huang Zhiwen was pointing at a direction. I followed his finger and noticed there was a college flower shop in the middle of the peach blossom path.</p><br/><p>Every single person who came out of that shop was holding onto a bundle of flowers. Their faces were beaming with joy and all of them had satisfied smiles on their faces. Were they going to declare their love? Or were they the receivers? I honestly couldn\u2019t see the connection between this sweet elegant place and the homicidal maniac.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you positive he\u2019s here?\u201d I frowned as I doubtfully asked Huang Zhiwen.</p><br/><p>He nodded with confidence.</p><br/><p>A smiling middle aged man came out of the flower shop with a flower pot. The moment Huang Zhiwen saw him, he instantly turned around and hid behind something.</p><br/><p>I also went to hide along with Huang Zhiwen as I racked my brain and observed the boss of the store. From the horrified expression on Huang Zhiwen\u2019s face, I was 80-90% sure that he was the killer. But no matter what, I couldn\u2019t connect this guy with the evil and vicious homicidal maniac who tried to kill me.</p><br/><p>In order to confirm, I turned to Sheyu, \u201cIs it really him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sheyu also nodded and my scale swayed.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t help but create a profile in my mind: <i>This is the disguise of the homicidal maniac. His disguise is an ordinary middle aged man. He uses his bloody hands to gently caress flowers. The flower is a symbol for happiness. Beneath his kind smile, he is actively using his merciless eyes to locate his next victim. In order to satisfy his desire, his true self will be revealed in the dark alley when he becomes the killer who finds joy in massacring others. </i></p><br/><p>Thinking of this, I couldn\u2019t help but sweat profusely.</p><br/><p>What am I supposed to do? Although I had managed to find the homicidal maniac with my method, I could not call the cops to capture him because I have no presentable evidence! Do I seriously have to wait until he commits another crime to seize him?</p><br/><p>Deep down, I knew I must not be rash. If by chance the boss escaped because he figured out I knew he was the killer, Sheyu, Huang Zhiwen, and all the other dead victims from before will never forgive me.</p><br/><p>After hesitating over and over again, I turned away from the flower shop and walked the opposite direction.</p><br/><p>For the time being, I must think twice before I act.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, I heard the sound of a vehicle stepping on its emergency brake. My childhood memory of the car accident immediately popped up in front of me and made me feel very uneasy.</p><br/><p>After I snapped out of it, I noticed a car had stopped on my right side of the street. The car window rolled down and revealed Suyang as the driver.</p><br/><p>I recalled our unpleasant interaction from this morning and waited for him to speak first.</p><br/><p>Suyang\u2019s first line was, \u201cYou\u2019re going the wrong way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can go whichever way I want. I\u2019m not a car.\u201d I rolled my eyes at him as I conveniently swept my eyes across his car.</p><br/><p>Ohhh, a luxury car!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am an unemployed person. I\u2019m just strolling around. What about you, huh? Aren\u2019t you an author? Shouldn\u2019t you be at home writing a novel?\u201d As I retorted, my eyes landed on his front passenger seat and I directly entered his car.</p><br/><p>Sheyu and Huang Zhiwen also followed along. They obediently sat behind me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho told you to get on?\u201d Suyang glared at me. His entire body language was telling me to\u2026. Get. Off.</p><br/><p>I pretended not to notice as I put on my seatbelt. I had thick skin, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t want me to get on, then why did you stop your car in front of me? Since I\u2019m already on, you might as well take me along.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUggh. Forget it. I\u2019m going home anyway. It\u2019s on the way home.\u201d Suyang gave up as he started the engine.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going home! I want to go to the Police Station! Please!\u201d I clasped my hand together as I smiled and begged.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet off!\u201d Suyang was trying to kick me off again. I guess my brilliant cute smile didn\u2019t manage to work on him. \u201cThe Police Station is located on the opposite direction. If you want to go, take a taxi yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am giving you a great opportunity right now! Don\u2019t you want to write speculative novels? Don\u2019t you want to get into the psychological minds of criminals? The Police Station is a perfect place for you to learn. You need to cherish your opportunities. Not everyone can casually enter and exit the Police Station, you know?\u201d I teased my hair as I proudly stated.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou and your twisted words and forced logic.\u201d Suyang\u2019s car was still heading towards the direction of the apartment.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, think about it! You and Shen Shaoqian were cosplaying because you wanted to truly experience the roles in order for a more realistic effect, right? If you bring me to the Police Station, you can personally witness all the different types of roles they have from within. It will definitely help you with your writing. Plus\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang seemed to be slightly affected by my flowery speech. \u201cYou\u2019ve almost convinced me. Keep going.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Yessir! </i></p><br/><p>I turned to salute at Suyang as I continued, \u201cThis morning, I told you I was going to capture the homicidal maniac, right? He should be captured in the next few days. Trust me. If you bring me to the Police Station, I will convince the other Police Officers to let you personally interview him after he is seized. That way, you can ask him about his dark and twisted world one on one. Wouldn\u2019t that be great source material for you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>There happened to be an intersection in front of us, and Suyang suddenly made a dramatic turn at the lights as he headed towards the opposite direction. We were heading towards the Police Station!</p><br/><p>Currently, Suyang still had a frozen expression on his face. \u201cCongratulations, you have convinced me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYES! YES!\u201d</p><br/><p>My heart was shrieking from excitement. I was proud of my silver tongue. But for a simple ride, wasn\u2019t this a big price to pay?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so stimulated because I have agreed. I just want to carry on the tradition and virtue of Greater China -protect the animals. You\u2019re merely a goldfish!\u201d Suyang calmly stated.</p><br/><p>\u201cPssssh! I\u2019m fine with being a goldfish! Goldfishes are super cute. Their eyes are so big! Don\u2019t you know?\u201d I rolled my eyes at him as I rebutted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, goldfishes are really cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang carelessly slipped a line, but it really touched me. My finger lingered on the tip of my curled hair as I attentively gazed at Suyang\u2019s side face. Suddenly, I realized he was actually quite adorable.</p><br/><p>\u201cA goldfish only has a memory of seven seconds. I guess it would be ranked as mentally disabled.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou! Annoying goblin!\u201d I shouted. I should have known he would have something else to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cNowadays, the cops don\u2019t just listen and obey. Even if I request, they may not let you see the criminal face to face\u2026\u201d I growled. I wanted to get revenge for the goldfishes.</p><br/><p>After our mouth battle, Suyang and I were very quiet. It was too boring. I couldn\u2019t help but start a new topic, \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s tiring for a person to act like an angel when in reality he\u2019s actually a shady devil?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA lot of people are like that. Who are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA lot of people are like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRegardless of who you are, we all have a different side to us. For example, the way you act towards your parents and teachers would be different. The way you interact with your friends and lover would be different. Perhaps I didn\u2019t have the intentions, but I felt like I had to do it. Or maybe, I wanted to do it but I felt like something was stopping me from acting. Humans tend to contradict themselves. Only when they are alone, are they truly themselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wow, an author was truly an author. His words were so deep. I had difficulties understanding him.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you simplify what you\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor example. When you first met us, didn\u2019t you assume Shen Shaoqian was a criminal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that Suyang mentioned it, I thought about my first impression of Shen Shaoqian.</p><br/><p>True. If I randomly came across him on the streets, I definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to associate the Uncle version of Shen Shaoqian with the hot version of Shen Shaoqian. They completely contradicted each other, even though they were both Shen Shaoqian.</p><br/><p>Seeing how I had lowered my head without a word, Suyang continued, \u201cShaoqian is not a criminal. He had never even purposely stepped on an ant. But he was able to convince you that he was a vicious criminal. Do you see what I mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo basically, you may know a person but you don\u2019t know his true nature? Sometimes, we could be wrong, because what we see was a disguise the entire time\u2026.\u201d I pondered on this thought as I thought of a plan. I turned to Suyan and exclaimed, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to the Police Station anymore. Take me to the hospital!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to go to the hospital again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find out when we get there! Hurry! Turn around!\u201d I urged Suyang as I touched his arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you seriously think I\u2019m your driver\u2026.?\u201d Suyang muttered resentfully, but still altered his path to take me to the hospital.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Just like the scenery that was flashing by outside, many thoughts were running through my mind. My mind was an utter mess.</p><br/><p>As Suyang mentioned, we have so many different relationships between us. But I was afraid that one day, if one of the relationship breaks, all the other ones will naturally fall apart as well.</p><br/><p>Some time later, I ended up falling asleep without knowing. By the time I woke up, the car was already parked in the parking lot downstairs. Apparently, I had fallen asleep against the car door. In addition, I was drooling too.</p><br/><p>I could still sense Suyang on the driver\u2019s seat. I didn\u2019t want him to see that I was drooling, so I didn\u2019t dare to raise my head as I secretly used the lower hem of my jacket to wipe the corner of my mouth to get rid of all noticeable traces. I pretended I had just woken up.</p><br/><p>The moment I lifted my head, Xu Weishan had plastered herself against the car door!</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d I covered my eyes with both my hands as I deeply buried my head. I was so frightened by Xu Weishan that my heart was furiously pounding.</p><br/><p>One second, two seconds, three seconds\u2026</p><br/><p>Just as I was about to recover from fright, Suyang grabbed my hand and smoothly pulled me into his embrace. My mind was starting to turn woozy again.</p><br/><p>Was Suyang hugging me right now?</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know where to put my hands. So currently, my fists were clenched in the air. My entire body was stiff.</p><br/><p>Suyang patted my back as he soothingly comforted me in a soft voice, \u201cDid you have a nightmare? Don\u2019t be afraid\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026.I\u2019m fine. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d I wanted to get up, but there was something behind me that was suppressing me from moving. It was Suyang\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you always like this? You were like this the first time we met. You were also like this at the hotel\u2026.honestly, why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI -I had a nightmare.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA nightmare? You had a nightmare while you were conscious?\u201d Suyang didn\u2019t believe me.</p><br/><p>I nodded, \u201cI\u2019m usually the type that freaks out if the wind blows and the grass moves. Sorry if my reactions scared you. I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Instead of scaring me, initially I thought you were purposely trying to take advantage of me\u2026.by using your stupid cute goldfish methods.\u201d</p><br/><p>I lifted my head and made eye contact with Suyang\u2019s slightly raised eyes.</p><br/><p>I was so serious, yet he was deviating into an inappropriate path. The only way to deal with an inappropriate individual was to be more inappropriate than the individual.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re the one who wants to take advantage of me?! If you continue hugging me like this, I cannot guarantee nothing will happen\u2026.after all, you\u2019re so handsome. I\u2019m not the one at a loss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough, my words were effective. Suyang immediately released me and opened the car door as he backed up.</p><br/><p>I knew it was going to work. Last time I was changing, Suyang had made a big fuss out of nothing. At the end of the day, all he had was a powerful mouth.</p><br/><p>I sighed a breath of relief. Now that Suyang wasn\u2019t saying anything else, I didn\u2019t have to keep acting. I quietly followed him home.</p><br/><p>Suyang had no idea, but there were actually three of us on the same path the entire time. I kept glaring at Xu Weishan, who was next to me. When Suyang walked further ahead, I threatened her underneath my breath, \u201cIf you dare to scare me again, I am not going to help you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, I thought my threat would be sufficient. However, Xu Weishan gave me a blank expression. Then, she pointed her right finger at Suyang, left at me, and combined them together.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you\u2019re thinking!\u201d Seeing how Xu Weishan had misunderstood, I immediately wanted to clarify, \u201cThere is nothing going on between us!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Don\u2019t tell me she thought she was helping me by scaring me\u2026</i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you walking? Why are your hands dancing and feet tripping?\u201d Suyang asked as he stood in front of the passageway.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi! Coming!\u201d I fully ran towards Suyang. When I was next to him, he insulted my short legs and so on. I casted a glance at Xu Weishan and made a long face to prove that someone like Suyang and I would never have that type of relationship.</p><br/><p>Suyang seemed to have forgotten to interrogate me about Grandmother Meng. If he forgot to bring it up, I naturally wouldn\u2019t mention it. After entering the apartment, I ran straight to my room. I pulled the curtains up but didn\u2019t see the mistress by the window. Then, I fell asleep on the bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you wash your face and rinse your mouth before you sleep?\u201d Suyang asked in a disapproving manner as he stood by the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Was it a misconception? Ever since I was at Grandmother Meng\u2019s, I felt an exhaustion that wouldn\u2019t go away. Could it be because the Su descendants had taken turns extracting all of my energy? </i></p><br/><p><i>Who can understand the pain of those in the lowest rung? </i></p><br/><p>\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>I stared at the fake Xu Weishan the entire class. I couldn\u2019t imagined how thick of a skin she must have in order to murder her sister and replace her in such a carefree manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Silu! Bai Silu!\u201d The person next to me nudged my arm and brought my wandering mind back to reality.</p><br/><p>Since I was so focused, I was a bit agitated that she had ruined my train of thought. So, I gave her a big sister attitude and snapped, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe professor just called your name\u2026\u201d The girl\u2019s expression appeared a bit cowardly due to my reaction. She looked wronged.</p><br/><p>I was still very unfamiliar with the name \u201cBai Silu\u201d. I often failed to react to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to pay attention in my class, then I\u2019d rather you leave. I am talking to the student sitting at the very end; Bai Silu classmate. Please take note.\u201d Suyang coldly stated.</p><br/><p>Then, Suyang continued his lessons. But there were a few times that his eyes had swept by me. I could tell he was angry\u2026</p><br/><p>From what I could remember, I didn\u2019t choose a course called \u201chistory of literature\u201d. However, when I received my timetable, the three words \u201chistory of literature\u201d had blatantly appeared on my schedule for every Wednesday afternoon.</p><br/><p>This was the shadow of my life.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Silu, answer my question.\u201d Suyang called my name again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026..?\u201d I shook my head. The whole class had their attention on me. <i>What did Suyang say? I zoned out again? </i></p><br/><p><i>Were University professors supposed to ask the students so many questions?</i> The way Suyang was acting reminded me of my High School homeform teacher. Each time I was caught for not paying attention, he would punish me by making me run around the track.</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t used to having so many eyes on me\u2026.why did he have to purposely make me look bad in front of so many people? Deep down, I resented Suyang.</p><br/><p>The fake Xu Weishan also turned around to look at me. She had a \u201cI know the answer\u201d expression on her face. It really annoyed me.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026..\u201d Before I could say another word, the bell rung.</p><br/><p><i>Yes! Saved by the bell!</i> I secretly rejoiced. But I accidentally made eye contact with Suyang.</p><br/><p>I quickly lowered my head as I mumbled to myself, \u201cI\u2019m invisible. Invisible. He cannot see me. He cannot see me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sadly, he didn\u2019t have the intentions of letting me go as he said in a stern tone, \u201cBai Silu, follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Suyang was a guest professor, the University had given him an office. I guess it was somewhat believable if he was actually a famous author.</p><br/><p>I entered the office sulkily. I purposely left the door open so that his lecturing words would be less cruel; since many students or professors may happen to overhear.</p><br/><p>Suyang icily stated, \u201cClose the door.\u201d All my hopes were shattered.</p><br/><p>I respectfully shut the door and placed my hands politely on top of each other. \u201cBoss\u2026 I can call you that now, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang slammed a textbook on the table as he hollered, \u201cYou didn\u2019t reach my requirements!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the reason why I sent you here. I didn\u2019t send you here for you to daydream in class. We need to get into our roles. I\u2019m the teacher and you\u2019re the student. But. You. Totally. Failed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Each of Suyang\u2019s words jabbed my brain. I was truly speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, please be more clear, boss? Be more specific?! You didn\u2019t have specific requirements, so I acted the way I would\u2019ve. This was how I behaved during my University years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang shook his head, \u201cI told you. I want to gain some insight in regards to a teacher and student relationship. Can you make me feel something?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Forcing a person from society to return back to school was already ridiculous enough. What? Now I have to make you feel something?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cThen tell me what type of girls make you \u2018feel something\u2019? I will work hard towards that direction.\u201d On the surface, I spoke in an amiable manner. I gave off the tone that I knew I was wrong.</p><br/><p>Suyang seized my hand and locked me in between him and his office table.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

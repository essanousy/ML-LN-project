You win!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as I was about to leave, Suyang blocked me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang looked at me like I was a hopeless child as he placed his hand on the top of my head and roughly turned it towards the clock against the wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoldfish, it\u2019s 7:12am. It is time for you to fulfill your obligations from the contract. Time for you to prepare breakfast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Do you think I\u2019m nanny?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the contract, it states that you are responsible for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. So you can go prepare breakfast now. I am not a picky eater. I will eat anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Suyang took out 200rmb from his wallet. \u201cFood allowance.\u201d</p><br/><p>I took the 200rmb and thought of a plan.</p><br/><p>I truly wanted to say, you\u2019ll eat anything, right? If I am the one buying, I\u2019ll definitely buy you the \u201chighest quality\u201d breakfast to match your \u201chigh class\u201d image.</p><br/><p>I smiled cunningly behind Suyang\u2019s back as I took his 200rmb and casually grabbed my jacket. I didn\u2019t even wash my face as I left the door. Deep down, I was thinking, \u201cYou want to have sandwiches with milk? Bread with jam? The typical standard breakfast? Dream on!\u201d</p><br/><p>In less than ten minutes, I had returned back from a breakfast place around the neighbourhood. I was carrying a lot of food.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have breakfast here. Come over and eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>I removed the plastic bag on the dining table and displayed the items that I had bought.</p><br/><p>The breakfast place was known for its soft bean curd with deep fried breadstick. However, I was worried the \u2018young master\u2019 wouldn\u2019t be accustomed to this type of food. So, as a kind-hearted woman, I also bought a steamer basket of one of their most popular dishes -the mincemeat steamed dumplings that had freshly came out of the oven.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Suyang stared at the breakfast that I had bought. His expression looked like he was staring at ET.</p><br/><p>\u201cBreakfast! Eat!\u201d I knew this rich guy had never eaten a commoner\u2019s breakfast. I secretly grinned as I took out two bowls and chopsticks. I sat on the opposite side of Suyang and began to eat.</p><br/><p>As we ate, I silently glanced at Suyang to observe his expression.</p><br/><p>I had already thought of all the things that I would say to mock him if he said it wasn\u2019t his type of meal. Unexpectedly, Suyang didn\u2019t complain at all. He quietly ate everything that I bought.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe soft bean curd tastes better when mixed.\u201d I reminded him.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he lifted his hand towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy money. I gave you $200rmb. You only bought this stuff. What about the rest of my money?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHummph! So stingy!\u201d I muttered as I jammed my hand into my pocket to take out all the leftover change.</p><br/><p>The coins clanged onto the dining table.</p><br/><p>Suyang stared at the wrinkled banknotes and I noticed blue veins appearing on his face. \u201cForget it, use the leftover money to prepare lunch and dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he lowered his head and proceeded with his meal.</p><br/><p>After breakfast, I pretended to tidy up the kitchen. But actually, I was on my phone searching up Suyang in the keywords. Strangely, there was nothing on the web about him. I was puzzled. Was he really an author?</p><br/><p>After observing him for a week, I came up with a conclusion: He was just an otaku that had nothing to do.</p><br/><p>Whenever I was tidying up around the apartment, he would be in the living room either playing video games, watching television, or playing some weird internet games.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, I would quietly watch Suyang play games. He would be very engrossed in it. Watching from the side, I would be as well. But then, he would suddenly throw the game to the side and run back to his room.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? How come you don\u2019t want to play anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>I stared at his closed bedroom doors. He wouldn\u2019t come back out for the rest of the afternoon.</p><br/><p>He left me alone in the living room. But just as I decide to continue playing his game, he would suddenly come back out and ignore my bewildered expression and heartlessly pluck the electric power source and hiss at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to create right now. According to clause 35, you\u2019re not allowed to make any noises to disturb me. No TV.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so demanding\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suyang disregarded my complaint and went back to his room. He shut his door once again.</p><br/><p>I angrily pressed the buttons on the video game controller to release my frustrations. Ugghh. Forget it. I\u2019m so gracious; just like one of those Prime Ministers from Ancient China that can hold a ship in their bellies\u2026I\u2019ll let you go this time!</p><br/><p>At this rate, if I stayed at home, Suyang was going to come out and say I\u2019m breathing too loud and tell me to stop breathing.</p><br/><p>If I can\u2019t move at all, I might as well go out for a breath of fresh air.</p><br/><p>Since it was a work day, aside from the old uncles and aunties that were retired in the neighbourhood, I was the only young person wandering the streets.</p><br/><p>Naturally, people would talk behind my back. \u201cWow, this young lady is always idling around\u2026\u201d <i>You think I want to idle?? It\u2019s society\u2019s fault! It is not allowing me to display my abilities. </i></p><br/><p>I came out for a breath of fresh air because Suyang was boring me to death at home. But if I wander off too far, it would be a big hassle to get back. So I took my cellphone and put some money in my pocket; I decided I was going to walk a few circles around the neighbourhood and then head to the supermarket to conveniently purchase the groceries I needed to make lunch and dinner.</p><br/><p><i>Wow, I was gradually becoming Suyang\u2019s nanny.</i></p><br/><p>Due to my gluttonous mouth, I was carrying a huge watermelon that weighs around 4kg. In addition, the shopping bag around my arm was filled with groceries. By the time I walked out of the supermarket, I felt like my arm was going to break. All the areas of my joints were starting to turn numb.</p><br/><p>While I was shopping and placing the items into the shopping cart, I didn\u2019t feel anything. It wasn\u2019t until I was at the counter that I realized how much I had bought when the numbers continued to increase.</p><br/><p>Ai ya, why did I buy so much?!</p><br/><p>From the supermarket, there was two paths I could take to go home. One path was the path that I took coming here. It was heavy traffic on a main street. But I would need to make a big detour before I could get back to the main entrance of my neighbourhood. The other path I could take was a nearby dark alley that was created in between the walls of houses. However, the alley would lead me straight to the entrance of my neighbourhood.</p><br/><p>The only downside was, the alley was sketchy. And according to the news, there had been an increase in crime these days. Hence, I haven\u2019t taken this path lately.</p><br/><p>But when I saw how much stuff I was carrying, I thought about it for a bit and decided to take the alley.</p><br/><p>What were the chances of people committing crimes during the day?</p><br/><p>The moment I stood outside the alley, I felt a pang of regret. Although I was standing in a bright area, there was no light through the alley at all. The alley was long and narrow, and I couldn\u2019t see the end of it. It was like a mysterious path to space.</p><br/><p>*Gulp*. I swallowed my saliva as I made up my mind.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

As a result, I had never been to any of the so-called class parties before. In my mind, a University party meant everyone would sit around a table to chat and drink beer. Then, perhaps they would go karaoke. After they were all hyped up from singing, they would probably end the night by going to a bar.</p><br/><p>So when the taxi stopped at my destination, I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes.</p><br/><p>The taxi fees alone was almost 100 rmb. In addition, this was probably the city\u2019s five star hotel?!</p><br/><p>The splendid majestic neon lights made the entire building look exceptionally radiant. On this dark night, it illuminated the surroundings. I lifted my head and couldn\u2019t help but open my mouth from shock. <i>This type of place\u2026?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cDriver, are you sure this is the address I gave you?\u201d Once again, I gave the driver the invitation card the girl handed to me. \u201cAre you sure you are at the correct location?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is correct. I inserted the address you gave me.\u201d The driver pointed to his GPS. \u201cMiss, are you trying to default on a payment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not my intentions\u2026\u201d I retracted the card from my hand. I had no other choice but to hurriedly pay the taxi driver and exited before further misunderstandings occurred. When I got off, I stood in front of the hotel in a disarray. From time to time, luxury vehicles would stop by my side and ladies with evening attires would step out.</p><br/><p>I was wearing a white blouse with jeans. In addition, I had no makeup on. In this group of beautiful women, I was extremely conspicuous. After staring attentively at my invitation card, I finally realized what was going on.</p><br/><p>Earlier, I thought it was a bit ridiculous that the University students would create an invitation card for a normal class gathering. But it was actually a formal event\u2026.</p><br/><p>If there weren\u2019t any crack I could drill myself into, I might as well just go home.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Silu classmate!\u201d While I was debating whether I should call a taxi to go home or enter the hotel, someone called me by my fake name. I had no idea I was being called until someone touched my back.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Silu classmate!\u201d</p><br/><p>I suddenly turned around. The person that was calling me was Kevin. He looked different from this morning. Currently, he was wearing a casual suit that made him appear informal but not too shabby. He was young but respectable.</p><br/><p>Kevin seemed to be astonished by my reaction. His hand hovered in mid air and his smile became stiff, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked him instead, \u201cYou\u2019re asking me? How come you scared me from the back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI called your name so many times but you didn\u2019t reply\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After Kevin resumed back to normal, he pursed his lips as he sized me up and down. He had a hand near his mouth to suppress his laughter, \u201cBai Silu classmate, you sure dress with a lot of personality\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>My face immediately felt like it had been splashed with boiled water. It was scorching hot.</p><br/><p><i>Laugh! Laugh as much as you want! </i>I thought to myself. Tonight, being ridicule was going to be unavoidable. This was simply a forewarning. Relax your heart. Relax your mind. You can do it.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, I gently touched my head as I comforted myself, \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to get over this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said\u2026 I didn\u2019t realize it was this type of party. Hence, I wore the wrong clothing\u2026\u201d <i>Is it because I\u2019m not in tuned with the current trends? I didn\u2019t expect the University parties to be so high class nowadays\u2026</i></p><br/><p>Suddenly I felt like the gap between me and the word youth was very very wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I just thought you looked very out of the ordinary today. Being different is beauty.\u201d Kevin gave me a killer pretty boy smile. Deep down I thought to myself, \u201cDamn you, youngster. Trying to shock me with electricity now, eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026really?\u201d I shook my head. Honestly, I didn\u2019t have anything else to say to him. So the two of us just stood there. I felt a breeze of cold wind, and it made the atmosphere even more awkward.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t stand here. Let\u2019s go in!\u201d Kevin suggested.</p><br/><p>I hadn\u2019t decided whether I wanted to stay or not. But Kevin grabbed my arm so I really had no choice.</p><br/><p>\u201cKevin!\u201d The moment we entered the hotel\u2019s banquet hall, a bright female voice called Kevin\u2019s name. Both of us turned towards the source. It was the girl that gave me the invitation card and phone number this morning.</p><br/><p>Thanks to her voice, it broke the awkwardness between me and Kevin. I felt a breath of relief.</p><br/><p>The girl was wearing a black dress. There was an unique rose on her left shoulder strap. She walked over with a complicated expression and looped her arm over Kevin\u2019s as she slightly tilted her chin and coldly glared at me.</p><br/><p>Compared to this morning, she was much more aggressive. How should I say it? She was domineering to the bones. In any case, she seemed much more natural now than before.</p><br/><p>Based on their intimate gesture, they were probably a couple. <i>No wonder the girl\u2019s expression changed. It\u2019s fine. I understand.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Xu Weishan. Do you still remember me, Silu classmate?\u201d Xu Weishan half leaned on Kevin as she fakely smiled at me, \u201cHow come you came dressed like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ok. Now I was starting to feel uncomfortable by her hostility; especially since my outfit didn\u2019t fit the venue.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was this type of party\u2026\u201d <i>Do I have to explain to every single person? </i>Just as I was about to say goodbye to this couple, the ghost that had sat next to me this morning suddenly popped out from behind Xu Weishan. It was as if she had plastered herself on Weishan\u2019s body. Two of her hands were tightly gripping her by the shoulders, and she exposed half her face. The ghost gawked at me with a hidden bitterness.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d I was so scared by her face that I sprouted cold air as I continuously backed away.</p><br/><p>However, my legs couldn\u2019t keep up with the speed I was going. When I was just about to trip over myself and fall onto the ground, two hands steadily supported me by the shoulders.</p><br/><p>I looked up and saw Suyang\u2019s face. His face appeared colder than his usual. Why was he here?</p><br/><p>I\u2019m so unlucky\u2026</p><br/><p>But if it weren\u2019t for him, I would probably have fallen over with four limbs in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen will you not make me lose face, Goldfish?!\u201d Suyang quietly muttered so only the two of us could hear. After he straighten my position, he used a deceptive tone as he smiled at me, \u201cAre you alright, student?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, I wanted to puke.</p><br/><p>Xu Weishan and Kevin were surprised by my reaction. They both looked at each other in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Xu Weishan began to approach me.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come over here!\u201d I hid behind Suyang. I wanted to keep a distance from Xu Weishan. The moment she comes near me, the ghost will follow along. Since they both have the same face, I was very disturbed.</p><br/><p>It was like a person with two heads\u2026</p><br/><p>Although I knew there was something fishy about this, I wasn\u2019t bored to the point where I want to find trouble for myself.</p><br/><p>After all, dealing with one Suyang was already enough work.</p><br/><p>After I calmed myself down, I used my left hand to tug Suyang\u2019s suit as a signal, \u201cI\u2019m fine. Xu Weishan classmate and Kevin classmate, you two enter first\u2026. I-I\u2019m waiting for someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d Xu Weishan gave me an odd expression as she left with Kevin looped in arm.</p><br/><p>While they walked by me, the female ghost\u2019s glare never left me\u2026.in addition, her head made a 180 degree turn! Seeing her made me nauseous.</p><br/><p>After those two left, Suyang used two hands to straighten my collar and pulled me in front of him. He looked at my fearful face and asked, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before I could reply, he continued sarcastically, \u201cI knew Bai classmate is a bit different, but I didn\u2019t know Bai classmate would stand out so much from the masses. Above all, your taste in clothing is truly out of the ordinary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only the two of us, can you speak normally?\u201d I avoided Suyang\u2019s eyes as I stared at the western painting on the hotel wall. I knew I was an embarrassment.</p><br/><p>Suyang glanced left and right as he gnashed his teeth, \u201cWe definitely need to find a good spot to talk!\u201d Then, he forcefully dragged me along.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can walk!\u201d I fought back. But Suyang was much stronger than me; I couldn\u2019t pull out of his grasp.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

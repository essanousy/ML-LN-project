As if to reward their attention, the fireballs started to expand. \u00a0The fireballs, which had been the size of a child's fist, was suddenly the size of a man's head. \u00a0At that moment, the Skeleton Magicians immediately threw their fireballs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-rooh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The five fireballs flew in an arc. \u00a0At the end of the arc, there was a battle going on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggah-ahng, kah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sound of steel striking was endless. \u00a0It was very easy to differentiate between the two groups that was fighting. \u00a0The contrast was stark.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One side was composed of Skeleton Warriors with horns on their head. \u00a0They were wearing an armor that was made out of black colored barks. \u00a0On the other side, one could see adequately armored humanoid lizards that had black feathers coming off their hides. \u00a0They were the Black Grooming Lizard Warriors </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The battle between the Skeleton Warriors and the Grooming Lizards were fierce and closely contested. \u00a0The two groups were so close to each other that a mumble could be heard by the other side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Five enormous fireball fell into the battlefield. \u00a0Of course, the fireballs didn't differentiate between enemies and allies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puh-uhng, puh-uhng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The five consecutive sound of explosions swept across the battlefield. \u00a0The black feathers of the Grooming Lizards started to burn, and the Skeleton Warriors started to let out black colored blood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Black Grooming Lizard Warriors were affected by the Black Sap.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Black Tree set's effect had been activated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, the Skeleton Warriors immediately regained their original form. They regained their original imposing form, and one couldn't see any trace of magical damage on them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, the Grooming Lizard Warriors looked unseemly from the effects of the magical attack. \u00a0Their feathers were burning, and the Black Sap clinging to them were quickly diminishing their HP.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sha-ah! Shah-ah! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bloody cry came out out of the Grooming Lizards' mouth. \u00a0It wasn't a threatening cry. \u00a0It was most definitely a cry filled with pain. \u00a0Even this didn't last long. \u00a0A Skeleton Knight appeared with the Black Cobalt King's sword in front of it, and its presence shut the mouths of the Grooming Lizards. \u00a0The Grooming Lizards were so tense that they didn't even attempt to quench the flame sticking to their hide.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Knight didn't let out any sound. \u00a0It just opened its mouth wide, and it pointed its sword towards the Grooming Lizard Warriors once. \u00a0It let out a silent roar as it charged. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The explosions caused by the magic had created a state of lull on the battlefield, but the Skeleton Knight once again turned the stage into a pandemonium.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan wasn't looking at this sight. \u00a0Hyrkan's gaze was to the left. \u00a0In the distance, there was a User observing at Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere's the next location?\u201d \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The User immediately answered Hyrkan's question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe've already prepared it!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the Black Grooming Lizard's nest. \u00a0This was the exclusive hunting ground of the Red Bulls guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Warlord had level up support teams.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a very absurd concept. \u00a0However, the 30 great guilds, the Underfoot guilds and any large guilds possessed level up support teams. \u00a0Even some individuals possessed a personal level up team. \u00a0The First One Sulwoo, who was ranked number 1 in Warlord's Level Ranking, was a prime example.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the role of a level up support team was to help a User increase their level.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The basic procedure was for the team to give material support. \u00a0In truth, most decent sized guilds participated in doing this. \u00a0They designated a fixed region as their main hunting ground, and the guild provided Items to guild members as needed as they hunted. \u00a0By extension, there were also Buff teams that casted only Buff and Healing magic. \u00a0Then there were the Gathering teams that rounded up the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI knew he was a monster, but I never knew what kind of a monster he was.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bower was the team leader of the Red Bulls guild\u2019s level up support team. He was basically the hidden trainer of the Red Bulls guild, and he was very experienced. \u00a0At the same time, he was very close to Chev in real life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was a User affiliated with the Red Bulls, but he had realized he had no talent for this game early on. \u00a0This was why he had helped out the Red Bulls with extrinsic matters, and this was how he was able to rise to his current position.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, he was assisting \u00a0the Hahoe Mask in leveling up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- His hunting speed is amazing. \u00a0It would take 5 minutes for a 3 man party to clear it, yet he is doing it in 3 minutes by himself. \u00a0If we just talk in terms of efficiency, his hunting speed is about 5 times faster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Bower wasn't the only one helping the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The owner of the voice that had responded to Bower was named Ricky. \u00a0He was a young 20 year old, who liked Warlord. \u00a0It had only been two month, since they started to work together, so he was a beginner to all of this. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe isn't really 5 times faster, but his speed seems to on par with the First One.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ricky was a younger cousin of one of the Red Bulls guild\u2019s officers. His work on the Support team was a temporary job he was doing to make some money on the side. \u00a0He was also a big fan of the First One.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Is he really comparable to the First One?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn my opinion, he is faster than the First One.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- What? \u00a0No way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This happened from time to time. \u00a0Ricky had parachuted into the level up support team through his background, so he didn't hesitate to disagree with his superior. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The First One powered through level 220 yesterday. \u00a0He now has a 15 level difference between the top 100! \u00a0In truth, if you compare him to the Hahoe Mask, it is an insult to the First One.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bower couldn't help, but let out a bitter laugh at Ricky's response.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If someone saw this, one would think he is my superior.\u2019 \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he didn't like Ricky's reaction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, he understood Ricky's reaction. If one looked at Ricky's word from a normal User\u2019s perspective, he wasn't wrong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First One was a speed demon at leveling up. \u00a0No, he was something more than that. \u00a0The proof was in his ranking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every Ranker within the top 100 tried to level up as if it was a life and death task. \u00a0A single level difference was like a difference of 1 second in a 100 meter sprint. It was a very big difference.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yet the First One was steadily creating a distance between the level 100 Ranked User and him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Bower knew about this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bower had led the Red Bulls' level up support team from an early point in time. \u00a0One of his duties was to find faster ways to level up, so he had researched the know hows of the Rankers. \u00a0This was why Bower was much more knowledgeable about the First One than Ricky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0I spoke in error.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he wasn't going to argue with Ricky right now. \u00a0He'll just secretly talk to Chev. \u00a0He'll just tell Chev that Ricky is an asshole. \u00a0Then Chev will handle the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The First One is the best.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ricky had no idea about his fate, so he stubbornly restated his opinion. \u00a0However, his tantrum didn't enter Bower's ears. \u00a0Bower once again looked at the Hahoe Mask's battle footage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, he didn't need to assist the Hahoe Mask in leveling up. \u00a0Bower wasn't just some simple trainer. \u00a0He was like the the Daddy Long Legs of the primary raid team members in the Red Bulls guild. \u00a0He had been supporting them since they were around level 20~30. \u00a0Bower was like a big brother to all the experienced Users of the Red Bulls.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even with such a status, he was given this task, because he was assigned to steal all of the Hahoe Mask's know how. \u00a0He was tasked in stealing the Hahoe Mask's ridiculous hunting method, battle method and any other information that made him special.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He's faster than the First One.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he was confident in his answer. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask's hunting speed was faster than the First One when the First One was at the same level as the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018However, the fights are too tight. \u00a0He doesn't let up.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, he could see the weakness of the Hahoe Mask. The Hahoe Mask fought urgently once he entered into a battle. \u00a0He had to stay focused throughout in order to finish the battle as fast as possible. \u00a0This was a clear difference from the First One.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The First One varied the pace of a battle even during a battle. \u00a0If he wanted to work fast, he could catch it in 5 minutes. \u00a0However, he didn't overwork himself to catch it in 5 minutes. \u00a0Instead, he hunted slowly to catch it in 10 minutes. It was a method used to delay the fatigue and loss of concentration that developed in battles. \u00a0The First One used this method to notch an unprecedented amount of play time. \u00a0He held the record.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His philosophy was the one who runs the longest beats the sprinter. \u00a0He was the proof of this philosophy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, the Hahoe Mask was a mutation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He's dangerous.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why it was dangerous. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask had gone against the traditional method. He was using his method to narrow the distance between the First One and the high level Rankers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn't matter if it was a small change or a big change. \u00a0If the Hahoe Mask was able to rise into the level ranking, there would be a change in how things work. The Red Bulls was currently on the top of this existing order, so this change might work against them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bower was deep in his thought, and his face continued to harden.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The Hahoe Mask requested for the Last Spot. \u00a0He wants to know the region with the most monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Bower heard the voice of a manager helping out next to the Hahoe Mask, he relaxed his hardened expression.</span></p><br/><p>7.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hyrkan] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Level : 179 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Class : Necromancer </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Title : 144</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Stats : Strength(2192)/Stamina(1132)/Intelligence(1327)/Magic Power(1601) </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun was checking the Hahoe Mask's Character. \u00a0There was a half empty pouch of a jelly drink hanging from his mouth. \u00a0It was a drink with a difficult name. \u00a0It was called the Smart Pouch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Slurp! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun quickly sucked the jelly out again, and the pouch shriveled up. \u00a0He sucked on it until not a single drop of liquid was coming out. \u00a0Ahn-jaehyun furrowed his brows.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I only sucked on it couple times, yet it's all gone?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun took the pouch out of his mouth, and he haphazardly tossed it on top of the table. There were three emaciated packs on the table. \u00a0If one looked a little to the side, there was a black bag with countless emaciated pouches placed in it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a meal replacement jelly made for patients, who were having a hard time digesting food. \u00a0This was Ahn-jaehyun's main meal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It is really expensive, tasteless and small in quantity.... Shit. \u00a0What the hell am I doing?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the Argardo Raid, Ahn-jaehyun's insides hadn't calmed down, and he was still in a bad state.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had went to the hospital, and a gastroscopy was done. The doctor told him there wasn't any big problems with him, but he may be suffering from a digestive problem. \u00a0As a precaution, he was told to refrain from foods that may act as triggers. \u00a0He was told to lessen his stress, and he was \u00a0ordered to do physical activities on a regular schedule.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the only advice Ahn-jaehyun followed was to avoid eating food that triggered his condition. \u00a0That was the only one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead, Ahn-jaehyun played on a more tighter schedule than usual. \u00a0He had no choice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I just need to jump one more level to reach level 180.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had negotiated with the Red Bulls. \u00a0To be precise, he blackmailed them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He sent a one-sided message saying he won't participate in the Immoral Prince Raid until he reached level 180. \u00a0The Red Bulls had used the Hahoe Mask's name to sell commercial spots in the live broadcast, so they couldn't just overlook his message. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Red Bulls had to reveal a spot that wasn't even revealed to the masses yet. \u00a0They allowed Ahn-jaehyun to use the Black Grooming Lizard's nest as his hunting ground. \u00a0They even attached a level up support team to him. \u00a0This was why everything else other than the actual act of hunting was all provided for by the Red Bulls. \u00a0They didn't hesitate to provide him with consumable Items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a chance that might never come again. \u00a0His insides were hurting, but he couldn't pass by this opportunity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018After I finish my level up, I'll be going into the Immoral Prince Raid immediately. \u00a0I have to raise my conditioning as much as possible before that occurs.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since he was given this opportunity, Ahn-jaehyun had to be at the top of his game in the Immoral Prince Raid after he reaches level 180. \u00a0It was probably too much to expect his insides to get better when he considered the various stress he was under.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Still, the events are coming along quite well.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, there hadn't been much chaos created by the Immoral Prince Raid yet. \u00a0It wasn't as if no one had tried to defeat it. \u00a0The normal users possessing the Battle Tokens allied with each other. \u00a0They put together the hints given on the Battle Tokens to find the secret location where the Immoral Prince was hiding. \u00a0Two attempts had been made on the Raid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The result of these two attempts were very bleak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Immoral Prince is unassailable! \u00a0If the group doesn't achieve victory, the group is wiped out!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The strongest boss monster in history has appeared. \u00a0What can be done to clear it?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Wiped out! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one was able to earn a Battle Token, one was a pretty skilled User in Warlord. \u00a0However, these Users weren't able to have an active role against the Immoral Prince. \u00a0None of them were even able to have a decent fight with the Immoral Prince.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how strong the Immoral Prince was. \u00a0The footages of the battle with Immoral Prince was released. \u00a0Even the Hydra, Stormhunters and Red Bulls guild didn't dare to attempt the Immoral Prince Raid rashly. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What more explanation was needed?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was also the reason why the Red Bulls was helping the Hahoe Mask level up without any complaints. \u00a0The participation of the Hahoe Mask in the Immoral Prince wasn't optional anymore. \u00a0It was a necessity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This didn't mean Ahn-jaehyun was thrilled with the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This won't be easy.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before he returned to the past, he never experienced fighting the Immoral Prince. \u00a0He hadn't dared to fight it. \u00a0This was the first time he was contemplating a potential fight with the Immoral Prince after seeing the video. \u00a0The fact that this would be his first experience made a chill run up his spine.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, the clear method was very simple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immoral Prince was strong because of the Power of Corruption. \u00a0It was an ancient power that had been left behind by the Fallen Kingdom. \u00a0Moreover, relics emitting this ancient power were hidden around the Immoral Prince. \u00a0Of course, the Immoral Prince would lose significant amount of power every time one of these relics were destroyed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the Immoral Prince Raid was about blocking the Immoral Prince, so it couldn't interfere with the Relic Destruction Team.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The content was simple. However, it was hard to carry it out the plan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It is much faster than expected.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The biggest problem was its speed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Up until now in Warlord, speed had been a User's weapon. \u00a0However, the speed showcased by the Immoral Prince was faster than any User.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the type of skills used by the Immoral Prince was troublesome. \u00a0His trigonal symbol represented Wisdom, Might and Mission. \u00a0As someone that represented a symbol with these 3 meanings behind it, the Immoral Prince was able to use skills that was similar to the main skills of the Swordsman class and the Magician class.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In fact, the Immoral Prince's skills were significantly more powerful than the skills used by the Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Skills were strengthen using the Fallen Kingdom's power. \u00a0Of course, normal skills can't hold a candle to it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skills used by the Immoral Prince was part of the new contents the Users would face once they reached the third part of the Main Scenario Quest. \u00a0It was the Fallen Kingdom episode.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways,, the Immoral Prince was a monster that possessed every advantage that a User had. \u00a0This shouldn\u2019t be seen as facing a Raid opponent. \u00a0One had to think of it as a PVP battle. This was why the Immoral Prince Raid needed multiple skilled Users. \u00a0One needed experts that could last at least one minute with the Immoral Prince.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018In the end, we have to use our numeric superiority.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was the Hydra guild's Sohank, Red Bull's Chev, Stormhunter's Shir and the Hahoe Mask Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These 4 people would decide whether the Raid would be a success or a bust.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An automatic sigh came out of Ahn-jaehyun's mouth when he thought about it. \u00a0Including himself, there were four people who he knew were skilled enough. \u00a0On the other hand, would the four Users, who were overflowing with personalities, be able to work together? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I hope the crazy bitch doesn't fight the crazy bastards.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even the thought of it made his insides hurt. \u00a0Ahn-jaehyun picked up a jelly pouch to calm his stomach. He clamped his mouth over it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Huh?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Ahn-jaehyun saw an icon indicating the arrival of an email on his Tablet PC. \u00a0Ahn-jaehyun lightly touched it with his finger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was sent by Chev.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What can this be?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The content was....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018In the end, that crazy bitch did something reckless!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Stormhunters guild had gone rogue.</span></p><br/><p>8.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018No matter how I see it, this is crazy. \u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch was putting the consumable items into the pockets that was present all over his body. \u00a0He stopped his movements for a brief moment, and he shook his head from side to side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018She wants to do the Immoral Prince Raid by ourselves....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Immoral Prince Raid was failed twice, the Immoral Prince moved to a different location.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Clues that notified one of the location of the Immoral Prince was given through the Battle Tokens. \u00a0The Stormhunters guild used their information network, and they were able to find the location immediately. \u00a0Everything up until that point was business as usual.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, when the location was discerned, a special order came down mobilizing the Raid teams on standby for the Immoral Prince Raid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She wanted to attempt the Immoral Prince Raid with only the Stormhunters! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Queen has completely lost her mind.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This decision couldn't have come from a rational and logical mind. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If other words, this was evidence that Shir was idescribably angry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Well, she had been treated like a complete third wheel up until now. \u00a0If one considered the Queen's personality, it is a miracle that she had lasted until now.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir had always received the best spotlights. \u00a0She had always been in the top spot, yet no one was paying attention to her recently. \u00a0This lack of interest was a humiliation that was hard for her to endure.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the Hahoe Mask's fame was piercing through the sky, and without her realizing it, the Red Bulls were being considered the best of the 30 great guilds. \u00a0This was a definite problem, and she wouldn't stand for it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one messed with Shir, it was basically pushing a button that made a bomb explode.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This isn't the right move.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hatch mustered up his courage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Stormhunters was Hatch's place of employment. \u00a0Warlord was a part of his life now. \u00a0The cost of a failed raid would be enormous. He was well aware of this fact. \u00a0If this was inevitable, he had to blunt the damage. \u00a0When a leader decides to do something reckless, the subordinate had to stop the bleeding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018In the end, the Queen won't listen to me if I speak... \u00a0I have no choice, but to inform the Hydra and Red Bulls.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch was determined to see this through.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Uh-whew. \u00a0I have to quickly get out of this guild. \u00a0If I stay here, I don't think I'll live a full life. \u00a0The hospital said they saw some bleeding from my GI tract. \u00a0I was told to avoid eating trigger foods, and to avoid stress.....\u2019</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

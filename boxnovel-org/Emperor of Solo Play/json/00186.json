\u00a0What about the Eat the Tail method?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 It doesn\u2019t work.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The underlings of the Barbarian King was different from the Corrupted monsters from the great battle. \u00a0They were smarter. \u00a0They also possessed their original battle instincts, yet they were able to move in perfect order as a group.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- No, the problem isn\u2019t really about killing the miscellaneous monsters. \u00a0We can take care of them through large scale magical bombardment. \u00a0However, the problem is the Barbarian King! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The 1st Phase isn\u2019t easy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 Isn\u2019t it just destroying the Protection Gems? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 Two to three Strikers are killed when destroying just one Gem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the biggest conundrum was the Barbarian King itself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Barbarian King was strong. \u00a0While the Gems on its armor was active, magical and physical attacks had no effect.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, the first button that had to be opened was to destroy the 31 Gems embedded on the Barbarian King\u2019s armor. \u00a0The destruction of the Gem couldn\u2019t be done through magic. \u00a0It had to be done through physical attacks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, it couldn\u2019t be destroyed with one powerful blow. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Twice!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn\u2019t matter how strong one\u2019s attack was. \u00a0It took two powerful attacks to destroy a single Gem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The Barbarian King\u2019s battle capability is too high. \u00a0Aggro management with this bastard is useless.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 This is the crux of the problem. \u00a0The Barbarian King\u2019s difficulty level is out of our league.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 The skilled Strikers can\u2019t last against the Barbarian King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When a User stuck close to the Barbarian King\u2019s body, it reacted immediately. \u00a0If a User tried to stick to the body, it immediately reacted by stepping on the Users with its enormous feet. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It also used its long arms to dislodge the Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When caught by the hands of the Barbarian King, the Users were crushed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the past 31 attempts at the Barbarian King Raid, no Users had survived being caught by the Barbarian King\u2019s hands! \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The destruction of the Protection Gem is at least doable. \u00a0The problem is the 2nd Phase.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The Storm Judgement Mode is messed up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the worst and the most ridiculous part occurred when it entered into the 2nd Phase.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When all the Protection Gems were destroyed, the Barbarian King\u2019s golden armor lost its power. \u00a0It was possible to stab the Barbarian King, and magical spells could harm it. \u00a0However, at the same time, the Barbarian King carried out the Dragon\u2019s Judgement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dark clouds started to fill the sky, \u00a0and a random User nearby was struck down by the Judgement. \u00a0The Judgement was so powerful that a Tanker fully equipped with Lightning Resistant set suffered a Game Over by being hit once. \u00a0Even if one was able to survive it, the Stun Effect would last for 10 minutes, so one would basically be a living corpse. \u00a0No Skill could undo the Stun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Its healing ability is more messed up than the Storm Judgement Mode.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 This is the biggest problem. \u00a0Who cares if magical and physical attack works? \u00a0It just recovers from everything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the Users faced these tribulations, the Barbarian King displayed an almost unlimited healing ability. \u00a0It was a monster amongst monsters. \u00a0The idea of facing such a Boss monster was almost unimaginable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At a certain point, the Users gave up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone now wanted someone else to catch the Barbarian King. \u00a0They left it alone as they harbored such expectations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the tyranny of the Barbarian King didn\u2019t end there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The monsters are moving with the Barbarian King?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Please investigate the regen rate by comparing the region before and after the Barbarian King appears.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It\u2019s confirmed. \u00a0The regen rate of the monster decreases sharply after the Barbarian King passes by!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The the Barbarian King passed by a region, and it pulled the nearby monsters. \u00a0No monsters were left behind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In some ways, this was the biggest blow to the Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Iron Lion Road was discovered, the Users no longer had to be stalled by the Voodook\u2019s Tunnel. \u00a0They started crossing the Urugal mountain range using a wide road.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why a significant number of Users over level 200 had stepped onto the Black Continent. \u00a0Naturally, there was a shortage of monsters. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While this shortage was ongoing, the appearance of the Barbarian King dropped the regen rate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To top it off, a half a dozen Users had to compete with each other for a single monster. \u00a0It was a scene that reminded one of the early days of Warlord. \u00a0The situation now repeated with Users over level 200. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To make things worse, the Five Stars and the 30 great guilds had already taken over the decent hunting grounds. \u00a0They had taken advantage of their early arrival at the Black Continent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, they didn\u2019t allow the normal Users to hunt in their hunting grounds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The normal Users couldn't even properly express their dissatisfaction. \u00a0The normal Users weren\u2019t the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Shouldn\u2019t the 30 great guilds step forward? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Didn\u2019t they announce their nonparticipation? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 Isn\u2019t this a dereliction of duty if they do nothing? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 Didn\u2019t the normal Users commend them for not participating?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 Still, this is too much! \u00a0We can\u2019t even play the game! We can\u2019t even hunt! \u00a0It has been 5 hours, since I\u2019ve logged on. \u00a0I only caught nine monster!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The hamsters of Tobot Soft\u2026. Please spread the monsters! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the key to the start and end of the event was being held by the 30 great guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The normal Users wanted them to use this key to end the Barbarian King event. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the 30 guilds didn\u2019t move. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several guilds tried to move, but they were interfered by other guilds. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the silence by the Five Stars and the Stormhunters guild hurt the most, since they possessed the most influence on the Black Continent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the Users gave up. \u00a0A portion of the Users returned to the other side of the Urugal mountain range. \u00a0The Black Continent was slowly reverting back to what it was before it was found.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The Hahoe Mask wants to catch the Barbarian King?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In such turbulent times, a hero started to move.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask had kept his silence up until that point. \u00a0He was north of the Red Desert. \u00a0He had been catching the Tattoo Scorpions in the Red Wildland, but now a rumor started to gain traction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Even the Hahoe Mask wouldn\u2019t be able to catch the Barbarian King by himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 I agree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 Even the Hahoe Mask can\u2019t do this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Users were pessimistic about the rumor. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask was an extraordinary gamer, but the Barbarian King was too big to taken down by himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- That is why the Hahoe Mask is gathering Users to fight with him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u00a0He is gathering Users? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 From what I hear, he\u2019ll take a screenshot with everyone, who participates.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 Really? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 He will also give out Hahoe Masks made by him!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In such a situation, a new rumor gained steam.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Afterwards, Hahoe Mask spoke through a youtube video. \u00a0He addressed the rumor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll battle the Barbarian King. \u00a0Please open a way for me. \u00a0If you set up the stage and occupy the monsters, I\u2019ll defeat the Barbarian King. \u00a0The stage will be at the Bizma Plains. \u00a0I\u2019ll battle the Barbarian King there. \u00a0Please I need all your help.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was no longer a rumor. \u00a0Hahoe Mask started his recruitment pitch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, who you are. \u00a0Everyone is welcome to join. \u00a0Moreover, I\u2019ll be handing out a Hahoe Mask to anyone who joins.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Event started for real.</span></p><br/><p>9.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease don\u2019t get too close to me. \u00a0It\u2019ll look too friendly.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m kidding. \u00a0Please get closer to me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a long line. \u00a0At the front of the line, a User wearing a shoddy Hahoe Mask was taking a picture with the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0Every User in line either had a Hahoe Mask on their face or they were holding one in their hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While the Users were waiting, 50 Skeletons were dancing off to the side. \u00a0The group of Skeletons were doing a dance from Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller music video. \u00a0They were dancing without music, and it caused the Users to burst out in laughter instead of clapping.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Skeletons are cute. \u00a0I want to keep one as a pet.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou want to make it your pet? \u00a0I bet it is stronger than you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf the Hahoe Mask flicks his fingers twice, this place will turn into hell.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then there was a large Bone Dragon, which was 20 meters in length, lying off to the side. \u00a0Users climbed atop it to start taking pictures. \u00a0Some even got on the back to make it look like they were riding the Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m a Dragon Rider!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey. \u00a0I want you to take a good picture of me!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a different corner, a 10 meter tall Earth Golem was standing still. \u00a0The Users were conducting a climbing competition.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an event set up for Strikers, who wanted to show off their climbing skill. \u00a0In a flash, the Strikers climbed to the the head of Golem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Some Users clapped their hands when they saw this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, no Users were climbing up the Iron Golem. \u00a0The Iron Golem was too slick to climb. \u00a0Instead, the Iron Golem was being used as a surface where the Users could graffitti on it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the Hahoe Mask theme park!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Couple days ago, this place was where the Users fought desperately against the monsters. \u00a0However, the Bizma Plain held a festive atmosphere right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Whatever.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hyrkan had to do all of this for free, so it was driving him nuts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan gritted his teeth when he couldn\u2019t see the end of the line.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahoe Mask-nim. \u00a0Cheese! \u00a0Cheese!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Hyrkan\u2019s expression, the User demanded a smile for his screenshot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCheese.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan yelled out cheese.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The User seemed satisfied by the result, so the User distanced himself from the Hahoe Mask to check the screenshot. \u00a0Then a new User sidled up next to Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSay cheese.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The User immediately asked for him to say cheese, and Hyrkan couldn\u2019t turn down the request.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Yes, I\u2019ll laugh.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tomorrow these Users, who were demanding him to say cheese, would fight the Barbarian King\u2019s underlings with their lives on the line.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan thought about what happened couple days ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling told Hyrkan of his plan to spread the rumor that the Hahoe Mask would be participating in the Barbarian King Raid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First, the rumor was disseminated. \u00a0When the rumor became ripe, Hahoe Mask used his youtube page to gather the Users. \u00a0Afterwards, Hahoe Mask made a theme park at the Bizma Plain. \u00a0This was where the battle would take place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, they hadn\u2019t planned on putting up the Hahoe Mask theme park. \u00a0Hyrkan had planned on giving a speech to the gathered Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would have said they were the only ones that could stop the Barbarian King. \u00a0He would have warned them about the consequences that would result if they failed. \u00a0The Black Continent would be turned into an inhospitable land. \u00a0He had wanted to warn the Users about the dangers again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wanted to make an resistance army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, everyone had ignored his idea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho\u2019ll come if you do that?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI agree. \u00a0No one wants to play the game under such a heavy cloud. \u00a0We are playing to have fun.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Who would want to come if he did that?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Most Users just wanted to enjoy this game. \u00a0They didn\u2019t want to play under such a heavy atmosphere. \u00a0Not many people wanted to play as if they were under a gun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Users avoided such desperate struggles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No one wanted to throw their bodies into a dangerous battle under such circumstances especially when it was almost a given that they\u2019ll suffer a 48 hour break.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, the Users wouldn\u2019t mind giving up 48 hours if the task turned out to be interesting and fun. \u00a0They would invest their time if it was a task they liked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow about we make a theme park? \u00a0It\u2019ll be a theme park where Users will be able touch Hahoe Mask-nim\u2019s familiars!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat sounds great. \u00a0What has gotten into you? \u00a0How could you come up with this plan?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0Of course, you would never be able to come up with such an idea.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Are you trying to pick a fight with me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how the plan for a Hahoe Mask theme park came into being. \u00a0They had expected a strong resistance from the Hyrkan, but he was receptive to the idea. \u00a0This surprised everyone. \u00a0Whistling became the representative of the surprised group, and he asked the question in everyone\u2019s mind. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you really fine with this?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the question, Hyrkan gave an answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey are willing to die for me, so at the very least, I should do this for them. \u00a0Moreover, Yojori is right. \u00a0People play this game to have fun. \u00a0If it isn\u2019t fun, who would want to play this game?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan recalled the answer he had given before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Yes. \u00a0They are here to die for me, so I should smile for them.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCheese.\u201d</span></p><br/><p>10.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From the beginning, Warlord\u2019s days were numbered. \u00a0To be precise, an order was given to the M.I. by the Tobot Soft after the M.I. created Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was told to create a Quest that could be carried out by the Users. \u00a0Three Main Scenario Quests were made, and the game\u2019s setting could be changed as it progressed. \u00a0Each Main Scenario Quest had to have contents that would last a year. \u00a0\u00a0The wanted a game they could produce and run for 3 years.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The command they had given was a test parameter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a test to see if the M.I. could produce and run the game correctly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Tobot Soft wanted to check how well their orders was being completed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why they picked capable and competent testers to check out the Virtual Reality.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If thing went according to plan, this test would last for two years.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, two variables occurred afterwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The first variable was the fact the Warlord\u2019s degree of completion was beyond imagination.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The second variable occurred when Tobot Soft ran into financial troubles. \u00a0They were developing various project simultaneously using artificial intelligence. \u00a0They were producing virtual reality content, yet they didn\u2019t have a business model to gain revenue. \u00a0The investors started to hound them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, they had to make revenue any way they could. \u00a0They had to satisfy the investors, so Warlord was immediately put into service. \u00a0This immediately turned Tobot Soft in the new leader of the VR contents market.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that time, Toby Gwynn had made calculations. \u00a0He figured out how much money they would rake in from delaying the Main Scenario Quest by one year. \u00a0Then he calculated the time he would need to come up with another content that would put them on the top again. \u00a0At that moment, Tobi Gwynn gathered the original testers, and he offered them a new contract.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was when the Hands guild was formed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At first, the Hands guild directed events from the shadows. \u00a0They slowed down the consumption of the game content. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t too hard. \u00a0The content called the Main Scenario quest was consumed the fastest by the 30 great guilds. \u00a0So they just had to control the 30 great guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, a User had appeared one day, and he was better than the 30 great guilds. \u00a0Moreover, it was impossible to bargain with or recruit this User. \u00a0All the tactics used by the Hands guild didn\u2019t work on him. \u00a0In the end, they had to send out a member named Horus as an agent. \u00a0He was sent out to dominate the 30 great guilds, and he would forcefully change the flow of events in Warlord. \u00a0Of course, this plan also failed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the important point here was the fact that not all the members of the Hands guild were exposed to the sun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They formed a powerful group within

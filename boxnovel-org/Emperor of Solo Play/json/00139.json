It also had thick spikes, which was especially impressive. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The second line wore red scaled armors, and it reminded one of Dragon Scales. \u00a0There was a round wooden shield in their left hand, and they held a very wild-looking scimitar in their right hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The third line of Skeleton Warriors wore leather armors. \u00a0It looked to be very well tanned. \u00a0The green colored leather was very slick. \u00a0It was quite mysterious in that the green colored leather kept blending into the surrounding vegetations. \u00a0It made their presence dim. \u00a0The Skeleton Warriors wearing the green colored leather armor didn't have any shields equipped. \u00a0Instead, both hands held various types of sword. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the finishing stroke to the group, two Skeleton Knights surrounded in Bone Armor stood in the front, and they looked like the eyes of a fire dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two instead of one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Each of the two Skeleton Knights raised swords that was overflowing with a sense of presence. \u00a0The two swords looked the same, but they differed in color. \u00a0One was pitch black, and the other was shining with light. This was the only difference between the two Skeleton Knights. \u00a0There was no difference that could be seen in what they intended to do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two Skeleton Knights opened their mouth, and they let out the world's most silent roar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddul-goo-ruhk, ddul-goo-ruhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying the roar, the first, second and third line moved in order after the Skeleton Knights.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ooh-uh-uh! Ooh-uh-uh!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the Zombies didn't retreat at the appearance of the Skeleton army. \u00a0When one became a Zombie, one lost all fear and rational thought. \u00a0They had no reasons to retreat. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddul-goo-ruhk, ddul-goo-ruhk! \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeletons also didn't know fear. \u00a0The two groups were immune to fear, and they displayed their attack capabilities to their hearts content.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They didn't know what retreat was, and even if they knew what it was, it wouldn't be allowed. \u00a0The two groups clashed against each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The line made contact with the other line. \u00a0It was a clash between the two front lines. \u00a0There was no defense here. \u00a0The two lines rammed into each other as they attempted an all-out attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The weapons swung by the Black Cobalt Zombies, and the morning stars swung by the Skeleton Warriors was aimed at each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their aim was the same, but the difference in result was stark.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hoo-oohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Black Cobalt Zombies swung their weapons in a wide arc, but their weapons only split empty air. \u00a0The Skeleton Warriors wearing thick plated armor was lightly dodging their attacks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bbi-uhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After they dodged the attacks, the Skeleton Warriors in the front line swung their morning stars towards the head of the Cobalt Zombies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All ten Skeleton Warriors had been able to dodge the attacks aimed at them, and they struck out. \u00a0At the same time, they burrowed into the group of zombies. They were basically the shock troops. \u00a0They ruthlessly destroyed the nearby heads of the zombies with their morning stars.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the second line of Skeleton Warriors followed in behind them. \u00a0These Skeleton Warriors wore Dragon Scale armor, and they swung their scimitars. \u00a0The headless body of the Cobalt Zombies were causing a problem, so they hacked at the body of the Cobalt Zombies. \u00a0The Cobalt Zombies that were causing the disturbance was either swinging at empty air or they occasionally banged their sword against the shields. In front of the scimitar\u2019s crescent-shaped line, the headless Cobalt Zombies lost their limbs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Cobalt Zombies were mutilated, it was the third line's job to put them down for good. \u00a0They held weapons in both hands, and they were much faster than a Skeleton with only one weapon. \u00a0Before the Cobalt Zombies could regenerate, they were diced up. \u00a0The Cobalt Zombies had lost their heads and limbs, so they didn't have any methods to resist against the Skeleton Warriors equipped with two weapons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a one sided battle! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the battle, there was a mutated monster that was sending forth the Black Cobalt Zombies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggoo-uh-uh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was twice as big as a normal Black Cobalt, and it appeared in front of the Cobalt Zombies. \u00a0It was over 3 meters tall. \u00a0It almost reached 4 meters in height, and the sword in the Cobalt Zombie's hand looked like a toy. \u00a0It was letting out a roar through its rotten vocal cords, but there was a gravitas and a powerful presence within its voice. \u00a0A horrifying dread was expressed through it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't a being that the Skeleton Warriors could contend with.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chul-kuhng, chul-huhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the Skeleton Knights stepped forward. \u00a0They were 2 meters tall, and their body was very large thanks to the armors. \u00a0Unlike the Skeleton Warriors, the Skeleton Knights appeared as they emitted a heavy sound.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, size and sound wasn't the only difference between the Skeleton Knights and the Skeleton Warriors. \u00a0The way they fought battle was also different. \u00a0The Skeleton Knights didn't back down from opponents that were much bigger than them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hoo-oong! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They dodged attacks....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ka-ahng! \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They blocked attacks, but they never stepped backwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shweeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The path of their sword swings were true. \u00a0It wasn't just sharp enough to cause a superficial wound. \u00a0It went beyond cutting flesh. \u00a0The sword showed decisiveness that held the intent of obliterating the enemy's bones.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The number of swings were low, but the result of each swing was terrifying. \u00a0The enormous mutated Cobalt Zombie's body was being cut away by the Skeleton Knight's sword. \u00a0It was as if the Skeleton Knights were cutting a rotten daikon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggoo-uh-uh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the normal Cobalt Zombies lasted longer than the mutated Cobalt Zombie.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The anticipated card didn't perform as expected. \u00a0In terms of a battle, this battle was already lost.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was no retreat for the Black Cobalt Zombies. \u00a0In fact, they charged towards their enemies. \u00a0The Cobalt Zombies were being ruthlessly cut down in the front line, and the Cobalt Zombies in the rear was now charging towards the front.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Naturally, the Black Cobalt Zombies started to get clumped up and tangled with each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the midst of this clusterfuck, an enormous flame that was burning ruthlessly coalesced to form a giant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the Fire Golem! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The burning giant didn't have to think about how to attack this group. \u00a0The Fire Golem belly flopped on top of the tangled Cobalt Zombie horde. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwahl hwahl! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Fire Golem's body started to burn the Cobalt Zombies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roo! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even as they were burning up, the Cobalt Zombies started using their swords against the Fire Golem. \u00a0Maybe this was the result of them being unable to feel pain. \u00a0Their bodies were burning, but the Fire Golem couldn't stop the sword strikes against it by the Cobalt Zombies. \u00a0The power behind the strikes remained the same as before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shweek, shweeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Parts of the Fire Golem's body was being cut away by the sword strikes. \u00a0The severed parts of the Fire Golem fell to the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The severed parts of the Fire Golem's body started to explode, and the fire became larger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Black Cobalt Zombies were trapped within the sea of flame, and the Skeleton Warriors continued with their slaughter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After a brief moment, the scene of the battle started to dim. \u00a0When the whole world turned black, white letters was placed over this dark world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[To be continued] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The footage ended there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Nice.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The video was on full screen, so it filled the entire screen of the Tablet PC. \u00a0He exited the full screen. \u00a0Then he checked various things.... \u00a0He looked at the information regarding the video, and he looked at the reaction given by the viewers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Two Skeleton Knights? \u00a0How?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I thought it was only possible to summon one Skeleton Knight?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Is it a bug?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyuhn grinned as he read their assessment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It's a Skill instead of a bug. \u00a0It's a Skill.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun released the new footage for free.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The video was titled Double Knights. It was the first video showing the activities of the two Skeleton Knights.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a mixture of the Hahoe Mask's fame, and the sensational description saying this was the first time this was being shown. \u00a0It resulted in the views skyrocketing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In one day, he achieved 8 million views! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the thing that made Ahn-jaehyun happier than the view counts was the reason behind the video. \u00a0It was the [Chivalry] Skill that had allowed him to make this video.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018As expected, this game gets fun at the latter stages.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he summoned the Skeleton Knight, two special abilities were activated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Knight's Stats increased proportionally to the number of Skeleton Warriors being summoned. \u00a0When the Skeleton Knights were summoned, the Leader ability increased the Stats of the Skeleton Warriors. \u00a0These were the two abilities.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, these two abilities had a fixed value. Even as the Skeleton Knight's Skill Proficiency increased, these two skill Options didn't change. \u00a0If one wanted to change the fixed nature of these two abilities, one had two obtain two other Skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The [Chivalry] Skill gained by Anh-jaehyun was basically like an upgrade software.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The newly acquired [Chivalry] Skill had the following effects.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Chivalry] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Proficiency : Rank F</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- You can summon one more Skeleton Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- With the summon of the Skeleton Knight, you will be able to summon additional (3) Skeleton underlings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Each additional summoned Skeleton Warrior will increase the Skeleton Knight's Stats by (6) percent. \u00a0At most, it can be increased by 30%. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It increased the number of Skeleton Knights he could summon. \u00a0The Chivalry Skill increased the special abilities, and on top of it all, it allowed one to summon additional Skeleton underlings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I also have to gain the [Leader] Skill, but at this current time, [Chivalry] is better than the [Leader]\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The [Leader] Skill was similar to the [Chivalry] Skill. \u00a0It also increased the number of Skeleton Knights one could summon, and it also increased the number of Skeleton underlings too.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I combine it with the [Chivalry] Skill...\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he could purchase the Death Knight Skill in the future, then he'll also have to gain the [Chivalric Order] Skill, which also had the effect of increasing the number of Skeleton Knights.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Rich Lich was able to summon four Skeleton Knights.\u2019 \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rich Lich used this process to be able to summon four Skeleton Knights. \u00a0He bought numerous No Name Skill boost to gain the [Chivalry] and [Leader] Skills. \u00a0Then he obtained the Death Knight Skills. \u00a0He had been able to summon a total of four Death Knights.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it didn't end there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I can use the Ancient Power to reinforce my Skills.... \u00a0How many Skeleton Knights will I be able to summon?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">With the appearance of the Ruined kingdom, the new contents would be released. \u00a0One will be able to use the Ancient Power to reinforce an A Rank Skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rich Lich hadn't reached this point. \u00a0He would truly be in uncharted territory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that part, Ahn-jaehyun let out a deep sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask could still get stronger. \u00a0This was something that made him feel happy and excited. \u00a0It was something he was looking forward to.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Urugal mountain range\u2026\u2026 I have to get over it, yet I have idea how I'll do it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, if he wanted that content, he had to cross the Urugal mountain range, and he had to discover the Ruined Kingdom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Ruined Kingdom had to appear for the third Main Scenario Quest to start. \u00a0Then the second Advancement contents will be released, and the Skill Reinforcement would included. \u00a0He had to reach level 300, not level 200 by that time. \u00a0If not, he won't be able to go through his 2nd Advancement, and it would be impossible for him to do the Skill Reinforcement. \u00a0Of course, he wouldn't be able to gain the Death Knight Skill either.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Anh-jaehyun wasn't confident that he would be able to cross the Urugal mountain range right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018In the end, I'm not sure I'll be able to do it even if I reach level 200.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if he reached level 200, he wasn't confident he'll be able to cross the Urugal mountain range even with the Arbiter of Corruption Ring and the Deposed Prince's Sword equipped.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, this didn't mean he was kosher with working with others. \u00a0Ahn-jaehyun had already suckerpunched the Red Bulls guild, who had been amicable towards him. \u00a0Hydra guild also didn't look too fondly on the Hahoe Mask. If he had to pick one, who might show goodwill towards him, it was the Stormhunters. \u00a0However, they weren't even a viable choice for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason why he could only sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Wait a sec.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun's expression changed once again. \u00a0While he was sighing, he suddenly remembered something that changed his expression. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Frozen Kingdom!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the event stage located across the Terube castle walls. \u00a0It was called the Frozen Kingdom. \u00a0It was an event stage made for level 200 Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Why the hell did I forget about the Frozen Kingdom?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To be precise, there were several event stages like the Frozen Kingdom that'll give clues as to the existence of the Ruined Kingdom. \u00a0One would be able to find out that the Ruined Kingdom was across the Urugual mountain range through these events.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From Ahn-jaehyun's perspective, he already had this information, so he had tried to skip couple steps in the process. \u00a0This was why he had forgotten about the Frozen Kingdom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He remembered what kind of place it was, and before he returned to the past, he remembered this stage had been set up for a certain person.... \u00a0He had forgotten about it for a brief time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I forgot something that is very important. \u00a0Of course, I can't leave out the Frozen Kingdom. \u00a0I have to gain all the benefits from it. \u00a0I must!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he thought about it again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun immediately turned his gaze towards his Tablet PC. \u00a0As a precaution, he planned on searching the web for the Frozen Kingdom. \u00a0When Ahn-jaehyun swiped at his Tablet PC, the page returned to the previous page. \u00a0The ranking of the videos appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Ahn-jaehyun's expression turned sour. \u00a0It was the Weekly Warlord Video Ranking, and his video was 2nd in terms of views. \u00a0This was the cause of his dour mood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018V&amp;V guild\u2026\u2026 They ain't playing around.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The V&amp;V guild's Blood Ogre Raid video had been uploaded around the same time as Ahn-jaehyun's video, and it had about twice as many views. \u00a0Moreover, the footage was worth the interest and praise it was getting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It basically means the newly added Users aren't normal Users.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even in Ahn-jaehyun's view, the Team Poker's strength was impressive. \u00a0This was especially true for the newly added members. \u00a0Their skills approached the skills of the Matador and the Storm Queen. \u00a0Basically, they were almost on a similar level as the Warlord's best Strikers. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this simple fact wouldn't have struck Anh-jaehyun's nerve. \u00a0The part that struck his nerve was the fact that the face of a User he already knew wasn't part of the new faces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Why isn't the one that tried to kill me amongst them? \u00a0Wasn't he a guild member of the V&amp;V guild? \u00a0Didn't he have the V&amp;V guild mark on at that time?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This fact kept bothering Ahn-jaehyun.</span></p><br/><p>9.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The change that happened in the V&amp;V guild was extreme, and the result of this change was also extraordinary. \u00a0Until now, the V&amp;V guild had been considered to be the middle of the pack within the 30 great guilds. \u00a0However, the value of V&amp;V guild's name shot up in an instant from the release of a single Blood Ogre Raid video. \u00a0They were starting to be judged in the same breath as the Big 3.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This fact had a big impact on the other 30 great guilds. \u00a0They were already beyond the point where the 30 great guilds could choose to go through a change. \u00a0They were starting to be forced to change.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, not many guilds tried to go for an aggressive transformation. \u00a0If one tried to force a changed like the V&amp;V guild, the guild would suffer bone grinding pain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, even if one looked into an organization going through such a pain, there was inevitably a different degree of pain being felt by the Users. \u00a0Moreover, no one wanted \u00a0to be the one to suffer the worst of the pain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Smiles guild repeatedly held officer\u2019s meetings, but in the process, they weren\u2019t able to come up with a clear plan of action. \u00a0This was the big reason why they couldn\u2019t come to a consensus.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018They are really looking at me as if I\u2019m some pushover!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The one, who felt the most pressure, in such a situation, was Apollo. \u00a0He was a newly minted officer. \u00a0If one took away his background, he was useless. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been implied that Apollo would be forced to make sacrifices.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018How dare they treat me like this? \u00a0Someday I'll take over the Big Smiles guild....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From Apollo\u2019s perspective, he couldn\u2019t help, but feel depressed at the recent developments. \u00a0At the very least, he hadn\u2019t paid exorbitant amount of money to be treated like this as an officer of the Big Smiles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, someone called Apollo. \u00a0When he checked who was calling, Apollo immediately answered the phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo was someone, who only thought highly of himself, yet he called someone 'hyung-nim'?

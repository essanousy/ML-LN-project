</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anugas' steps sounded heavy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-bah-baht! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's steps sounded swift.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two types of sound converged, and the two sounds intersected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hoo-oohng!

</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After exchanging blows, the two of them basically backtracked the path each other took. \u00a0Hyrkan stopped his footsteps as he turned his body. \u00a0Anugas' enormous body also came to a stop, and it turned its head. \u00a0Anugas and Hyrkan glared at each other. \u00a0Hyrkan looked at the wound he made on Anugas' thigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It is as I had predicted.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan once again got into the same stance as before. \u00a0He got ready to run towards Anugas.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It has 3 Phases. \u00a0The estimated Raid completion time is 44 minutes 33 seconds. \u00a0I'll be doing the same thing over and over again. \u00a0A thousand strikes should be enough.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he finished his preparation, Hyrkan ran towards Anugas again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He started a battle that wouldn't allow a single mistake.</span></p><br/><p>12.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Black Continent allowed the Users to enjoy a bountiful harvest of monsters. \u00a0The number of Users crossing over into the Black Continent was steadily increasing. \u00a0The Game System adjusted the amount of monsters spawned to match the number of Users. \u00a0However, these Users weren't killing the monsters that were being produced. \u00a0Now there was an excessive supply of monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While this was going on, the Heard Fortress Quest was activated, and it inevitably meant that the roads heading towards the Heard Fortress would have a higher number of monsters there. \u00a0Moreover, the monster regen time would be significantly decreased.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn't end there. \u00a0The Five Stars had placed many Users near the Heard Fortress to keep a constant watch, but the Warlord's System thought they were there to hunt. \u00a0The System acted accordingly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were at the precipice of being flooded. \u00a0The surface tension of the water was keeping the water from overflowing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it wasn't wise to put in 1,000 Users into such a stage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a totally different situation from the great battle. \u00a0In the great battle, the monsters were in Siege mode, and they had exposed many of their weak spots. \u00a0If the monsters hadn't opened themselves for attack, the difficulty of the great battle would have been unimaginably harder. \u00a0Moreover, the monsters in the Black Continent wasn't weak like the ones in the great battle. \u00a0The monsters here were all over level 200, and there were a new breed of monster amongst them. \u00a0The Illusion type monsters were present.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason why the Five Stars were moving their forces slowly as they planned on positioning themselves to be able to bombard the Heard Fortress. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They methodically killed the monsters as they moved with their safety in mind. \u00a0The Strikers went forward in advance to find and lure out the monsters. \u00a0Then the Tankers controlled the aggro as the Magicians and Strikers took down the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- This is like trying to find mines.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Poker team's Diamond Unit was in charge of bombarding the ruins of the Heard Fortress. \u00a0The commander of the Diamond Unit gave a short summary of what they were doing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Exactly right.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- There is no downside in being careful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At his words, people started to speak in the Voice Talk channel, which was labeled as the Hand's guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The most dangerous situation will be when the Hahoe Mask runs away with Anugas in tow like before. \u00a0At that point, we have to retreat no matter what. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Right. \u00a0Everyone has to take those words to heart. \u00a0We have to avoid any losses.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Still, we have to catch him this time. \u00a0We can't always let the Hahoe Mask have it his way. \u00a0Even the people above us are making a fuss about catching that bastard. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Those kinds of thoughts are dangerous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Anyways, I feel more motivated to play the game recently. \u00a0Everyone recognizes my face no matter where I go.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- We'll be on a program soon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Where? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- BBC. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They warned each other, and they shared honest advices. Then there were the occasional snippets regarding their personal lives.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it took only a moment for their conversation to turn into nervousness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The monsters are coming!</span></p><br/><p>13.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch saw the Users, who easily dispatched several dozen monsters. \u00a0The monsters were easily over level 200.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tsk tsk tsk tsk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch clicked his tongue as if he was playing playing an instrument.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018In the end, we got the short end of the deal.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir had accepted the Hahoe Mask's proposal. \u00a0For the price of accepting the proposal, the Stormhunters had to block the advance of the Five Stars, who were planning on interfering with Hyrkan from carrying out the Anugas Raid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From Hatch's perspective, this was a bad deal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Why can't she direct some of her affections towards me instead of the Hahoe Mask? \u00a0Even a little affection would shave my contract period to 2045. \u00a0If not, they should just date each other. \u00a0They aren't even dating, yet why do we have to get the short end of the stick in regards to a deal with the Hahoe Mask?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hatch didn't express his complaints in front of Shir.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he didn't plan on doing shoddy work, because he thought this was a loser of a deal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018In the end, doesn't the people low on the totem pole have to make up for the difference?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch raised his clenched fist into the air, and an enormous Ice Spear appeared above his fist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch aimed his Ice Spear towards the chaotic battlefield. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ballista. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was known as the most accurate Magician in Warlord. \u00a0He closed one eye as he became a sniper. \u00a0He aimed his magic towards the cluster of Magicians. \u00a0After he weighed the distance, Hatch stopped breathing, and he threw the magic as he exhaled. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shweeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Ice Spear flew in a big arc.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pha-bah-bahk! \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While it was flying through the air, it fragmented into several hundred ice shards. \u00a0The ice shards were about the size of an arrow, and it fell on the clustered Magicians like hail.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blizzard Shooting Star! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a level 190 Unique Rank magic, and it was currently the strongest Ice type magical spell in Warlord. \u00a0It was terrifying and awesome. \u00a0The magicians, who admired this magic, were pierced ruthlessly by it. \u00a0Their body was frozen in an instant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch clicked his tongue as he watched his handiwork.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If only my contract period would end, I could.....\u2019</span></p><br/><p>14.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monsters were attacking the Heard Fortress' Bombardment team. \u00a0The ace team moved forward to quell the disturbance. \u00a0There were only 10 Users in the ace team, and it was hard for them to face the monsters on the move. \u00a0The monsters were powerful and difficult to face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe rest of you retreat!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLeave this to the Diamond unit!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Diamond unit was in charge of carrying out the most difficult task.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their involvement was an inevitability.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before Anugas made its appearance on the Black Continent, the hardest monster one had to kill was the Black Blood Troll. \u00a0Of course, the Diamond unit was needed to take take down these monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- It's a magical attack!

\u00a0Let's just crush them!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how the battle that would change the future of Warlord started.</span></p><br/><p>15.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one considered the Users in the upper tier of fighting capability, they could maintain their full concentration for about 15 minutes. \u00a0Afterwards, it didn't matter how, but one's power of concentration flagged.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why it was important for one's concentration to drop in a gradual manner. \u00a0This allowed the User to be able to adjust to the speed of the decreasing power of concentration. \u00a0It was a matter of how well the User was able to fight as this adjustment continued.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">With that in mind, Hyrkan's effort was worthy of an applause. \u00a0He had been in this battle for 39 minutes, which required his full concentration, and he hadn't allowed Anugas to get in a direct hit against him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh, hoo-ooh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt as if his head was about to burst open. \u00a0His breathing was rough. \u00a0If this was a World Title matchup in Las Vegas, the crowd would be on their feet clapping even though the match hadn't ended yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unfortunately, Hyrkan didn't have an audience that would clap and cheer him on. \u00a0Hyrkan's eyes could only see the one-eyed, four-armed giant with wounds all over its body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018As expected of the Stormhunters, they are very skilled.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was very satisfied by this fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Not a single person had bothered him. \u00a0This meant the Stormhunters did a really awesome job at blocking the disrupters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, at that moment, Hyrkan didn't feel thankful towards the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead, he was filled with hatred for the Stormhunters guild, which had allowed him to reach this point. \u00a0His hatred allowed him to maintain his sharp concentration.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There is no way I'll give this to them.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Hyrkan died by Anugas' hands, Anugas would be gobbled up by the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was on the verge of catching this fish. \u00a0Hyrkan wouldn't allow himself to give away this fish to the Stormhunters guild. \u00a0It was unacceptable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't care if he was being selfish, stupid and petty. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan hadn't reached this point in this game by being rational and reasonable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'll never give this up.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His hatred and his aversion to giving this monster away to the Stormhunters guild allowed Hyrkan to move.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had made his resolve, and he didn't shy away from looking into Anugas' eye, which had turned red.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-uh-uh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anugas didn't spare his wrath as it directed it towards Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Its enormous muscular body was filled with wounds. \u00a0It was as if it wore clothes made out of wounds. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The wounds weren't shallow. \u00a0They were very deep. \u00a0If the wounds were slightly deeper, it might be possible to sever parts of its body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was like the process of making a stalactite as the attacks accumulated one by one. \u00a0Hyrkan was like Don Quixote of La Mancha charging against a windmill. \u00a0He kept running at the monster at full force. \u00a0It was an act that others would consider to be crazy. \u00a0He repeated it several hundred times to create these wounds. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, the wounds were a count of how many time Hyrkan had knocked on a indomitable steel door.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shouldn\u2019t it be time for it to change? \u00a0It should be about the time when the 3rd Phase should start.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anugas had a total of 3 Phases. \u00a0The Phases could be identified by the color of its gem-like eye.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the beginning, it glowed blue. \u00a0After receiving significant damage, the eye turned red. \u00a0In the last phase, all color drained out, and the eye looked like a diamond.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One had to go through these 3 Phases, and when all three signs appeared, Anugas' real body was revealed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It'll be in a state where it could be killed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This setting was put in place so Anugas couldn't be killed by Users through magical bombardment from afar. \u00a0This meant the magical bombardment could cause damage that exceeded the HP needed to get past the 2nd Phase, yet the setting wouldn't allow it to move onto the next Phase. \u00a0It was a very troublesome setting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For a User like Hyrkan, who used unconventional methods that the Warlord System couldn't predict, the change of color in Anugas' eye was merely akin to a traffic light.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Anugas is taking form.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Anugas' eye is shining.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Anugas' influence has expanded.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It's here!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the traffic light called Anugas\u2019 eye changed color, Hyrkan flicked his fingers as if he had been waiting for this exact moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After couple seconds, 50 Skeleton Warriors and 3 Skeleton Knights came charging towards the horrible battlefield as they were led by the Death Knight. \u00a0Hyrkan caught sight of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan gritted his teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to go all in.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the last gambit prepared by Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had summoned the Skeleton army before the battle started. \u00a0Of course, he had emptied his magical energy, and he had used expensive magical recovery Items to activate the Power of Frost. \u00a0He had summoned Bone Armor on all of them, and he even put several curses on each of their weapons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It took him 30 minutes to accomplish all of this. \u00a0When he finished his work, he had switched the Skeleton army into defensive mode.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were prepared for this moment! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I can't end it here, I'm dead.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Army appeared as they let out white misty breaths. \u00a0They charged towards Anugas.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-uh! \u00a0Kooh-uh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anugas used its four arms to stave off the Skeleton army. \u00a0One arm was used to fling Skeletons away, and the second arm was used to punch. \u00a0The remaining two arms grabbed a Skeleton by each hand, and the Skeletons were rammed against each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sound of steel deforming was heard as the armors rammed against each other. \u00a0In a flash, the bones of Skeleton Warriors were crushed. \u00a0The battlefield turned into a pandemonium in short order.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the Skeleton Warriors weren't able to recover for their injuries. \u00a0Hyrkan didn't have any magical energy. \u00a0He had a Death Knight, but the Undying skill couldn't be activated without Hyrkan's magical energy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why the Skeleton Warriors were fighting with injuries. \u00a0If a shoulder was blown off, the Skeleton fought with one arm. \u00a0If its legs were damaged, the Skeleton crawled across the ground to harass Anugas.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There had been a dignity that came with the Skeleton army from the fact that one couldn't kill them even if one tried. \u00a0However, that was missing now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, the battle being fought at that moment by the Skeleton army was intense and brilliant compared to any other battles they had participated in. \u00a0The Skeleton army was showing desperation in this fight. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kill or be killed. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a sight that could only be seen if there were only two choices the Skeletons could make.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Above all else, the most desperate combatant on the battlefield was Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to finish this within 5 minutes.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was going all in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Warriors couldn't be healed, so they were basically one-off combatants.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he couldn't use his Bone Explosive in a pinch. \u00a0He couldn't stylishly turn the tide of battle with it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everything Hyrkan could put forward was out right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If everything here fell, Hyrkan would fall alongside them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he was desperate, and his desperation made him look bold.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was always like this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan didn't back away in despair when faced with danger. \u00a0Instead, he rammed forward straight into the danger and despair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Warriors were occupying Anugas. \u00a0The four arms were all engaged in fighting the Skeleton Warriors, so Hyrkan was able to climb Anugas' back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if to respond to their master, the Skeleton Knights and Death Knight moved urgently towards Anugas. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the Death Knight was able to accomplish the most in this battle. \u00a0Even without its master's magical energy, the Death Knight didn't budge an inch against Anugas.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was wearing the Dark Spot set, and it attacked with the Deposed Prince's Sword. \u00a0At times, it actually made Anguas take steps backwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Knights also performed remarkably. \u00a0While the Death Knight pushed Anugas, they came in from both sides. \u00a0They stabbed into the wounds that had been made by Hyrkan's constant attack. \u00a0The three Skeleton Knights moved like a saw-toothed wheel against Anugas.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Warriors basically threw their bodies against Anugas. \u00a0Their role was to make sure no one else would be caught by Anugas' hands. \u00a0Then there were the Skeleton Warriors, who had crawled towards Anugas. \u00a0They stabbed at Anugas' ankle, and it slowly ate away at Anugas' health. \u00a0In certain instances, the Skeleton Warriors shone more than the Death Knight, since they didn't spare themselves in their attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the most important part was the fact that white Frost was forming on Anugas from their constant attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Power of Frost! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then there was the fact that all the weapons of the Skeleton army was cursed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lethargy, Corrosion, Slow... \u00a0Hyrkan's Curse Skills were very high in rank. \u00a0It couldn't affect Anugas for a long period of time, but that didn't matter. \u00a0If one ended, the second Curse took hold. \u00a0If the second Curse ended, a third was applied. \u00a0The Curses bedeviled Anugas.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-uh-uh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anugas was letting out a continuous bellow now. \u00a0It was a sound that was only filled with rage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was when Hyrkan started climbing Anugas' back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Its body was like a cliff. \u00a0Hyrkan used the open wounds as handholds to climb to its shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Let's end this.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This action would be considered to be crazy by all. \u00a0If Anugas used one of its arm to peel off Hyrkan, he was dead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even with this risk present, Hyrkan chose to get closer to Anugas. \u00a0He was basically clinging onto Anugas.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, before the Skeleton army's sacrifices could come to an end, he had to produce a clear result. \u00a0He couldn't just stand back. \u00a0He wasn't dumb enough to think that his Skeleton army could finish this on their own.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In short order, Hyrkan had climbed near the shoulder of Anugas.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hweeeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anugas, who was in a heated fight with the Death Knight, turned to looked at its shoulder where Hyrkan was perched.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-uh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anugas let out a roar of anger, and for the first time, Hyrkan let out a bright smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying the smile, Hyrkan stabbed his sword towards the clear diamond-like eye.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Keeeeng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This brief sound adorned this single scene! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the scene Hyrkan had always wished for.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

This was what had happened right now. \u00a0A monster eventually had gotten past the efforts of the Skeleton Warriors. \u00a0A monster with frozen arms was attacking Hyrkan. \u00a0It had its arm, which was as sharp as a sword, up in the air as it approached Hyrkan. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As this was happening, Hyrkan had to aim and hit his target. \u00a0It wasn't an easy task.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It shouldn't have been easy....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shoong! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan did it too easily. \u00a0He did it effortlessly. \u00a0The Cursed slave, which had bypassed the Skeleton Warriors, had almost reached him, yet Hyrkan had accomplished his task. \u00a0He had true in his aim as he hurled the javelin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shweeeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The spear didn't fly in an arc. \u00a0It traveled in a straight line.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time as he threw his spear, he took a step forward as if he had intended to do it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He shortened the distance with the Frozen Orc that was rushing him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The gap had closed much quicker by him, and the Frozen Orc didn't hesitate to swing its arm towards Hyrkan's head. \u00a0Hyrkan easily dodged the attack by lowering his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he lightly stuck out his foot to trip the Frozen Orc.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-oohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Frozen Orc fell forward, and it didn't even have the chance to turn its body around to look up at the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Choo-roong! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Crying Sword had severed its head with a single strike. \u00a0The severed head rolled away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bbuh-uhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan kicked the head as if he was playing soccer. \u00a0Then he looked at the Skeleton Warriors with cold eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was this all the Skeleton Warriors could do?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the message he conveyed in his gaze. \u00a0Of course, the look shouldn't have worked on the Skeleton Warriors, but one could see the Skeleton Warriors start to shift towards being more aggressive in their attack. \u00a0Hyrkan tried to hold back a laughter when he saw this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koohng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Until now, the Frost Knight had looked over the battlefield in a detached manner. \u00a0No, he had looked down at it with a haughty attitude. \u00a0Without unsheathing the enormous sword, the Frost Knight hit the ground with its sheathe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Including the Bone Spear Hyrkan had just thrown, there were 7 total spears stuck in the Frost Knight's body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was embedded in its armor. \u00a0It seemed the Frost Knight hadn't felt the need to move. \u00a0It didn't pay an ounce of attention to them as the Bone Spears stuck in its body. \u00a0It was treating the Bone Spears as if they were decorations for its armor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Frost Knight hit the ground ground again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sheathed sword hit the ground consecutively.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Boo-doo-doohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Bone Spears stuck on its body froze, and it crumbled away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ground rang out for the third time. \u00a0A crack formed on the sheath.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A crack shaped like a lightning formed on the sword sheathe, and the crack started to thicken.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ground rang out for the fourth time, and it was the last time it rang out. One could see through the crack of the sheath, and a thick fog started seeping out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The first to react to the fog was the Cursed slaves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Boo-roo-roo! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had been fighting, but they unconsciously started to shake. \u00a0In such a tight battle, it was basically suicide to tremble like this! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Warriors didn't miss the opening created by the shaking enemies. \u00a0The Skeleton Warriors didn't even need to think about their actions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only one that had to think was a single User.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It's coming.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan clenched his fist as if he had expected this. \u00a0Clear droplets of liquid fell through his clench fist. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Clay Play! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it happened before Hyrkan could complete his summoning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-hwaht! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Frost Knight's sheath broke into pieces, and the extreme cold that was sleeping within it for all these years exploded forth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Frost Fog is spreading quickly.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hweeeeee! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Frost Fog was so powerful that a System Warning was given. \u00a0The Frost Fog ate up the battlefield in an instant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everything was frozen as all stood still. \u00a0All kinds of sounds had been emitted from the fierce battle a moment ago, but the fierce scene of battle was frozen in place. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The unfathomable silence replaced the fierceness of battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if one\u2019s goose bumps had frozen by this sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The first one to disturb this scene was Hyrkan. \u00a0Hyrkan had frozen in place with his fist clenched.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Boo-doohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He started thawing, and the ice started to crumble away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When his fist appeared, it was like a domino effect. \u00a0The ice around Hyrkan's body started to break away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the ice had all shattered away, Hyrkan opened his fist. \u00a0A Phoenix appeared out of Hyrkan's hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To be precise, it was a level 170 Boss Monster called the Big Bird.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had a massive body, yet the bird boasted even bigger wings. \u00a0It had the power to send enemies flying with its terrifying wingbeats. \u00a0It was the most difficult Boss Monster in the same rank category!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Big Bird appeared with a body that was burning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As soon as it appeared, it started flapping its wings. \u00a0Accompanying its wingbeats, a wind of flame overtook the frozen battlefield. \u00a0It melted the frozen time, and the battle started up again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan, who hadn't done anything up until now, started to run.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The 2nd Phase has started.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the second problem posed by the Frost Knight. \u00a0He pierced through the Frost Fog.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the early runs in the past, numerous Users were unable to do anything against this attack. \u00a0They suffered the attack with their eyes open. \u00a0While the Users were frozen, they suffered blows from the Frost Knight's sword. \u00a0He had just broken through the calamity faced by those Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The solving of this problem was good news. \u00a0However, at the same time, it meant he would be posed with a new problem from the Frost Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to do this immediately.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Finally, Hyrkan summoned the two Skeleton Knights for the first time in this battle. \u00a0When the Skeleton Knights appeared, the tide of the battle changed 180 degrees. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Special Ability 'Chivalry' has activated.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Special Ability 'Commander' has activated.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The tide of the battle turned overwhelmingly in favor of the Skeleton Warriors when the Skeleton Knights appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of it all, the appearance of Big Bird Fire Golem had decreased the defense of the Cursed slaves. \u00a0Since the Skeleton Warriors had gotten stronger compared to a moment ago, the Cursed slaves were helpless.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the Skeleton Knights started to attack in a frenzied manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One of the Skeleton Knights was equipped with the Great Battle Hero's Sword. \u00a0This particular Skeleton Knight was the definition of being overpowered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puh-uhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the sword came down on the hardened skin of the Cursed slave, it didn't let out a sharp sound. \u00a0It let out out a dull sound as the Cursed slave was broken into pieces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Critical blow! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a more frightening sight then the enemies being sliced open.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Knights were making a path. \u00a0When one Knight seemed to be slowing down, the Skeleton Knight with the Great Battle Hero's Sword took over to quickly clear the path. \u00a0They were making a path towards the Frost Knight, and at the end of the road, the Frost Knight was standing there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Frost Knight was almost 4 meters tall. \u00a0The Skeleton Knights were almost 3 meters tall. \u00a0They stood facing each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, white bone started to encase the Skeleton Knight's body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bone Armor! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Just last 1 minute.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan activated more power, so the Skeleton Knights could face off against the enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He summoned their horns. \u00a0He didn't forget to activate the Madness Helm. \u00a0The Skeleton Knights were encased in Bone Armor, and the tell-tale sign of the Madness Helm appeared as a horn on their skulls. \u00a0The Skeleton Knights opened their mouths wide as they displayed their ferocious nature. \u00a0They raised their swords at the same time to attack the Frost Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the Frost Knight swung its sword to block the attacks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a collision between swords.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggoo-roong! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It should have sounded like steel clashing, but it came out as loud thunderclaps.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Each attack had a huge effect on the participants. \u00a0It was as if there were springs attached to the swords. \u00a0Every sword swung by either the Skeleton Knights or the Frost Knight was bounced backward after the impact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why the battle was slow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggwah-roong! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After a single clash, one had to resist using one's strength. \u00a0Then one had to attack after resetting one\u2019s stance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggwah-roong! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They once again attacked each other in terms of strength. \u00a0Each strike made one take a deep breath twice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how powerful these strikes were. \u00a0They were exchanging blows that had all their strengths behind it. \u00a0It was hair-raising to approach this melee! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ok!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a hair-raising display where one would be remiss to even stick one's hand in there. \u00a0However, someone dared to push his body into the fray.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had already moved behind the Frost Knight, and he sprung towards the Frost Knight's back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's sword pierced the exact center of Frost Knight's back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Choo-roo-roo! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the Crying Sword let out a sad cry. \u00a0It was as if it was lamenting that fact that it had met a crazy owner. \u00a0It sounded as it was grumbling. \u00a0However, Hyrkan ignored the grumbles as he worked against the Frost Knight's movements. \u00a0He made a scar on the back plate of the Frost Knight's armor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he immediately put a Bone Spear through the scar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Knights and the Frost Knight had exchanged 7 strikes up to this point. \u00a0The Frost Knight's sword had already crushed the Skeleton Knight's Bone Armor, and it had even dented the armor underneath it. \u00a0After the 1 minute Hyrkan had wanted passed, the Frost Knight looked like a hedgehog.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The surprising part was the fact that the Frost Knight didn't pay any attention to Hyrkan during his work.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a loophole.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Frost Knight didn't register any attacks on its armor unless it exceeded a certain threshold of damage. \u00a0This was the loophole.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had an innate arrogance and it was a near immortal. \u00a0It died without knowing the pain of death, and this loophole was developed through these confluence of characteristics.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a loophole found through the sacrifice of over 10 Stormhunters guild members.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After finishing his attack using the loophole, he looked at his Skeleton Knights.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Bone Armor hadn't held up. \u00a0Moreover, the damage to the Skeleton Knight's defensive gears were quite significant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the Skeleton Knights still showed the willingness to fight on. \u00a0They showed Hyrkan that they could go on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Thank you.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Knights had performed well above expectation, so he thanked the bedraggled Skeleton Knights.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He put his thanks into motion. \u00a0Hyrkan used the Bone Spears as handholds, and he started performing a job only he could do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a job that couldn't be done by the Skeleton Warriors, Skeleton Knights and the Golem. \u00a0He started the Armor Breaking, which was a job that could only be done by Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Choo-roong! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This time the Crying Sword let out a cry of joy. \u00a0The Crying Sword was the best at taking off enemy's tough scales, leather or carapace. \u00a0It was something the sword enjoyed doing!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Crying Sword started to dismantle the Frost Knight's armor in a short amount of time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the result of giving a master calligrapher the best possible brush to use.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As its owner did its job, the Skeleton Knights continued to fight hard until the end. \u00a0At the two minute mark, a Skeleton Knight had lost its left arm. \u00a0When the battle reached the 3 minute mark, they were in terrible shape. \u00a0\u00a0The demise of the Skeleton Knights looked inevitable. \u00a0In the end, the Skeleton Knights had lasted three times longer than Hyrkan had expected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hyrkan was also working well above expectation as if to reward the earlier efforts of the Skeleton Knights. \u00a0The Frost Knight's anger started to flow out of the cracked armor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The cold energy that can never be broken is flowing over you.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[All Stats will be decreased.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You will suffer from terrifying frostbites.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This freezing air pretty much repelled anyone close to the Frost Knight. \u00a0Even the Ifrit's Essence wouldn't let one resist against this cold air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, one couldn't resist against the cold air using will power or stubbornness. \u00a0If one unwisely choose to resist against it, the User would inevitably be frozen to death by the cold air!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had experienced this for the first time, but he was fully aware of the effect of this attack. \u00a0Therefore, he put distance with the cold air. \u00a0However, the Skeleton Knights froze over as they could evade it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan couldn\u2019t continue watching his noble Skeleton Knights.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-oohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Hyrkan distanced himself, the Frost Knight erected an enormous ice wall. \u00a0This wall completely cut off the Frost Knight from the battlefield. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was different from the ice walls he had seen several times before. \u00a0This wall looked to have been carved. \u00a0There were shaped carved into the wall. \u00a0It was as if various monsters, elves, dwarves and humans were trying to escape hell. \u00a0This image was willing up the wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Wall of Agony has appeared.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Frost Knight's power is recovering across the Wall of Agony.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Third Phase.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the third problem that was posed to him. \u00a0It was the appearance of the Wall of Agony.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wall boasted an incredible amount of defense. \u00a0On top of it all, the wall had a special property that it didn't accumulate damage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One had to break through it using a single blow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he looked at this door, Hyrkan took out a card he had prepared. He took out a single gem, and he gripped it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddoohk ddoohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The gem that had melted in Hyrkan's hand dripped to the frozen ground, and a Golem was awakened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Earth Golem appeared in the shape of an enormous rhinoceros.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was 5 meters long! \u00a0The frightening part was the incredibly large horn that was as big as its body. \u00a0The enormous horn was a weapon that was used to crush castle gates. It reminded one of a battering ram.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cast Iron Rhinoceros! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a level 180 Boss Monster. \u00a0It possessed a variety of nicknames. \u00a0It was called the Slaughterer of Tankers. \u00a0The Tankers hated this monster the most. The second nickname\u2026\u2026 The most popular amongst the nickname was Tankerbell! \u00a0It rang the Tankers like a bell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a Boss Monster that gave out expensive Items. \u00a0In terms of worth, it was within the top 10. \u00a0Of course, the ingredients that came out from this monster was used to make Rare and Epic Items. \u00a0At the very least, these ingredients were sold for 5000 gold.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was well worth the money considering the attack it would perform.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGo!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As soon as Hyrkan's yell ended, the Cast Iron Rhinoceros charged towards the Wall of Agony.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koong, kwahng, koong, kwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ground shook as it ran.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koong koong koong! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It accelerated in a flash.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Cast Iron Rhinoceros was running at incredible speeds. \u00a0Its large body looked ungainly, but it was flying across the ground as swift as a swallow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the Cast Iron Rhinoceros' horn collided with the Wall of Agony.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggwahhhhhhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All the sound up until this point couldn't compare to this sound. \u00a0It swept across the battlefield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For a brief moment, Hyrkan was tense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Break through.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was most unsure of this part of the plan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Stormhunters guild had shown the level of attack one needed against the Wall of Agony.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That level\u2026\u2026 It had to be a level 190 or above Magician or Striker. \u00a0One needed to be equipped with Epic Items, and one also needed a full set of Buffs. \u00a0On top of it all, one had to use a level 180 or above skill with burst damage!

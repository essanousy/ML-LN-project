No one elaborated any further. \u00a0It was as if they had come to an agreement beforehand. \u00a0Instead of carrying on the conversation, the members of the party kept eyeing a particular User intermittently as they spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The members with the Hahoe Mask's team observed how the Noopy Family acted. \u00a0They had a rough idea on what was going on, so they started eyeing the User too.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Who is he?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Those Items look extraordinary. \u00a0What kind of Items are those?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan didn't cast side-glances at the User. \u00a0He outright stared at the User.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If it's the Greenstone Imoogi set... The level 150 Evil Eye would have been child's play.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan knew about the worth and Option of the other User's Items. \u00a0Hyrkan immediately pieced together what had happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">With the Greenstone Imoogi set's effect, Evil Eye wouldn't even be strong as a level 150 mid-boss monster. \u00a0It would be like an average level 130 boss monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the Users gathered here all had serious fire power. \u00a0If they received such a boon, Hyrkan could see how they had killed the Evil Eye faster than his team.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would have been hilarious and sad if they had been slower than his team.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I can equip my Skeleton with one of those....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan coveted the Greenstone Imoogi Set.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Greenstone Imoogi set's special characteristic was its curse, which activated when a critical hit happened. \u00a0This would be perfect for a Skeleton Warrior. He could create a Skeleton using low level monster's bones as ingredients. Then he could equip this set on the Skeleton and use it to specifically cast Curses. It would be very effective. \u00a0It was no wonder why Hyrkan coveted it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, his thoughts regarding the Item ended there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was curious as to who his opponent was. \u00a0He had lost the incredibly valuable Sarabo's Sword, because of him. \u00a0It made his stomach hurt so much that he felt like dying. \u00a0He was also dying to have the Greenstone Imoogi set, yet Hyrkan couldn't do anything about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't possible, so that's that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, this was the first time Hyrkan had met this User, but it wasn't as if the User was friendly towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If that man was really interested in Hyrkan, he would have approached Hyrkan as a helper. \u00a0Instead, he had decided to go to Hyrkan's competitor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018That bastard came here to fuck me over.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan saw through to the core issue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If that User wearing the Greenstone Imoogi set wanted to talk, trade or negotiate with Hyrkan, he would have come to Hyrkan first.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the User had done the opposite. \u00a0It was obvious to everyone that he had secretly aligned against Hyrkan. \u00a0He had basically fucked over Hyrkan, and it meant he had no plans on striking up a friendly relationship with Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Since the Quest is done, I have no reason to stick around here.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The right thing to do was to leave this stage before unnecessary conflict started.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if it had read Hyrkan's inner thoughts, Sarabo appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll of you are marvelous. \u00a0Good job.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The distribution of the reward for the Quest started. \u00a0Sarabo's Sword was given to the Noopy Family.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease show us its Option!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow. \u00a0Is it a rare? \u00a0Or is it a Unique?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat's the level restriction?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Users became unsettled. The members of the Noopy Family smiled as they acquired the Item. An amicable yet disordered atmosphere formed inside the Cursed Castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan wasn't part of this atmosphere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the Greenstone Imoogi swordsman Sinclair was gone too.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After leaving the Cursed Castle, Hyrkan ran at full speed. \u00a0However, his tail closed the distance quickly. \u00a0A tail had attached himself right after he had left the castle. \u00a0Hyrkan couldn't shake his tail no matter what. \u00a0The distance between them kept shrinking. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were at the center of a forest. \u00a0The blue fog had receded a little bit, and the person Hyrkan expected appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the User, who had been wearing the Green Imoogi set.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What the hell?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2026\u2026or not. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Bat Marauder set?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an armor made out of reddish black leather. The User was wearing a helmet that made him look like Batman.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Amongst the level 100s sets, those Items have the greatest speed Option....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bat Marauder set.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It's official name was the Giant Blood Bat set. The Giant Blood Bat was a level 140 rare monster. \u00a0One had to catch the Giant Blood Bat to be able to make this set, and it had numerous Options regarding to movement speed. \u00a0Basically, it was an upgraded version of the Shadow Hunting Dog set he had worn before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the price and the options wasn't even comparable to the Shadow Hunting Dog set. If the Shadow Hunting Dog set was a Sonata, the Giant Blood Bat set was a Ferrari.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the design was similar to Batman's suit, so its nickname was the Bat Marauder set. \u00a0Basically, it was the Batman set.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He has the Greenstone Imoogi and the Bat Maurauder set. \u00a0The last remaining slot is probably filled with something of similar rank\u2026\u2026.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A Warlord User could fill a total of three slots. This User's two slots were filled with incredible Items, so the last slot was probably filled with something similar. \u00a0At the very least, he probably filled it with a level 140 Unique Item set.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Tsk.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan had come to a decision. \u00a0He opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you have some kind of business with me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you the Hahoe Mask?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf I said no, will you believe me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, his opponent manipulated his wrist watch. \u00a0He had changed his Item Slot. Sinclair had activated his third Item Slot. The look he unveiled was an armor made out of black steel. It looked very sleek, and the helm had the shape of a wolf. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He even had the Black Steel Wolf set.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Black Steel Wolf Set.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Amongst the countless number of Set Items in existence, this was one of the top 10 Items in existence right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was especially famous for its high defense. Amongst the highest level Items, it was famous for its surest defense. It wasn't an exaggeration to say almost no weapon held an advantage over the Black Steel Wolf set.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have no personal enmity towards you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan didn't mince words when his opponent spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0I, the Hahoe Mask, doesn't shy away from fights that come my way.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair had come to catch Hyrkan, so he smiled at Hyrkan's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He is unexpectedly prideful. \u00a0The probability of him running away isn't high.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Catch Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the order given by the organization Sinclair was part of. Moreover, there was also a bounty on his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Currently, the Hahoe Mask has a bounty of 50 thousand dollars.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had a 50 thousand dollar bounty on his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn't reality. \u00a0It was a game, and he had an overwhelming advantage in terms of Spec. \u00a0He would be earning a lot of money just by killing a User, who was 30 levels below him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Items that comes out from his Watch is mine.\u2019 \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, there would be additional profit he would gain after killing Hyrkan. It had been agreed that any Items that could be stolen from the Hahoe Mask's wrist watch was his to keep. If his research was correct, Hyrkan was an incredibly rich person, and it was known that he didn't spare any costs in acquiring Items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I lost a lot of time, but it seems I'll gain a huge profit here.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair started to have happy thoughts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if he was trying to break Sinclair's revery, Hyrkan spoke in a very solemn manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShall we do the battle off the record? \u00a0Let us keep no records or footage. How about we bury this battle in our hearts after this?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At those words, Sinclair stopped his imagination from running away from him. \u00a0It seemed Hyrkan wanted to talk to him a little bit more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll be thankful if we did that.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair decided to humor him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSince we are to fight, let's put our lives on the line in no uncertain terms.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Put our lives on the in no uncertain terms?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair was suspicious as to what he was saying, but Hyrkan took off his glove and he cut his wrist with his sword. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ivan's Sword immediately sliced deep into Hyrkan's wrist. \u00a0If he did had brought down the sword about half a dozen times harder, it would have been enough to cut off his own wrist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair's expression hardened when he saw the sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat the hell am I doing? Do you not know about the Watchman Style?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWatchman?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahjeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He once again brought down his sword on his wrist. \u00a0A smile could be seen below the Hahoe Mask, and he continued to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe'll give each others our watch. \u00a0It is a life and death battle that one cannot avoid. You don't know about it?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair thought about it for a brief moment. \u00a0The Watchman battle wasn't conducted like this to his knowledge. \u00a0However, this wasn't something unusual. \u00a0Warlord was game that catered its service to the world. \u00a0Depending on where the User was from, the battle styles and trends varied.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't as if Sinclair knew about everything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou sliced your own wrist to give your watch to your enemy. \u00a0This isn't even funny.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was simple reason why one would cut one's wrist to extract a watch. \u00a0In Warlord, the owner couldn't release one's wrist watch even as the owner. \u00a0There was only one way to release it. \u00a0One had to take it off after cutting the watch off the wrist. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was horrifying, but it made a perverse sense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was going to give the watch to his enemy then fight. \u00a0It was a gesture expressing his will. \u00a0He was basically saying he'll fight his enemy until he'll be able to recover his watch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he was cutting off his own wrist! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It seems he is really determined to go through with this.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair looked on in silence as he watched Hyrkan cut his own wrist. \u00a0It was known that the Hahoe Mask had never experienced his wrist being cut before. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan finally severed his wrist, and he took off the watch. \u00a0He used Body Glue to reattach his wrist. With his reattached hand, he threw his watch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSince you don't know about the Watchman Style, it can't be helped. \u00a0You keep it for now. It'll be mine once again after a couple of minute. It is inevitable.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he received the watch, Sinclair's expression hardened. \u00a0Something twitched within Sinclair's heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Fuck.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From the time he had started Warlord to now, Sinclair had always been the best. However, his situation didn't allow him to reveal the fact that he was the best. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he revealed himself right now, he could become more famous than the guild masters of the 30 great guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In fact, Sinclair was treated like a VVIP by the 30 great guilds. The 30 great guild masters requested communication with him. \u00a0They asked him for help, and at times, they tried to recruit him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was someone of that stature, yet the Hahoe Mask was acting as if killing Sinclair would be easy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt reattaches pretty well since it's a game.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan once again spoke to Sinclair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh! You chased after me with such fervor, yet you are trying to run away with my watch?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a provocation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe items in there is only worth a pittance to me. \u00a0If you run away, it would be unsatisfactory... Well, all right. \u00a0I promised this will be off the record, so I won't spread any rumors. \u00a0However, the memory of you running away with your tail behind your leg will remain in my memories.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After saying his provocation, Hyrkan sneered below his Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Sinclair heard the provocation, he took his glove off before he thought about what he was doing. \u00a0Then he raised his sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a smile that he wanted to knock right off Hyrkan\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He planned on cutting his wrist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWatchman Style. \u00a0What a fun concept.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Hyrkan saw what he was doing, the smile around Hyrkan's mouth disappeared. \u00a0It was Sinclair's turn to smirk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Finally, his wrist had been cut, and Sinclair tossed his wrist watch towards Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan wordlessly stared at the watch thrown at his feet. \u00a0As all of this was going on, Sinclair used the Body Glue to reattach his wrist like Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The expression on their faces had changed. \u00a0Hyrkan's expression had hardened, and Sinclair had a mocking smile on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll remember the Watchman Style.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Sinclair's words, Hyrkan answered by kicking the watch near his feet in a frustrated manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was evidence that Hyrkan was angry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair smirked as he laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The content of my investigation was all wrong. \u00a0He's the really prideful type. He gets easily riled up by provocations. \u00a0He probably never experienced hardship in this game. \u00a0He probably played the game thinking he is better than everyone.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It looked as if Hyrkan was filled with rage. \u00a0He took out numerous Skeleton Fragments, and he scattered it on the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, he summoned his Golem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo koo koo! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Golem appeared, and the Skeleton Fragments morphed into Warriors. \u00a0Hyrkan yelled out in the midst of an unsettled situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don't know who you are, but you'll pay dearly for challenging me!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He yelled out with a voice full of anger. \u00a0Sinclair raised his sword, and he started casting his Buff skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, Sinclair started drawing up a plan inside his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There is a limit as to how many Skeletons he can summon. In the end, I'll be at an advantage if I fight him head on.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair had devised a method to take down the Hahoe Mask, and it was quite simple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would eliminate all of Hyrkan's summoned familiars, then he would take down Hyrkan!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Normally, he would ignore the familiars, and he would try to take out the summoner as soon as possible. \u00a0However, this was actually the more dangerous plan. \u00a0Hyrkan's personal battle prowess was better than an average Striker. \u00a0He wasn't someone that could be eliminated in a short amount of time. While fighting Hyrkan, one would be in the worst position if one was surrounded by Hyrkan's underlings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the Skeleton Fragments and the Golem summon consumed a lot of Magic Power. Those skills most definitely had a cool down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the course of action chosen by Sinclair required him to destroy the fearsome Skeleton Warriors, Skeleton Knight and Golem. They were difficult opponents as some people even considered them as being glitch in the system. \u00a0However, Sinclair didn't feel any sense of threat from them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'll destroy them completely.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After finishing casting his Buffs, Sinclair immediately used the Charge skill. \u00a0As he used the Charge skill, he swung his sword imbued with the Booster skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shweeeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He combined the Charge and Booster skill. \u00a0Both were Rank A skills. \u00a0The sword swung by combining these two skills were so fast that the Skeleton Warriors had no chance of dodging it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Sinclair was able to control his body, which was on overdrive through the Charge skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A single use of the Charge skill allowed him to cross path with three Skeleton Warriors, and he hit all three of them with a single blow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was like a car that couldn't use its break to control its speed. \u00a0However, he was able to cleanly change directions or it looked as if he was doing it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The power of the strike was that much more terrifying. \u00a0The strike looked as if it just brushed by the Skeletons, but all the Items equipped by the Armament skill were destroyed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During all of this was going on, the Golem had taken shape, and it was bring down its massive arm towards Sinclair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The enormous hunk of rock was falling towards Sinclair's head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the attack was laughably slow for Sinclair. \u00a0Moreover, the Clay Play skill hadn't been used, so this was a normal Golem. \u00a0The chance of the Golem's attack hitting Sinclair was the same as being hit by lightning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koooohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The evidence of his composure was shown when he lightly avoided the attack, and he immediately jumped onto the Golem's fist, which had impacted the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, he swung his sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shweeeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A crescent sword energy was emitted from his swung sword, and it headed quickly towards the Golem's shoulder joint.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-hwaht! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One strike. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had severed the Golem's shoulder with one attack, and the arm fell away to the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koooohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The arm fell to the ground as it let out a lot of noise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During all of this, the Skeleton Knight had been moving. \u00a0Sinclair swung his sword towards the Skeleton Knight's body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the Skeleton Knight pitted against Sinclair. \u00a0They exchanged blows atop the detached fist of the Golem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggee-reek, ggee-reek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the battle between power vs power was initiated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the winner was Sinclair. \u00a0Sinclair's sword easily pushed away the Skeleton Knight's sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Sinclair foot pushed against the Skeleton Knight. \u00a0The Skeleton Knight was inferior in terms of strength, so it started taking steps backwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Knight fell backwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The surface atop the Golem's fist was uneven. \u00a0The act of regaining one's balance was outside of the skill possessed by the Skeleton Knight. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair raised his sword high as he shifted towards the fallen Skeleton Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThunder!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying a short shout of invocation, Sinclair's sword descended.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sword immediately fell like thunder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Gwah-roong! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he called for real thunder. \u00a0A single thread of thunder fell towards the sword right before it impacted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thunder! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a level 160 Rare Fighter Skill. \u00a0Amongst the currently discovered Fighter Skills, this was the strongest one!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A specific feature of the Thunder skill was being used now against a lower level opponent. \u00a0It had the Option of ignoring the opponent's defense. \u00a0Hyrkan was at least 30 level below Sinclair. \u00a0Basically, the Skeleton Knight summoned by his had no defense against his attack. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The result was terrifying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was only one Skill, but the Skeleton Knight had been burnt to a black crisp. \u00a0It was such a critical blow that the Skeleton Knight was down for the count.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This was easy.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair had a triumphant expression on his face. \u00a0At the same time, Sinclair looked for Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had been so confident that his attitude had been arrogant. \u00a0Sinclair was curious to see what kind of expression he had on his face. He wanted to remember the devastated and crushed look on Hyrkan\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Mmmm?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he wasn't...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He really wasn't....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI...it can't be?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahoe Mask was nowhere to be seen. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ooh wah\u2026\u2026 Look at speed at which my Magic is being consumed. His damage dealing is incredible.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he was running, Hyrkan clicked his tongue as he watched his Magic decrease with incredible speed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Does this mean he was over level 160? He most definitely has his name up in the Rankings.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan had a thin smile as he looked at the watch grasped in his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Greestone Imoogi, Bat Marauder and the Black Steel Wolf... \u00a0I could give one to the Skeleton Knight.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been speaking out of the both side of his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he mentioned the word Watchman, Hyrkan had never considered fighting with Sinclair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The case against not fighting was overwhelming.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His opponent had researched about Hyrkan. Sinclair was a very skilled player, and he had come prepared for the fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, Hyrkan had zero information on his opponent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He hadn\u2019t plan on fighting. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the first place, Hyrkan never fought a hopeless battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Still, I never expected him to fall for my bullshit...\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had acted pretty convincingly as he brought up the non-existent Watchman style. \u00a0He even cut off his wrist, and gave his watch to Sinclair. \u00a0He had been planning on using his watch as a sacrifice as he attempted to run away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He hadn\u2019t been trying to get his opponent's watch. \u00a0His aim was to make his opponent believe that he was going to battle no matter what. \u00a0If he gave away his watch, it made this deception more believable. \u00a0At the very least, if his opponent received Hyrkan's watch, he would think it less likely that Hyrkan would run away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, if his deception worked and he was able to run away, he would have suffered a huge monetary loss. \u00a0Still, it would be better than suffering a 48hrs penalty on top of losing his Items. \u00a0It was important to note that the most important Items equipped by Hyrkan like the Secret Society Ring, Ivan's Sword and the Corrupted Accessories couldn't be lost. \u00a0These Items would always revert to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This meant his scheme had brought in a jackpot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, his happiness ended there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He put the watch into his pocket, and he looked at his Magic. \u00a0He gritted his teeth when he saw only 20% of his Magic left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I fought him, it would have been horrible for me..\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It meant Sinclair had killed his summoned familiars at an incredible speed. \u00a0If he fought Sinclair head on, he couldn't guarantee his victory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't good news.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Why the hell is a bastard like that aiming for me?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the very least, Hyrkan was now aware that a big fish was gunning for Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan gritted his teeth once again.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

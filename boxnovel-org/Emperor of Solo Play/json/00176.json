The fallen Wooden Devil didn\u2019t even twitch. \u00a0Its devil-like visage was gone. \u00a0The Wood Devil\u2019s corpse looked as if it had been impacted by a typhoon. \u00a0The stones, woods and soil was spread around everywhere as if it had faced the teeth of the wind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Two Users were staring at the sight with a blank expression. \u00a0It looked as if their souls had been sucked out. \u00a0They yelled out at the same time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy level just increased!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy level went up.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The battlefield had been filled with the sound of swords, roars, and the unique bone clacking of the Skeletons. \u00a0Now the battlefield started to be filled with the voices of people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is incredible.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI heard the Wood Devil gave out a lot of EXP, but I never expected it to be this much\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0It is only a mid-sized monster, but it has the EXP of a large monster.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt just took 2 days to increase one level. \u00a0If we maintain this speed, maybe we will be able to catch up to the First One?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI thought the Wood Devils aren\u2019t supposed to be this easy to take down?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t you have eyes? \u00a0Numerous Skeletons continuously attacked it, yet it lasted for over 10 minutes. \u00a0It was this short, because we are talking about the Hahoe Mask-nim. \u00a0I bet over a dozen ordinary Users would have to attack to defeat it!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is what it is. \u00a0So why are you getting angry at me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI didn\u2019t get angry at you?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat the hell was that bullshit from before? \u00a0Was it some kind of a hysterical fit?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The noise around him was quite loud. \u00a0It was funny, but when he heard the bickering, he understood how a certain woman felt.</span></p><br/><p><span

and Joba was similar to the Hahui and Hatch, who represented the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They continuously fought with words, but when the battle started, they showed teamwork that was better than what most Users could pull off. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t just the fact that they were individually talented. \u00a0The two of them had experienced fighting alongside each other for a long time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This game has a lot of interesting people.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Crusader was a Striker type occupation under the Priest Class. \u00a0The Magic Swordsman type was under the Magician Class. \u00a0Their ability to cooperate with each other was the secret reason why they were able to reach level 200 with such difficult occupations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan also had someone, who had filled such a role.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There are a lot of shitty humans too\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had a comrade whom he had thought he could entrust his back to.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou did well.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling stared at the two Users. \u00a0After Hyrkan started the battle, Whistling hadn\u2019t had the opportunity to unsheath his sword for two days. \u00a0It was a very novel experience, and he gave a word of encouragement to Hyrkan. \u00a0Whistling had a peculiar expression his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was apologetic and surprised. \u00a0Several complex emotions arose within him anew.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the past, he had searched for the Elven Forest, and Hyrkan had leveled up quickly thanks to Whistling\u2019s help. \u00a0Now Hyrkan was helping Whistling in the same way. \u00a0He just watched as his level went up, and it was great\u2026 \u00a0However, such a short sentence was inadequate to describe what he was feeling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan shrugged his shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Skeletons are doing the heavy lifting, not me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying those words, Hyrkan put a candy in his mouth. \u00a0It was as Hyrkan had said. \u00a0The fighting was all done by his Skeletons. \u00a0He didn\u2019t even need to summon his Golems for the Wood Devils. \u00a0\u00a0He had a Death Knight and two Skeleton Knights out. \u00a0Then there were the 20 Skeleton Warriors and three Skeleton Magicians. \u00a0Hyrkan maintained this exact number.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a figure he came up with through experimentation as he had hunted inside the Highwood Forest for 10 days.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, nothing was free. \u00a0Hyrkan repeatedly ate expensive magic recovery Items as he continued his battles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan quickly crunched and grinded the Item into small pieces as he tried to recover his magical energy as soon as possible. \u00a0Hyrkan looked grim as he did so, and this was when he looked the most combative.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou really eat an endless supply of those Items.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy brand of fighting always puts me at a loss in terms of profit. \u00a0If I don\u2019t bring in so much profit through my videos, this would be too unprofitable to continue. \u00a0Of course, I\u2019m leveling up, so after calculating all factors, I can say I come out ahead. \u00a0\u00a0That damn levels.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Hyrkan\u2019s words, Whistling\u2019s mouth cracked open a little bit. \u00a0It seemed he was about to say something, but in the end, he shut his mouth. \u00a0He even swallowed most of what he had been about to say.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...you are enduring hardships.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not enduring any hardship. \u00a0As I said before, my Skeletons are doing all the heavy lifting.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan smiled as he looked at his Skeletons. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling lightly nodded his head when he saw this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, let\u2019s dismantle the Wood Devils.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Hyrkan\u2019s words, the argument between Yojori and Joba ended like magic. \u00a0At the same time, the two of them shouted towards Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want to do it!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were freakishly in sync in whatever they did. \u00a0However, this was also the cause of their arguments.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways, they were working hard to repay the generosity shown by the him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan shrugged his shoulders, and Whistling opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan turned around to look at Whistling, and Whistling shrugged his shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m riding such a great bus for free. \u00a0I should at least pick up the trash rolling around in the bus.\u201d</span></p><br/><p>8.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Hahoe Mask is back again?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, all the Users using the Highwood Forest as their main hunting ground were from the same guild. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Smiles guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the members of the Big Smiles guild heard that the Hahoe Mask had appeared once again, they tsked and hemmed. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat son of a bitch is treating this place as if it is his front yard.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt would have been better if it was his front yard. \u00a0This is our house. \u00a0He is in our front yard, and the Hahoe Mask is a thief.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are the retarded ones. \u00a0We spotted a thief, yet we are making it easier for the thief.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their average level was 228. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t low at all. \u00a0Even if they searched the entirety of Warlord, not many people have yet to achieve this level. \u00a0Of course, these were the core members of Big Smiles. \u00a0They were the big guns of the guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guild had wholeheartedly supported them, so they could level up. \u00a0They had personal Level Up support teams, and they fought against anything that would impede them from leveling up even in real life. \u00a0These Users ran on treadmills, and they worked out to train their bodies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They weren\u2019t playing this game for fun. \u00a0This was their occupation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From their perspective, they had been running full tilt on track when a monster like King Kong or a dinosaur had appeared. \u00a0Of course, they wouldn\u2019t look kindly towards such an impediment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMaybe sub-guildmaster Heh-bibin is right. \u00a0This is ridiculous. \u00a0Why do they think we won\u2019t be able to kill the Hahoe Mask if we go out in force? \u00a0Why do we have to leave that bastard alone?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Antipathy always brought out bitter words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStill, why should we unnecessarily bother the Hahoe Mask? \u00a0This is something decided by the Five Stars. \u00a0They decided to leave the Hahoe Mask alone.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the Five Star. \u00a0It was a decision made by the V&amp;V guild. \u00a0In the end, the Five Stars are servants of the V&amp;V guild.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou words are a bit\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, bitter words always took hold easily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou aren\u2019t wrong. \u00a0In truth, we have to settle a quarrel with the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0\u00a0I can\u2019t even go around telling people I\u2019m with the Big Smiles guild, because of that bastard. \u00a0If I tell people I\u2019m from the Big Smiles guild, the first thing they do is to ridicule me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGuild master Brooks is basically a puppet of Sinclair, and Sinclair sides with the V&amp;V guild. \u00a0In the first place, didn\u2019t V&amp;V hire him as a mercenary? \u00a0Sub-guild master Heh-bibin is right. \u00a0If things remain the same, we\u2019ll just be used.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, what are you talking about? \u00a0If Sinclair-nim didn\u2019t join us, we would be in a worse situation right now.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is this and that is that\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s be honest. \u00a0Wouldn't it be worth it to kill the Hahoe Mask? \u00a0If we do manage to kill him, the sale of the footage would be astronomical. \u00a0Moreover, no one would disparage us for trying to kill the Hahoe Mask with a lot of Users. \u00a0It isn\u2019t as if we did anything wrong this time around. \u00a0Hahoe Mask wronged us first.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are clearly on the moral high ground here.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the conversation continued, someone spoke up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn a situation like this, isn\u2019t the Killer supposed to fight the Hahoe Mask? \u00a0I know we\u2019ve had success recently thanks to the Killer, but why do we have to admit defeat before the fight?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou guys are taking this way too seriously.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThese are harsh words, but we aren\u2019t wrong.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course, you guys are in the wrong! \u00a0What if Killer loses? \u00a0It\u2019ll be the end of us!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoes losing to the Hahoe Mask actually hurt us? \u00a0If so, Sohank would have never recovered from his prior loss.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI would be more understanding if we had lost a PVP match to the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0However, this isn\u2019t the case. \u00a0There is a difference between losing and cowardice.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. \u00a0Our situation right now\u2026..\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The debate wasn\u2019t showing any signs of dying down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Some Users stopped participating in the discussion, and they just observed what was said. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u00a0We are luring a Wood Devil. \u00a0Please get ready for battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Users received a message from the Level Up support team, they put a pause to their conversation for now.</span></p><br/><p>9.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They went past the Highwood Forest, and they arrived at the Red Desert.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan no longer hunted any monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He ran.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He ran full tilt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The others also ran.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shweeek! \u00a0Shweeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A Sand Snake was closing the distance at incredible speed as the four Users ran.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan threw two Skeleton Fragments.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were running too fast, so the Skeleton Warriors formed after the Sand Snake had slithered past the Skeleton Fragments. \u00a0However, the Skeleton Warriors immediately caught up to the Sand Snake, and they attacked the hard body of the monster. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kyahhh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Sand Snake stopped its pursuit. \u00a0It took one of the Skeleton Warrior in its mouth, and it burrowed into the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The remaining Skeleton Warrior looked around as its comrade and enemy disappeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is ridiculous..\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had used the Skeleton Warriors as bait. \u00a0Hyrkan and the three others in his party was able to put a significant amount of distance from the Sand Snake using this method.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, they didn\u2019t stop running. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They kept running as if nothing had happened, and they talked as they ran.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt seems even Hahoe Mask-nim has a hard time driving the bus in the Red Desert.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey. \u00a0You should keep that kind of talk to yourself. \u00a0Why do you have to say that out loud?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0I\u2019m sorry. \u00a0My mouth gets away from me sometimes\u2026\u00b7.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan let out a bitter laugh at their words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The current situation was unfolding as he had expected. \u00a0When they entered the Red Desert, he gave up on hunting the monsters. \u00a0He focused on heading towards the directions pointed out by the Gem Conch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t impossible for Hyrkan to take down all the Sand Snakes. \u00a0However, problems would arise if one of his three party members were taken below the sand. \u00a0At that point, Hyrkan couldn\u2019t save them. \u00a0Also, it was true that Sand Snake was much harder to catch than the Wood Devils.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you know this trivia? \u00a0Originally, the Sand Snake monster wasn\u2019t a monster.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joba didn\u2019t want Hyrkan\u2019s mood to sour from his previous remark. \u00a0Joba changed the topic. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs there a story behind it?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan showed a little bit of interest. \u00a0Even if they were running full tilt, no one was out of breath. \u00a0In such a boring marathon, talking was a great way to pass the time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Yojori and Joba told entertaining stories, and there were a lot of substance behind their stories. \u00a0In regards to certain topics, they knew more than Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Sand Snake was a mode of transportation used by Elves and Dwarves, who lived in the Red Desert. \u00a0They used the Sand Snakes to travel through the underground tunnels.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat a weird transportation method.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBefore the Barley Kingdom became eradicated by the Dragon\u2019s Curse, a passage was handed down. \u00a0The exact words were...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTo avoid the Dragon\u2019s Curse, the ground snake was used to make an underground world. \u00a0The power will allow one to fight it.

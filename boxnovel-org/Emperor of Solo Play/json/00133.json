Despite knowing all of this, the teams attempted the Raid. \u00a0None of the teams were able to last even an hour in the Raid. \u00a0When the Raid failed, the Immoral Prince immediately left the location. The losing groups took a terrible beating in many ways.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018They were very unlucky.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If seen in those terms, the Stormhunters was very lucky. \u00a0After the second Immoral Prince Raid was a failure, the Stormhunters was able to decipher the cryptic hints on the same day they got it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I never expected the Immoral Prince to appear at a location we just found. It is said that the bread always fall on the buttered side down....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Blue Snake symbolized a Blue river, and the White Roof was a snow covered mountain. \u00a0Everyone reached a consensus on this interpretation. However, there were about 50 locations with a blue river and a snow covered mountain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Therefore, the crucial part was the Red Mirror, and the angular landmark. \u00a0Surprisingly, the Stormhunters had found a region that checked off the two remaining requirements.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Patagonia mountain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a region found recently by the Stormhunters. \u00a0Several days ago, this stage had a Block Field over it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Patagonia mountain had a Red Lake, and a tree had been struck by lightning. \u00a0The tree had been burnt to death, and it was the angular landmark. \u00a0Of course, this location was very hard to find.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the Patagonia mountain hadn\u2019t been found and professionally investigated by the Storm Hunters, no one would have been able to find the Red Mirror and the angular landmark. \u00a0Moreover, the Patagonia mountain was teeming with level 190 monsters, and it would take a long time to explore this mountain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why events had turned out like this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The fact that we found this place first was the reason behind our problem now. \u00a0Why did it have to be this way?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason why the Storm Queen Shir had decided to monopolize the 3rd Immoral Prince Raid run.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If it was a location everyone knew about, everyone would inevitably be watching their every move. \u00a0The two other guilds would try to meddle in their business. \u00a0However, the Stormhunters didn't have to worry about that. \u00a0Unless there was a Judas within their guild, there was no way the other guilds would find out about their actions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, Hatch was very pessimistic about this raid, so these were all signs of bad luck to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he saw the trees thick with leaves around the Red Lake and the presence of the burnt tree, he couldn't help, but feel very depressed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey. \u00a0What's are you doing!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of it all, the Storm Princess Hahui was unnecessarily trying to pick a fight with him. \u00a0She possessed an unfortunate name, and she had the eyes of a fire dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you think I'm doing? \u00a0I'm sighing.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c A sigh?

The Stormhunters guild was one of the 30 great guilds, and they had broken an agreement they previously agreed with the Red Bulls and the Hydra guild. \u00a0They had made an independent decision to do this Raid on their own. \u00a0Moreover, it would have been better if the leader had done all of this for profit. \u00a0However, this event had occurred, because of Shir's bullheadedness. \u00a0Her actions defied common sense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chev was very irritated by the situation, but at the same time, he quickly accepted the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018As expected of a crazy bitch. \u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If someone else had done this, he would have been suspicious instead of being surprised. \u00a0However, the Storm Queen was quite capable of doing this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways, the Stormhunters had made their decision, and they were going to carry out their mission. \u00a0They would have to react accordingly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- What do you plan on doing?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat about your side?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Anyways, we only have two choices available to us.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They could either become spectators or join up in the action.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one thought about it rationally, one could already surmise the probability of success was very low for the Stormhunters if they tried the Immoral Prince Raid on their own. The Stormhunters had sinned by offending them, so they could just watch the Stormhunters fail. \u00a0They weren't required to join and help the Stormhunters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was the fact that the decisions made by Stormhunters wasn't bound by logic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- If the Stormhunters fail this Raid, they'll never participate in one afterwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat'll cause a big headache.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the Stormhunters guild failed this Raid, there was zero chance that they'll show any remorse for their actions. \u00a0At the same time, the Stormhunters guild would immediately give up on the Immoral Prince Raid. \u00a0The Storm Queen's pride wouldn\u2019t allow for a reattempt. She probably was well aware of the consequences, yet she chose to go through with her actions. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- If the Stormhunters drops out, the Immoral Prince Raid will become very hard. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The absence of the Stormhunters couldn't be glossed over. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two of them were watching the footage of the Immoral Prince raid as they held their conversation. \u00a0In the world of Warlord, these two men were basically cut from the same cloth, and they both had an appropriate fear about the Immoral Prince.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of it all, only those with the Battle Tokens could participate in the Immoral Prince Raid. \u00a0If the Stormhunters drops out, it would be very difficult to replace them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If so, would it be better to mobilize now and help the Stormhunters? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, both men were having a hard time seeing this as the right answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid you perhaps calculate the benefit cost analysis of joining the Stormhunters?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immoral Prince Raid was a business decision. \u00a0Their decision would change based on the calculation of the profits and losses. \u00a0If helping the Stormhunters was more profitable than watching from the sidelines, they'll take appropriate actions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- How many live tickets were sold?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe sold as much as possible through the pre-sales. \u00a0How many commercials spots did you sell?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- We've sold it all. \u00a0However, we weren't able to sell it at a high rate as you guys.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if the two guilds helped out the Stormhunters in this Raid, they weren\u2019t expected to lose \u00a0much money. \u00a0They had already sold the live tickets through pre-sale, and the contracts for the commercials had been finalized.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- We won't lose anything from helping them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course, there will be some loss, but we can request compensation for our loss from the Stormhunters.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if they did suffer a loss, they could ask for compensation from the Stormhunters. \u00a0Of course, they would have to succeed in the Immoral Prince Raid to do this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Are you ready for the Raid? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The next problem was the preparation for the Raid. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI can finish all preparation in 10 minutes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The preparation had been finished a long time ago. Both sides had gathered a team of professionals that were qualified to participate in the Immoral Prince Raid. \u00a0They had been passing time by training and leveling up at the hunting grounds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All the equipments and consumable Items that would be used in the Raid had been prepared. \u00a0The two guilds even synced their hours of operation. \u00a0Everyone logged in and logged out at the same time. \u00a0Everyone slept for the same amount of time. \u00a0All the participants had also received a checkup. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one worried about the preparedness of the Hydra guild and the Red Bulls guild, it was basically an insult to them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wouldn\u2019t be bad to join the Immoral Prince Raid in secret with the Stormhunters. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, they couldn\u2019t be satisfied from just participating in the Raid. \u00a0They had to find a way to maximize their profits.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- If I\u2019m to come up with a plan, I\u2019ll probably let the Stormhunters go first. \u00a0We enter afterwards, and each team will find and destroy the relics. \u00a0I think that\u2019ll be for the best.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShould we use the Stormhunters as bait?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- If we use the Stormhunters as bait, we will be able to destroy 2 relics... \u00a0No. \u00a0The Stormhunters would also have to form a team that\u2019ll destroy the relic, while they occupy the Immoral Prince. \u00a0If we are lucky, we can use the Stormhunters as bait, and we\u2019ll be able to destroy at least 3 relics.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were going to use the Stormhunters as bait. \u00a0Aside from whether the hunt is a success or not, the bait would suffer the most damage. \u00a0This was why the bait was also called the sacrificial lamb.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the three guilds worked within the framework of the agreement, no one would have been used as bait. \u00a0No one wanted to be the sacrificial lamb.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the Stormhunters guild was the first one to break their agreement. \u00a0Even if the Stormhunters guild was used as bait, they couldn\u2019t officially express their dissatisfaction. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, they\u2019ll probably express their anger through the unofficial channels, but the Red Bulls guild and the Hydra guild was on equal standing with the Stormhunters. \u00a0These two guilds had no reason to be scared of the Stormhunters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI would like to read a more detailed description of the plan.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I\u2019ll send it to you immediately. \u00a0However, I want you to tell me about the Hahoe Mask first. \u00a0I won\u2019t be able to make a complete plan if his information is absent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll contact you again in 10 minutes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After exactly 10 minutes, Chev sent the First Head a message. \u00a0It was a very short text message.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Hahoe Mask will join up later.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chev, who was sending the message, did not have a happy expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p>3.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir was leading from the front, and 25 members from the Stormhunters guild were following her in a straight line. \u00a0The angular tree was to their left, and each member of the group put a distance of 2 meters between each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It happened 10 minutes into their walk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir was the first one to disappear from sight. \u00a0Everyone followed her example as they followed after her, and they all disappeared from sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch was at the end of the line, and at some point, he lost sight of all of his comrades. \u00a0However, Hatch didn't feel any confusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Good.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instance Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The battle with the Immoral Prince was a content that can only be done by selected Users. \u00a0Moreover, \u00a0a defeat meant the annihilation of the whole Raid Party.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Users in front of him had entered the Instance Dungeon one by one. \u00a0Moreover, the Users in the front was informing the others of what was happening through the Voice Talk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hatch knew this was the opportunity he had been waiting for. \u00a0He turned his head to look backwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch sensed something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch sent a signal towards the location where he sensed a presence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Hey!

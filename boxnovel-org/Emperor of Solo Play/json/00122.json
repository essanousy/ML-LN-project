(3)</span></p><br/><p>9.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the V&amp;V guild and the 8 other guilds announced their intention of sitting out the great battle, it didn't really cause much change to the overall flow of the great battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, nothing was felt. \u00a0The normal Users didn't feel much difference, because the announcement that the 9 guilds wouldn't participate was meaningless. \u00a0This was like a politician earnestly spouting nonsense towards another politician.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ones affected the most was the 30 great guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What nonsense are these crazy bastards suddenly spouting?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If they can't have it, then we can't have it either? \u00a0Is that it?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The rest of the 30 great guilds had planned on entering into the great battle at the right moment. Aside from the 9 guilds, the rest of the 30 guilds had to temporarily pause all the plans they had made.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this didn't mean the 9 guilds, who announced their non-participation, had a lot of influence or authority over the other guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The one to step forward first will be hit the hardest.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There is no need to be the first one to get bludgeoned.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This might be better for us. \u00a0The great battle is more difficult than expected. \u00a0We should use this time to put our forces in order.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, everyone's choice came down to calculating the cost. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If we look at what's happening right now, the Corrupted army is dominating the battlefield. Eventually, they'll need us.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018We can still work at the individual level. \u00a0We just have to keep our guild's name out of the spotlight.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ones, who were most affected aside from the 30 great guilds, was the Underfoot guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While the 30 great guilds were punching figures into their calculators, the Underfoot guilds were aggressively participating in the great battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, their participation couldn't change the tide of the battle. \u00a0Still, there had only been consecutive losses before, but now there were increasing number of victories.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was especially true for the Fighters guild. Whistling Pitbull's stellar performance was \u00a0dazzling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Did the Fighters guild win again? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- He did it! \u00a0He did it! \u00a0Pitbull did it! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Pitbull made a breach as he put his life on the line. The Users were sheeps without a shepherd, but now they have someone to flock towards. Someone really has to take the lead. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, the Fighters guild more than likely would have lost their first foray into the great battle. They were using methods that had failed before. Their line of Tankers hadn't performed up to par, and the command structure had not been solidified. \u00a0The mages rained down magic indiscriminately as they damaged allies and enemies equally. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, everyone thought this was a wasted effort... \u00a0The Users were getting ready to bail out quickly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was when Whistling Pitbull marshaled his comrades, and they charged forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBreak through! Burrow in as deep as you can! The side that can break through the other's battle line wins!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling Pitbull was going to be surrounded by monsters, but he didn't show a single ounce of fear. \u00a0Whistling Pitbull unhesitatingly charged forward, and this sight changed the heart of some Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. Let's try at least once. It isn't as if we can runaway forever.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf I wanted to run away all the time in a paid game, I would be playing Pacman.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFollow Whistling Pitbull in! We'll live if we stick together!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Users that had been about to run away changed their minds. \u00a0They ran back into the battlefield, and they fought with Whistling Pitbull as they formed a wedge. Everything was resolved rapidly afterwards. \u00a0The Corrupted army was broken in half, and the Corrupted army broke up further to form smaller groups. \u00a0The Users defeated them one by one. \u00a0Most of the Users weren't talented at fighting a large group like the Corrupted army, but they had a lot of experience in taking down small number of monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Fighters guild had broken the streak of losses, and they were somewhat able to direct the Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this method couldn't be replicated by others, and it wasn't an answer that would change the tide of the battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They needed a strategy instead of directions. \u00a0They needed a tactic where anyone could copy it, and the result had to be certain. \u00a0They needed a method where the effect could be seen immediately!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A User appeared to propose such a method.</span></p><br/><p>10.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOne of the special characteristics of the Corrupted army is the Siege mode where their vision narrows. If put in simpler terms, they won't stop marching even if the comrade next to them is killed. This is why it is very easy to hunt the monsters on the periphery while they are moving. This is what knowledgeable people call Gnawing.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the footage, there was a man wearing a red Hahoe Mask standing in front of a castle. \u00a0He was pointing at the Corrupted Army, while he earnestly gave an explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On another video, the Corrupted army had broken through the Castle gate. \u00a0As if this wasn't enough, the Corrupted army broke down the castle wall, and they marched past the rubble. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe fact that the castle gate and castle wall had fallen doesn't have to signal the end of a battle.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In this video, the man wearing a red Hahoe Mask was giving an explanation again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cActually, this is the time to attack. \u00a0When a castle gate is breached or a castle wall falls, there is something that will always happen! This congestion of traffic always happens! \u00a0A small number of Tankers can buy time. \u00a0At the same time, AOE magic can be used on the monsters stuck in the bottleneck. \u00a0The effect would be beyond description. If you can maintain this line, the defense of the castle is possible.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The footage switched to the sight of numerous buildings within the castle being destroyed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe buildings are incredible obstacles for the monsters. \u00a0There is no reason why you shouldn't use the obstacles to your advantage. The street fights are the last battle before the castle is lost, but it is also the battle where the advantage is overwhelmingly in the User\u2019s favor. \u00a0Don't panic, because it is a street fight. \u00a0Enjoy it. This will be the chance to participate in the most easiest hunts, so don't run away.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a video regarding tactics. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask unhesitatingly put out videos where he showed tactics on how to defeat the Corrupted army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Users were brooding from the fact that they kept losing in the great battle. \u00a0The video was like sweet water to the Users, who had suffered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I acknowledge this is a very good tip! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- It is as the Hahoe Mask said. You have to approach the Corrupted army laterally instead of a head-to-head contest. The battle becomes very easy. The Gnawing method is really sweet! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- He uploaded a jar of honey instead of videos. Thank you for the treat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, not everyone looked favourably on the Hahoe Mask's actions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Why did you reveal this? \u00a0Take down the vids.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Ah. \u00a0Every time I'm trying to harvest some honey, bastards like you who are crazy about views mess everything up. Take down the vids!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Hahoe Mask. \u00a0Unless you want to cry from being PKed, pull the videos.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were Users, who had been making a killing using the know-how dropped by Hyrkan. \u00a0From their perspective, it was as if Hyrkan had broken the jar of honey they had been consuming. Of course, they didn't look favourably at Hyrkan's release of information.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was the same for Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit. \u00a0Do you think I'm doing this, because I like it?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had been the one drinking the most from the honey pot he had revealed. \u00a0Hyrkan had planned on using the methods he had revealed to earn the Great Battle's Hero title and other rewards. In truth, he had been taking full advantage of it until now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the situation had changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Users had to win the great battle. The result of the great battle was incredibly important to him. \u00a0From Hyrkan's perspective, he had no choice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to spread a lot of bait like this to reignite the interest of the regular Users.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The string of defeats had caused a lot of disappointments, and a lot of Users had turned away from participating in the great battle. \u00a0He needed to provide candies to turn them around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, this wasn't the end. There was a limit on how many he can lure back with sweets. \u00a0While the gaze of the Users were back on the stage of the great battle, he had to make their bodies burn with fighting spirit. \u00a0He had to make their body itch from the need to participate in the great battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This meant his most difficult task was yet to be accomplished.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'm working like a dog, yet what if the Ruined Kingdom Quest Route is different from what I know from before... \u00a0If so, I'll find a way to blow up Tobosoft's server.\u2019</span></p><br/><p>11.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shezga castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an adequate distance away from Misandra's castle. \u00a0Like the Misandra's Castle, the Shezga castle was where level 80 to level 100 Users stayed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the Shezga castle's Subjugation Association was surrounded by a lot of users, who had already went through their 1st Advancement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were almost 1000 Users of varying classes present. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Normally, two to three thousand Users participated in great battles at castles, so this was a relatively low turn out. \u00a0Of course, the expectation for victory at the Shezga castle was inevitably low.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was when Hyrkan appeared in front of them. \u00a0Unlike yesterday, he was wearing his red Hahoe Mask, and his appearance created a sensation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? It's the Hahoe mask!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you for the videos!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll take advantage of the tips you us.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying Hyrkan's appearance, a great number of Users sent their goodwill towards him. \u00a0Hyrkan left behind the crowd, and he entered the Subjugation Association. \u00a0\u00a0Unlike outside of the Subjugation Association building, there weren't that many people inside the building.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were 12 Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These Users had been nominated, and they were given command of the forces that would be fighting in the great battle. They were given the title of Centurions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Users kept losing, they realized they needed a command structure at the very least. \u00a0They decided to gather in a group of 100 Users, and each group decided to nominate a group leader. \u00a0Of course, this wasn't a prestigious seat. \u00a0They were given command, but they were something akin to a leader of a college group project.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They weren't happy with the appearance of Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Why is the Hahoe Mask here?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He always soloed everything up until now. \u00a0There is no reason why he should show up here.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They all were in agreement that the appearance of Hyrkan would help their beleaguered force, but Hyrkan had never operated with a group before. \u00a0He was strictly an outsider.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This meant he had a purpose in coming here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Hyrkan entered the room, he immediately walked towards the Centurions. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a distance of about 15 meters between them and the door. \u00a0About a dozen steps were taken by Hyrkan, and the sound of his steps pressed down hard on the slightly disordered atmosphere within the Subjugation Association. \u00a0When he came to a stop, there was silence, and everyone stared at Hyrkan's mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want to command this great battle. Do you mind handing the operational authority to me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p>12.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe greatly admire the Hahoe Mask's exploits. \u00a0If you ask for the operational authority, of course, we will give it to you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They gave their answer. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid you expect to hear some bullshit answer along that line? \u00a0I hope not\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an unequivocal rejection.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, there was a vehement response to Hyrkan's request.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou suddenly appeared here, and you are asking for the operational authority? \u00a0Why should we give that to you?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf an outsiders saw this, they'll think we are your underlings by the way you treat us. However, we are utter strangers.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was to be expected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask's fame was incredible. \u00a0Of course, one's eyes would be blinded when staring at his fame, which was brilliant. Even though they were drunk on his fame, this didn't mean Hyrkan had a right to treat them as his servants. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Centurions gathered here were all pretty high level, and they had a plethora of battle experience under them. \u00a0They couldn't play the game as well as Hyrkan, but their passion and interest for this game weren't any less than Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou can't give it to me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you immediately go outside and you are able to get 66% of the participating Users to sign a written consent, then we'll give you the operational authority to you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan snorted at his words. \u00a0They were asking for a written consent. \u00a0It was possible in real life, but it was something impossible to do in Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's make this simple. \u00a0How about we decide this through PVP?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan gave a counter proposal. \u00a0It was more of a provocation than a proposal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy would we agree to such a crazy proposal? \u00a0There are plenty of reasons on Youtube that says we shouldn't fight the Hahoe Mask.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, no one fell for his provocation. It wasn't about falling for it or not. \u00a0This was normal in Warlord. Most of the Users in Warlord solved disagreements through words. It was rare to see a disagreement be solved through PVP or PK.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you insist on fighting your way, this will turn out like the battle at Misandra's castle. \u00a0I have a decent plan in mind.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou don't know what we want. \u00a0We are going to kill a decent amount of monsters then we'll escape. \u00a0We didn't come here to win.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Someone stood up from his seat, and he slowly walked to stand in front of Hyrkan. \u00a0At his appearance, everyone shut their mouths. It seemed this person had a strong voice within the group of Centurions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan also recognized him when he checked his face. \u00a0He unconsciously pursed his lips as if he was about to whistle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Big K? The Submariner is here?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big K. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, he was level 175, and he was a magician that had gone through his 1st Advancement to become a Magus Magnus.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His nickname was the Submariner. \u00a0He used to be a baseball player, and he used his underhand pitching form to throw his magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His method of delivery was unexpectedly quite effective. \u00a0A great number of monsters had a high amount of defense against attacks coming from the front or the top. However, they were relatively vulnerable to an attack that exploded from the bottom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since he was a former baseball player, the accuracy of his magic couldn't even be compared to the normal Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he was affiliated with the Red Bulls.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had a pretty good gaming career, and there were no Underfoot guild present here. Of course, he was qualified to become a leader of such an undisciplined group of Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe don't have to speak in length about this. \u00a0I'll just lay out the main points.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big K confidently stood in front of Hyrkan, and he spoke in a sharp manner towards Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe don't care about winning this fight. \u00a0We don't have the ability to bring this about. We want to catch a decent amount of monsters before we slip away. \u00a0We don't care if the Shezga castle falls or not. \u00a0That is none of our business.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big K's words spelled out the group's intentions in no uncertain terms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Those who wanted to win the great battle and successfully defend the castles were with Underfoot guilds already, since they had proven they could win. \u00a0Moreover, the locations with the Underfoot guilds had Users ranging in number from 3 to 5 thousand. \u00a0They were overflowing with fighting power, and their chances of defending the castles were quite high.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, the monster hunts were very competitive in those locations. \u00a0There was a sense of achievement in winning, but one couldn't get a sufficient amount of EXP from those battles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, the Users that had gathered in number at the Shezga castle was at a location where the downfall of the castle was almost a certainty. However, there was no way there will be a shortage of monsters here. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan knew this truth better than anyone. \u00a0This was the reason why Hyrkan always went to stages where the odds were stacked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If seen that way, Hyrkan was like an icon for defeat. \u00a0Hyrkan had never moved the needle towards victory in the battles he participated in. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo you guys are paying a lot of money to play like hyenas, who clamor over rotten meat?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan tried another provocation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big K furrowed his eyebrows. In truth, Big K and the Centurions had been considerate to Hyrkan. \u00a0In the first place, Hyrkan didn't have the authority to come in here and be so overbearing. \u00a0If it was any other User, they would have chased him out. \u00a0They were giving an explanation, because he was the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was a limit to anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahoe Mask. Aren't you in the same boat as...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe plan is simple.

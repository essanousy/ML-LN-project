When Maoong stopped talking, the air was filled with a serious and somber atmosphere. And as if to match such an atmosphere, Hyrkan also kept a stern expression.</p><br/><p>Of course, his thinking was completely different on the inside.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come on, let\u2019s get this over with.\u2019</p><br/><p>The fact that the Stormhunter Guild had arrived at the Bulkas Mountain Range made Hyrkan restless. He was no longer happy to keep up with Maoong taking his sweet time.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately for Hyrkan, Maoong had no way of knowing what Hyrkan was thinking. He was faithful to his role. </p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He started with an expression of gratitude. </p><br/><p>\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for you, it would have been hard to avoid a casualty. We also learned a valuable piece of information thanks to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease. I\u2019m just happy I could be of help.\u201d </p><br/><p>Hyrkan replied immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, really.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyrkan couldn\u2019t help but make a sour face. </p><br/><p>\u2018Hurry\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Then, as if Hyrkan\u2019s prayers had been heard, Maoong got up from his seat. After heading to one of the bookshelves that were lined up against the wall, he carefully took out a book. Although its cover didn\u2019t look any different than the others, its inside was filled with folded papers.</p><br/><p>\u2018Eh?\u2019</p><br/><p>The voice inside Hyrkan\u2019s head urging him on disappeared like snow on heated asphalt.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan\u2019s expectation began to grow, as Maoong placed the folded papers on his desk for Hyrkan to see.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are maps I\u2019ve gathered during my time here at the Bulkas Mountain Range.\u201d</p><br/><p>Maps!</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this word, Hyrkan let out a shout inwardly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes! Dungeon maps!\u2019</p><br/><p>Dungeon map. </p><br/><p>As one might expect, it was a map showing the location of a dungeon. In Warlord, dungeon maps were no different than treasure maps.</p><br/><p>Another name for them was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Maoong, you\u2019re collecting some good stuff here!\u2019</p><br/><p>Certified checks.</p><br/><p>That was the worth of a dungeon map. A dungeon from a dungeon map guaranteed at least 1 title and a Rare rank item. Dungeons also gave much higher EXP than field hunting grounds, and videos of them were highly anticipated as well. If lucky, one could find hidden quests, and most importantly, the chance of leaving a dungeon with a valuable skill-book was immensely high. Most skill-books that were Rare rank and above came from dungeons.</p><br/><p>\u2018They say life is full of ups and downs. With what I just went through, this makes me feel so good!\u2019 </p><br/><p>Hyrkan was back to being extremely happy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Looks like it\u2019s really going to be beef tonight.\u2019 </p><br/><p>Hyrkan began to immediately think about his dinner. Maoong then continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cConsidering their value, I\u2019ve kept them with me, but since I cannot leave the Bulkas Mountain Range, it is a waste to just let them be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough it might not be enough of a reward, take one you want.\u201d </p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyrkan wasn\u2019t disappointed by this in any way. </p><br/><p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter which one I choose.\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t brood over which one to choose. He simply picked the middle one, from the five maps in front of him. </p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019ll be 10,000 gold at the very least\u2026\u2019 </p><br/><p>With a 10,000,000 won check in hand, Hyrkan could feel his heart racing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll choose this one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyrkan picked a map. Maoong then continued as if he had been waiting for Hyrkan to make his decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have one more favor to ask of you.\u201d </p><br/><p>Hyrkan observed Maoong\u2019s actions carefully, and noticed that he had left the maps on the desk.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh?\u2019</p><br/><p>He immediately understood why Maoong had taken out several maps.</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2019s going to give me another one for a favor?\u2019</p><br/><p>It looked like Maoong wanted to make a trade with Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan was more than happy to comply. For the sake of the main scenario quest, if he had to, he would have done Maoong\u2019s favors for free. But since Maoong was giving out such good rewards, Maoong seemed like an angel to Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be more than happy to do you a favor, sir.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeyond the Bulkas Mountain Range, there is a place called the Parung Forest. Do you know of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Parung Forest.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan couldn\u2019t help but frown for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have received reports of armed monsters, like the Bear Warrior you fought. I\u2019d like to ask you to investigate that place, and if you find anything suspicious, I\u2019d like you to do a closer examination. Although it might not be enough, I will reward you the best I can.\u201d </p><br/><p>Maoong then tapped on his desk twice. At the place his fingers tapped were his dungeon maps. </p><br/><p>Hyrkan could only nod in response.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will head to Parung Forest.\u201d</p><br/><p>[The quest, \u2018Maoong\u2019s Request\u2019, begins.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI give you my sincere gratitude.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a quest he couldn\u2019t refuse. </p><br/><p>But hearing the destination, Hyrkan could feel a slight headache coming over him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Parung Forest\u2026 of all the troublesome places\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Parung Forest was a place filled with monsters above level 90. It wasn\u2019t somewhere Hyrkan could go at his current state. Not to mention, although he had fragmentary information on Parung Forest, he himself had never hunted there. Warlord was just too vast for Hyrkan to remember everything.</p><br/><p>\u2018Whew.\u2019</p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t outside of his scope of expectation. In the first place, it was a miracle that a level 60 player like Hyrkan could have passed Maoong\u2019s Test. It was a quest designed for players above level 80, and Hyrkan beat such a quest at level 60. By himself no less! It was only obvious that future quests would grow in difficulty. Hyrkan had already expected that he would need to stop to level up. </p><br/><p>It was just he felt more pressured with pursuers right behind him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Looks like I\u2019ll need to focus on leveling up.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>After leaving the Bulkas Ranger Village, Hyrkan examined the dungeon map he had obtained. The content of the map would make one ask if it was done by a child. There was barely anything on it, and because only a small area could be seen, it was impossible for an unknowing person to figure out where it was.</p><br/><p>There was only one clue. The two characters \u2018Su\u2019 and \u2018Ra\u2019 written in the corner.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is it the Sura Canyon?\u2019</p><br/><p>Sura Canyon.</p><br/><p>It was the home of the level 80 monsters, Devil Goats. The Sura Canyon was a long and winding ravine. Hidden within the grass and trees inside were a peculiar species of goats that liked jumped out the canyon\u2019s cliffs as if they were grass plains. </p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s not so bad.\u2019</p><br/><p>For Hyrkan, it wasn\u2019t an unfavorable place.</p><br/><p>In fact, the Sura Canyon was a fine hunting ground. Although the place was filled with Devil Goats, they themselves liked to move about alone. Their combat strength was lower than most level 80 monster, and they gave average amount of EXP. The hunting ground difficulty was below average, but the experience it gave was average. Paired together, it was a great hunting ground for Hyrkan to reach level 70. </p><br/><p>The problem was that what was good for Hyrkan was good for others as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018Didn\u2019t the Red Bulls occupy that area recently?\u2019</p><br/><p>A week ago, the Red Bulls Guild discovered the Sura Canyon and occupied the area. </p><br/><p>In Warlord, declaring a monopoly or occupancy held a political significance. Declaring a monopoly meant that no one was able to enter a designated area without permission. Declaring occupancy meant that those who entered a designated area had to abide by certain rules. Those that failed to comply were, of course, killed. </p><br/><p>In most cases, people acknowledged declaration of monopoly and occupancy for some time. </p><br/><p>In this case, since it was an occupancy declaration, there would be no problem as long as Hyrkan followed the Red Bulls\u2019 rules.</p><br/><p>\u2018The guys from Red Bulls aren\u2019t so bad\u2026 but I\u2019m slightly bothered that they allied themselves with the Stormhunters.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan was concerned by the fact that it was the Red Bulls who occupied the area.</p><br/><p>Of course, Hyrkan didn\u2019t have too much of a choice. Rather than hunting elsewhere and going to Sura Canyon\u2019s dungeon, it was much more efficient to hunt in Sura Canyon and go to the dungeon. </p><br/><p>At this point, even a single day was worth a lot.</p><br/><p>Without even stopping for a breath, Hyrkan ran in the direction of Sura Canyon.</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this is the Bulkas Mountain Range.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe clue to the main scenario quest is here, eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ten days after the sighting of Ballista Hatch and Storm Princess Hahui in the Bulkas Ranger Village, the Bulkas Mountain Range had become the hottest place in Warlord. Players of all levels and guilds of all sizes came to look for the treasure that was sure to be in the Bulkas Mountain Range.</p><br/><p>Fans of Warlord also began to see the Bulkas Mountain Range with great interest.</p><br/><p>It was the same for Romany. Due to the nature of his occupation, he couldn\u2019t help but have great interest in the Bulkas Mountain Range. Because of this, he couldn\u2019t help but tremble at what he currently had in his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018It took a full week.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had spent a full week to work on a single video. It didn\u2019t mean it had taken a long time. After all, one week couldn\u2019t be considered long in movie production.</p><br/><p>\u2018To think I made this with just one week\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The reason he was trembling was he was amazed by what he accomplished in just a week.</p><br/><p>\u2018I see why kids like to make baking powder volcanoes for fun.\u2019</p><br/><p>Thinking about the kind of impact his video would have, Romany trembled once again.</p><br/><p>To calm himself down, Romany took a sip of hot cocoa. </p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018This is a real bomb. If the videos so far had been grenades, this one is a bomb strong enough to knock down a few buildings. Not to mention, with the current timing\u2026.\u2019 </p><br/><p>Romany\u2019s hands couldn\u2019t stop shaking. Seeing his continued trembling, Romany smiled.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is it.\u2019</p><br/><p>The knowledge that a piece of art he made could shake the world. How many times would he be able to experience such a feeling in his lifetime? As a creator, Romany couldn\u2019t help but be happy.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is what I wanted to make!\u2019 </p><br/><p>Just like that, Romany sent the bomb in his hand to his client.</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, the work-out has been canceled. Yes, it was sudden.\u201d</p><br/><p>Choi Sulyeon\u2019s secretary, Park Suji.</p><br/><p>The Choi Sulyeon she knew was someone that all women\u2026 no, all human being would be envious of. Not only was she born with everything, she furthermore had the ability to put them to use by 120 percent.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is the first time she\u2019s acted this way.\u2019</p><br/><p>One of her greatest strengths was her ability to create a solid schedule and follow it. Especially when it came to working out, eating, sleeping, or other standard activities, she kept to her schedule without failure. Unless there was a natural disaster happening, she kept to her eating schedule, work-out schedule, and sleep schedule at all times.</p><br/><p>But for the first time, she ignored her schedules. </p><br/><p>\u2018This is the first time she ate in her room. Not to mention, she canceled her work-out plans.\u2019</p><br/><p>This was the first time Park Suji had seen her act this way since she started serving her. </p><br/><p>As such, Park Suji couldn\u2019t help but wonder.</p><br/><p>\u2018What happened?\u2019</p><br/><p>While Park Suji was contemplating the different possibilities, Choi Sulyeon was watching a video in her room.</p><br/><p>Not even a day had passed since the video came out, yet the views were in 6 digits. The first digit was a 6, even. By this time tomorrow, the numbers would undoubtedly be at 7 digits league. </p><br/><p>Watching the video, Choi Sulyeon\u2019s expression was stiff. She didn\u2019t even wipe the salad dressing on the corner of her mouth, as she watched the 11-minute video on a loop. A scene of someone soloing a never-before-seen boss monster. She engraved each and every one of his movements in her brain. </p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until she had watched the video 6 full times that she finally pulled her eyes away. Over an hour had passed since she started watching, and Choi Sulyeon murmured softly.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 no matter what, I\u2019m going to make him mine.\u201d</p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

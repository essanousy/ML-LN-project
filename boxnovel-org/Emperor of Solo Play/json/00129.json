The White-eyed Knight looked awe-inspiring as it looked at Hyrkan. \u00a0Hyrkan also looked awe-inspiring as he looked at the White-eyed knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had always wanted to create this scene.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan wanted to be the only one fighting against Argardo. He had dreamed about getting all the glory and benefits from this fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had achieved what he had always wanted, yet Hyrkan wasn't feeling that great.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was he feeling \u00a0the pressure of meeting an indescribably powerful enemy? \u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course not.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he was someone that wilted under pressure, he wouldn't have sought out the Red Bulls guild to set up a 1on1 stage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He liked this stage. \u00a0It didn't matter if he won or lost. \u00a0This was the stage he had always pined for.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What he didn't like was the path he had to take to get to this stage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chev had given Hyrkan a proposal as they shook hands. \u00a0Instead of a 1on1 battle, he wanted Hyrkan to work together with them on the Argardo Raid. \u00a0It was a very reasonable and logical proposal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, when he received that proposal, his worthless pride that he had wanted to protect cracked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018My pride really isn't worth anything, but I can't bring myself to do that.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One could call it a moral victory. Maybe it was a form of self-pity. \u00a0He couldn't dispute it if someone said his reasonings were fallacious. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan wanted to fight Argardo by himself. \u00a0He didn't want any help from one of the 30 great guilds during the battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I get beat, then it was meant to be. \u00a0It was fated.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The death would be his comeuppance, yet at the same time, it would feel lame if he died. Since he had reached this point, he had to win. He had to make a pathetic deal to be able to get on this stage, yet if he couldn't do anything here, the embarrassment he would feel wouldn\u2019t allow him to put on his Hahoe Mask again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In an instant, Hyrkan swallowed all the emotions he felt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was time to focus on the battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The opponent in front of his eyes was the second strongest NPC one could fight right now. \u00a0The first was the Blacksmith Olf.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">With such an enemy in front of him, he wouldn't let the idle thoughts and remorse shackle his ankles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan pulled out his sword. \u00a0If one pulled out one's sword in front of a knight, it disclosed one's hostility towards the knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Argardo didn't have to unsheathe its sword, so it immediately closed the distance between it and Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sound of a harsh clanging of metal rang out. \u00a0It was the first greeting between the two.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the greeting continued.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sound of steel and bodies hitting each other was heard. \u00a0At time, there was the sound of the air being split, but it was mostly a sound induced by Argardo on purpose. \u00a0For the most part, Hyrkan didn't dodge the attacks. \u00a0He met them head on. There was a great amount of force felt by Hyrkan every time they clashed. \u00a0However, it wasn't as if there wasn't an underlying reason why he was doing this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There is a big difference in Stats between us.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was getting a measure of his enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When fighting a large monster, there's no User that is boorish enough to get into a battle of strength with it. However, it was a different story when fighting an NPC. Even if one wasn't engaging in a battle of strength, one had to get a rough measure of one's opponent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What level of speed, power and reflex did the NPC have? \u00a0Moreover, what level of AI did it possess? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If you know your enemy and yourself, you can win every battle. It wasn't some profound truth, but one couldn't ignore it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, a skilled User like Hyrkan could measure his opponent in about one minute.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was strong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was almost at a level where he was almost unable to fight against it in terms of strength.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Hyrkan was satisfied with his choice of weapon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018As expected, Ivan was a better choice than the Black Cobra King.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, Hyrkan was using the Ivan's Sword as his weapon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ivan had been a member of the Secret Society. \u00a0However, he had been caught by the Immoral Prince's madness. \u00a0He had died in the midst of indescribable pain, and now Hyrkan was using a sword given to him before Ivan\u2019s death . \u00a0He was fighting Ivan's enemy with it. \u00a0It was incredibly dramatic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this wasn't the only reason why he had picked the Ivan's Sword. Of course, Ivan's Sword was inferior in terms of damage and offensive ability compared to the Cobalt King Sword. \u00a0However, it had a No Destruction Option. It couldn't be destroyed. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I had the Black Cobalt King, it would have been totally smashed during the testing-out phase. As expected, the Crying Sword is annoying.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When facing Argardo, it was mandatory to have an Item with a No Destruction Option. The Special Option on Argardo's Crying Sword was Break. It accelerated the destruction of weapons and armors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, Ivan's Sword had another useful Option.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaste!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Item had a C Rank Haste Skill available as an Option.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan decided to use that Option at that moment. Naturally, the speed of the battle caught fire. The gap between each sound of steel ringing out decreased. \u00a0Of course, as the gap decreased, the margin of error decreased. \u00a0Hyrkan and Argardo didn't have the luxury to pay attention to their surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Let's do this properly.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was afforded a moment where he was able to summon the Skeleton Knight. \u00a0It appeared fully equipped with its Bone Armor and Madness Helm on.</span></p><br/><p>14.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While the guild members of Red Bulls were cleaning up the remnants of the Corrupted army, Chev was watching the battle between Argardo and Hyrkan. He had to direct the battle, but he was neglecting his duties. However, there were no looks of condemnation directed towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018As expected of the Hahoe mask.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was worth watching the battle between the Hahoe Mask and Argardo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The pincer attack between the Skeleton Knight and the Hahoe Mask was surprising. \u00a0The Skeleton Knight's AI was astounding in itself, but Hahoe Mask was in perfect sync with the Skeleton's Battle AI. \u00a0Hahoe Mask's battle sense was astonishing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The method on how Hahoe Mask grew his Skeleton underlings had been mostly figured out, but...\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The secret behind the outstanding Battle AI of the Skeleton Warriors possessed by the Hahoe Mask had already been mostly revealed. The Hahoe Mask's Skeletons didn't follow the conventional method of Defend First and Attack After. \u00a0The Skeletons had learned the method of Evade First, and Attack After. \u00a0It had learned how to evade. \u00a0If one looked at Hahoe Mask's Character Growth Style, one could pretty much deduce some of the answers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018However, no one can fight like the Hahoe Mask.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if one was able to train the Skeleton underlings like the Hahoe Mask, it was impossible to fight like him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This battle was the proof.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, this tag team approach from the Hahoe Mask and Skeleton Knight wasn't producing any result.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason why Chev's eyes narrowed as he watched the battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It'll be useless to summon additional Skeletons.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, the Hahoe Mask had only summoned his Skeleton Knight. If one considered the over 20 Skeleton Warriors and Golem he could summon, the Hahoe Mask had a very powerful force at his disposable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, even if he did summon the rest, it would be meaningless in this battle. \u00a0This wasn't only true for the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0Even if other Users attacked Argardo together, only two or maybe three would be able to attack it at once. \u00a0It was impossible to send more into the fight even if one wanted to.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if Users clung to Argardo, it was hard to achieve any result. Argardo didn't take any damage from physical or magical attacks. \u00a0In front of Argardo, Hyrkan and the Skeleton Knight could make sounds of attack, but there was no traces left behind on Argardo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, Argardo's Crying Sword was slowly leaving its mark on the body of the Hahoe Mask and the Skeleton Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If time passed as is, the result was obvious to see.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Hahoe Mask will use his winning move now.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the Hahoe Mask had something planned, he would have to do it now. \u00a0This was why Chev narrowed his eyes as he watched the battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Argardo's Sword pierced through the Hahoe Mask's stomach, and it exited through his back. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When everyone saw this sight, they let out a sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, Chev's eyes narrowed further.</span></p><br/><p>15.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The first one to kneel in this ceaseless battle was the Skeleton Knight. \u00a0Argardo's sword severed the Skeleton Knight's two knees at the same time. \u00a0No matter how great the Skeleton Knight is, it couldn't continue to battle without its legs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Knight had fallen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Argardo and Hyrkan once again looked at each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan suddenly shifted his left arm in mid-air. It was a clear crack in his defense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Swheeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Argardo didn't miss the opportunity. \u00a0It narrowed the distance as it aimed its sword towards Hyrkan's stomach.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was using Bone Armor, Items and Passive skills like Skin Sewing. \u00a0His defense was incredible, but the combination of the Crying Sword's attack stats and its Special Option ruthlessly ignored everything in its path.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-jeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His armor was pierced.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pooh-oohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The flesh of Hyrkan's belly was pierced.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-jeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Crying Sword exited the stomach, and it once again pierced through the armor and Bone Armor on the other side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hand holding the sword was so close to Hyrkan's stomach that there was barely any distance between them. \u00a0It was that deep of an attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan had a smile on his face. \u00a0As he smiled, Hyrkan hugged Argardo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, Hyrkan used that brief moment to change the scattered Skeleton Fragments into Skeleton Warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After they formed, it could be seen that they weren't holding any weapons. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were barehanded. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this didn't mean they couldn't attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Hyrkan was impaled on Argardo's sword, he continued to hug Argardo as he flicked his finger. \u00a0At that moment, the Skeleton Warriors ran in towards Argardo empty handed. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During all of this, Argardo wasn't struggling to escape from Hyrkan's grasp. \u00a0Instead it kept moving the sword that was piercing Hyrkan's stomach.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Invincible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Argardo couldn't be damaged by anything, so it didn't have to pay attention to the new beings that was showing hostility towards him. \u00a0In the end, Hyrkan was controlling the Skeletons, so it just needed to kill Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan didn't easily show signs of weakness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a reason why.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I finally benefit from the Life Vessel.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Life Vessel was a Body Modification skill that drastically increased one's health.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Life Vessel wasn't a heal-all remedy. \u00a0If the situation remained the same, Hyrkan would eventually die.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was almost time to end this exchange.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a flash, four Skeleton Warriors got close to Argardo. \u00a0Their hands held nothing except the bones that composed their hands, and they started pounding on Argardo's armor. \u00a0Then they grabbed his armor as if they were about to pull it apart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Argardo still ignored the Skeleton Warriors, and it put more strength into the sword piercing Hyrkan's belly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Choo-roong, choo-roohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Crying Sword let out a cry as if it was happy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment... </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-ah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A thunderous roar engulfed Hyrkan and everything near him. \u00a0It engulfed Hyrkan, Agardo and even the Skeleton Warriors!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying the explosion, a black liquid spread out as it covered Hyrkan and Agardo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Argardo was effected by the Black Sap.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It was exposed to the Black Sap. Your opponent's HP will decrease.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two Announcement tickled Hyrkan's eardrums.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of it all, it seemed Argardo must have realized something was wrong. Argardo kicked him as it distanced itself from Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pooh-hwaht! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the process, the sword was roughly pulled out of Hyrkan, and the sword grated itself against the wound. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If this was reality, it wouldn't have been strange for Hyrkan to let out a scream. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan spoke in a low voice as he smiled instead of letting out a scream. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSlot on.\u201d </span></p><br/><p>16.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had only one aim.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Black Sap! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn't matter how impressive one's physical and magical defense was. \u00a0It was useless against the Black Sap's fixed damage done over time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan wasn't the only one, who had come up with this method. The members of the Red Bulls and the Storm Hunters were all wearing Items that would ignore the opponent's defense. \u00a0They were wearing Items that had the Option of causing damage over time. \u00a0They had determined this was the way they'll clear the Argardo raid. \u00a0However, these Items worked only when the Armor came off. \u00a0The Black Sap was different from those Items. \u00a0The Armor Break was unnecessary. \u00a0Argardo's armor was invincible, but it couldn\u2019t keep liquid out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Hyrkan had placed the Skeleton Warriors equipped with the Black Tree set nearby. Then the Skeleton Warriors were detonated using a Bone Explosive. This battle scenario was all put together to achieve this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, if this scenario was carried out, Hyrkan would also be drenched in the Black Sap.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSlot on.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he had prepared the Circlet of Purification and the Skeleton Panda set.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Circlet of Purification is protecting you from the Black Sap.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Black Sap that was covering Hyrkan let out a foul smell before it evaporated into smoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, no smoke emanated from Argardo's body. \u00a0It basically meant that the Black Sap was still there. \u00a0Since the Black Sap was still present, it would continuously drain Argardo's HP. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Black Sap damages at a fixed rate, and if I consider the estimated HP Argardo has.... At the very least, I need 20 minutes.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Agardo had an enormous amount of HP. \u00a0One couldn't expect the Black Sap to produce result in only couple minutes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If his estimates were right, he needed at least 20 minutes. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He'll see the HP bottom out only after that amount of time had passed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of it all, Argardo and any monster in Warlord had a characteristic they had all in common. \u00a0While not in battle, their health regenerated rapidly, and the Abnormal Statuses reset after a certain amount of time. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, Hyrkan had to battle Argardo for several dozen minutes. Moreover, every time the HP is reduced, Argardo would enter into a new phase where its ability and Skills would be used in a terrifying manner. \u00a0Hyrkan had to solo such an opponent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a really long way to go.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if he asked for help, no one would have blamed or disparaged him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan didn't ask for anyone\u2019s help. \u00a0He didn't even intend to buy time by going on defense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Attack is the best form of defense! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Hyrkan had a battle strategy that was well suited to this stage. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While engaged with Argardo, Hyrkan scattered the Skeleton Fragments. \u00a0He had scattered the Skeleton Fragments for neither the Skeleton Warriors nor the Skeleton Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the Skeleton Magicians.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'll finish it with the Waltz.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Corrupted Comrade Ivan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was time for Hyrkan to dance for him.</span></p><br/><p>17.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Waltz. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It sprung Hahoe Mask into super-stardom. \u00a0He once again did the Waltz except the stage was located at the Havanz Castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask displayed his masterful skills as Argardo continued to attack him. \u00a0He was luring Argardo into locations where the Skeleton Magicians were throwing their magic. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the magic didn't cause any damage, but it was sufficient enough to distract Argardo. \u00a0This was a fight against time, and anything that occupied Argardo was worth its weight in gold. \u00a0No, it was more valuable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everything was going well up until that point. \u00a0The viewers watching this footage live was in a fevered pitch. \u00a0They were going nuts. \u00a0Moreover, the live tickets were being continuously sold as the battle continued, and the number of people, who purchased the live tickets, broke through the 2 million mark.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was very rare for people to purchase live tickets during a live broadcast. Moreover, this was the first time anyone had sold hundreds of thousands of live tickets during a broadcast.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a historic event that would last forever in the lore of Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, as the Waltz progressed, the more astute viewer started to furrow their eyebrows. The viewers that didn't like the Hahoe Mask started to smile, and the viewers that liked the Hahoe Mask started to frown.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Hahoe Mask is being pushed back.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In Shir's case, she had no expression on her face. \u00a0She had two feelings... \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had refused her love call, yet he kept answering consecutive love calls from the Red Bulls. \u00a0She felt hatred towards him. \u00a0On the other hand, he was like an expensive jewel that she couldn't have, so she felt an affection for him. \u00a0Shir didn't have the ability to display these two emotions at the same time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways, it had been 7 minutes, since he started the dance. In Shir's opinion, he was starting to waver.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a reason why this was happening.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Argardo had entered its 2nd Phase, and its attacks had changed. \u00a0Its attack speed hadn't changed. \u00a0Instead of speed, its attack style had changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Up until now, Argardo's attack had been very controlled in its attack, and now the attacks were getting rougher.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was trying to dance the Waltz, yet the opponent danced the Tango. Of course, a decent dance wouldn't arise from it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan finally reached the 18 minutes mark, since he started to dance the Waltz. \u00a0It was at this point when Argardo went into its 3rd Phase. It started letting out Sword Energy, and Hyrkan's arm was severed. \u00a0He didn't have time to reattach it. He needed a brief respite, so he summoned the Skeleton Warriors to form a defensive wall. \u00a0However, this defensive wall didn\u2019t even last 10 seconds in front of Argardo's sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Red Bulls isn't stepping forward?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a critical moment. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the Red Bulls stepped forward, this crisis could be resolved into nothing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHatch.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Yes. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat about the Red Bulls?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- They aren't moving. \u00a0Everyone is just watching.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the Red Bulls weren't moving. Shir didn't think this wasn't the will of the Red Bulls.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the Hahoe Mask's will.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had set up the carpet with the help of the Red Bulls, but it seemed he wanted to fight alone on the main stage. \u00a0He was expressing his will to die on the battlefield if it came to it, but he was determine to fight solo. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir thought the Hahoe Mask's will was splendid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He still fought on his own, so he wasn't owned by anyone. \u00a0She was satisfied.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Still, he is in danger.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Shir wordlessly watched Hahoe Mask's crisis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Chev also watched the sight without saying anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShouldn't we help him? \u00a0If we help him, Argardo will be....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chev spoke to his subordinate as he kept his eyes glued to the battlefield. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe doesn't want it, so wouldn't it be absurd if we did step forward? \u00a0Moreover, isn't it best for us to wait for the Hahoe Mask to die?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a \u00a0very cold answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The subordinate, who asked the question, harbored a suspicion. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask was held in the highest regar by Chev. At the same time, he knew Chev was a very fiery guy. \u00a0\u00a0He was someone that had to work on putting the guild\u2019s profit first. \u00a0A man like that wouldn\u2019t give such a cold-hearted answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Does he not like something about the Hahoe Mask?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It meant Chev's feelings had changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The change was centered around the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I really want him, but now that I see him fight... I feel jealous.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chev wanted the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask was like the famed sword stuck in a stone. If one could pull out and own the sword, it basically meant victory and glory would be given to the owner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Chev was filled with jealousy right now as he looked at the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chev wanted to fight like him. \u00a0No, he had fought like Hyrkan in the past. \u00a0It was when the Red Bulls guild was still small, and profit gained by others wasn't dependent on Chev's shoulders and hands. \u00a0Chev had fought like Hyrkan. He had often carried out reckless and foolhardy fights like him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he couldn't do that any more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he felt jealous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Chev was brooding on his jealousy, timed had passed, and the battle was drawing to a close.</span></p><br/><p>18.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It's one thing after another.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he entered into the 3rd Phase, Argardo started to mix in his Sword Energy skill within his attacks. The concept of distance was meaningless now. Hyrkan had to evade even when the sword was swung from a distance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, Argardo's Stats increased by a significant margin after it entered into the 3rd Phase. The Stats it possessed didn't allow for a direct confrontation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the Hahoe Mask discarded the Ivan's Sword. He just focused on dodging all of Argrado's attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One could no longer see the Waltz in Hyrkan's movements. \u00a0He was just struggling to stay alive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018My reaction is slowing.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was another element that was tormenting Hyrkan during all of this. \u00a0It was none other than the drop in his concentration.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was fighting in the battle as he maintained extreme concentration for 20 minutes. \u00a0It was inevitable, but he was reaching his limit. \u00a0He hadn't been in tiptop condition even before the battle had started. If his physical condition deteriorated, it affected his game play. \u00a0Hyrkan noticeably felt his body become dull.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Had I been too optimistic about this situation?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The letters of death and defeat was starting to crystallize within Hyrkan's head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, Hyrkan could imagine all the members of the Red Bulls surrounding him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they helped Hyrkan right now, everything could end in a happily ever after. \u00a0At the very least, he wouldn't have to waste his time as he stared at the ceiling of his one room apartment for the next 48 hours.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bbah-doohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The thought made Hyrkan grind his teeth again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, he didn't like the fact that he was thinking that way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018All right.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The anger sharpened Hyrkan's resolve.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I've died numerous times before, because of my lowly pride. \u00a0There is no reason why I should start becoming afraid now.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan took out his last bastion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Golem Summon! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't use Clay Play. \u00a0He simply summoned his Golem. \u00a0He didn't have time to even use Clay Play.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, Hyrkan hid behind the Golem. Instead of chasing after Hyrkan, Argardo took care of the Golem. \u00a0Argardo raised its hand, and Hyrkan used a Skill. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHardening!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Golem's body turned into stone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, the white eyes within Argardo's helm flashed as it aimed its sword towards the Golem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan stood still behind the Golem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he had said before, the Golem was his final bastion. If the Golem fell, he had nothing to hide behind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Hyrkan didn't have enough energy to fight Argardo again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Argardo somehow had to die or else Hyrkan was fated to die.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If that was the case, he'd rather have the choice in how he would die.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCome at me!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan used all the energy and feeling he had left inside the pit of his stomach to let out a yell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The shout made the hearts of the viewers twitch. \u00a0The words were scrolling up so fast that it was almost impossible to read the chatting window. \u00a0However, at that moment, a brief silence fell over the messy chatting window.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, his yell was like a starting pistol that made Argardo move.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shweeeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Argardo took a big swing towards the Golem, and the enormous Sword Energy cut the Golem diagonally in a flash.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-kwah-kwah! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Sword Energy cut through the Golem, and it even brushed by Hyrkan's side. \u00a0If Hyrkan was a couple feet to the side, Hyrkan's body would have been cut open like the Golem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how the Golem bought Hyrkan several seconds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-goo-goohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Golem fell, the large noise and the smoke that was created bought him several more seconds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, that was it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The final bastion wasn\u2019t really a bastion. \u00a0However, Hyrkan wasn't disappointed. \u00a0Even as the Golem fell, Hyrkan stood still. As the visibility improved, he looked at Argardo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Come at me.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan tightly held his final Bone Explosive in his right hand. He wasn't going to die in a lame way, and he wasn't going to give up. \u00a0If Argardo used its Sword Energy, he was going to evade it then throw the Bone Explosive. \u00a0The Bone Explosive wouldn't cause any damage. \u00a0However, the explosion and smoke would buy him a little bit of time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Attack is the best form of defense.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would give Hyrkan time to close the distance, and he was going to kick Argardo's body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From the beginning, Hyrkan had followed this adage, and there was no reason why he should veer away from it. \u00a0If he wanted to win here, he had to become more aggressive in his attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, if a mistake happened in the process, Hyrkan would be killed in an instant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Come at me.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan squeezed out all this strength, and he regrouped his concentration as he pushed it to the extreme.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You've gained the Title \u2018Defeater of Argardo\u2019.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You've gained the Title 'Hero of the Great Battle'.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he heard the Announcement of the two Titles, it turned everything inside Hyrkan's head white.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

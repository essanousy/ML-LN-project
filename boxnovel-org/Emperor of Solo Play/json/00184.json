\u00a0Everyone is heading towards the Black Continent!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Stormhunters guild had triggered the Barbarian King Event.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Anyways, a middle boss has made its appearance.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had heard about the Barbarian King through the Blacksmith Olf.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This information matched up with the prior knowledge he had. \u00a0Of course, Ahn-jaehyun was well aware of the worth represented by the Barbarian King in the Main Scenario Quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was similar to the Great Battle in the Immoral Prince episode. \u00a0The Immoral Prince episode had led to the Argardo Raid. \u00a0It was a similar concept. \u00a0After killing the Barbarian King, it would lead to the acquisition Quest for the War King\u2019s relics. \u00a0Then one would have to fight the five Powers of the Dragon. \u00a0Afterwards, the only thing left was the final battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Ahn-jaehyun wasn\u2019t worried about that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Stormhunters are faster than me.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, Ahn-jaehyun had received two things from the Blacksmith Olf.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Gold Bar he had acquired was melted by the Blacksmith Olf, and it created a hybrid Item. \u00a0It was a cross between a Golden Conch and a Dragon\u2019s Horn. \u00a0It was the Dragon Horn Conch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I\u2019m not doing so well with the Golden Conch Quests right now\u2026.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had two threads of evidence he could follow, but he wasn\u2019t able to fully take advantage of them. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was the level restriction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One needed to be level 250 to be able to progress in the War King\u2019s Artifact Quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the case of the Dragon Horn Conch, it was impossible to progress in the Quest right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason why the Hahoe Mask was burning money as he continued to hunt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While he was still hunting, the Stormhunters guild had triggered the Barbarian King Event. \u00a0It basically meant that they were couple steps in front of the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Those monsters...\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The surprising part was that they deserved to be called monsters. \u00a0Ahn-jaehyun had no choice, but to acknowledge this fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Stormhunters guild was putting their guild\u2019s full capacity and ability to breaking through to the east. \u00a0In the process, they had suffered considerably. \u00a0Their progress had to be kept secret, so they couldn\u2019t broadcast their achievements. \u00a0Moreover, the skilled Users, who represented the guild, were all devoted to progressing in the Main Scenario Quest. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The biggest money earner on a live channel were the Raid footages. \u00a0This meant their profit took a deep dive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, after the Stormhunters arrived at the Black Continent, the Stormhunters guild\u2019s live chanel was the least profitable channel amongst the 30 great guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A guild with such clout had decided to invest in the Main Scenario Quest, and the result matched their efforts. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Yes, it was like this during that time. \u00a0They were always monsters. \u00a0Che-sulyun was the monster queen.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He still detested the Stormhunters guild. \u00a0His hate had eroded away significantly compared to the time when Kim-dongsoo betrayed him with the Stormhunters guild. \u00a0Still, he didn\u2019t like the Stormhunters guild. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This didn\u2019t mean Ahn-jaehyun would disparage the skill level of the Stormhunters guild. If he wanted to crush them, he had to be cold in how he assessed them. \u00a0He had to be cold. \u00a0He had to leave behind his personal feelings and private affairs. \u00a0When he looked at the Stormhunters with an objective eye, they were an awesome guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were playing this game properly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While the other guilds were focusing on personal gains, profits and popularity, they were focused on the game itself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This damned ill-fated relationship. \u00a0Damn it to hell.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun sipped his coffee. \u00a0As he sipped his coffee, he spoke towards his own pride.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018You are an expensive bastard.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun complained about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He complained about it, but he didn\u2019t regret his actions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Which position shall I take? \u00a0What\u2019s my best option?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun continued to coldly assess the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Since the Barbarian King has made its appearance, the Black Continent will become a mess.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since the Barbarian King Event had already been triggered, the Barbarian King would start to run amok across the Black Continent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is an impossible task.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Obviously, the regular Users and the Underfoot guilds wouldn\u2019t be able to take down the Barbarian King. \u00a0In the first place, the game\u2019s pace was overclocked. \u00a0There was no way the normal Users would be able to follow the pace of the high rank Users. \u00a0How would they be able to face a monster that would \u00a0be troublesome for these high rank Users?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The problem isn\u2019t when they\u2019ll beat it. \u00a0There is a good chance that they\u2019ll get pushed back.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the 30 great guilds as a whole didn\u2019t control this event, the Black Continent will be lost.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In reality, there was only a single checkpoint inside the Black Continent. \u00a0It was the Heard Fortress ruin town.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What would happen if the Heard Fortress ruin town was overrun? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Iron Lion Road was discovered, but it\u2019ll become very troublesome to cross the Urugal mountain range after every death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018From the Main Scenario Quest Info, this Barbarian King has the Power of Storm at its disposal.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Power of Storm was an additional feature.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From Ahn-jaehyun\u2019s memories, the Barbarian King had been a terrifying monster even without the Power of Storm. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What would happen if this monster was now capable of using the Power of Storm?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, Ahn-jaehyun couldn\u2019t even imagine a clear method that could be used against the Barbarian King. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he couldn\u2019t imagine it, how could any other User in Warlord come up with one?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no way they\u2019ll be able to come up with one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Is this the season 2 of the Great Battle?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the ones holding the key was the 30 great guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was akin to the time during the great battle. \u00a0They held the fate of the Black Continent, and there was a chance that the Black Continent could revert back to its previous state. \u00a0The level 220 and up hunting grounds were all located within the Black Continent. \u00a0If the Black Continent became a region inaccessible by Users, the Level Up pace would drop significantly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hahoe Mask would be able to hunt there. \u00a0It would be more arduous, but it was possible for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Hmmm.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why his course of action was clear this time around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The answer is to not even attempt this. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He\u2019ll sit this one out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First, the 30 great guilds held the key to this event. \u00a0If the Hahoe Mask participated in the event, the Big Smiles guild and others wouldn\u2019t look kindly at his actions. \u00a0Their eyes would focus on him. \u00a0They\u2019ll make a big fuss about catching the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, even if the Barbarian King took down the entirety of the Black Continent, the Hahoe Mask could still hunt in any location he wanted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was an independent. \u00a0Hahoe Mask could travel anywhere, and he could solo anything. \u00a0\u00a0He had matured as a Necromancer, and it gave him the power to solo. \u00a0He was an All-Strength Necromancer. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the Black Continent turned into being the true Black Continent, Hahoe Mask\u2019s competitors would be weeded out through natural selection. \u00a0This would be the best case scenario for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the cream of the Barbarian King Event was the Barbarian King. \u00a0He could just show up when the Barbarian King Raid started. \u00a0He could just show up to eat the kernel by bypassing the outer shell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The most logical choice he could make was to not attend this event. \u00a0He could weigh the advantages and disadvantages several hundred to several thousand times. \u00a0However, this course of action always came out as being the most profitable. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t close.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was only one factor that interfered with him taking the wise choice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to take a backseat in such a large event\u2026. \u00a0This doesn\u2019t feel too great.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t like the choice he would have to make.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If the Hahoe Mask did something the 30 great guilds couldn\u2019t do\u2026 \u00a0It would make for a killer narrative. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he had these thoughts, Ahn-jaehyun drank his coffee. \u00a0He once again spoke towards his pride.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018You are a really expensive bastard.\u2019</span></p><br/><p>3.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease call me Horus.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou can call me Hatch.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Horus and Hatch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They only knew each other by name. \u00a0They both raised their hand, and they naturally shook each other\u2019s hand. \u00a0They pumped their hands twice, but after the handshake ended, they continued to clasp hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch had relaxed his hand, but Horus continued to grip Hatch\u2019s hand tightly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch patiently looked at Horus. \u00a0Horus smiled as he spoke to Hatch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m speaking to you assuming that you already know what\u2019s going on. \u00a0Of course, our conversation today is off the record.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf I planned to publicize this, it would have already been done. \u00a0If I had any plans of running my mouth, I wouldn\u2019t have shown up here.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Horus finally let go of Hatch\u2019s hand. \u00a0Hatch lightly moved his hand, which had participated in the handshake. \u00a0He checked if his hand was damaged.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ve heard about you. \u00a0You are someone like a father to Warlord.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The words were just put out there, and Hatch answered in a calm manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf that is true, there are about 100 fathers and 100 mothers. \u00a0I don\u2019t think it is prudent to call me the father. \u00a0I only designed what is considered to be akin to the pinky nail of Warlord.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen you know the worth of Warlord. \u00a0Of course, you know about it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhen the Main Scenario Quest lifespan is extended by a year, Tobi Gwynn\u2019s personal wealth increases by 16%. \u00a0I\u2019m well aware of the fact that Tobot Soft\u2019s stock also increases by 23%.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch finally lost interest in inspecting his hand. \u00a0He looked at Horus.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI know the next project needs about 2 years to complete. \u00a0I know you guys have a contract with the Tobot Soft, and the contract will give you stock options. \u00a0However, there was a condition that had to be fulfilled before you can exercise your stock option.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Horus nodded his head instead of answering Hatch. \u00a0It was hard to tell if he was agreeing or disagreeing with Hatch. \u00a0It was hard to decipher the meaning behind the gesture.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Horus stopped nodding his head, and he changed the topic of the conversation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt seems you know about everything. \u00a0All right. Let\u2019s talk. \u00a0We want to extend the shelf life of this game.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWouldn\u2019t the shelf life of Warlord be fine as long as Tobot Soft doesn\u2019t pull its service? \u00a0When the Main Scenario Quest ends, it\u2019ll turn into normal mode. \u00a0From that point, the game developers can work on the game. \u00a0Wouldn\u2019t that be preferable? \u00a0They could set up events that they couldn\u2019t set up before.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you really think that is true?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess if such a thing happens, there are other new games with great reviews that one could try. \u00a0There is a recently released game called Play the World\u2026. \u00a0I looked at it once, and I thought it was pretty well made.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat game has a bad naming sense.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis game is named Warlord, so a name like that could be forgiven. \u00a0Moreover, that game doesn\u2019t have monsters like the Hahoe Mask playing it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Horus shut his mouth at the talk of the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0One could see his brows slightly furrow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unlike before, Hatch could read his emotions through his expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That damned Hahoe Mask bastard! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch understood what Horus\u2019 expression was saying. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If it wasn\u2019t for the Hahoe Mask, Horus wouldn\u2019t have to be a tool for the Tobot Soft. \u00a0He wouldn\u2019t have to do perform such ridiculous tasks. \u00a0He would have been able to live out his life in comfort. \u00a0He would have had so much money that he wouldn\u2019t have been able to spend it in his lifetime.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of that, Tobo Soft\u2019s next project would have received the popularity of Warlord. \u00a0The next project would have achieved a bigger success than Warlord. \u00a0For helping out Tobot Soft, the Hands guild members would have also received complete support in their next game. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, all of this fell into pieces when a single User named the Hahoe Mask appeared out of nowhere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Hatch was in Horus\u2019 shoes, he would have use every method and tricks to eliminate the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was also one of the reason why Horus had come out to meet Hatch. \u00a0Currently, Horus and Tobo Soft decided to use every methods and tricks available to them. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s frustrating. \u00a0If you could intervene in the game, you could immediately limit his effectiveness. \u00a0However, you can only intervene if the Main Scenario Quest is done\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0However, who could have have predicted this?

</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a large sound was heard, and an earthquake could be felt. \u00a0The ground started to crack, so everyone decided to retreat for now. \u00a0The ground cracked as it sunk. \u00a0An enormous snake erupted out of the ground when everyone was clear of the stone monument. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan, who had pretty much experienced everything within this game, dumbly stared at the majestic mammoth of a snake. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The snake quickly disappeared back into the ground as soon as it appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since then, the situation remained the same.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m sure of it. \u00a0The Gem Conch wants us to go in there.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone wanted Whistling to listen to the Gem Conch again. \u00a0For reference, this was the seventh time they had asked him to do this. \u00a0Still, Whistling hadn\u2019t kept count, but he continued to put the Gem Conch to his ear. \u00a0Whistling was also dazed at what had just happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh whew.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan let out a long sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is nuts.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t as if the situation was totally unbelievable. \u00a0This was a game. \u00a0The large snake had appeared, and it had made a hole. \u00a0The hole led to some other location. \u00a0This wasn\u2019t out of the realm of possibility of what one would face in a game. \u00a0It was actually a very cool setting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If that snake is the boss monster\u2026. \u00a0Will I be able to kill it?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem arose if they would have to kill the large snake from earlier. \u00a0This particular game was sadistic enough to make them confront and kill the snake. \u00a0At that point, this would turn from being a cool setting to being a horrible setting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even Hyrkan couldn\u2019t imagine himself fighting this snake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why everyone had a vacant expression on their faces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll go in first.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling was able to somewhat pull himself together, so he volunteered to be the sacrificial lamb. \u00a0Hyrkan turned to look at Whistling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis hole isn\u2019t an Instance Dungeon. One person can go scout and come back. \u00a0If there is a problem, one could run back here.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0Then I\u2019ll go in first.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo way. \u00a0I should go in. \u00a0A Crusader has a higher chance of surviving.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yojori and Joba was finally able to open their mouths, and they each offered to be the sacrificial lamb. \u00a0They spoke about it as if it was their duty.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, the Hahoe Mask acted different from them. \u00a0He became surprised at their words, and at the same time, he fell into a dilemma.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was afraid. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He calculated the cost associated with his Game Over. \u00a0He used simplified figures for his calculations. \u00a0When he arrived at a figure, he clamped his mouth shut.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t like the number he had arrived at, \u00a0and at the same time, he didn\u2019t like the fact that he was weighing only his own interests.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018When did I\u2026..\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hero Slaughterer didn\u2019t use to make such calculations. \u00a0The only thing the Hero Slaughterer \u00a0cared about was whether he was going to kill an opponent or not. \u00a0His calculations revolved around the methods needed to kill the ones that deserved to be killed. \u00a0That was it. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan let out a long sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf we are set on this plan, I\u2019ll go in.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The three of them reacted to his words. \u00a0Before they could speak, Hyrkan gave an explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEven if a lesser monster comes out, the only one that could defeat it would be me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was right. \u00a0If it wasn\u2019t for him, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to reach this location. \u00a0The Red Desert was a burdensome stage even for Hyrkan. \u00a0If a goblin appeared here, the three of them would be hard pressed to kill it. \u00a0This game was like that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At his words, the three Users nodded their heads.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen we can all go in together.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYeah. \u00a0We can do that.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of giving an answer, Whistling turned to look at Hyrkan. \u00a0Hyrkan was still thinking over the decision.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It isn\u2019t an Instant Dungeon\u2026 \u00a0If things go sideway, we can run away. \u00a0Yes, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. \u00a0I\u2019ll just use the Golems to buy time. \u00a0If we keep a sharp mind, we\u2019ll be able to survive even if we all go into the tiger\u2019s cave.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling looked at Hyrkan as his eyes became bleary.</span></p><br/><p>11.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You\u2019ve enter the Den of the Rebels.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You\u2019ve acquired the title

style=\"\">[You\u2019ve acquired the title \u2018One who saw the Mirage Snake\u2019.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Mirage Snake had made this large hole, and the four Users slid down the tunnel like a water slide. \u00a0They were instantly greeted with three presents. \u00a0Three out of the four Users immediately marvelled at what they had received.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRebels\u2026. \u00a0It sounds nice.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf this is the Den of the Rebel, then the Quest Man was correct. \u00a0This scenario is set up as he had predicted.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t care about that. \u00a0I just want Elves to come out and greet me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCrazy son of a bitch.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEven I think my words were a little bit too much. \u00a0Anyways, the Mirage Snake\u2026 \u00a0Wasn\u2019t it awesome?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI agree. \u00a0A large snake made this tunnel. \u00a0It was very cool.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, the remaining User was unlatching his wristwatch instead of looking over his presents.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Item Slot Change Mode is unavailable now.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He gripped the wrist watch, which he had slipped off. \u00a0A darkness flowed out from the wristwatch to make a door.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Death Knight was Summoned.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A Death Knight appeared within the dark tunnel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Special Skill \u2018Commander\u2019 was activated.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nine Skeleton Warriors, two Skeleton Magicians and a Skeleton Knight appeared alongside the Death Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Bone Armor was summoned.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Madness Helm was summoned.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if the summoning wasn\u2019t enough, all kinds of Skills armed the Skeleton unit again. The Bone Armor surrounded the Skeletons, and a horn grew on their heads. \u00a0Moreover, all kinds of Curses was added on to their weapons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Life Vessel was activated.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the end, Hyrkan activated the Life Vessel Skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He optimized himself for survival, and when he finished all his preparations, he was prepared to slip into his fighting mode at any moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His sigh came out as if to harden his resolve.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0Let\u2019s move.\u201d</span></p><br/><p>12.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knight rode the Skeleton Steed as it took the lead. \u00a0The Skeleton Knight, Warriors. and Magicians followed behind it. \u00a0Hyrkan\u2019s group was in the rear. \u00a0It was an exaggeration to say that they were in the rear. \u00a0Hyrkan\u2019s party was as far as they could be with the Death Knight and its cohort.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The distance between the two groups was quite large.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan wasn\u2019t satisfied even after putting that much distance with the advance group. \u00a0He kept vigilant of his surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was actually too vigilant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ll lead from the front.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was so bad that Yojori and Joba stepped forward to intervene.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is too dangerous.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAt worst, we\u2019ll die. \u00a0We can live with that.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From their perspective, Hyrkan was being overly cautious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They didn\u2019t enjoy a Game Over, but from their perspective, they were willing to risk a Game Over if needed. \u00a0It was an option they were willing to choose.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, Hyrkan valued survival over everything else, and he acted accordingly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan\u2019s vigilance was eating away at their time. \u00a0Up until now, Hyrkan had moved at break speed when he committed to fighting. \u00a0However, Hyrkan was now moving at the slowest speed setting that could be travelled by the Skeleton army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why they moved only 3 kilometers, yet it took them an hour.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the tunnel made one feel ashamed for being so vigilant. \u00a0It was called the Den of the Rebels, but until they found the ruined underground city, they hadn\u2019t run across anything dangerous. \u00a0Not a single battle was fought.. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is amazing.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is it? \u00a0Where is the light coming from?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere. \u00a0I think something is over there. \u00a0The ceiling is really high. \u00a0Isn\u2019t this as big as a domed baseball stadium?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnexpectedly, this place is pretty clean. \u00a0I have a hard time calling it a ruin. \u00a0I don\u2019t think this place suffered any attacks. \u00a0It was just abandoned.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the underground city was found, Yojori and Joba couldn't hold themselves back. \u00a0They started running around to satisfy their curiosity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, Hyrkan was still tense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Where is it?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had basically followed a path left behind by the snake. \u00a0He got ready to fight a battle with the snake. \u00a0It might occur at any moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Where did it go?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling intruded into the feeling of tenseness felt by Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMaybe, this is because I haven\u2019t seen you in awhile. \u00a0However, you are really make this game boring.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan replied reflexively. \u00a0Hyrkan\u2019s question held a sharp edge to it. \u00a0However, Whistling wasn\u2019t someone, who would back down, because he heard some sharp words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhen we met last time, you grumbled a lot, but you seemed to be enjoying yourself playing this game.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of giving an immediate answer, Whistling thought over his answer. \u00a0He organized his thoughts and feelings he had, since he met up with Hyrkan for this Quest. \u00a0After he thought through everything, he gave his answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEach person has their own reason for playing this game, and I don\u2019t care what that reason is. \u00a0However, one\u2019s action should match one\u2019s motivation to play this game.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a bit of an exaggeration, but Whistling had seen the Hahoe Mask as a gamer sent by the gods. \u00a0He was a warrior sent by the gods to see if he could reach the end of Warlord. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was akin to a warrior of a god! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In reality, Hyrkan created results that far exceeded his talents. \u00a0He didn\u2019t give up when confronted with difficulties. \u00a0If there was a dead end, he used all methods available to him to pave a path forward. \u00a0Even if it was a battle considered to be impossible, he put his life on the line to drag himself to victory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahoe Mask was that kind of a User. \u00a0The battle footages that was popular on youtube was the evidence. \u00a0He could just order his powerful Skeleton Underlings to do everything, yet he didn\u2019t hesitate to throw himself into the mix even at the risk to himself. \u00a0He led from the front to bring about victory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even though he was the Hahoe Mask, he hadn\u2019t shown any aversion for the possibility of a Game Over. \u00a0He hadn\u2019t shown fear of the risk that came with a Game Over. \u00a0If one looked at the footages of the Hahoe Mask, he had always believed what he did was worth the risk of a Game Over. \u00a0He fought despite the risks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the current Hahoe Mask was different from the one from before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a difference\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0Others couldn\u2019t tell the difference. \u00a0However, Whistling had the closest seat in viewing Hyrkan from before and after the change. \u00a0Moreover, he considered himself to be a friend of Hyrkan, so Whistling was aware of this change.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf your aim is to earn money, you should act as if this is a business. \u00a0You should play as if you are playing for the audiences that\u2019ll give you money.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since Whistling thought of Hyrkan as a friend, he brought up this subject.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf your goal is to achieve the highest level, you should play the game more efficiently. \u00a0You shouldn\u2019t be here. \u00a0You should kill Wood Devils or monsters of that ilk to give it your all in leveling up. \u00a0If you want to become famous, you should do something controversial. \u00a0You can challenge one of the 30 great guilds.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling thought of Hyrkan as a friend. \u00a0He had thought he had made an amazing friend in an amazing world within a game!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you are aiming to complete the Main Scenario Quest, you should adjust your attitude accordingly.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he didn\u2019t think of Hyrkan as a friend, Whistling wouldn\u2019t have spoken this many words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan didn\u2019t even let out a sigh at Whistling\u2019s words. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan felt conflicted. \u00a0Whistling left Hyrkan alone. \u00a0He didn\u2019t want to pile on more stuff on top of an already conflicted Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The thoughts that weighed upon Hyrkan\u2019s mind deepened.</span></p><br/><p>13.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There had been no battles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There had been no enemies inside the Den of Rebels. \u00a0There were no allies either. \u00a0It was just a remnant left behind by the distant past. \u00a0Hyrkan\u2019s party used the Gem Conch to find the Artifacts left behind by the owner of the Den of Rebels.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ve located the boxes. \u00a0There are three of them.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a grave made out of rocks within the underground city. \u00a0Underneath the stone grave, three boxes were found. \u00a0They found a red, black and green colored boxes. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The red box had one scroll, and the black box held three scrolls. \u00a0The green box couldn\u2019t be opened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo this is it?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0I\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling\u2019s party immediately guessed what was within the green box.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt probably holds a Record Tree seed. \u00a0I\u2019ve seen similar boxes near the Record Tree.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is an amazing Artifact.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Whistling took the green box, Whistling and his party heard a Quest Announcement. \u00a0Their Quest Content had just changed. \u00a0They had to deliver the green box to the Red Elves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, Hyrkan\u2019s Quest Content didn\u2019t change at all. \u00a0There were no new System Announcement. \u00a0Unlike his expectation, his Elven Kingdom\u2019s Artifact was elsewhere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan didn\u2019t get discouraged. \u00a0He didn\u2019t throw a tantrum. \u00a0He just looked at his surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It\u2019s clean.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He looked at the unblemished Bone Armor on his Skeletons. \u00a0When he saw this sight, he felt silly for being worried, tense, and wary. \u00a0These emotions had been sucking his blood dry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His actions up until now looked ridiculous in hindsight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I was a scaredy-cat.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had flopped around like a scared coward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling was right.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he returned to the past, he had prior knowledge, which allowed him to gain rewards. \u00a0These rewards were set in stone, and he had nothing to lose. \u00a0This certainty was the reason why he had thrown himself at every obstacles he encountered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this wasn\u2019t true any more. \u00a0Everything he faced was shrouded by the unknown, and he had a lot to lose now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the past, he always walked on that fine line where a slip up would result in a Game Over. \u00a0He had enjoyed walking this fine line within this game. \u00a0Now he was avoiding such situations at all cost. \u00a0He was only filled with wariness now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I thought it was bullshit when people said a person\u2019s position maketh the man. \u00a0Jeez\u2026.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been in self-denial.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why did Hyrkan become a Necromancer? \u00a0Did he

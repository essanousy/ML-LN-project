Natal didn't hesitate at all as he moved his feet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Corrupted Centaurs wore full armor that made them look more knightly than most knights. \u00a0Sohank didn't show any hesitations as he faced 10 Corrupted Centaurs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Even if I die, it'll only be for 48hrs. \u00a0Let's do this!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of running away, Sohank used his Charge skill to run towards the approaching group of Centaurs. \u00a0Sohank was charging like a mad bull, and he used Body Slam to send the leading Centaur flying. \u00a0The Centaur was 4 meters long, and it was 3 meters in height. The massive body of the Centaur was thrown backwards just like that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, the Centaur closest to Sohank thrust its spear accurately towards Sohank's head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shweeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sound of destruction coming towards him was frightening.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggahhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sohank's response to the sound of destruction was to use the Heading skill. \u00a0Instead of avoiding the spear coming towards his head, he used Heading to deflect the attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was inelegant, but the result was indisputable. \u00a0The spear bounced off his head, and the Centaur showed an opening. \u00a0Sohank didn't miss capitalizing on the opening that was created. Several skills were stacked on the sword, and Sohank swung it towards the Centaur's forelegs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sohank's sword strike broke both its forelegs. When the Centaur lost its use of its forelegs, it fell over. \u00a0Sohank punched the fallen Centaur's head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggwahhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a single punch, but the Centaur\u2019s body shook uncontrollably as it lay on the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a level 170 Unique Skill exclusive to the Fighter class. \u00a0It was called Concussion Punch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The skill had the powerful effect of causing a Stun status, and the skill was worth its price. \u00a0It was such an expensive skill that one had a hard time acquiring it even if one had money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Sohank possessed a skill that was more expensive than the Concussion Punch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAwooooo!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A wolf's cry exploded forth from Sohank's mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Howling! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a level 190 Unique Skill exclusive to the Fighter class. It was the last skill one could get as a Fighter Class, who had gone through only the 1st Advancement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had the effect of adding an additional 10% damage to the monsters in the surrounding for a limited amount of time! It also reduced the damage the User took by 10%!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, it gave the Fear effect to the surrounding monsters. \u00a0It also had secondary Option of pulling the aggro.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, there were only two Fighter class Users in Warlord who possessed this skill. \u00a0The skill was possessed by the First One Sulwoo, and the Second Head Sohank. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several Corrupted Centaurs had ignored Sohank as they were about to chase after Natal, who was running away with Bagel on his back. \u00a0The Howling had the effect of focusing all the attention of the Corrupted Centaur on him. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a flash, Sohank was surrounded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sohank laughed at his own situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Mission complete.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sohank's role was to make sure there were no pursuers following after Natal. \u00a0Natal understood this fact, so he immediately stopped running. \u00a0He checked up on Bagel's condition.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you ok, Bagel-nim?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When meeting with Prince Dean, Bagel had observed decorum as he took off the heavy armor he always wore. \u00a0Instead, \u00a0Bagel had worn luxurious clothes one might see on an entertainer. \u00a0However, Prince Dean wasn't there to greet Bagel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm all right. I avoided the critical blow.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStill, you are bleeding heavily.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf such a flesh wound could kill me, someone else would have already taken my place as the caretaker of the Terube castle walls by now. \u00a0Moreover, I refuse to die by Agardo's hands.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sir Agardo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was a blonde haired knight, who was known as the left hand of Prince Dean. \u00a0He had disguised himself as Prince Dean, and he had been waiting for Bagel. \u00a0Bagel tried to observe etiquette by kneeling on one knee with his head lowered. \u00a0As soon as Bagel was raising his lowered head, a sword stabbed towards Bagel's heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In that brief moment, Bagel avoided the attack. \u00a0As a result, Sir Agardo's sword pierced through Bagel's shoulder instead of his heart. Afterwards, Bagel let out a counterattack, and he was able to escape the room. \u00a0Natal and Sohank had been on standby, and they attempted to escape with Bagel. \u00a0Natal let out a sigh when he exited the castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I was fortunate.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You've earned the Title 'Those who Helped Bagel Escape'.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You've earned the Title 'Bagel's Savior'.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You've earned the Title 'Observer of History'.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the consecutive Announcement rang out in his ears to announce the three titles he had earned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sohank used the Voice Talk to speak to Natal. \u00a0Sohank was far away from Natal now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Natal! Did you also get the Titles? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sohank's voice was still overflowing with energy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow are you faring?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I did well in taking down five of them, but it seems I'll be taken down soon! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even though he was about to die, Sohank's voice was upbeat. \u00a0Sohank was that type of a person. \u00a0If he died, he died. He'll just catch up on dramas he missed for the next 48 hours! \u00a0This was how he played the game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, from the Hyrdra guild's perspective, this trait worried them the most about him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you hold out a little bit longer, the support team will be there!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I don't think I'll be able to hold out any longer. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sohank was Hydra guild's best fighting power. \u00a0The very best Items and Skill Books they gained was given to Sohank first. For the Hyrda guild, he was like a walking treasure box, yet he treated himself without much care. \u00a0This frustrated the other officers of the Hydra guild to no end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit. \u00a0I still need more time until the support team arrives.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sohank and Natal were the only two allowed to participate in the meeting with Bagel and Prince Dean.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, they had prepared a contingency plan. \u00a0There was a support team on standby, but they were a long distance away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As with any business, \u00a0it wasn\u2019t easy for the support team to arrive on time. \u00a0They only moved if something went wrong. \u00a0The support team stayed in place until that actually happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Natal\u2019s calculations were correct, the support team needed 5 minutes until they would be able to arrive near Sohank.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The support team is here! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unlike Natal\u2019s prediction, the support team arrived immediately.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Uh? Why are you guys here so early? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sohank was surprised.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- We received an order from the First Head. \u00a0When Prince Dean insisted on a private meeting with Bagel, we were told to go to the agreed escape route.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou should have told me about it earlier!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Natal yelled out as if he was angry, but there was no signs of anger on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018As expected of our guild, everyone is quick thinking.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had just escaped danger, so there was no reason to feel bad.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat's going on?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Natal looked as if he was talking to himself. \u00a0Of course, Bagel didn't understand what was going on, so Bagel asked Natal a question. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Natal shut his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is nothing. \u00a0I was just talking to myself.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis situation is urgent. \u00a0These facts.... We have to notify the Secret Society.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll inform them.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he said those words, Bagel immediately handed over its Secret Society Ring, and a letter soaked in blood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease deliver this to Ahimbree.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Quest 'Prelude to the Great Battle' has started.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0Of course, I will deliver it to him.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That moment was the start of a new age.</span></p><br/><p>8.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[This is an announcement.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Huh?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Hyrkan connected to the game, an announcement immediately arrived.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What kind of announcement?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were usually two types of announcement. \u00a0The first type was from the creator of Warlord, Tobot Soft, sending out an important announcement. \u00a0The other instance was when there was a change to a currently progressing Quest. If it was an issue regarding an electronic gear, Hyrkan would have known about it before he accessed the game. \u00a0He was one of the numerous Users, who gathered and organized new informations before he connected to the game. This type of information gathering was a basic of basics for those who earn their keep through playing this game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This meant this was an announcement related to a Quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Can it be?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before Hyrkan could check the exact content of the announcement, he already had a hunch on what this was about.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Hyrkan's hunch was right on the money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[NPC Maeung and every quest related to him will be restricted from progressing.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Progress Restricted! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn't just any NPC. \u00a0His progress in the Maeung's Quests was restricted!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Someone stepped on the Prince Dean's tail.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the start to the great battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Who was it? It couldn't be the Storm Hunters, since they were on the same Quest Route as me. \u00a0Was it the Red Bulls? \u00a0Or was it some guild outside of the 3 great guilds?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had his suspicions, but he decided not to act based on his suspicions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't have much time. \u00a0Hyrkan wasn't the only one, who noticed the change. \u00a0A great number of Warlord Users probably realized what was happening, and they'll immediately mobilize.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If everyone suddenly moved at the same time, the person who got up first would beat the traffic jam. \u00a0He had to go meet Maeung before the traffic congestion occurred, and he had to receive the new Quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Hyrkan was running full tilt towards the Bulkas mountain range. He had been waiting for this. \u00a0There would be confusion caused by Maeung's disappearance, and he had the secret note given to him by the Bulkas' Ranger.</span></p><br/><p>9.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a forest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This forest was like the Elven villages. \u00a0Only select Users could enter it. However, Users had come to the circle around the forest like a pack of hyenas.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit! I lost it again!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt seems they are planning on taking everything. \u00a0Isn't this a bit too much?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had come here to eat the scraps, yet they were left to sucking on their thumbs. \u00a0Of course, they vented their frustrations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the people online were also in an uproar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Isn't the Maeung's side incredible? \u00a0Someone caught sight of Ballista and the Storm Princess moving together.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I think all of Red Bulls is moving on towards here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Hahoe Mask! The Hahoe Mask has appeared! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Main Scenario Quest had been progressing on the down low, and this moment was when the front-runners were revealed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This information caused a ruckus, and it was impossible for the user base to stay composed. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Those who carried out the Main Scenario Quests faithfully gathered in one place to fight the Immoral Prince. The atmosphere between them was frigid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even though some of them saw each other on a regular basis, they didn't even give each other a smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the same when Hyrkan appeared. Usually, the reaction to Hyrkan's appearance was quite predictable. \u00a0Usually, the Users became surprised as they conversed with each other or they glared at him with an annoyed expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, everyone was silent as they focused their attention on Hyrkan. They merely registered the Hahoe Mask as a new rival in their minds. Even the Storm Princess, who had been going crazy wanting to beat Hyrkan with her own two hands, was standing still. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What other explanation was needed?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was also acting in a similar fashion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He looked at the noteworthy Users. \u00a0Even though the Stormhunters guild members were present, Hyrkan didn't get angry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It's the Storm Princess and Ballista. Have they started dating? Or did they start dating at a later date?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone just too note of who was present here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They kept their mouth shut as they waited. \u00a0Several more people were joined the pool of rivals. After a brief amount of time, Maeung finally appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPrince Dean has finally revealed his evil influence!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he appeared, Maeung went into a one-sided speech. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t have the time to get into the details.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First, Maeung made sure no one would ask him questions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPrince Dean... No, the Immoral Prince used the power of Corruption to form the Corrupted army. \u00a0Moreover, this army is filled with powerful and scary beings. This horde will move to swallow this world.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Users gathered here had invested a great amount of time, effort and money into the Main Scenario Quests over a several month span. In the end, they were being gathered under the same coat of arms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One would expect them to feel despondent, but no one present here fidgeted from being let down. \u00a0The anxiousness of waiting for a new mission blew away any let down they would have felt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOurs first task is to save the continent from this war!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Users were listening to the speech with serious expressions. \u00a0This was evidence that the Users present weren\u2019t feeling letdown.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFurthermore, our second task is to defeat the Immoral Prince!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Most of the Users had a smile as excitement overtook their expressions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOur third task is is to save the world from the fear caused by the power of Corruption!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Quest 'Great Battle' will start.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn't help, but also be excited.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Oh oh oh!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'll be the protagonist this time.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a scary venture, but at the same time, they were the selected few. \u00a0They\u2019ll be given a chance to open a treasure chests with incredible value. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Who wouldn\u2019t feel excited by such news?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was exactly one person who wasn\u2019t.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah. \u00a0I remember now.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was the only one who didn't have an excited smile on his face. \u00a0His lips turned down as it settle into a frown.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018At the time, the Users ignorantly launched attacks, and it had been quite the spectacle to see them wiped out.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan knew what would happen. \u00a0The great battle that'll start from this point was much more difficult than any battles everyone in this game had experience before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason why Hyrkan was confident in himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'I have good enough odds in this great battle.' </span></p><br/><p>10.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[This will be the start of Warlord's second Main Scenario Quest. \u00a0It is the last chapter of the 'Immoral Prince' chapter!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It is the Great Battle!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Those with the bracelet can participate in the Immoral Prince Raid. \u00a0Let us find out who possesses the bracelets!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Hyrdra guild revealed the identity of the Immoral Prince.

Of course, the portion of the media that focused their topics around Warlord talked about it. \u00a0However, even the media that had been disinterested in the game quickly moved to push out articles related to Warlord. In Japan, the news programs reported on contents relating to the great battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even those who had been disinterested in Warlord were paying more interest now.

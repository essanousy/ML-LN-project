At the same time, the gold colored fur gloves on his hand rolled into a ball.</p><br/><p>\u2018Level 40 Magic Power Switching set for 3,200 gold.\u2019</p><br/><p>When Hyrkan turned his head from the stat window, the hair on the lion head he was wearing fluttered in the air, and when he turned his body, the fake tail on his lion body followed.</p><br/><p>Lion suit.</p><br/><p>This Halloween party costume was the Magic Power Switching set Hyrkan purchased.</p><br/><p>3,200 gold!</p><br/><p>It was rather cheap for a level 40 item set with a decent magic power boosting stat. What hyrkan was wearing was worth more than 4,000 gold.</p><br/><p>Of course, there was a reason that it was so cheap. In fact, Hyrkan\u2019s body was fully displaying the reason.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s cheap, but\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan slowly looked down at his feet. Watching the large hobbit-like lion fur boots, Hyrkan made an awry expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018For some reason, I don\u2019t think it was cheap.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was a fad.</p><br/><p>About 8 months ago, when level 40 players were best of the best, a video made by Ranker class magicians went viral. In it, the level 40+ magicians were wearing animal suits, which resulted in animal suits to trend for a short while. It was the result of people trying all sorts of concepts to get attention.</p><br/><p>However, as always, no trends lasted forever.</p><br/><p>The animal suits created during this time were then shunned by people afterwards. As a result, they ended up selling for much cheaper than other armor with the same stats. After going through owner after owner, the lion suit had now ended up in Hyrkan\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u2018There are too many people trying weird concepts in Warlord. This was worth over 10,000,000 won back then. What a shame.\u2019</p><br/><p>In truth, it was so cheap because the prices had gone down since then. When this suit was first made, the price of a level 40 Magic Power Switching set was enormous. After all, it was used by those who didn\u2019t care about spending large sum of money on gaming.</p><br/><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><br/><p>In any case, it was bad.</p><br/><p>No matter how good its options were, wearing such clothing in hunting grounds would bring nothing but mockery.</p><br/><p>However, this wasn\u2019t the reason Hyrkan was so bitter. What\u2019s worse was that this animal suit was much better than the clothes he had been wearing before. Thanks to this, Hyrkan was once again reminded of how awful and disgusting his old clothes were.</p><br/><p>\u2018When I get my level 50 items, I\u2019m going to have to get better looking clothes even if I lose out on some stats.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then, with his newly bought clothes, Hyrkan made a small vow to himself and set foot towards Churu Castle.</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>Churu Castle.</p><br/><p>Located far away from Bangtz Castle, this castle was smaller than the Figurs Castle or Bangtz Castle that Hyrkan had visited before. If compared, its size was probably a third of either of the castles.</p><br/><p>However, Churu Castle\u2019s atmosphere was vastly different than those of the other two castles. This difference was evident from just the castle gate.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan was wearing the Subjugation Association\u2019s default armor saved onto his 3 item slot. As he passed the castle gate, a few players had caught sight of him and were talking amongst themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, he\u2019s wearing the SA default set\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid he get here by himself? Considering how he\u2019s hiding his item settings, he\u2019s probably quite high leveled.\u201d</p><br/><p>Low whispers. Of course, there was no way for Hyrkan to hear what they were saying. Even so, Hyrkan could tell what they were talking about.</p><br/><p>\u2018Those are eyes of wolves, not hyenas.\u2019</p><br/><p>Churu Castle was founded 7 months ago by the Sweepers Guild, one of the Top 30 Guilds. As such, it was not one of the starting point castles. This meant that there weren\u2019t people staying near the castle gate eyeing for potential newbies to trick. This was reinforced by the fact that there were large amount of level 30+ monsters on the way to the castle.</p><br/><p>Therefore, most people visiting the Churu Castle had fair amount of experience and knowledge. It was only natural that players looked at others differently than they would newbies.</p><br/><p>As for Hyrkan, he enjoyed this feeling.</p><br/><p>\u2018I made it this far.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was a proof.</p><br/><p>\u2018Although I still have quite a way to go, I have the groundwork to catch up to Rankers.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was proof that Hyrkan had grown as he expected.</p><br/><p>Currently in Warlord, those who could call themselves \u2018good gamers\u2019 were between level 50 and 70. The ones like Hyrkan who were prepared to spend their life playing Warlord were above level 80. 1st in the rankings was currently level 109, while 100th was level 101.</p><br/><p>Although it wasn\u2019t easy to catch up to them, Hyrkan\u2019s growth speed was incomparable to anyone else. Those who could reach level 40 in 2 months would only be the highest Ranking players. For this reason, Hyrkan could be confident.</p><br/><p>With a full smile on his face, Hyrkan quickened his pace towards the Subjugation Association branch.</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>[Searching for Migi.]</p><br/><p>-Quest rank: Rare</p><br/><p>\u2013 Quest level range: 40+</p><br/><p>\u2013 Quest content: As per Ahimbree\u2019s orders, find traces of the agent named Migi, and complete the mission he could not. Acquire information on Agent Migi at Churu Castle\u2019s Subjugation Association branch.</p><br/><p>-Quest Reward: 500 gold and additional rewards.</p><br/><p>-Miscellaneous: You will receive a penalty if you do not complete this quest in (29 days 9 hours 33 minutes)</p><br/><p>Checking the content of the quest, Hyrkan let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck.\u2019</p><br/><p>The conversation he had just now with a NPC popped up in his head.</p><br/><p>After arriving at the 3rd floor of Churu Castle\u2019s Subjugation Association branch, Hyrkan talked to an NPC.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the one lord Ahimbree sent.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a particularly noteworthy conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cAgent Migi\u2019s mission\u2026 his mission was surveillance. His job was to observe the places where Corrupted Stones continued appearing after removing them, and to find the one transporting the Corrupted Stones to these places.\u201d</p><br/><p>The quest content wasn\u2019t anything noteworthy either.</p><br/><p>Agent Migi is most likely dead, and Hyrkan would find his corpse when he went to look for him where he disappeared.</p><br/><p>After finding his corpse, Hyrkan would most likely take over his mission and track the one transporting the Corrupted Stone. Since he wasn\u2019t required to fight any monsters, anyone with the skills to escape could complete this quest.</p><br/><p>The problem was the location.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBobor Forest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bobor Forest.</p><br/><p>Hearing this absolutely ridiculous name, Hyrkan unintentionally shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fuc\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he almost cursed as well, he was able to swallow the words before they came out. Watching this, the NPC tilted his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not at all. Just that Bobor Forest is quite a dangerous place\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBobor Forest is indeed dangerous. That is why you are here. Lord Ahimbree would not have entrusted this job to anyone. Since you\u2019ve passed his test already, you should be more than capable of finding Agent Migi and finishing his mission.\u201d</p><br/><p>Watching the NPC\u2019s trust-filled expression, uncontrollable rage roared inside of Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck off.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan knew well enough about Bobor Forest.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come on, what\u2019s up with this difficulty setting? Level 40+? Bobor Forest is a hunting ground for level 70+ players!\u2019</p><br/><p>Bobor Forest is a vast forest located below Bobor Mountain. As one might expect, Bobor Forest covered a large area and many different types of monsters inhabited it. This was Bobor Forest\u2019s special trait. Generally, in Warlord, the types of monsters that could appear in a hunting ground were limited. This made it easy for players to set their items and set up strategies for fighting. However, because of the vastly different types of monsters inhabiting Bobor Forest, players had to have multiple item sets and also have multiple strategies in mind.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, monsters from level 40 to 70 equally lived in this area. This was also quite problematic. This made Bobor Forest too difficult for level 40 players to use as hunting grounds. At the same time, level 40 monsters weren\u2019t worth money nor the experience for level 70 players. For them, it was much more efficient to use other hunting grounds.</p><br/><p>The finishing touch was the boss monster, Bobor Ogre. In truth, most people that visited Bobor Forest was there to hunt this boss monster. At this point in the game, Bobor Ogre was a monster worth quite a bit of money.</p><br/><p>In any case, Bobor Forest was too far for Hyrkan. It was too difficult. It was on a completely different level than the Lizard Swamp or the Dead Woods.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll die for sure.\u2019</p><br/><p>Even if his goal wasn\u2019t to fight, the risk was too big.</p><br/><p>The problem was that Hyrkan couldn\u2019t refuse this quest.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis stone has a magic casted on it. Since Agent Migi also has this stone, it will react when you are near him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was the end of the conversation.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan looked at the stone he received back then. In reality, he wanted to throw this stone far into outer space. His current mood was the worst of the worsts.</p><br/><p>\u2018I mean, I know Warlord sets its quest difficulty high, but isn\u2019t this too much?\u2019</p><br/><p>All of Ahimbree\u2019s quests so far were high in difficulty. Just the Nested Egg quest wasn\u2019t something someone of Hyrkan\u2019s level could complete. It wasn\u2019t something meant to be done in partied units, but as part of a guild. In fact, it really was a quest made with guild participations in mind. Main scenario quests were quests that governed Warlord\u2019s world, and thus was very balanced to be made for guild-level units than party-level units.</p><br/><p>This was the root of the problem.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan was able to complete quests that were far above what those his level could handle. Since he completed the quest, he had to receive the next one, and he ended up receiving a quest meant for a level 60 player at level 40.</p><br/><p>Of course, this was to be expected. It was because Hyrkan was that good. He should in fact be quite happy about it. It meant Hyrkan was better than what Warlord\u2019s system could have ever predicted.</p><br/><p>However, this wasn\u2019t the real problem.</p><br/><p>The quest he received this time was one that would give him a penalty if he failed to complete it on time.</p><br/><p>And this penalty\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018If I can\u2019t finish this quest, I\u2019ll get my ring taken away.\u2019</p><br/><p>Was having to return the Pursuer of Corruption Ring.</p><br/><p>It was a ring that came with a responsibility, which, in this case, was this quest.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn.\u2019</p><br/><p>If his Pursuer of Corruption Ring was taken away, he would lose at least 50 points of magic power. This would result in a huge problem for his future plans. Above all, it was impossible to obtain a ring like the Pursuer of Corruption Ring for something like 10,000,000 won.</p><br/><p>Give it up?</p><br/><p>If he couldn\u2019t receive it, he would just feel bitter and move on, but he would not let himself hand over something he received.</p><br/><p>There was no such thing in Hyrkan\u2019s dictionary.</p><br/><p>\u2018What should I do?\u2019</p><br/><p>That said, heading do Bobor Forest would be worst thing he could do.</p><br/><p>Since he had 30 days, he could try to level up as much as possible and search Bobor Forest with only a little bit of time left. Even so, he could not guarantee this plan would succeed. Not only would it be difficult to hit level 50 in 30 days, but being level 50 would also not help his situation much.</p><br/><p>\u2018If only I met with Ahimbree after leveling up a bit more\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>If he knew, he would have purposefully delayed his meeting with Ahimbree.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was too late for regrets. Besides, Hyrkan aside, even Ahimbree could not possibly have predicted this.</p><br/><p>\u2018I have no choice here, do I?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan covered his face with his hands.</p><br/><p>Like so, while Hyrkan was silently murmuring to himself in the corner of 1st floor of the Subjugation Association branch, a group of players passed by Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you hear? It seems like Hydra Guild is going to catch the Corrupted One soon. What should we do? Go watch?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you even know who or where? \u2026 how much do you think you can get from catching the Corrupted One? I wonder what titles you\u2019d get.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just curious what the other Top 30 Guilds will do. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll just sit by and watch\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re probably already doing all they can do to hinder the Hydra Guild. If they catch the Corrupted One now, they\u2019ll be the number 1 guild without a doubt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, but what happens with the main scenario quests when the Corrupted One gets caught? Do they all get completed, or do they end incomplete?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot sure\u2026 this is the first main scenario quest, so probably no one knows.\u201d</p><br/><p>This conversation.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hm?\u2019</p><br/><p>Their short conversation turned a switch on in Hyrkan\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait a minute, if the Corrupt Count gets caught, all scenario quests related to the Corrupt Count ends!\u2019</p><br/><p>It seemed like there would be no need to search for Migi.</p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

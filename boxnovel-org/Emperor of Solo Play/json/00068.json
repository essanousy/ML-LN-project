This monster had ruthlessly swung its club at Hyrkan a moment ago.</p><br/><p>He was sent flying after a critical hit. \u00a0After Hyrkan healed his wound, he was about to eat a consumable item when he leveled up as one of the Black Troll died.</p><br/><p>The level up bonus recovered him fully. \u00a0Since his Stamina and Magic was filled to the brim, Hyrkan got a little bit of a breathing room.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is so tiring.\u2019</p><br/><p>He swallowed his complaints. \u00a0The Black Troll ran towards him, and its club came down like lightning. \u00a0He sidestepped the blow, then he slid between the Black Troll\u2019s legs to escape.</p><br/><p>Then he quickly came to a stop.</p><br/><p>After a quickly leap, he stabbed the White Mamba Fang Sword into the Black Troll\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Poo-oohk!</p><br/><p>White Mamba Fang Sword. \u00a0It was a level 70 Unique Rank Item. \u00a0The main attribute of items were assigned randomly. \u00a0Instead of Strength and Stamina, it rolled Wisdom and Magic. \u00a0Hyrkan had purchased it at a cheap price at auction. Even at a very conservative price, he had purchased it for 38,000 gold.</p><br/><p>For the general public, it was a ridiculous price, but Hyrkan felt as if the price had been a bargain.</p><br/><p>[The Black Troll was poisoned by the White Mamba\u2019s Venom.]</p><br/><p>White Mamba Fang Sword\u2019s secondary attribute, Poisoning!</p><br/><p>The damage caused by the Poisoning was quite strong. Moreover, the Poisoning Magic worked very well against Trolls, who had a powerful skin regenerative property. \u00a0Even if its regeneration was strong, there was still a finite HP. \u00a0Its HP didn\u2019t recover. \u00a0It only recovered its wounds. \u00a0The effect of the poison continued as it disregarded the regeneration ability.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the sword\u2019s damage was also powerful. \u00a0This fact was evident when the sword pierced through the very thick leather of the Black Troll in a single breath.</p><br/><p>When the sword was embedded deep, the Balck Troll\u2019s regeneration ability activated. \u00a0Its skin started to regenerate around the still embedded sword. Hyrkan had a bloody smile on his face. \u00a0With both his hands holding the sword, he pressed both his feet against the Troll\u2019s back. He looked akin to a climber using rock climbing techniques.</p><br/><p>He was skillful and sure in his techniques.</p><br/><p>There was a reason why Warlord users took the Climbing Test. In Warlord, the Rock Climbing technique was an absolute requisite skill. \u00a0It was used, while fighting against any monsters over midsize. \u00a0If one was capable of sticking to the monster\u2019s body, it gave one the opportunity to give constant damage to the monster.</p><br/><p>Choo-roong!</p><br/><p>In this position, Hyrkan unsheathed his other sword from his waist, then he tirelessly moved the blade to make countless cuts on the Black Troll\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Sss-ooht, sss-ooht!</p><br/><p>Every time he made a mark with his sword, he saw the wound heal immediately. \u00a0It was a chilling sight. However, the damage was most definitely accumulating, and the Black Troll\u2019s HP was quickly and abruptly decreasing.</p><br/><p>Ooh-uhuh!</p><br/><p>Finally, the Black Troll turned his attention toward Hyrkan. The aggro was steered towards Hyrkan. \u00a0The Black Troll started struggling to catch Hyrkan, who was stuck to the Black Troll\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>The Black Troll didn\u2019t perceive the Skeleton Warriors in the front holding terrifying weapons.</p><br/><p>It was a mistake.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s worse, the Skeleton Warrior that had been facing the Black Troll earlier was the Black Orc Skeleton Warrior with the Orc Hero\u2019s Sword in his grasp. \u00a0The sword had the power to ignore the target\u2019s defense\u2026</p><br/><p>Suh-guhk, suh-guhk!</p><br/><p>In a flash, he dealt significant damage to both its knees. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t a wound the Black Troll could ignore. \u00a0Moreover, that wasn\u2019t the end of it.</p><br/><p>Ddul-goo-ruk, ddul-goo-ruk!</p><br/><p>The Skeleton Warriors didn\u2019t let this opportunity pass. \u00a0They ran towards the Black Troll, while making bone rattles. There was a horn attached to their skulls. \u00a0It was the Madness Helm, and it made them much more fearsome. \u00a0Moreover, through Hyrkan\u2019s repeated teachings and continuous battles, the combat AI of the Skeleton Soldiers had already reached a professional level.</p><br/><p>When the Skeleton Warriors saw a crack, they charged forward like eels swimming towards a crack.</p><br/><p>After they ran in\u2026.</p><br/><p>Pook, shweek, kook!</p><br/><p>All kinds of sounds that could be made by swords hitting flesh was made.</p><br/><p>Ooh-uhuh!</p><br/><p>The Black Troll\u2019s yell spread out wide into the surrounding. \u00a0During all of this, Hyrkan tirelessly moved his sword. \u00a0As if Hyrkan was trying to pull a sword out of the ground, he put both feet on the Black Troll\u2019s back, and he pulled out the White Mamba Fang Sword.</p><br/><p>Pooh-haht!</p><br/><p>He extracted his sword, and an arc of blood fountained into the air. \u00a0Hyrkan dismounted to the floor. \u00a0Hyrkan rolled once as he dropped, and he came to his feet unharmed.</p><br/><p>Ooh-oh?</p><br/><p>The being that had been frustrating the Black Troll by skillfully attacking its back had fallen to the floor. \u00a0The Black Troll turned his head towards Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>It meant he turned his back on the Skeleton Warriors, who had been tormenting the Black Troll!</p><br/><p>Sheek!</p><br/><p>Hyrkan had a deep smile underneath the Hahoe Mask.</p><br/><p>[Hyrkan]</p><br/><p>\u2013 Level : 75</p><br/><p>\u2013 Occupation : Magician</p><br/><p>\u2013 Title : 39</p><br/><p>\u2013 Stat : Strength(649)/Stamina(219)/Intelligence(352)/Magic(467)</p><br/><p>\u2018The Hunting Dog Set\u2019s Options are fantastic.\u2019</p><br/><p>After he distributed the Stat Points earned from the level up, Hyrkan checked his Stat Window then he put on a slight smile. \u00a0He had bought this set under the market value in preparation for reaching level 70. \u00a0He was satisfied with the Shadow Dog Set\u2019s Options. \u00a0No, it exceeded his expectation. Now that he was well-off in terms of Stats, it also enriched Hyrkan\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Of course.</p><br/><p>\u2018Still, why are there so many Shadow Dog sets being released? \u00a0Today I saw at least 10 full sets come on the auction. Will the price drop in the future?\u2019</p><br/><p>He had spent a lot of money to purchase the Shadow Dog Set. \u00a0He paid 37,000 gold to purchase it, so this was a fresh worry for Hyrkan. Since he had invested his entire net worth into commodities, he felt like a stock broker looking at one\u2019s stock daily. \u00a0He understood how they felt.</p><br/><p>This situation was basically asking for trouble. \u00a0Hyrkan looked at himself as he shook his head from side to side.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s only think about the good things. Good thoughts.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan forced himself to think positive thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, my level up is progressing very well.\u2019</p><br/><p>The most positive news was his level up pace. \u00a0Currently, Hyrkan\u2019s level up pace was unrivaled. \u00a0His goal was to raise 10 levels in a month. \u00a0At this pace, he\u2019ll be close to becoming the top ranker within a year. Moreover, he have gained 5 levels from the Parung Forest in only 13 days. It was a very surprising level up pace. \u00a0</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m most definitely closing the distance with the rankers.\u2019</p><br/><p>Currently, the highest level on Warlord was 134. \u00a0Of course, Perfect One Sulwoo was the one to achieve the top level. The top 100 Ranker was 125. Hyrkan was only level 75, so those levels looked very far away. \u00a0However, Hyrkan was slowly and gradually narrowing the difference.</p><br/><p>It was a very positive sign.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026\u2026this was the result of too many monsters being here. \u00a0It\u2019s problematic.\u2019</p><br/><p>Moreover, the situation wasn\u2019t something normal.</p><br/><p>Parung Forest.</p><br/><p>It was teeming with Black Trolls over level 90. \u00a0It also had field boss monsters like the fearsome Red Eye Ogre. \u00a0This was the hunting ground where the so-called Red Eye appeared. It wouldn\u2019t have been a problem if this was the only thing he had to be worried about.</p><br/><p>The problem was there was a very small amount of users permanently stationed at the Parung Forest. \u00a0Moreover, not many users hunted here. Currently, the Parung Forest didn\u2019t even have a village nearby. Not many users used this place as their stage.</p><br/><p>The reason behind it was complex. If one wanted to make a village here, one would need a powerful guild to make the village at Parung Forest. \u00a0The Parung forest wasn\u2019t a bad hunting ground, but a lot of effort would have to be put into making the village. \u00a0Effort wasn\u2019t the only problem. \u00a0In the end, there wasn\u2019t a suitable location where a village could be built.</p><br/><p>The EXP was quite nice here, but the difficulty of this location could give trouble to even the level 90 users.</p><br/><p>Most of the current Warlord users were between latter half of lvl70 or early lvl80s. \u00a0From their perspective, the Bulcass mountain was much better option than the Parung Forest.</p><br/><p>There was no need to suffer by coming to the Parung Forest.</p><br/><p>This was the reason why the Parung Forest was overflowing with monsters.</p><br/><p>Unless there was a large influx of users to the Parung Forest, the number of monsters would continue to increase, and at a certain point, it would be too difficult to hunt here.</p><br/><p>Of course, the practical users retreated at that point. \u00a0There was no need to risk their lives to stay here.</p><br/><p>However, Hyrkan had a task he must pass in the Parung Forest.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ve searched the Parung Forest for nearly a fortnight, yet I haven\u2019t found any clues.\u2019</p><br/><p>Maeung\u2019s Request.</p><br/><p>He had to find monsters akin to the Bear Warrior. \u00a0He needed to find a monster wearing equipment like a person.</p><br/><p>However, to his knowledge, there weren\u2019t any monster wearing armor within the Parung Forest. \u00a0The Black Trolls and the Red Eye Ogres didn\u2019t equip themselves with items.</p><br/><p>\u2018Maybe this is like the instance of the Dragon Lizard. \u00a0I might have come across a Quest Monster with a very low probability of\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>If the Parung Forest kept producing a higher number of monsters than expected, Hyrkan had no choice but to retreat. \u00a0It would be better than dying. However, this meant his quest completion would be pushed to a later date.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan bit hard at his lips.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Strormhunters are probably about to graduate from the Bulcass mountains.\u2019</p><br/><p>If Hyrkan\u2019s quest was delayed here, the Stormhunter\u2019s Quest line would converge with his.</p><br/><p>This meant he will be in direct competition with the Stormhunter\u2019s guild. \u00a0Would it be possible for Hyrkan to win against them?</p><br/><p>The probability wasn\u2019t that high.</p><br/><p>Also, he didn\u2019t care if some other guild overtook him, but Hyrkan\u2019s pride wouldn\u2019t allow him to fall behind the Stormhunter guild.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan stood up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Should I have entered into a community at that time?\u2019</p><br/><p>At that moment, Hyrkan thought about what happened 10 days earlier.</p><br/><p>There were only about 10 user groups operating in the Parung Forest. \u00a0It was a very low number. \u00a0If one considered the size of the Parung forest, it could support over 50 teams hunting at this location.</p><br/><p>These 10 groups were composed of outstanding players. The average level of the party members was level 95. Basically, they were at the cusp of being promoted.</p><br/><p>The users, who were at the cusp of being promoted, usually overworked themselves to quickly reach level 100. \u00a0</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter if it was strenuous, hard and not profitable. \u00a0They looked for a hunting ground where they could level up in the shortest amount of time possible.</p><br/><p>This was also true for the Alto Family.</p><br/><p>They were a group of 5 people, and all of them were level 98. \u00a0They only needed 2 levels before they all reached level 100. \u00a0They had come to the Parung forest, since they didn\u2019t have to worry about running out of monsters here. \u00a0It didn\u2019t matter to them that this place was a much more difficult place to hunt.</p><br/><p>It was great at first. \u00a0The place was overflowing with monsters, and the Black Troll\u2019s EXP was quite substantial.</p><br/><p>However, the Alto Family was starting to feel their limit recently.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow we have to fight at least three of them at every encounter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we only meet Black Trolls, we\u2019ll be fortunate. \u00a0Recently, aren\u2019t all the Black Trolls being accompanied by smallfrys?\u201d</p><br/><p>The number of monsters weren\u2019t decreasing. \u00a0Instead, it was actually increasing. \u00a0It was how the Warlord\u2019s Regen System was set-up. \u00a0The Warlord Regen System took into consideration of additional users showing up at a map. \u00a0This was why the system regenerated a higher number of monsters in the field compared to the users.</p><br/><p>However, no new users had come to this map recently. \u00a0Eventually, the number of monsters in the Parung forest expanded, and it was up to the users to hunt them down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the status of our consumables?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe might have to go visit the castle once. Or we might have to call in the traveling merchant. \u00a0I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be able to hold out until level 100.\u201d</p><br/><p>The biggest problem was the party had used more consumable items than planned as they tried to survive the overtaxing battles.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were so meticulous in our preparations\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say in the beginning we wouldn\u2019t be able to use it all even if we tried?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a money drain. Will we be taking a loss, because we came here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be hard for us to make any profit. \u00a0If we are lucky, we might break even.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Alto family let out a sigh. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t too hard to go back and restock their items. \u00a0However, the goal of reaching level 100 would be delayed by a day or two. \u00a0This made that option unpalatable. They were like 3 day starved dogs with food in their near future. \u00a0Endure! \u00a0That\u2019s what they told themselves. Still, they were reaching an end to their patience.</p><br/><p>It also meant they couldn\u2019t overstretch themselves. \u00a0It was preferable to waste one or two day in-game instead of wasting 48 hours from the Game Over. \u00a0They were players who had bought a 20 thousand dollar system and they were paying couple hundred dollars per month on the game. They knew which scenario was more profitable.</p><br/><p>Still, they couldn\u2019t help, but be filled with regret.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should have just given the money to the Hahoe Mask, and we should have asked if he could carry us on his bus.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their regret centered around the Hahoe Mask Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is soloing in this place. \u00a0I still can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw it with my own eyes, but I still can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since the Parung forest was a stage with a small number of groups, everyone knew who was operating there.</p><br/><p>They had also developed their own community, and they helped each other when the need arose. \u00a0Since no village was nearby, this arrangement increased their survivability. The community also allowed them to make personal connections, and it might benefit them in the future. \u00a0At the very least, they were sharing the same hunting ground, so they were of similar levels.</p><br/><p>This was why the Alto family had invited Hahoe Mask Hyrkan to the community, but they were coldly turned down. \u00a0At the time, everyone thought, \u2018What kind of \u00a0person is that?\u2019, but now they were in awe of the Hahoe Mask\u2019s skill.</p><br/><p>The fact that the Alto family had to leave before they could reach level 100 made them feel a sense of loss.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an amazing bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is rumored that the Hahoe Mask summons Skeleton Warriors, and one of them wields the Orc Hero\u2019s Sword.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Orc Hero\u2019s Sword?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe gave a Skeleton such an expensive item? \u00a0Is he some kind of heir to a rich family?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019m jealous. If only I could pay2win like the Hahoe Mask, my level would be\u2026.\u201d \u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cHahoe Mask. \u00a0I bet he eat steak and wine everyday. \u00a0I bet he imports only the highest quality of coffees.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop it. \u00a0I bet he is too tired of meat, so he eat caviar with a spoon like ice cream.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sense of loss they felt made them think about all kinds of things. \u00a0It happened at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the user, who was listening to this rubbish conversation, suddenly stood up in place as if he had heard something.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Toon Party has sent a request for a rescue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Toon party?\u201d</p><br/><p>Toon Party.</p><br/><p>Like the Alto family, the Toon party were composed of members close to advancing into level 100. \u00a0It was a 5 man party that the Alto family had gotten acquainted with around a fortnight ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems we are the closest to them. \u00a0What should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t complete strangers with the Toon party. \u00a0They helped us out before. \u00a0We have to leave anyways, so let\u2019s help them then leave. \u00a0Also, isn\u2019t the Toon party more powerful than us? \u00a0Shouldn\u2019t they have no problem in taking care of couple Black Trolls?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid they find the Red Eye?\u201d</p><br/><p>At the question, the man used voice talk to have a brief conversation, then he answered his party member\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an ogre, but they are saying it is an ogre wearing a helmet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

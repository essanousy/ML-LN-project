The hero who earned 1st place by recording a sales of 101 million is the Hahoe Mask in the Immoral Prince Raid.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Ahn-jaehyun was watching Ahmong and Ken's Ranking show, and he was massaging his eyes with his two hands. \u00a0He wasn't massaging his eyes from being tired.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is driving me nuts.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This shameful clip was something he wanted to forget, but it was being replayed in front of millions of people. The hands over his eyes were also a method to avoid looking at the replay. \u00a0Of course, it was a preposterous way to avoid looking at it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit. \u00a0Of all the things....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Ahn-jaehyun once again reminisced on what had happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maeung\u2019s appearance had been foretold. \u00a0Although, it was a bit of a surprise that Maeung chose to end the Immoral Prince. \u00a0It was a scenario where he had expected Maeung to show up when the Immoral Prince was close to death. \u00a0He had expected Maeung to give a clue about the ruined kingdom. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he never expected Maeung to search out the Hahoe Mask after it finished its business.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, he didn't have the mental capacity to worry about such a thing. \u00a0The Immoral Prince Raid had been very hard, but Ahn-jaehyun had been close to his limit even before the Raid. \u00a0To face the Immoral Prince, he had to reach level 180 as fast as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he had wanted to work in secret behind the Red Bulls, so he had stopped receiving help from the Red Bulls' level up support team. \u00a0Afterwards, he hadn't had time to rest. \u00a0When he reached level 180, he had to recover the Items he had put in Item Storage. \u00a0His personal attention was also needed for coming up with the Item Setting he would enter the Immoral Prince Raid with. \u00a0He also had to check each of the Item Setting of his Skeleton subordinates. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask's goofy response was an appropriate reaction. \u00a0It was a great feat in itself that he hadn't logged out by falling asleep.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, no one was aware of his situation. \u00a0The world thought the Hahoe Mask was talking in a half-asleep state at the most important moment in the Raid. \u00a0Still, people focused on it, and they really enjoyed that scene.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun's gibberish from his lack of sleep had already hit the Warlord related fan sites, and it was being circulated as an animated gif. \u00a0Moreover, the footage appeared in any article, interview or video related to the Immoral Prince raid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were even some Users in Warlord that used the word 'Huh Maeung' instead of saying a greeting or thanks. \u00a0If things turned out unfavorably, Ahn-jaehyun's shameful past had a chance of becoming a part of the lexicon of Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The image I built up until now was destroyed, because of a short 3 seconds clip.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was stronger than anyone else. \u00a0It didn't matter what trouble he was in, the Hahoe Mask solved the problem with his own strength. \u00a0He was an extraordinary hero, yet he had become the butt of a joke in the span of a single day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigo\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun let out a moan. \u00a0He was letting out a moan, but at the same time, it indicated that Ahn-jaehyun was full right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had gained everything he wanted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun had earned everything he was able to earn in the Immoral Prince episode.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had gained a level 200 Chronicle Epic Item. \u00a0It was currently the strongest Item in existence. \u00a0Moreover, there were merely 10 of these Items in circulation. \u00a0It was the ultimate Item, and it wasn\u2019t something that could be bought with money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had also gained numerous Titles. \u00a0Ahn-jaehyun had gained the two Titles he had coveted forever. \u00a0He gained the 'Havan Kindom's Hero' and 'Arbiter of Corruption' Titles. \u00a0These were precious Titles that couldn't be earned any more. \u00a0On top of it all, he had gained the 'Hero of the Great Battle' and 'Defeater of Argardo' Titles....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had earned a lot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the biggest jackpot for him was the profit he received from the Paid Video Sales. The Immoral Prince Raid was seen live by over 5 million people. \u00a0However, there were a large portion of the viewers that hadn't been satisfied with the live broadcasts. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was to be expected. \u00a0Usually, a normal live Raid broadcast needed a lot of preparation and planning. \u00a0When preparing for a raid, one had to be mindful of where to place the cameras, and one had to know which shots looked good. \u00a0There was a separate group of people that had to get ready for the Raid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this Immoral Prince Raid had developed too suddenly, and everything had been rushed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The appearance of the Hahoe Mask was especially a surprise. \u00a0In such a situation, they weren't able to properly broadcast the Hahoe Mask's exploits. \u00a0This was why a lot of people were disappointed. \u00a0However, the Hahoe Mask had his own footage, and a video was made using his contents. Their disappointment turned into anticipation as they waited for the Hahoe Mask's version of the Raid. \u00a0Ahn-jaehyun hadn\u2019t move with that much forethought, but the anticipation felt by the people was immediately proven through the number of sales.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In just a week, the sales of his video moved past a million!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In terms of Personal Paid Video Sales, the only one who had been able to sell over a million in one week was the First One. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask was the first to achieve this feat since the First One. His revenues were incredible. \u00a0The price for his Paid Videos was $4.99. \u00a0Of course, the Hahoe Mask's share of the money was in the hundred thousands of dollars.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun had just gained the crowning achievement one could reach in the game of Warlord. \u00a0Currently, Ahn-jaehyun was in a far better place than the time before he returned to the past. \u00a0He was shining brighter than the time before he had gone to war with the Stormhunters. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he couldn't complain about this embarrassing event.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun was cognizant of his situation. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He peeled his two hands off of his face. \u00a0Then he put on his glasses over his slightly more relaxed eyes. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He looked at this Tablet PC.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- We will be announcing the guild ranking for the 30 great guilds. \u00a0This topic always sparks a fierce debate, so we are qualifying it beforehand. \u00a0Ahmong and Ken's Ranking show uses 15 criteria to determine the ranking of the 30 great guilds. \u00a0This ranking isn't an official ranking, and we aren't a credible source for such information. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He focused on Amohng and Ken's Ranking Show, but the light in Ahn-jaehyun's eyes was a little bit different from before.</span></p><br/><p>2.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The end to the second Main Scenario Quest affected a lot of people. \u00a0The people, who were interested in Warlord, became new resident of the game. \u00a0On the other hand, there were those that had lost interest, and they left the stage called Warlord. \u00a0Then a vital change happened regarding the 30 great guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A crucial decision had been made.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This truth was acknowledged by regular Users and Warlord fans, who weren't part of the 30 guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Let's be real about it. \u00a0Even if they are all called the 30 great guilds, isn't there too much internal differences amongst the guilds?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I feel the same way. \u00a0I think they should make a large scale changes to the live channel rights. \u00a0In truth, some of the 30 great guilds don't deserve the live channel rights. \u00a0Some of them are even worse than the Fighters guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- If you look at Amohng and Ken's RanKing show, the Fighters guild moved past the bottom of the 30 great guilds. \u00a0They moved past the Big Smiles guild in terms of quality in their Guild Ranking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 For real. \u00a0In truth, does the Big Smiles guild have anyone that can fight better than Pitbull?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 Don't look down on the Big Smiles. \u00a0They are still one of the top guilds in the 30 great guilds in terms of views.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 Their view count is inflated since China has a lot of people. \u00a0Is that really something to be proud about? \u00a0How many people purchase their pay-per-view videos? \u00a0Can they even sell 500,000 live tickets any more?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During the Corrupt Count episode, a good number of guilds participated in the Main Scenario Quest. \u00a0The evidence of this fact was shown when the Corrupt Count's identity was revealed in the Corrupt Count Raid. \u00a0A large portion of the 30 great guilds was present in the Corrupt Count Raid. \u00a0However, only three guilds had made an imprint on the Immoral Prince episode. \u00a0Aside from these three guilds, the other 27 guilds pretty much took on the role of sidekicks. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If so, what will happen in the 3rd Main Scenario Quest? The guilds had started to distinguish themselves from each other in the Immoral Prince episode.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, there was the three guilds that was considered to be the Big 3. \u00a0What did the other remaining guilds have to do now?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First, they couldn't avoid doing the Main Scenario Quest. \u00a0In the Main Scenario Quest, one needed a good understanding of the game, a good information network, and monster hunting ability. \u00a0It was the surest measuring sticking that allowed a guild to show their capability.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If a guild avoided doing the Main Scenario quest, one needed a sure content that'll allow a guild to be self-sufficient in its survival. \u00a0In reality, only the Sweepers guild and the Geicoff guild was able to do this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In such an environment, the V&amp;V guild was the first one to attempt a change.</span></p><br/><p>3.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before he connected to Warlord, Ahn-jaehyun always searched for articles related to Warlord. \u00a0Of course, Ahn-jaehyun's attention was focused on the reorganization plan announced by the V&amp;V guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What the hell is this?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun knew there were going to be changes. \u00a0He had expected it. \u00a0If they didn't change, they would inevitably be culled. \u00a0Ahn-jaehyun insisted on watching Amohng and Ken's Ranking Show to gather information about the public trends.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In fact, this had also happened before Ahn-jaehyun returned to the past. \u00a0When the Immoral Prince episode ended, all the guilds went through an overhaul. \u00a0It didn't matter if it was a big guild or a small guild. \u00a0The outstanding Users were scouted, and the trading of Users between guilds, which had been considered a taboo, started to occur.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The team name is\u2026\u2026 Poker? \u00a0Is it in reference to the card game?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">With that in mind, the V&amp;V guild had started to consolidate the disorderly organizations under their banner. \u00a0The guild's core power were being gathered into one team. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Ahn-jaehyun didn't doubt the reasons behind their actions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead, he was impressed by their bold initiative. \u00a0Guilds were most definitely a for profit organization. \u00a0If one joined and worked for a guild, one would expect personal gain in the process. If not, no one would stay in a guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Each of the 30 great guilds easily had over a thousand guild members. \u00a0If the guild wanted to guarantee some profit for everyone, the guild had no choice, but to diversify their activities.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, V&amp;V had just gave up on that. \u00a0They had decided to focus their efforts on a single purpose. \u00a0This would surely mean that the profit gained by the regular guild members would decrease. \u00a0It also meant that a good number of guild members would leave the V&amp;V guild. \u00a0They wouldn't be able to avoid internal strife. \u00a0If this was a company, it would basically be a restructure. They were willing to go through a grinding pain, and it deserved respect. \u00a0They were willing to go through the pain in pursuit of some unknown purpose.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Their naming sense is shitty... \u00a0However, the content of their plan isn't bad. \u00a0No. \u00a0I'm surprised the V&amp;V guild went through with this decision. \u00a0I'm pretty sure they weren't like this before.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From Ahn-jaehyun's perspective, the V&amp;V guild was making the right decision. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Red Bulls, Stormhunters, and Hydra.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These three guilds had become the Big 3, and these three possessed the most powerful tools. \u00a0If one didn't have a tools that was as strong as theirs, one couldn't covet what the Big 3 owned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the Team Poker that was being formed by the V&amp;V guild was structured different from the primary Raid teams of the other guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as the named indicated. \u00a0The Poker would branch into 4 classification. \u00a0It'll be the Spade, Heart, Clover and Diamond. \u00a0The members will be labeled starting with Ace and it would end with King. There would be a total of 52 Users, and three Jokers would be added in. \u00a0The final tally was a total of 55 people. \u00a0A normal primary Raid team had between 20 to 30 members. \u00a0The Poker were much numerous in number.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, they weren't only going to do Raids. \u00a0They would be like a swiss army knife in terms of their use in the game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun couldn't find any fault up to this point. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Why is there so many bastards here that I don't know?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was the new members that were added to the newly unveiled Poker Team of the V&amp;V guild. \u00a0There were faces that people from the outside didn't recognize. \u00a0They didn't recognize the two Users that occupied the seat of the Aces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Ahn-jaehyun couldn't remember all the faces he had seen in this world. \u00a0Moreover, his memory was on the poor side. \u00a0If he was to spell it out more bluntly, he probably didn't know the faces of the Rankers more so than knowing them. \u00a0However, this time not all the faces was unfamiliar to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- V&amp;V guild made an incredibly resolute decision. \u00a0Still there are a lot of faces I've never seen before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I don't think they were with the guild before. \u00a0I checked their career data, and it says they worked as normal users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Aside from Ahn-jaehyun, many people were interested in V&amp;V Guild's reorganization. \u00a0They became suspicious when they saw faces they didn't recognize.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- They are normal Users? \u00a0What are their level? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Huhk? \u00a0Level 200? \u00a0What the hell? \u00a0Their levels are \u00a0on par with the Rankers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bigger problem was that the V&amp;V guild had tried to minimize the backlash for their actions. \u00a0This was why they posted the Specs of the new faces, and their Specs were much better than an average User. \u00a0They were all over level 200, and the state of their main Item Setting and the Titles they possessed wasn't just above average. \u00a0It was world class.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The part that bothered Ahn-jaehyun the most was the number of Titles they possessed. \u00a0It was an incredibly high number.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The least of them had 150 Titles and the ones with the most had exceeded 200 Titles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When leveling up quickly, it was hard to earn the necessary Titles. \u00a0On the other hand, if one focused only on gaining Titles, the time one needed to invest in leveling up decreased. \u00a0If one wanted to gain both at the same time, one had to be like Ahn-jaehyun. \u00a0One had to map out how one will get the Titles, and the most effective Level Up route had to be planned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this was possible for those in the 30 great guilds. \u00a0They had the intelligence network, and there were those who helped to gather title for guild members.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If this was the case, the explanation given by the V&amp;V guild clashed with the conventional wisdom. \u00a0They couldn't be normal Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018They have that many Titles yet they are normal Users? \u00a0Bullshit.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no way they were just normal Users. \u00a0The number of Titles they have are impossible to achieve unless they received help from an organization that was on par with the 30 great guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018That bastard showed up last time. \u00a0It seems these bastards appear every time there is a lull. \u00a0Are they part of some professional guild that nurtures Users?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways, it seemed an unknown organization had appeared, and they were Ahn-jaehyun's new enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun's face hardened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Stormhunters, Hydra, Red Bulls and others....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He never thought any of them were easy enemies. \u00a0However, they were enemies that he could see.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, at that moment, an enemy that he hadn't seen before had appeared in front of Ahn-jaehyun's eyes. \u00a0This enemy wasn\u2019t in his memory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he felt anxious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fact that he had accomplished a lot made his anxiety higher. \u00a0Ahn-jaehyun had too much things to lose now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018\u2026\u2026if I become lax, they'll take it all away from me.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, this anxiety allowed Ahn-jaehyun to come to a decision.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018So my immediate path to a Spec Up.... The Skill Books are the only way.\u2019</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

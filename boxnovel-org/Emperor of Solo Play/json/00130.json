However, one couldn't come up with the words on the spot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how several thousand watching the Havanz castle... No, millions of people were faced with such a situation. They couldn't immediately express the feeling they felt as they watched the sight in front of them. They could only let out a simple exclamation of admiration and acclamation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was also part of this group.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Uh. I caught it?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been prepared for death. No, in truth, he had thought he was cooked. He had thought he was a loser that hadn't been able to last until the Black Sap's effect had entirely ate away at Argardo's HP. He had thought his death was well-deserved. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He even felt regret. Maybe he should have just shut both his eyes, and asked for Red Bulls' help. Who was going to look after his watch? Maybe, the Red Bulls guild would quickly eat it, then deny taking it? \u00a0What will he do for the next 48 hours? Maybe he should play game X... </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Regrets would have started to fill his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Hyrkan was someone that couldn't differentiate between game and reality, he would have probably kept thinking about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, Argardo was dead, but it hadn't fallen. He had heard the Announcement in his ears. It was sufficient proof that the battle had ended. However, Argardo was standing straight as it pointed its sword at Hyrkan. It made Hyrkan wonder if he had misheard the announcement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't know why, but it felt as if he was going to cut down by Argardo's sword if he moved. \u00a0The suspense didn't even allow Hyrkan to swallow his spit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The one who should be celebrating the most in this victory was immersed in this suspense. Even the spectators watching this scene couldn't help it. The suspense created a sense of desolation, and they were having a hard time shaking off this feeling. The sense of desolation was like a fog that had descended in the morning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The very first one to shake off this sense of desolation was Chev.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He really did it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chev was filled with complicated thoughts. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been clear that Hyrkan was inferior to Argardo. On the other hand, the thought of facing Argardo's attack made one's body shudder. It was frightening. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From afar, it seemed Argardo was still standing there looking unharmed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he was sure this was over. The only thing left was the curtain call.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Hahoe Mask defeated the White-eyed knight by himself.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In other words, someone else had to give the curtain call. Chev used the Voice Talk to talk to the producer directing the live broadcast.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMic mode.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- What? Ah, yes! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed the producer had been in a daze too. However, he quickly came to his senses. This was still a live broadcast. If a PD lost control over his thoughts during a live broadcast, the consequences wouldn't end after sending in a report.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Mic mode, 3, 2, 1. Start! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The producer immediately sent a signal to the sound team. The sound team made adjustments to the system so that Chev's words would immediately be heard through the broadcast.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the countdown ended, Chev opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Argardo hunt was a success. This was a production made possible by the Red Bulls. The Red Bulls guild and the Hahoe Mask was the participants. \u00a0Thank you for watching our broadcast. \u00a0We'll see you soon through the credit cookie.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The curtain descended on the stage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now the viewers wouldn't be able to see the story that was about to occur on the other side of the curtain.</span></p><br/><p>2.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan accepted Argardo's death when he received the Titles. He immediately check on the Titles after he acquired it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hero of the Great Battle] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Title Effect : All Stats increase by 5%.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Defeater of Argardo] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Title Effect : All Stats increase by 5%.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These two Titles were an explicit proof.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I really caught it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had caught Argardo. The Titles were a clear proof.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The death of Argardo put a period on the great battle. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was finally able to wipe the dazed look off of his face. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan started to walk. Hyrkan lost his balance for a brief moment. \u00a0He forgot he had temporarily lost the weight of an arm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan took a peek at his left arm. No, it was impossible to see his left arm. His left arm was missing. It had probably rolled away nearby, or maybe it had been crushed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he didn't need to worry about it. He just had to receive a regeneration magic from a priest nearby. It would grow back in 3 minutes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah. Life Vessel.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan realized he couldn't receive the Regeneration magic. Once he activated the Life Vessel, a priest couldn't use any recovery type magic on him. \u00a0It was a form of penalty. The Regeneration was a recovery type magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan took a peek at his HP status. Then he wordlessly put a Recovery Candy in his mouth. \u00a0Once his Live Vessel skill was deactivated, he'll be at the brink of death. He might lose the life he had barely hung on to. That was how bad of a state he was in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I almost died for real.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan rolled the candy around in his mouth, and a sweet smell emanated from his smile. He approached Argardo. Argardo was still standing still in the same location.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan felt several types of emotions mingle inside his head and heart as he looked at Argardo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First, he wanted to smack the back of Argardo's head with his hand. Of course, he wouldn't feel favorable towards someone that had tried to kill him. Above all else, he hadn't been able to land a single satisfying blow against Argardo. He had gained victory using the Black Sap. There wasn't much gratification from winning this way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On one hand, he was proud of his victory against Argardo. \u00a0On the other hand, he felt as if he should show his respect to the powerful knight he had fought.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it was merely an NPC within the game. \u00a0Moreover, this NPC had not been kind to him. \u00a0It was actually an NPC that had committed horrifying misdeeds in its past. It would be absurd to pay respects to it. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of it all, Hyrkan was very unlike the Users that insisted on romanticizing the game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I wonder what Coyote or Whistling would have done if they were in my place.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Hyrkan did nothing. He just looked at Argardo with complicated emotions inside his heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the dead Argardo couldn't feel his gaze.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Choo-roong, choo-roong! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if Argardo's sword had felt his gaze instead. It started letting out a cry towards Hyrkan. His shoulders had unconsciously given a big flinch when the sword let out a cry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018That gave me a fright.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, Argardo's body flinched. As the sword let out its cry, it started shaking the stiff body of Argardo. The vibration was small, but it started to spread like a ripple. In the end, it toppled over Argardo's body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Argardo finally got on his knee, then he fell forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan watched this sight. The fallen Argardo had let go of his of his prized sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan used his remaining arm to pick up Argardo\u2019s prized possession. He picked up the Crying Sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You cannot use this sword yet.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Announcement tickled his ears. It informed him he couldn't use it yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan ignored the Announcement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cItem Option Check.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He did something only he could do with this Item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A hologram window immediately appeared in front of Hyrkan's eyes. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Crying Sword] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*Main Properties</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Epic Rank Item</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- All Stats +222 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Required Level : 180 \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*Sub-properties</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The weapons and armors that receives an attack from the sword will rapidly lose its durability.

It will let out a cry if a hostile enemy is near the master. It protects the master of the sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was more than a smile. The Option made him shudder from the thrill. This was better than the last weapon he used before he came to the past. In some ways, it was proof that he had already exceeded his past self.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hyrkan didn't pay attention to those thought. The important part was the spoils of war.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The privilege of enjoying the spoils of war was only given to the winners.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At last, the vague word within his head was able to be crystallized in a recognizable word.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I\u2019ll use this Item well.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The word was victory.</span></p><br/><p>3.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An explosion sometimes meant a release of pent up emotions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The viewers hadn't been able to say anything after the Hahoe Mask and Argardo finished their battle. In the process, their emotions had been building and coalescing. Now it started to explode.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The Hahoe Mask really won? How?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- When will the Red Bulls release their strategy? What the hell did they do? Wasn't the only direct damages done by the Bone Explosives?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Black Sap. I guess it does DoT damage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 The Black Sap does DoT Damage? It feel like I've seen that somewhere before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 Isn't it from the Black Tree?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 Black Tree? What is that? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 It is Hahoe Mask debut pay-per-view video. It is really fun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Hahoe Mask is the best. Sulwoo may be the First One in the Rankings, but the Hahoe Mask is the First One in terms of fighting ability.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They weren't the only ones reacting in an intense manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRequest an interview from the Red Bulls! We have to get an interview before the others! Hurry! Get me that interview immediately!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you are able to get an interview with the Hahoe Mask, you'll get one month paid vacation. Get it at any cost! \u00a0We can't lose to the bastards from Fruit!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The unexpected appearance of the Hahoe Mask allowed an unprecedented history to be written.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn\u2019t the only historical event that had happened that day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- We sold 2,710,000 tickets. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm pretty sure you got the number wrong. The number of ticket sold before the Raid started...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The number of tickets we sold increased precipitously when the Hahoe Mask joined the Argardo raid. We just got the official number. Truthfully, I'm also having a hard time believing it. Anyways, we achieved a new record. It is unfortunate that we weren't able to reach the 3 million mark.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had sold 2.71 million tickets.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had broken the all-time record for the amount of live tickets sold in Warlord. Chev was the owner of the new record, and he let out a forced laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There's my jealousy towards the Hahoe Mask, and there are the several factors that make me regret my decision a little bit....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been jealous of the Hahoe Mask in this battle, and he felt regret at losing out on the incredible rewards that would be given to the winner of the battle. Chev would be lying if he said these two emotions weren't at the back of his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, at that moment, he forgot about the regret he had felt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The sale of the paid videos will be quite significant.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn't the end of it. The Hahoe Mask had given up the rights to his cut as part of the deal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If we combine the live tickets that will be sold in the Immoral Prince Raid\u2026\u2026.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he thought about the guaranteed profit in the future, Chev didn't smile any more. Instead, he put on a serious expression as he thought about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018As expected, I have to recruit the Hahoe Mask.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, there was someone, who was having the same worry as Chev.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Excuse me. What shall we do? Should we just pull back or should we send a message of congratulation to the Red Bulls? Ah. What about the Hahoe Mask....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir was thinking so hard that Hatch's report wasn't registering in her head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018In the end, he didn't ask for help from the Red Bulls.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the Hahoe Mask was the source of her troubled thoughts. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her stomach had been beyond the point of aching when the Hahoe Mask worked with the Red Bulls. She wanted to destroy both of them as her insides churned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, in the end, the Hahoe Mask hadn't received help from the Red Bulls even when he was in a desperate situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Shir hadn't exploded. This was why she was still deep within her thoughts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Why?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the very least, one thing was for sure now. It wasn't as if the Red Bulls hadn\u2019t wanted to help the Hahoe Mask. It didn\u2019t matter if the Red Bulls guild would be giving out a favor or go under debt. There was no downside in helping out the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, in end, the Hahoe Mask wanted to fight by himself even in a desperate situation. The decision was of his own will. He did receive help from the Red Bulls, but his will was to fight Argardo by himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Why is he so insistent on soloing?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had a hard time understanding his will to solo. Normally, it was better to cooperate to get the sure result. This was the logical and common sense approach. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask was a very unique existence, but he wasn\u2019t someone who was absurdly illogical and unreasonable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The insistence on soloing everything was illogical and irrational.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, there was a reason behind his actions. In other words, she had to find out and resolve this reason. It was the only way she'll be able to possess the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'll die before I let him be possessed by someone else.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir kept brooding over her troubles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Excuse me, Queen? Are you listening to me, Queen? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch once again tried to speak to Shir. Shir's expression crumpled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are being noisy.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was nothing more annoying than someone yapping through the Voice Talk, while she was thinking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, disturbing Shir was a much scarier proposition than disturbing a lion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- No, that's not....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hatch was aware of this fact. However, Hatch once again disturbed Shir. The expression on Shir's face disappeared. She was expressionless. This was the expression she put on when her annoyance had reached its peak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hatch couldn\u2019t see her expression, but he caught wind of it. He couldn\u2019t even hear her breathe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even so, Hatch spoke to her again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Bracelet. \u00a0Bracelet! Look at the Bracelet! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir looked at her own Bracelet instead of getting angry.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

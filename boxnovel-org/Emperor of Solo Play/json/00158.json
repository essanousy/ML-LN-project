</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An enormous wall of fire suddenly appeared in front of him. \u00a0Hyrkan reflexively stopped in front of the fire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'm in a hurry. \u00a0Which bastard did this?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hyrkan knew that the wall of fire had been created by a magician. \u00a0This was why he had stopped running.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was around 10 meter high, and it was 1 meter in width. \u00a0It was too big to jump over it, but Hyrkan's superior Item Setting meant that the Fire Wall couldn't do much harm to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he wanted to, he could just charge through it. \u00a0However, this meant the magician, who had used the magical spell, knew this fact too. \u00a0Basically, this fire wasn't meant to damage Hyrkan. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Fuck....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a diversion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he recklessly hurtled through the Fire Wall like an acrobat, a critical blow would come from the other side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had suffered this scenario before, so he was well aware of this tactic. \u00a0Moreover, even if there was nothing across the Fire Wall, he had no choice, but to stop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan turned to look behind him. \u00a0Unlike the chaotic situation in front of him, it was very calm and quiet behind him. \u00a0The only thing he could see was his own tracks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan could guarantee it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If Anugas follows the attack pattern from before, it unerringly follows its opponent, and its pursuit can\u2019t be shaken unless it locks onto another opponent. \u00a0It is classified as an illusion type monster, so it wouldn\u2019t be strange if it appeared suddenly.' </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had a pursuer except one couldn\u2019t see this pursuer with one's eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Hyrkan considered the current development to be somewhat favorable for him. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, a Wall of Fire had been placed in front of him, and this meant that there was at least one other User nearby.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had no reason to waste his energy by striking up a conversation. \u00a0Hyrkan tossed the box he had been carrying nearby. \u00a0It held the Ancient Power. \u00a0At this point in the game, it was worth a lot, but he couldn't fight, while carrying it by his side. \u00a0He wouldn't risk his life for the sake of protecting the Ancient Power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Hyrkan's left hand was freed, he stole a handful of flame from the barrier in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The spark of fire took hold on Hyrkan's glove, and the spark didn't fizzle out. \u00a0Instead, it started burning larger, and the flames surged forward. \u00a0In the end, a giant made out of fire took shape.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Fire Golem appeared! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Fire Golem appeared, it immediately absorbed the flame blocking its master's path. \u00a0Hyrkan looked at the road in front of him. \u00a0As expected, there was a trap that was meant to catch Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggoo-uh-uh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two enormous bears made out of fire like the Fire Golem on the road, and they started running toward Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan didn't step forward. \u00a0The Fire Golem had located its enemies first, and it moved to protect its master.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The three Fire Creatures, which had been formed beforehand, started to fight each other. \u00a0It was a messy fight between large monsters, and while the battle was commencing, Hyrkan scattered two Skeleton Warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Mini Ogre Skeleton Warriors took shape!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had already confirmed that these Skeletons were genius trackers, so he gave the order.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddahk, ddahk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he flicked his fingers, Hyrkan turned to look towards his back again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It feels as if I'm fighting with a bomb strapped to my neck.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a desperately dangerous situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had fallen into a danger that he hadn't been able to predict.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Yes. \u00a0It's always like this for me. \u00a0When things start to go my way, a bloody awful day is around the corner.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, he now felt as if he was playing Warlord.</span></p><br/><p>2.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When facing the Hahoe Mask, one had to avoid close combat at all cost. \u00a0Even though Hyrkan was a Necromancer, he had higher Strength Stat than most Strikers. \u00a0He had put all his Level Up bonus into Strength, and he had managed to equip himself with the best Item setting in Warlord. \u00a0On top of all of that, he had numerous titles that boosted his Stats further.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's Items were too advantageous in a close combat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Crying Sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, there was no weapon in existence that could destroy weapons and defensive gears as well as the Crying Sword. \u00a0In terms of destroying Items, it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that the Crying Sword was better than the Deposed Prince's Sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Depose Prince's Sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was unequivocally the strongest Item in existence in Warlord right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dark Spot set was similarly a defensive gear that boasted the highest defense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This resulted in Hyrkan being a monster in terms of close combat ability.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So what was Hyrkan's weakness? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the powerful AOE magic. Of course, Hyrkan had incredible defense against magic, and he had high resistance to elemental magic. \u00a0It wasn't easy to give critical damage by using a powerful AOE magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, magic was still considered to be Hyrkan's weakness even with a lot of things going against it. \u00a0The reason being it was the surest way to keep his Skeletons underlings, which was Hyrkan's greatest power, in check. \u00a0Hyrkan's Skeleton underlings were also equipped with incredible Items, but they couldn't be compared to Hyrkan. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Another deciding factor was the fact that Hyrkan's magical energy consumption increased as the number of Skeleton Warriors were increased.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was true.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Magic was Hyrkan's achilles heel, and if one wanted to kill Hyrkan, one had to aim for this weakness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKeep using your magic! \u00a0You have to put him on his heel! \u00a0Use your magic, so he can't take out his Skeletons!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo was using that strategy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he wasn't carrying out the plan. \u00a0From the beginning, Apollo stood far away from the battlefield. \u00a0He did as he wanted, and he continuously bombarded his subordinates with orders. \u00a0His subordinates resented him. \u00a0Apollo never contributed in a battle, yet he had the potential to be a detriment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018That son of a bitch. \u00a0He should do it himself!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Does he think using magic is easy? \u00a0Everyone thinks Tankers are the only ones that suffer.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the recipients of Apollo\u2019s words didn't feel good hearing after hearing such words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were navigating through the battlefield as they chased after the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0It was hard to use magic in such conditions, yet Apollo kept giving orders that sounded like threats. \u00a0It was unspeakably humiliating.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, their humiliation came to an end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- We've been had! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Something terrible occurred not long after the battle had started. Hahoe Mask used the trajectory of the magical spells to track down and kill the magicians. \u00a0A Striker and a Tanker was placed nearby a magician as protection. \u00a0In truth, the only thing they could do was for the Strikers to runaway with the Magicians, while the Tankers stalled the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0This was the only way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they failed to do that, they would let out the sad message like 'We've been had!' again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, two magicians from the group of 5 was cut down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo smiled when he received the report.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He finally bit the bait!\u2019</span></p><br/><p>3.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">With a single strike, he cut through the robe and body of the third magician. \u00a0The Striker, who had been guarding the magician, executed a sword strike. \u00a0It was a top to bottom swing. \u00a0The Striker's sword fell vertically like lightning, and it was as if the Striker wanted to destroy Hyrkan's sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the sound of harsh steel exploded forth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggee-reek, ggee-reek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two swords pushed against each other as a goosebump inducing screech was emitted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This bastard\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hyrkan immediately realized the User in front of him wasn't normal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't something he had to realize, since it was obvious. \u00a0How many Users could fight on even ground with a sword with Hyrkan without using any Skills? \u00a0Hyrkan immediately eyed his opponent's Item Setting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He has the Great Battle Hero's sword. \u00a0Is that the Golden Centipede set?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Great Battle Hero's sword wasn't as good as the Deposed Prince's Sword, but it was good enough to be call a top tier weapon. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the Golden Centipede set was famous. \u00a0One could get this Unique set Item when one caught a level 180 Boss Monster called the Golden Centipede. \u00a0It had low defense, but amongst the level 180 Items, it was best for maximizing attack. This was why it was categorized as an Extreme Attack Set.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it was expensive. \u00a0Even if one had money, it was hard to acquire. \u00a0The Golden Centipede was only found recently, and Users, who weren't interested in Items, didn't even know the existence of the Item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was at that moment....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Blood Ogre's Dignity has come over your body.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The System Announcement gave Hyrkan a warning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blood Ogre's Dignity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an expression one would hear when one was exposed to the Option of the Blood Ogre set. \u00a0Basically, it meant that someone wearing the Blood Ogre set was approaching Hyrkan! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Hyrkan knew better than anyone as to the price of the Blood Ogre set.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShall we introduce our names?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggee-rick, ggee-rick! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The blade of the two swords were interlocked as if they were kissing each other. \u00a0The User asked a question over the sound.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan ignored his opponent's question, and he gave an answer instead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRootbeer.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">RootBeer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a drink that was popular in North America. \u00a0It was similar to the likes of cola and cider. \u00a0Of course, one never forgot it once one heard it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you part of the Clover unit?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if RootBeer's name wasn't easy to remember, he would have remember this User.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Hahoe Mask remembered my name. \u00a0It doesn't feel too bad.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Clover unit. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hyrkan didn't remember all of them, but he remembered the skilled Users. \u00a0RootBeer was skilled enough to be able to pull off being the centerpiece of the Clover unit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This guy is no joke.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His core role was similar to Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was the Assault Captain. \u00a0RootBeer stuck to a monster's body to deal damage and Armor Break. \u00a0He was a Striker!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In Hyrkan's estimation, it was a wonder that such a skilled User had managed to remain anonymous. \u00a0A User of this skill would itch to be able to make a name for himself. \u00a0He wonder how RootBeer had kept that desire in check for so long.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He\u2019s the bait.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a reason why RootBeer was conversing with him. \u00a0Of course, it was part of their plan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan looked out of the corner of his eyes, and he could see other Users encircling him. \u00a0They were slowly tightening the net. \u00a0Moreover, the User wearing the Blood Ogre set jumped out in his sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if RootBeer didn\u2019t appreciate Hyrkan looking away from him, he continued to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course, my mood would get better if I'm able to kill the Hahoe Mask.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's lips twitched.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If only Anugas showed up here\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u2019 \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, he wasn't in a good situation. \u00a0Even Hyrkan couldn't take on the Clover unit here. \u00a0Even if he chose to face them, he would only have a chance at victory if he was the one that seized the initiative.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Please come out, Anugas-nim\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It made Hyrkan wish for the main culprit, who had been the cause of his worry, to show up. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment.... </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Uh?

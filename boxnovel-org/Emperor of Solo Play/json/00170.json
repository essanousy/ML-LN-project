</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The first move was taken by the Guardian Knights. \u00a0One took a swing at the Iron Golem, and the other swung its sword at the Ogre Golem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Guardian Knights held swords carved out of stone. \u00a0Basically, it was a chunk of rock. \u00a0It was fascinating to see such a heavy weapon part the winds. \u00a0Moreover, it wasn't simply parting the air. \u00a0It was swiftly cutting through the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was terrifying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of dodging the terrifying sword strike of the Guardian Knight, the Ogre Golem swung the stone axe in its hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It blocked an attack with its own attack! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a very ogre-like act.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggwah-ah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A thunderous sounded exploded forth as two pieces of rock clashed against each other. \u00a0Accompanying the thunderous sound, the head of the Ogre Golem\u2019s stone axe was chipped. \u00a0On the other hand, a crack appeared on the Guardian Knight's sword, and a golden light was emitted by the sword. \u00a0The true weapon was hidden underneath a layer of rock. \u00a0The sword showed its true self. \u00a0If the Ogre Golem was able to speak, it would have called the Guardian Knight a cheater.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Wah-roo-roo-roohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if to avenge the Ogre Golem, the Griffin Fire Golem let out a stream of fire towards the head of the Guardian Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, there was another fierce battle occurring nearby. \u00a0This battle also started with the Guardian Knight swinging its sword. \u00a0While one Guardian Knight swung its sword towards the Ogre Golem, the other Guardian Knight swung its sword toward the Iron Golem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hoo-oohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As expected, it was a terrifying attack. \u00a0However, the Iron Golem couldn't dodge the attack, and it had no plans to do so. \u00a0It decided to take on the Guardian Knight's sword with its head and body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggwahhhhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A loud sound exploded forth once again. \u00a0It wasn't simply a loud noise. \u00a0It was a thunderous roar that could be heard nowhere else. \u00a0Moreover, the result of this sound was horrifying. \u00a0There was a big divot in the head of the Iron Golem's hard head. \u00a0If it was a living creature, it would have died instantly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, when the Guardian Knight's sword impacted on the Iron Golem, it also revealed a gold light.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puhl-jjuhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The one to avenge the Iron Golem was the Death Knight. \u00a0The Skeleton Steed leapt into the air. \u00a0Thanks to the Skeleton Steed's leap, the Death Knight was able to take a swing at the Guardian Knight's neck.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puh-uhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knight's sword cut at the left side of the Guardian Knight's neck. \u00a0A deep cut appeared on the Guardian Knight's armor, which was made from stone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how the battle between two Guardian Knights, three Golems and a Death Knight started.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This terrifying battle was filled with fearsome sounds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hoo-oohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the sound of the Guardian Knights swinging its heavy sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggwah-ahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was the Ogre Golem's stone axe hitting the body of the Guardian Knights.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggahhng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the sound of the Iron Golem resisting the fearsome attack of the Guardian Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roo!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then there was the sound of an enormous flame emanating from the Griffin Fire Golem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shweek! \u00a0Shweek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of it all, the sharp sounds of the sword being swung by the Death Knight was heard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Various sounds filled the battlefield, and small sounds were drowned out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, the Skeleton Warriors and the Skeleton Knight summoned with the Death Knight wasn't able to do much. \u00a0They were like dogs at the feet of fighting elephants. \u00a0They could struggle to not be stomped on by the elephant's feet, but that was all they could do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan threw his body in the battlefield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was the smallest combatant, and he looked like a shrimp entering into a fight between whales.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, there was no hesitation to Hyrkan's movements.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koong koong!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan deftly avoided the footsteps of the Golems and the Guardian Knights. \u00a0Each of their steps were filled with enormous power, and their footsteps shook the ground. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a flash, Hyrkan stuck to the leg of a Guardian Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan took in short breaths as he climbed up the leg of the Guardian Knight as if it was a cliff.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-oohng, koo-oohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He continuously climbed this shaking cliff. \u00a0It was impossible to do such a feat with just pure strength.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this task was easy for Hyrkan. \u00a0He had learned climbing in the virtual space, and it was something he was better than anyone in the world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It really was as if Hyrkan was walking across a flat ground. \u00a0He quickly went up the leg of the Guardian Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggoohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he climbed, he stuck a Skeleton Fragment in any cracks he came across. \u00a0Hyrkan continued to climb up after placing these Skeleton Fragments, and they took shape as Skeleton Warriors. \u00a0They looked like ticks that lived parasitically on one's skin. \u00a0Moreover, these Skeleton Warriors were letting out white breath from their mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Warriors showed the path Hyrkan had taken. \u00a0Hyrkan climbed atop the Guardian Knight's back, and he moved towards the right shoulder. \u00a0Seven Skeleton Warriors had taken form behind him, and they attempted to injure the body of the Guardian Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, from the perspective of the Guardian Knight, it was as if it was being attacked by mosquitoes. \u00a0Still, this was also the reason why it couldn't leave them alone. \u00a0They were poking at its body, so how could it leave them be?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Guardian Knight tried to dislodge the Frost Skeleton Warriors when it had the luxury to do so.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When it did, the Ogre Golem and the Griffin Fire Golem used this opportunity to attack the Guardian Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In such a situation, the Guardian Knight didn't have the luxury to pay attention to Hyrkan, who had climbed up to its right shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'll start with the shoulder.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan planted his sword in the Guardian Knight's right shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek! \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His sword was able to pierce 10 centimeters. \u00a0However, his sword was having a hard time penetrating deeper.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead, he felt an increased resistance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There is something underneath it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the Guardian Knight's left hand came flying in toward Hyrkan, who was on its shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Tsk.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan dodged the hand, and he moved to the nape of the Guardian Knight's neck. \u00a0Then he immediately climbed down towards its back. \u00a0Of course, the Guardian Knight's hand couldn't easily reach that spot. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggwah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While the Guardian Knight was distracted, the Ogre Golem's stone axe impacted on the Guardian Knight's body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As usual, a large boom rang out, and the Guardian Knight's body was rocked. \u00a0The Guardian Knight ignored Hyrkan again, and it looked at the Ogre Golem. \u00a0It swung its sword towards the Ogre Golem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan quickly climbed to the shoulder region again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I can't stab it...\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He planted a Bone Explosive within the wound he created.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'll just blow it up.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Bone Explosive exploded immediately.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he wasn't satisfied with just detonating the Bone Explosives. \u00a0The region affected by the explosion became frozen. \u00a0At that moment, the Guardian Knight tried to move its left arm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zzuh-juhk, zzuh-juhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ice stuck to the right shoulder couldn't take the rough movements of the Guardian Knight. \u00a0It started to crack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the ice also made the Guardian Knight move slower.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn't the end of the attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Knights stuck to the body of the Guardian Knight, and their added power of Frost was slowly making the Guardian Knight heavier and unresponsive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he saw this, Hyrkan took out a new Bone Explosive.</span></p><br/><p>9.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-oohnng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Guardian Knight took a knee, the ground shook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The kneeling Guardian Knight was full of wounds.

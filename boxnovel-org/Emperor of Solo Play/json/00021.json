Their methods of doing so were called Doping Recipes.</p><br/><p>Doping Recipes of Rankers even sold for money, and in-game doping potion recipes and materials sold for a rather high price. This was one reason why raids took an enormous sum of money.</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun, of course, had his own Doping Recipe. However, he could never sell it for money.</p><br/><p>Cling\u2026 Cling\u2026</p><br/><p>In front of An Jaehyun was a large cup the size of a glass of beer than a coffee mug. 2/3 of the glass was filled with coffee, while An Jaehyun dropped several mysterious white objects into it. These white objects weren\u2019t sugar cubes, but the glucose candy he often ate.</p><br/><p>He continued to pour in glucose candy, so much so that he wasn\u2019t putting candy in his coffee, but his coffee soaked in candy. An Jaehyun did not stop until the coffee was on the brink of overflowing. Then, he lightly sipped his coffee. Tasting the mixture of cheap sweetness and cheap bitterness, An Jaehyun frowned.</p><br/><p>The reason others didn\u2019t try An Jaehyun\u2019s Doping Recipe was obvious. Although caffeine and sugar were both great for energizing the brain, it was too barbaric.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ugh, too bitter.\u2019</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun himself knew how barbaric his method was. But as he had no money to work with, this was the best method, and its effect was clear. With just a sip, he woke up from his previously sleepy state and his mind became clear.</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright, let\u2019s see what new things happened while I was asleep.\u2019</p><br/><p>Now completely awake, An Jaehyun turned on his tablet PC and began to look through Warlord-related news.</p><br/><p>[Hydra Guild, First to Discover Level 100 Monster. Preparing their Hunt.]</p><br/><p>The first news to catch his attention was news about the Hydra Guild.</p><br/><p>With the help of coffee and glucose candy, An Jaehyun quickly worked his brain.</p><br/><p>\u2018The first level 100 monster\u2026 Black Metal Warrior was it? Didn\u2019t they fail five or six times before they succeeded?\u2019</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun knew the future, but he didn\u2019t know everything. He only knew the general flow of it. The details, he would have to fill in by reading various news articles.</p><br/><p>\u2018I wish they\u2019d fail more while they\u2019re at it.\u2019</p><br/><p>To Hyrkan, the entire Top 30 Guilds was his enemy. Getting revenge aside, to become the best in Warlord, he had to go beyond the Top 30 Guilds.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Black Metal Warrior is related to the Corrupt Count main scenario quest, so the Corrupt Count quest line should begin after this. Tsk. I need to get on this quest line to obtain the titles I need, but with my level\u2026 ugh, not a chance. If only I came back just 10 months earlier\u2026 I\u2019d be the one killing that Black Metal Warrior. What a shame. Then I\u2019d be getting the title for myself too\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk.\u201d</p><br/><p>In any case, An Jaehyun enjoyed reading these news articles and reaffirming the details of the future he knew.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, no choice I guess. Looks like I\u2019ll have to make it up in The Immoral Prince, the next main scenario.\u201d</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun felt as if he had become almighty being.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Immoral Prince\u2026 back then, I could only stay in the side lines and suck on my fingers. But now is different. Come to think of it, the Ares Guild that led The Immoral Prince main quest earned quite the money from it.\u2019</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun let out a light grin.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yep. Be it the Hydra Guild or the Ares Guild, doesn\u2019t matter! I\u2019ll be the last one to laugh, hahaha!\u2019</p><br/><p>But this light grin\u2026</p><br/><p>[Stormhunter Queen defeats Head Hunter!]</p><br/><p>Became twisted as he read the next article.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Stormhunter Queen Choi Sulyeon.</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun got a headache just reading her name on the paper. With her, he had an irreconcilable relationship.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk!\u201d</p><br/><p>He even clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>Of course, An Jaehyun didn\u2019t want to continue seeing this name, but he couldn\u2019t just avoid the name altogether.</p><br/><p>\u2018If anything, I\u2019ll do it for you, Choi Sulyeon.\u2019</p><br/><p>Turning off his tablet PC, An Jaehyun drank his coffee bottoms up as if it was a glass of beer. He threw the remaining candy in the cup in his mouth.</p><br/><p>Then,</p><br/><p>Crunch!</p><br/><p>He bit down with all the anger he could muster.</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>Standing in front of a cave, Hyrkan turned on the flashlight app on his watch.</p><br/><p>Pat!</p><br/><p>A fist-sized sphere of light appeared from his watch. He grabbed a hold of the light sphere, and equipped it to the skull of the Skeleton Warrior next to him, making it look like he was wearing a miner\u2019s hat. Then, he smacked the Skeleton Warrior\u2019s head and yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo forth!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Skeleton Warrior lightly touched the place he was hit, then walked into the cave.</p><br/><p>As he watched the Skeleton Warrior go in, Hyrkan had a solemn expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll finish this in one go.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Rising Star title wasn\u2019t something that could be so easily obtained. Most players would fail even if they were given the chance.</p><br/><p>The reason?</p><br/><p>One had to clear what would normally be at least a level 20 quest at level 15. The quest difficulty was just too high. But that\u2019s why it was called the Rising Star title. It was for someone who could do at level 15 what others could at level 20. Only someone of such caliber would be worthy of being called a Rising Star.</p><br/><p>Plus, a 3-man party was the standard in Warlord. Quest difficulties were set with 3-man party being the standard. In other words, Hyrkan had to do alone what a 3-man party would find hard to do.</p><br/><p>It was in no way easy.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I can\u2019t do this at level 15, it just means it\u2019s too difficult for me to do.\u2019</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why he got to level 15. Though everything would come to waste if he leveled up during the quest, it was a risk he had to take. As he didn\u2019t have the capital to plaster himself with unique-rank items, this was the best he could do.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan pulled his sword out in advance, and lowered his stance. Concentrating on everything around himself and his Skeleton Warrior, he followed behind it. His concentration was now sharper than ever.</p><br/><p>\u2018Throw whatever you want at me.\u2019</p><br/><p>The smile beneath his hahoe mask was as frightening as a serial killer\u2019s. It demonstrated his confidence to catch whatever that\u2019s thrown at him.</p><br/><p>But after just 10 minutes, his smile shattered.</p><br/><p>With a snap of his finger, he yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnd Camera!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, irritated, he scratched his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cGarrggh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Why isn\u2019t there a single monster?\u2019</p><br/><p>For 10 minutes, Hyrkan remained tense, as if he was walking on a mine field. But nothing came out to greet Hyrkan. There wasn\u2019t even a single split path, which was common in a cave like this. He had been walking through the same, long path continuously.</p><br/><p>\u2018My whole body\u2019s itching.\u2019</p><br/><p>These 10 minutes have been mentally taxing. Hyrkan wasn\u2019t just walking; he was walking while maintaining peak concentration and tension. Furthermore, the limited vision from the darkness, the one way path, the unchanging scenery, and the enclosed space all caused more stress. It was like staring at a clock on the wall in a white room.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan hopped in spot and slashed in sword in thin air. It wasn\u2019t to warm-up his body, but rather his mind. Only after did the knot in his mind unravel. Hyrkan then reassessed his situation.</p><br/><p>\u2018Looks like there\u2019s something huge ahead.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hunting grounds had their own styles as well.</p><br/><p>Even at the same difficulty, some were difficult because of the sheer amount of monsters, while some were difficult because there monsters were more-powerful in place of being fewer in number.</p><br/><p>Anyone could tell that it was currently the latter.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s not so bad\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan thought it was better to fight against a few than multiple. This also lowered the chance of leveling up.</p><br/><p>\u2018But it\u2019s not necessarily good either\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Even so, it was hard to find comfort in this situation. In the end, he would have to face a strong monster.</p><br/><p>After organizing his thoughts, Hyrkan held his watch to his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cStart Camera.\u201d</p><br/><p>He began walking.</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>The Skeleton Warrior suddenly stopped on his feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? Walk! Go forward! Why\u2019d you stop?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even with Hyrkan\u2019s yelling, the Skeleton Warrior remained still in the darkness, turning around and staring at Hyrkan blankly.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s this, a protest? The thought only glanced by before it quickly disappeared.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan rejoiced.</p><br/><p>\u2018Could it be?\u2019</p><br/><p>He walked past the Skeleton Warrior, then stared at the empty space. He couldn\u2019t see a thing. Complete darkness blocked his sight, and not even the light on the Skeleton Warrior\u2019s head could shine light through it. Rather than darkness, it was as if there was a barrier made of darkness blocking their path.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan reached his hands out into this darkness.</p><br/><p>[Would you like to enter the stage?]</p><br/><p>Immediately, he heard an alert.</p><br/><p>\u2018As I thought, an instance dungeon.\u2019</p><br/><p>The darkness came from an instance dungeon.</p><br/><p>In Warlord, instance dungeons weren\u2019t too important. In fact, instance dungeons were often tied to quest. Once the quest was cleared, the instance dungeon would often disappear. This was why instance dungeons weren\u2019t too important. They couldn\u2019t be recycled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Instance dungeons had their pros and cons.</p><br/><p>The pro was that they were isolated from the outside. This prevented others from interfering and messing with whoever was inside. This was why guilds welcomed instance dungeons. They could do everything according to their plan. Furthermore, as instance dungeons required success on the first try, it served as a good symbol of achievement.</p><br/><p>But it was not without flaws.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can\u2019t run\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Though players were free to enter, they weren\u2019t free to leave.</p><br/><p>If it was a field, Hyrkan could simply run if he went up against something he could not handle. It wouldn\u2019t be wrong to say that an all-strength necromancer like him was built to escape. If it came down to it, he could use his Skeleton Warrior as bait and run. But this didn\u2019t work in instance dungeons. He couldn\u2019t leave before killing the monsters inside. He couldn\u2019t expect any outside help either.</p><br/><p>It was a true deathmatch.</p><br/><p>Because of this, Hyrkan let out a short groan.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what was inside. He couldn\u2019t escape either. He had no reinforcements. It was kill or be killed. With this in mind, the darkness in front of him was truly full of unfavorable conditions.</p><br/><p>Danger.</p><br/><p>Most players would choose to back out here. It was the logical thing to do.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s indeed dangerous.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan didn\u2019t deny this fact either. The risk was greater than he had expected.</p><br/><p>\u2018But there\u2019s more to obtain as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>The merit was bigger as well. Hyrkan organized the things he could obtain in his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Kill the monsters inside the instance dungeon alone, then acquire the Rising Star title\u2026 now, quest-related instance dungeons have a high chance to giving a related title. Since there won\u2019t be any outside interference, I just have to deal with whatever\u2019s inside. I don\u2019t need to worry about other monsters either. It\u2019s not like I lost any strength on my way here, and I\u2019m still in my top condition.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had a lot to lose.</p><br/><p>However, more so than ever before, he was sure of his current intuition.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I can film this well, it\u2019ll pull in a good amount of views.\u2019</p><br/><p>His intuition told him that this battle video would turn out great. It wouldn\u2019t be wrong to say he had full assurance.</p><br/><p>\u2018The baits are in place. I\u2019ll at least get ten thousand within two weeks.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Rising Star title and solo-clearing an instance dungeon had great synergy as bait. Furthermore, anyone could tell it was something not everyone could do.</p><br/><p>\u2018I mean, what crazy bastard would do something like this?\u2019</p><br/><p>Something not everyone could do. To earn money in Warlord, this was what one had to do.</p><br/><p>Far more people watched Warlord-related videos than did people play the game. What the viewers wanted to see was someone accomplishing something that was seemingly impossible. No one wanted to watch something that anyone could do.</p><br/><p>To earn money, one had to capture these viewers. The money one could earn in-game through hunting and item crafting was incomparable to the money one could earn from pay-to-watch videos. It was why guilds and Rankers challenged unfathomably strong monsters.</p><br/><p>Danger represented a chance to earn viewers!</p><br/><p>\u2018Once Skeleton Fragment cooldown ends, I\u2019ll go in.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan made his decision.</p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

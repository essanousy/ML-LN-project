Their imagination had been tinted by romanticism.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The world thought the Northland was now owned by the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0This was why no guild could insist on management rights, ownership rights or autonomous rights. \u00a0Moreover, the Hahoe Mask didn't plan on managing his territory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of it all, the Northland didn't have a castle or a town to use as a reset point. \u00a0The Users gathered in places, but these were very laughable locations. \u00a0It couldn't be considered to be waypoints. \u00a0Everyone returned to the Terube castle wall when they died.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why all kinds of behaviors that were considered to be bad manners were being carried out here. \u00a0No one in the near vicinity would stop these acts from being carried out. \u00a0No one was here to manage these lands. \u00a0It was a type of location where PK could be carried out if there was a problem with another User. \u00a0This was a legit method to buy significant amount of time against other Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At some point, the Northland turned into a lawless paradise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, those that were still surviving and playing in this lawless paradise of the Northland weren't normal Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow many were we able to get?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf we count those we caught a moment ago, we have a total of 17.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are earning a good income. \u00a0All the people here have pretty good Items. \u00a0If we stay here, we could probably gain enough money to play this game for a whole year.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These Users were like fighting dogs with their collars taken off. \u00a0The Users that took up PK as a job promoted this lawlessness in this lawless lands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were some that enjoyed this aspect of the game. \u00a0Warlord's system didn't stop PKs. \u00a0There were no penalties given. \u00a0Warlord actually had contents that accounted for Users that enjoyed PK.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, three Users were counting the number of wristwatches obtained through PK. \u00a0Moreover, they did something that added to the fun. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is as I predicted. \u00a0This will end all our problems if we wear this! \u00a0It'll end it! \u00a0I told you guys we should have used it earlier! \u00a0Even if I tell you good advice, you guys can't even comprehend it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0Good for you. \u00a0You are smart. \u00a0Why didn\u2019t you use that smart head of yours in college?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you trying to pick a fight with me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey! \u00a0Stop it! \u00a0It is very distracting to see people wearing the same masks fight each other.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The group consisted of a swordsman, a magician and a priest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They all held different Classes, but they were all borrowing the face of someone that was more famous than Ironman and Batman in Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStill, I can't believe the Hahoe Mask is working so well. \u00a0Everyone becomes afraid from just seeing this.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahoe Mask. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the identity of the masks they were wearing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, they didn't \u00a0have any relations to the actual Hahoe Mask. \u00a0They weren't even acquaintances. \u00a0If one had to put a label on the relationship, it was something like a connection between a star and his fans. \u00a0Currently, it was closer to victim and the identity thieves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, they weren't the only ones doing this. \u00a0It wasn't too hard to find Users wearing the Hahoe Mask in various towns and castles. \u00a0Moreover, there were a fair number of them that were using it to take advantage of the Hahoe Mask's reputation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was clear that the presence of the Hahoe Mask was the strongest across the Terube castle wall in the Northlands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis place is the Hahoe Mask's domain. \u00a0Of course, it is a matter of course.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStill, I become occasionally startled when I catch sight of one of us.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fact that the Hahoe Mask's reputationi was strong meant that this method was powerful and effective.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Most Users, who caught sight of the Hahoe Mask, in a hunting ground would find their hearts were trembling. \u00a0For the Hahoe Mask's fan, there was a possibility of coming across the real one. \u00a0The anticipation made their hearts tremble. \u00a0For those that crossed the Hahoe Mask before, it made their heart flutter from fear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one used their trembling heart against these Users, one would be able to have a good time. \u00a0These three Users were using it to their advantage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ooh-uh-uh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sound rang in their ears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It's a Hammer Head!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They recognized the owner of this distinctive roar. \u00a0As if it had been rehearsed, the three Users stopped their conversation, and they turned their head towards where the sound had emanated. \u00a0Afterwards, they smiled as they looked at each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShall we go gather up more wristwatches?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They aimed to attack the Users, who were in a desperate situation. \u00a0It was a very cheap thing to do, but the three of them didn't feel any compunction at carrying out this act.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's assess what he are working against, then let's get to work.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI hope we meet a juicy prey.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI might get addicted to this.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They quickly moved towards the ruckus to meet the new sacrificial lamb that was to their taste.</span></p><br/><p>7.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The User, who was wearing a Hahoe Mask and a magician's robe, swore. \u00a0He was in a rough shape. \u00a0It was as if he was wearing a layer of ice over his clothes. \u00a0Large chunks of ice were infused into the User's clothes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't a good feeling. \u00a0The chunks of Ice were cumbersome weights that restricted movement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Frost's power has invaded into your bones. \u00a0All Stats and movement speed will be decreased.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were in a jungle filled with overgrown vegetation. \u00a0It was muggy enough to be uncomfortable yet he was feeling a chill. \u00a0He was in an unpleasant and disagreeable state, but there was something that was more baffling than the cold.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What truly made the magician User be disconcerted was the Skeleton Warrior letting out a cold breath in front of his eyes. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The magician was like a parrot repeating his words. \u00a0Resist was a vocabulary that wasn't even present in Cervid\u2019s mind right now. \u00a0His actions were unbecoming of the mask he was wearing. \u00a0In Warlord, the Hahoe Mask signified a hero that possessed an indomitable will, power and excellence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, if his plight was explained to others, everyone would understand why he was acting this way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cervid had come face-to-face with the Skeleton Warriors. \u00a0Moreover, he saw a User that fit the Hahoe Mask the most standing behind these Skeletons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the real deal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was Hyrkan, who had ushered in this Third Age!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, there wasn\u2019t anything special that had lead Cervid to face the real Hahoe Mask as an enemy. \u00a0When their group saw a single User face off against the large monster Hammer Head, they didn't hesitate. \u00a0The three of them conducted a pre-emptive attack against this User. Afterwards, Cervid's two companions suffered the consequence of their pre-emptive attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once Cervid face the consequence of his actions, this would all be forgotten.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI...I'm sorry. \u00a0I'll give you all the watches. \u00a0Just spare me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Cervid finally came up with a sincere apology. \u00a0In reality, the apology was his only chance at getting out of this situation. \u00a0The only way he would be able to walk around the Terube castle wall alive would be through the Hahoe Mask's mercy and generosity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this didn't mean his two wrists would come out of this unharmed in any case.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, this Hahoe Mask wasn't the Hahoe Mask he had seen through countless videos.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The expensive armors were infused with Frost, and unlike the fiery eyes one could see through the helmets, the Skeleton Warrior's eyes were like sculpted ice that shone like gems. \u00a0There was a continuous white breath emitted from within the helmet, and the sound of its breathing was cold as ice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, it wasn't just the outer appearance. \u00a0They were emitting a cold that was frightening.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease! \u00a0I'll never do this again!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In front of this cold air, Cervid once again asked for forgiveness in a desperate voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan didn't answer Cervid's yell. \u00a0He flicked his finger twice as an answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Warriors on standby moved as if they had been waiting for this. \u00a0They attack all at once.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit! \u00a0You son of a bitch!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Cervid revealed his true feelings towards Hyrkan. \u00a0Before Cervid could curse any more with his words, the Skeleton Warriors chopped Cervid's body into pieces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan approached Cervid once the Hammerhead was taken care by his two Skeleton Knights.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When all the variables that could threaten him was dispatched, Hyrkan moved towards Cervid's corpse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He looked at the three that was wearing his symbol on their faces. \u00a0He honestly felt good about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Crazy bastards.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no reason why he should feel bad about it. \u00a0In the first place, the Hahoe Mask hadn't been created by Hyrkan. \u00a0It was something anyone could wear, and it wasn't hard to make.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Hyrkan didn't care if other people chose to wear it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I guess I've been living too much on the straight and narrow these days. \u00a0These bastards dare to put on the Hahoe Mask.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan didn't want to make the Hahoe Mask a symbol of justice. \u00a0Hyrkan wanted the image of the Hahoe Mask to frighten even the skilled Users of the 30 great guilds, and this would in turn allow the skilled Users to vent their anger on those that tried to copy the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Well, I made some money thanks to them.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of it all, the Users that put on the Hahoe Mask were like monsters. \u00a0There was no consequences in attacking them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After taking all the watches, Hyrkan turned to look at the Skeleton Warriors and Skeleton Knights. \u00a0A smile finally formed when he looked at them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a smile that came out when he felt satisfaction at the effect of the Ancient Power of Frost.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It\u2019s beyond expectation.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After leaving the Frozen Kingdom, he continued to hunt and level up as he headed towards the Terube castle wall. \u00a0At the same time, he started checking and analyzing the power of Frost.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The result of this power was the best. \u00a0The smile on his face was an understatement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After seeing the abilities displayed by his Skeleton Underlings, it wasn't enough to give them a perfect score.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the power of Frost was imbued into them, his Skeleton Underlings\u2019 All Stats and mobility was increased by 20%. \u00a0Moreover, the Chill was very useful in effecting nearby enemies. \u00a0As one became exposed to it longer, the Chill effect changed into the Frostbite effect.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Frost Golem was also the best. \u00a0When it appeared, it immediately made all enemies feel the Chill. \u00a0It couldn't be compared to the Earth Golem, which could only use the Hardening skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then there was the Frost Bone Armor. \u00a0It froze anyone that came in contact with the Frost Bone Armor. \u00a0It was useful in hunts and PK battles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The one that exceeded expectation the most was the Bone Explosives. \u00a0When the Bone Explosives reinforced by the power of Frost was detonated, the explosion gave much more damage than before, and it froze anything in the radius of the explosion. \u00a0It could quickly give the Frostbite effect to the enemies, and it was also great at interfering with the mobility of the target.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it wasn't as if there weren't any downsides.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The magical energy is consumed much faster than I had expected....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Ancient Power of Frost was activated, any Skills that benefited from the power of Frost consumed 2.2 times more magical energy. \u00a0It also meant that it took him 2.2 times more magical energy to maintain his summons. \u00a0In recent days, he hadn't thought his Magic Power stat was lacking, but now he wasn't unable to summon all his Skeletons with the power of Frost activated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only thing he found lacking was the fact that the power of Frost was only applied to the Summon Skill Tree. However, he had already been aware of this fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, the power of Frost was incredible. \u00a0If everything had worked out as planned, he would have still been drunk on this power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018That bitch Shir probably has something comparable.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, at that moment, Hyrkan wasn't the only one that possessed this surprising power. \u00a0This fact made him worry more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan turned his gaze away from the Skeleton Warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018How long will I have to fight that bitch? \u00a0That's the question I'm curious about now.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The rumors regarding famous people usually spread like wildfire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahoe Mask and the Storm Queen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the rumors regarding the two most famous Users in Warlord spread much faster than a wildfire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the case of the Storm Queen, it wasn't really rumors. She had started advertising herself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She didn't show any hesitation in showing off the Ancient Power of Flame to the people that were interested in the Stormhunters guild through footage. \u00a0The Storm Queen was using powerful yet diverse set of Skills that was infused with the power of the Flame. \u00a0The presence of the Storm Queen surprised the Users, and her competitors felt at a loss.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Isn't this too much of a cheat? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The other Users can't measure up to them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Will all the Ancient Power be able to do that? \u00a0Or is this unique to her Skills?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Shit. \u00a0If I was born with a gold spoon in my mouth, I would have been able gain that too! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 It isn't just about the golden spoon. Even if you had founded Tobo Soft, you wouldn't be able to gain that power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 I agree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the case of the Hahoe Mask, everything was a rumor. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask hadn't revealed what he had earned in his ventures. Instead, the rare footages that were taken by Users was the origin of the rumors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These weren't the usual Skeleton unit used by the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0This Skeleton army left behind traces of Frost. \u00a0It was clear evidence that the Hahoe Mask had gained a new power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the emergence of the Frost Skeletons! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if these Skeletons were tailor made for the Hahoe Mask, so of course, the Users were interested in it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- He's the Lich King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Yes, he's the Lich King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Lich King sounds a bit tacky. \u00a0Since the Hahoe Mask is incredible wealthy, how about we call him Rich Lich?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 That's pretty good. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 I agree with Rich Lich! \u00a0Let's make this happen! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, there were other issues that dominated the news.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was the release of the Second Advancement Skills, and the battle footages displayed by the upgraded Users were much more fancy. \u00a0Moreover, more information about the Ancient Power content was slowly trickling out, and it was enough to put a firm grip on the interest of the Users. \u00a0It was that appealing. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The new contents were fun even for the lower ranking guilds that were below the 30 great guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the market was now overflowing with contents from Warlord Users. \u00a0There was the live broadcasts, youtube live stream, paid videoes, pay-per-view tickets and the marketing market. \u00a0The market was reaching its peak. \u00a0It was hard to fathom before, but people were able to gain fame and money through playing a game well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Renaissance was in full swing! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying the start of the Renaissance era, the Hahoe Mask\u2019s Frozen Kingdom footage was revealed to the world.</span></p><br/><p>8.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou did well! \u00a0You did really well!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Romani ended his conversation, he threw the headset on his head backwards towards his bed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He clenched his fist as he sat on the chair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018We finally did it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Recently, Romani hadn\u2019t had a proper night of sleep. \u00a0He couldn't remember when he had a proper night of sleep. \u00a0That was how hard the recent days were.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, at that moment, Romani felt pleased instead of being tired. \u00a0It was almost enough to make him develop insomnia.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I would have never expected to work on a same project with such great people. \u00a0I never would have expected to produce such an amazing product!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Romani raised his clenched fist above his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everything had started with the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0Hahoe Mask had sent a massive amount of footage. \u00a0The footage of the Frozen Kingdom wasn't measure in minutes. \u00a0It was a 20 days worth of footages. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask didn't make an order. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask asked a question that was closer to being a request. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wanted to make a long piece that lasted 2 to 3 hours. \u00a0He wanted to know if Romani would be able to make it like a movie.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he received the question, he flat out refused to do it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a massive difference between editing footage to make a short film and making a movie. Romani's ultimate goal was to produce movies, but Romani knew better than anyone that he still had a long way to go. \u00a0He wasn't confident in his current capabilities.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'I apologize. \u00a0It is impossible to do this by myself....' \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he gave his answer, the Hahoe Mask asked another question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't mind bringing in others to collaborate on the project. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask was willing to foot the bill, and he wanted Romani to, at the very least, attempt it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that point, Romani started to inquire through his contacts. \u00a0He got a hold of people that worked around the movie industry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if people had been waiting for this day, incredibly famous people in the industry started contacting him to work on the project. \u00a0There were even skilled veterans within Hollywood that were pushing for this opportunity. \u00a0Even one of the top line directors, who produced a movie with a budget of several hundred millions, were giving him enthusiastic advices.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The people on the project received salaries that were pennies on the dollars compared to their reputation, yet they were all participating in this project with a fervor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Yes. \u00a0Everyone had been thirsty.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the passion exhibited by these individuals weren't based on money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, the world called Virtual Reality was changing this era. \u00a0\u00a0Moreover, they were able to acquire the best ingredients that could be acquired in the world right now. \u00a0The Warlord's best player, the Hahoe Mask, had provided the ingredients, and they wanted to make a proper film!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a product that had been created by like-minded individuals, and it was way above Romani's expectation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Romani could guarantee it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This film about Warlord.... \u00a0No, this might be a historical turning point in the VR movie industry.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the future, when movies staged in a VR were discussed by the movie executives, Romani and his associates would always be included in the discussion. \u00a0His work would be discussed with the previous greats he had grown up watching. \u00a0His work would be mentioned with the works of Quentin Tarantino, Spielberg and James Cameron.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It is unfortunate that the Academy Awards doesn't have a Virtual Reality category. \u00a0If it did, I'll be able to attend the Oscars.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Romany felt a laugh come on when he thought about attending the Academy Awards in a suit. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a happy thought, but at the same time, it was ridiculous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Huh?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Romani looked at his wrist. \u00a0The smart watch vibrated, and it informed him, who was calling him.

This simple action allowed him to form a formation where his Skeleton underlings attacked from the front and the back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since the Skeletons were fighting one type of monster here, they had become specialist after fighting the same monsters several hundred times. \u00a0The Skeleton Warriors and Skeleton Knight held the numerical advantage, and they were placed in advantageous positions by Hyrkan. \u00a0The outcome of the battles were basically settled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The one-sided battle continued to happen. \u00a0It was so one-sided that Hyrkan didn't have the chance to do anything! It was so bad that he could take his eyes off the battle. \u00a0He watched some unknown guild's Raid video.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In many ways, the Catacombs Dungeon was too ideal for Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJeez! \u00a0Really!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would have been perfect except for one thing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy did another dead-end appear here! \u00a0Why? What's the reason? I just want to go forward!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Catacombs was a maze Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-ahhh. Really!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was pretty poor at finding the right route in the maze type Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If it wasn't for this fact, the exploration of the Catacomb would have been like a vacation instead of work.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This one factor drove Hyrkan nuts. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you looking at? Shut your mouth!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Hyrkan became hysterical towards the Skeleton Warrior, who was staring at him with its mouth open.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the light within the Skeleton Warrior's eyes changed. \u00a0The two globes within the socket of the skull started to burn.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was the Skeleton Warrior resentful at being exploited? Was it angry towards its vicious master, who beat on it whenever he had a free time? \u00a0Did the Skeleton finally snap?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, that wasn't the case.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the light within its eyes changed, the Skeleton Warrior immediately turned around. \u00a0It looked towards its back. The light above the Skeleton Warrior's head illuminated the surrounding, and a Chimera Skeleton came into its view.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Warrior got ready to charge into battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan moved before the Skeleton Warrior could move. \u00a0Hyrkan raised Ivan's Sword, and he charged in towards the Chimera Skeleton before his Skeleton Warrior could get there. \u00a0The battle started immediately.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sword was hovering around the Chimera Skeleton like a satellite, and his constant sword swings crushed the Chimera Skeleton's armor. \u00a0He broke its bones, and when a thick piece of bone was cut away, he tossed it far into the distance. \u00a0The sight made one feel sorry for the Chimera Skeleton. \u00a0The battle was that one-sided.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The battle reached its peak when Hyrkan was successful in stealing the Chimera Skeleton's skull. \u00a0When he stole the skull, he let his Skeleton Warrior finish the battle, and he started to have fun by hitting the skull as if it was a bongo drum.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been a week since he had entered the Catacombs. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a solution he had found, which relieved his hysteria.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Those who Find the Wall] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Stamina +2 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Recently he had gained a new Title. \u00a0Ahn-jaehyun tightly closed his eyes when he saw it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit. \u00a0I received this one again.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Those who Find the Wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a maze type Dungeon, one acquired this title when one encounters a certain number of dead-ends.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Title Option wasn't that great. These were Titles one could only gain when one finds a deadend. \u00a0Users with time on their hands intentionally searched out deadends to gain these Titles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, when one received this title unintentionally, it caused anger instead of happiness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Quest isn't progressing at all.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason why Anh-jaehyun was mad.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, the Catacombs Dungeon was Ahn-jaehyun's most optimal hunting ground. \u00a0The EXP given was quite high, so the level up pace was very good. \u00a0Moreover, the hunt wasn't difficult, so he barely used any consumable Items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the Quest progress was basically stalled compared to the hunting speed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Catacomb Dungeon's maze was bigger than expected, and it was complicated. \u00a0Moreover, the maze was pitch black, so it increased the difficulty of clearing the maze. \u00a0On top of all of that, he had no clue on how to solve mazes. \u00a0From Ahn-jaehyun's perspective, the maze was driving him crazy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'm sure Users, who are good at this kind of stuff, would have solved this immediately. \u00a0Why is my luck so poor?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, luck was a big factor in all of this. \u00a0If he had luck on his side, he would be able to get past this place in a single breath.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This fact was evident by seeing the map of the Catacomb Dungeon that was being updated by Ahn-jaehyun. If a User was lucky, the maze map would look simple and fragmented.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Ahn-jaehyun's map was too detailed. \u00a0He had run into too many walls, and he had marked all the dead-ends he had encountered. \u00a0He had so many route marked that he could sell it later as a comprehensive map.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it just made Ahn-jaehyun's insides burn.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This game is a real mother fucker.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Ahn-jaehyun had to take an emergency measure to help his sour stomach. \u00a0He didn't take a digestive medicine. \u00a0He used a more sure-fire method. He checked the current summary of his bank account.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A happy smile formed around Ahn-jaehyun's lips when he saw the balance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018My stomach feels full from just looking at this.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">With the help of his successful Waltz video, he was getting a constant stream of ad money and donations. He even received support fund from his recently signed sponsor. The amount was quite large.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he wanted to, he could immediately leave his one room behind. He could probably find a 20-30 pyeong apartment near the metropolitan area. \u00a0He would be able to purchase a small or medium sized apartment. He would also be able to buy a car with a lump sum.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Ahn-jaehyun's standards differed from others.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I save a little bit more, I can purchase a level 130 Unique defensive Set. \u00a0Shall I buy it for my Skeleton Knight? \u00a0No, it might be better to equip all my Skeleton Magicians with Unique Rank weapons. Should I purchase a Skill book? \u00a0If the Skeleton Magicians can use the Dark Flame skill.... \u00a0However, a single Skill book is worth 10,000 gold, and it is rarely put up on the market. \u00a0Maybe it would be better if I just abandon that idea?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun's thought about his happy \u00a0troubles made him thirsty, so he opened his fridge. \u00a0In a surprise, he decided to take out the milk carton. \u00a0Ahn-jaehyun didn't even bother to pour the milk into a cup. \u00a0He just drank it straight out of the carton.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The milk was more expensive than Ramen, but Ahn-jaehyun downed the whole thing. \u00a0He smiled with a milk mustache on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This makes me feel like I\u2019ve been a bit successful.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The milk helped erase the sensation of his insides burning. \u00a0It disappeared like melting snow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun once again focused on the map on the Tablet PC. \u00a0He calmly thought it over as he looked at the map.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'I've pretty much discovered every route. \u00a0I just have to be patient. \u00a0It'll be done soon. \u00a0Yes, there is no reason why I have to get discouraged. \u00a0You weren't wrong, Ahn-jaehyun.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After regaining his calm, the light within Ahn-jaehyun's eyes became cold.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan noticed the definite change. \u00a0He caught sight of a Chimera Skeleton wearing a different armor. \u00a0It was very similar to the ones he had seen up until now, but Hyrkan didn't miss the clear difference.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I finally get to see it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had searched for a difference, and he had found a faint emblem imprinted on the armor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was circular emblem, where three snakes were biting each other's tails! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The three snakes are Prince Dean's Crest. \u00a0I finally get to see it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In one viewed the world of Warlord, there was a faction, who had the most territory and the strongest forces. \u00a0\u00a0In the era of the monsters, the Hiban kingdom was at the frontline of fighting the monsters. \u00a0When the third prince was born, castle of Bayan was given to the prince.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before he was born, the great Archmage Bokan gave the prince a name. The name implied the prince would drive away the nightmare descending on the world with martyrs on his side. The name he had given was Dean. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, as the father and king ruling over the Hiban kingdom, the prince was given the title of Un Northland. \u00a0It meant he was the protector of the Northern lands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bayan Dean Un Northland.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the crest with the three snakes was bestowed on him. \u00a0The three snakes was named Martial Arts, Wisdom and Destiny. \u00a0He was symblolized as being the trigon prince.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I've finally arrived at the edge.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the power of Corruption left over by the Fallen Kingdom was found, Prince Dean sought to steal the throne with his new found power. \u00a0He had conducted numerous evil deeds as he dreamed about creating his own era. \u00a0He was the Immoral Prince.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The tracks of Prince Dean had finally appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It meant Hyrkan was on the right path. \u00a0It was evidence that he was carrying out the Immoral Prince episode correctly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hyrkan didn't care about the epic storyline related to Prince Dean.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The important thing right now was that he had discovered a Chimera Skeleton wearing an armor engraved with Prince Dean's crest. \u00a0Basically, he had found the breadcrumbs left behind by Hansel and Gretel. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I can finally get out of the Catacombs now.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he followed the breadcrumbs, he'll find the witch's house, then the delicious cookies making up the house will show itself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan raised his head as he looked into the darkness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-sulyun was checking out someone's youtube page through her smartphone. \u00a0A slight wrinkle formed on her cold face. \u00a0The wrinkle had formed near her bewitching eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Why isn\u2019t he uploading any videos of it? \u00a0I purposefully special ordered it from a designer.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was akin to gifting your significant other with a handmade scarf. This was like the boyfriend coming to the next date without the scarf around his neck. \u00a0This was how she felt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, she had never felt this kinds of feelings before, so she couldn't identify what was fouling her mood like this. \u00a0The fact that she couldn't identify this feeling meant it kept worsening her mood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the smart phone's screen suddenly changed. \u00a0It was an incoming phone call. The call was coming from the Stormhunters guild. \u00a0It was Hatch. \u00a0It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that he received the most abuse from Che-sulyun in the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Master. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is it?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Uh\u2026\u2026. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the effect of him being constantly berated by her. \u00a0Hatch felt nervous when he heard Che-sulyun's voice. He knew he was sticking his hand into boiling oil.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unfortunately, he had to continue on with his conversation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- There is someone, who wants to speak directly to master.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs he someone important?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- At the very least, he is more famous than me. \u00a0He also possesses very high level, and he holds a high position. \u00a0His rank is a bit too ambiguous to describe it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The light in Che-sulyun's eyes changed when she heard the expression he used. \u00a0There was only one organization within Warlord where that particular turn of phrase was used to describe them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you talking about a head of the Hydra guild?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Yes. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hydra guild. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The nine heads possessed ranks that differentiated them, but at the same time, they were all heads. \u00a0They were treated as equals. \u00a0The organization didn't have the structure of boss, officers and underling. This was why their ranks were described as being a bit ambiguous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this wasn't the immediate point she wanted to go over. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJust say he is from the Hyrdra guild. \u00a0Do you really have to speak in such a roundabout way?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The person insisted I describe it like that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs he next to you?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Yes. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid you secretly make some kind of deal with a head of the Hydra guild?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- No way! I am contracted to be within the Stormhunters until 2050. \u00a0I would never dare to do such an act. The other side approached me first. \u00a0He wants to have a conversation about a Quest, and he asked to speak to someone of similar rank as him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The heads of the Hydra guild was similar in rank as the Stormhunter's guild master. \u00a0Che-sulyun was the only \u00a0one, who fit the description.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason why Hatch had to call her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was the fact that Che-sulyun wasn't in a good mood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-sulyun immediately answered him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI bet he is trying sound out the relationship between our guilds. \u00a0If he wants a conversation, then tell him to go through the official channel. \u00a0The one, who wants something, should be the one crawling on the floor.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- What? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before Hatch could reply, the call ended.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The screen immediately changed to the Youtube page she had been viewing. \u00a0However, there was a slight change on the screen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had uploaded a new video. \u00a0The light within Che-sulyun's eyes changed as she played the new video.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the video, a User wearing a Red Skeleton set appeared. A slight smile formed on Che-sulyun's lips when she saw the figure. \u00a0When the video ended, she immediately called Hatch's phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Ah, master! He says this business is really important. \u00a0I'm sure this is a negotiation regarding the Main Scenario Quest....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll take the call now, so make room for him.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- What? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDidn't you say he is next to you? Give him the phone.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After several seconds, she heard someone else's voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I'm the 5th head. \u00a0We've acquired a crucial clue regarding the Main Scenario Quest. \u00a0We want to carry out the Quest with your guild.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

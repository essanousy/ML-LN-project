Hey, Quiyote! Quiyote! Snap out of it! Don\u2019t tell me you logged out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Quiyote\u2019s friends were poking him, trying to console him while making fun of him at the same time. </p><br/><p>Hyrkan watched them from an appropriate distance.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026 doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019re going to attack me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan wasn\u2019t watching them because he didn\u2019t have anything better to see.</p><br/><p>Although people may issue a fair challenge at first, it wasn\u2019t rare to change the moment they lost. </p><br/><p>Hyrkan had experienced such happenings more than most people. Before returning to the past, his fame was closer to notoriety. </p><br/><p>At the same time, Hyrkan\u2019s battle style wasn\u2019t exactly knightly. It was dirty in a way, but the biggest reason it angered people was its overwhelming result. In a fight, it seemed appropriate for fighters to trade an arm for a wrist. However, it wasn\u2019t the case for Hyrkan. The way he overwhelmed his opponents gave his opponents a sense of hopelessness. Ones who thought they were good at fighting were devastated and put to place.</p><br/><p>In any case, Quiyote and his friends didn\u2019t seem like they would go against their words. </p><br/><p>That only meant one thing. </p><br/><p>\u2018Time to get my pay.\u2019</p><br/><p>The 5,000 gold was for the winner, and the wristwatch was the right of the winner.</p><br/><p>Once he received these, Hyrkan planned to leave without turning back. After all, he had received money to make up for his reason being there. Moreover, Hyrkan was quite interested in Quiyote\u2019s watch. </p><br/><p>\u2018If that gives me a weapon, I can probably swim in meat for a few days.\u2019</p><br/><p>Quiyote\u2019s armor was the White Mamba set. However, it was of a different design than what the player Hyrkan met last time had. It was likely made by a different person. In any case, it was an expensive one. Although each of the White Mamba set items had good options, its set effect was truly amazing. It was better than wearing a Unique item.</p><br/><p>At this point, the most expensive items were those between level 70 and 90. Not only did players at these levels start playing from the beginning, but they were also the type to spend enormous amount of money on games. If not, unless they had the talent and ability like Hyrkan, it was impossible to enter the level range. Plus, because they could easily resell any items they are done using, the price on items had a lot of bubbles attached to it. Since they could sell it for almost the exact amount they had bought it for, there was no reason to not spend a large sum of money. </p><br/><p>There was no way that someone wearing a White Mamba set, especially one that would agree on 5,000 gold for a duel, would have spared money on weapons.</p><br/><p>If a weapon dropped from the watch, Hyrkan would truly have hit the jackpot!</p><br/><p>No, it would be a jackpot even if he got any one of the White Mamba set. </p><br/><p>\u2018This is why people have to live kindly.\u2019</p><br/><p>While Hyrkan was thinking some nonsense, Quiyote, who had remained speechless for a while, finally got up. </p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re finally up. Idiot. Why would you call 5,000 gold for a challenge fee?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a waste. You should\u2019ve gone to a club with that instead.\u201d </p><br/><p>His friends each gave him some words. Quiyote simply ignored them and walked towards Hyrkan. Hyrkan stared back at Quiyote through his Hahoe Mask with his guard down. Watching Hyrkan\u2019s attitude, Quiyote took off his helmet. A handsome, blonde and blue-eyed man showed his face.</p><br/><p>He looked at Hyrkan and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>\u2018Amazing.\u2019</p><br/><p>To Quiyote, his battle with Hyrkan was a nightmare. Everything he had thought of before the fight had gone to waste. He couldn\u2019t do anything against the situation he was put under. Everything was outside of his expectations and outside of his imaginations. He was toyed with ruthlessly.</p><br/><p>However, to Quiyote, his battle with Hyrkan felt newer than any fight he had ever had before.</p><br/><p>It went past the level of new and reached the level of touching.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah, this is a real fight!\u2019</p><br/><p>The duels Quiyote had until now was exchange of different skills to see who could deal more damage. That was it. It was something one could find in a simple console or PC game much less a VR game.</p><br/><p>However, it was different with Hyrkan. In a virtual world that was as real as the real world, Hyrkan used every gap in his movement to attack.</p><br/><p>This is what a real fight is like! Hyrkan seemed to be saying so.</p><br/><p>Dirty? Cheap? In a war where lives were at risk, such words were flattery. It wasn\u2019t a game of sports. The goal wasn\u2019t to score more points than the opponent.</p><br/><p>\u2018I want him as my teacher.\u2019</p><br/><p>In this sense, the battle with Hyrkan became a turning point for Quiyote. Quiyote felt like he finally opened his eyes. From the bottom of his heart, he wanted to learn to fight under Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Quiyote\u2019s pride didn\u2019t let him bow his head.</p><br/><p>As such\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI learned a lot. I\u2019ll come to challenge you again one day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Quiyote took off the weapon he was wearing from his item slot and gave it to Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the payment for this battle as well as the next.\u201d</p><br/><p>This sword was the single most expensive item in Quiyote\u2019s possession.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan stared at the weapon for a moment.</p><br/><p>He had felt the matter became a bit more complex.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm.\u2019</p><br/><p>He did want the weapon. However, by his calculation, it could be more profitable to receive 5,000 gold and the watch. After all, there was a chance the watch might drop the weapon. In that case, he would receive both the gold and weapon.</p><br/><p>However, the situation wasn\u2019t one where he could accept the latter. </p><br/><p>A challenger who accepted his loss and promised a next time had a right to receive proper treatment. </p><br/><p>Moreover, such an experience was extremely rare for Hyrkan. Most people who lost to him did not do as they promised, but cursed out in anger.</p><br/><p>\u2018What an interesting guy.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan received the weapon and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour name?\u201d </p><br/><p>\u201cQuiyote. No, it\u2019s Don Quiyote.\u201d</p><br/><p>Don Quiyote. </p><br/><p>That was Quiyote\u2019s full in-game name. He had misspelled Don Quixote as Don Quiyote during character creation. To hide his mistake, he introduced himself as Quiyote instead of Don Quiyote. </p><br/><p>When Hyrkan heard his name.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan remembered.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Challenger Don Quiyote. This is him?\u2019</p><br/><p>The Challenger Don Quiyote.</p><br/><p>While Hyrkan was making a name for himself as the Hero Slaughterer, although it wasn\u2019t as much as Hyrkan, there was another player that made his name known through PvP. Hyrkan never had the chance to meet him. Although his PvP skills were monstrous, he wasn\u2019t interested in making it his main focus. He only became renowned for his PvP skills because countless number of people picked fights with him.</p><br/><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t recognize him because his skills were too low.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan was slightly surprised. The Don Quiyote he knew was skilled enough to be called The Challenger. However, the one he faced this time was just average. If he won against someone at his level, it would only be because of his items.</p><br/><p>Of course, he would become better as time went on. It wasn\u2019t rare for players to suddenly make great advancements through certain events. Perhaps, today\u2019s battle could even be that event. </p><br/><p>Hyrkan smiled lightly.</p><br/><p>Who would have thought I\u2019d meet someone like him in such a way?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon Quiyote. I\u2019ll remember it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Life is funny, eh?\u2019</p><br/><p>At this instant, although it was only for an instant, Hyrkan thought Warlord was fun after a long time.</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>[Orc Hero\u2019s Sword]</p><br/><p>* Main Properties:</p><br/><p>\u2013 Rare-rank item</p><br/><p>\u2013 Strength +66</p><br/><p>\u2013 Stamina +66</p><br/><p>\u2013 Required level: 60</p><br/><p>\u2013 Required condition: Minimum of 350 strength</p><br/><p>* Sub-properties:</p><br/><p>\u2013 Increases strength proportional to level</p><br/><p>\u2013 9% chance to ignore all monster\u2019s defense</p><br/><p>\u2013 9% chance to ignore animal-type monster\u2019s defense</p><br/><p>* Miscellaneous</p><br/><p>\u2013 A sword used by a Blue Orc mutant, the Orc Hero. After slaughtering through countless number of enemies, it obtained a mystical power to see through the enemy\u2019s weakness.</p><br/><p>\u2018Whoa.\u2019</p><br/><p>Immediately after Quiyote and his friends left, Hyrkan took off his mask and helmet, and checked the option of the sword he received. When he did, he couldn\u2019t stop himself from blinking in amazement. </p><br/><p>\u2018The OH Sword? Isn\u2019t this a Unique rank sword?\u2019</p><br/><p>Orc Hero\u2019s Sword.</p><br/><p>For swordsmen, especially strikers, it was known to be better than some Unique items.</p><br/><p>\u2018The last time I checked\u2026 15,000 gold, I think it was? I can sell it immediately for 13,000 at least.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was 15,000 gold in price.</p><br/><p>Although its supply wasn\u2019t too low, because of its popularity amongst level 60 swordsmen, it fetched a high price. As popular as it was, if one tried to sell it, he could do it within couple days. It was incomparable to the lion body suit he was still trying to sell.</p><br/><p>Of course, there was no reason for Hyrkan to sell this item.</p><br/><p>\u2018If it\u2019s this, who cares about magic power or the like.\u2019 </p><br/><p>Although weapons with magic power was ideal for Hyrkan, it was different if it was the Orc Hero\u2019s Sword. Rather than summoning another skeleton with the extra magic power, it would be much better for Hyrkan to swing this sword himself.</p><br/><p>\u2018To just give away something like this\u2026 just how rich is he?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan realized just how generous Quiyote was.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was possible because it was a game. When two people got into an argument and fought in the real world, one person wouldn\u2019t say, \u2018I like you. Here\u2019s my Rolex Watch, let\u2019s fight again.\u2019</p><br/><p>If Hyrkan was in his position, he would never have done such a thing.</p><br/><p>\u2018Quite the romantic, isn\u2019t he?\u2019</p><br/><p>In a way, Hyrkan was envious. It wasn\u2019t just that he had money, but that he could play Warlord in such a way. The fact that he could purely enjoy the game made Hyrkan jealous.</p><br/><p>To Hyrkan, Warlord was life. A way and means. Although there were times he enjoyed it, in the end, it was a tool for survival. Everything he did was for efficiency and result. Joy came afterwards. </p><br/><p>Hyrkan closed his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Making me all emotional\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Snap out of it, An Jaehyun. It\u2019s not the time to get all sentimental!\u2019</p><br/><p>After scolding himself, Hyrkan went back to his usual way of thinking.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is enough.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although it wasn\u2019t the lucky drop he was hoping for, it was one nonetheless. Furthermore, it gave Hyrkan confidence.</p><br/><p>\u2018With this, once I become level 60, I can hunt Bulkas Mountain Range\u2019s master, the Bear Warrior.\u2019</p><br/><p>Bulkas Mountain Range\u2019s master, the level 80 boss monster, Bear Warrior.</p><br/><p>It was a monstrous bear that walked on two legs, and carried a large sword that easily sent chills down the spine. </p><br/><p>His original plan had been to hunt it at late level 60s or even level 70. However, now that he had the Orc Hero\u2019s Sword, he could give it a try the moment he hit level 60. </p><br/><p>\u2018Good.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hunting the Bear Warrior was the starting point.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll hunt it, and officially begin the Immoral Prince scenario quest. It\u2019s going to be the start of me taking everything for myself.\u2019</p><br/><p>The start of the second main scenario quest!</p><br/><p>Hyrkan grinned.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s time to go find a useful weapon to use until level 60.\u2019</p><br/><p>With that, Hyrkan turned back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I go hunt just one more pack of Sword Monkeys?\u201d</p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

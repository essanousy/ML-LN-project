Isn\u2019t that the location of Hahoe Mask\u2019s recent hunt?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-L. He is still hunting inside the Highwood Forest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-L. Of course, everyone is aware of that fact. \u00a0It had been only couple weeks, since the Hahoe Mask uploaded the footage of him soloing the Wood Devil!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-L. No, he isn't hunting monsters anymore. \u00a0He is hunting down Big Smiles guild members.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These people enjoyed watching Warlord. \u00a0They were also interested in the User named the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0He made their hearts flutter from excitement. \u00a0They were very interested in the activities of the Hahoe Mask, since he attempted tasks that was considered to be impossible to solo. \u00a0They cheered when he overcame the odds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was able to solo Boss Monster Raids, and he was doing the Main Scenario Quest by himself. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he was able to oppose the 30 great guilds. \u00a0These exalted organizations were almost untouchable as if they were placed high in the sky, and even the influential Underfoot guilds could do nothing against them. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This made people become more fanatical about the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These people were romantics.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone could imagine themselves doing what the Hahoe Mask did. \u00a0While anyone could imagine doing it, the Hahoe Mask actually took action to make these ideas into reality.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This inflamed the romanticism inside the hearts of people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-Did he declare war against the Big Smiles guild?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-L No. \u00a0He says he is out for revenge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-L- Revenge? Against whom?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-L. Pitbull and the Hahoe Mask are friends. \u00a0Recently, the Big Smiles guild killed Pitbull. \u00a0He is avenging Pitbull.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-L. From what I heard, the Hahoe Mask didn\u2019t touch anyone except the 10 guild members, who hunted down Pitbull. \u00a0He even apologized to the unrelated party members for intruding on the hunt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the most important part of his plan. \u00a0Ahn-jaehyun had to sidestep the trappings of the romanticism his actions might evoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'I like where the public opinions are heading.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He sipped his coffee, and he looked at the reaction caused by his actions. \u00a0Ahn-jaehyun was satisfied.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Yes, this is the correct answer.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The act of fighting the 30 great guilds had a quality of romanticism. \u00a0Everyone could imagine doing it, yet no one could do it. \u00a0Of course, even the Hahoe Mask couldn\u2019t fight the 30 great guilds in a fair fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before he had returned to the past, he had felt this truth deep within his bones. \u00a0He had made enemies of the Stormhunters guild, and this had turned the entirety of the 30 great guilds against him. \u00a0He had fought them like a crazed dog. \u00a0However, he now realized how illogical and pointless such an act was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was especially true for Ahn-jaehyun, since it didn\u2019t make sense to cause a Game Over to all of his opponents, because they were wearing the same uniforms. \u00a0It was a dangerous way to play this game, and it was also stupid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Nothing good will come from messing with the normal guild members.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before he returned to the past, he had been very radical in his actions as the Hero Slaughterer. \u00a0He cut down anyone that got in his way. \u00a0This was why he was nicknamed the Slaughterer. \u00a0He never hesitated, and he had no mercy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he looked backed on it, he knew it had been a mistake. \u00a0It didn\u2019t matter how or why he killed the Users, but in the end, they were revived from their Game Over after 48 hours. \u00a0They would be made whole again, and their animosity towards him would grow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, the hatred mounted and the number of Users he wronged increased to a point where they took action by attacking the Hero Slaughterer..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, when the Stormhunters guild announced their war against the Hero Slaughterer Hyrkan, not everyone was willing to follow their lead. \u00a0The normal guild members hated being dragged into such conflicts. \u00a0There was no reason why they would enjoy it. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t as if killing a single User allowed them to gain treasures. \u00a0Moreover, if they weren\u2019t careful, there was a high risk that they would suffer a Game Over. \u00a0The normal guild members were basically being forced into the hunt, so why would they like such a scenario?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, once those normal guild members died at the hands of the Hero Slaughterer, their eyes flipped over from anger. \u00a0Even if they weren\u2019t told to catch Hyrkan, they threw their bodies towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be difficult to convince the first wave of Users to throw their bodies against him. \u00a0However, it wouldn\u2019t be too hard to convince the second and third wave of Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun applied the lesson he had learned to his current actions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'It is unnecessary to galvanize the regular guild members.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His targets had to precise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask left alone the Users, who had nothing to do with the attack on Pibtbull. \u00a0He only attacked the guilty, since they wouldn\u2019t be able to complain even if they were killed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, none of the Big Smiles guild members would clap their hands at the Hahoe Mask\u2019s actions. \u00a0They wouldn\u2019t be happy, but it would make them think. \u00a0It would make them wonder if it was worth messing with the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'The Big Smiles guild officers will now gather to come up with a plan.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The normal guild members will now want the higher ups to take care of the problem!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The normal guild members would choose to remain as spectators.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why the Hahoe Mask expressed to the normal guild members that he wasn\u2019t the enemy. \u00a0He even saved some, who were in trouble.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He used numerous methods. \u00a0He sometimes killed his target, and he retreated quickly. \u00a0He purposefully approached a Big Smiles guild party without any of his targets included within the group, and he struck up amicable conversations with them. \u00a0He even gave them permission to contact him, and he gave encouraging words to the hunt parties. \u00a0\u00a0From the perspective of the guild members, the Hahoe Mask\u2019s words were far from sounding friendly, but they felt relieved from not being PKed. \u00a0There were even times when the Hahoe Mask had saved a Big Smiles guild member in trouble during a hunt. \u00a0He also gave them tips on how to more effectively hunt down the Wood Devils.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone knew he wasn\u2019t doing this out of pure kindness, but they were thoroughly convinced that the Hahoe Mask would only attack his targets.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'In the past, this method wouldn\u2019t have worked.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, if the Hahoe Mask was someone insignificant, this would be a different story. \u00a0Every one of them would have attacked him on sight. \u00a0However, the Hahoe Mask was no longer a User that could be taken down by a single party.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the difference between the prior Hero Slaughterer Hyrkan, and the current Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He needed the current level of power to pull off this plan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hmmm.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had enough power now. \u00a0He was able to leisurely smell the coffee as he hummed a tune even as he faced an enemy called the 30 great guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'If I chase their tail like this, the Big Smile guild\u2019s reputation will suffer. \u00a0They\u2019ll try to catch me\u2026 \u00a0I would be very grateful if they chose to catch me using a bait and a small force.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The power he possessed gave him the luxury to be able to think a move ahead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This required power, and the current Ahn-jaehyun possessed that power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">9.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What did you just say?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We\u2019ve received information saying the Hahoe Mask had appeared within the Highwood Forest again. \u00a0I think it would be best to take a break today.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What are you talking about? You want to take a break?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The current situation is a bit muddled right now.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The speaker, Jigwan, was a Level 235 member of the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0He was a Ranked User, who operated while maintaining the very high level. \u00a0This was why he was flabbergasted by his comrade\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he maintained this dumbfounded look, he lightly swiveled his head to look at the atmosphere of his surrounding. \u00a0His party members had finished getting ready for the battle with the Wood Devil. \u00a0Some refused to meet his eyes, but others boldly met his eyes. \u00a0However, all of them were in disagreement with him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he quickly realized what was going on, so Jigwan gritted his teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You guys\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We aren\u2019t saying you did anything wrong. \u00a0You did good. \u00a0We are almost thankful that you took the initiative. \u00a0You went through with it. \u00a0At the very least, we won\u2019t be called cowards by others before we go into battle thanks to you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jigwan had been about to erupt in rage, but his comrade shut him up by talking over him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No\u2026\u2026\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"However, if a problem arises here, it\u2019ll be a detriment to you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed his comrade was determined to speak his mind. \u00a0It was as if he had prepared a speech for this eventuality, so he poured out his words towards Jigwan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It isn\u2019t as if the high ranking people will do anything for you. \u00a0It isn\u2019t as if they are ordering us to form a hunting party to catch the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0If you act too hastily, you are the only one, who will suffer.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hey!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The power of his rapid-fire words were very effective. \u00a0Jigwan was made momentarily speechless. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m sorry.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the short phrase, Jigwan shut his mouth as if a key had been turned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jigwan could no longer raise his voice. \u00a0His party member\u2019s words made Jigwan realize the underlying reasons behind the other User\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Shit.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This made Jigwan more angry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was so clear that he would have to accept the current reality.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'What did I do wrong!'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His anger turned towards the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'That damn bastard. \u00a0It is all the Hahoe Mask\u2019s fault\u2026.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, his anger moved on from the Hahoe Mask to a different existence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Why are we so afraid of a single person? \u00a0Why do I have to suffer like this, because of their cowardice?'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He focused his anger on the executive officers, who lead the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'I\u2019ve worked my butt off for the Big Smiles.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From the birth of the game of Warlord, he had gotten close to the members of this guild. \u00a0They were so close that they called each other hyung and dongsaeng. \u00a0His relationship with the other guild members spanned across a good amount of time, and this was why the betrayal hurt so much.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jigwan wasn\u2019t someone that would stand being treated so poorly. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was especially true, since his actions were all for the benefit of the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, he thought about the last time he was treated right.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'This would have never happened when Heh-bibin was in charge of the guild.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the past, their guild didn\u2019t have a guild master. \u00a0The executive officers ran the guild. \u00a0At the time, Heh-bibin had wielded a considerable amount of power within the guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During that time, Jigwan had been treated very well. \u00a0He was always given full support, and the small problems were taken care of by the guild. \u00a0The guild didn\u2019t even ask any questions when taking care of the problem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Heh-bibin also gave breaks to Users tired from leveling up by purposefully putting them in youtube videos or a live broadcast. \u00a0This resulted in them gaining some spending money from the appearance fee.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the very least, he wouldn\u2019t have been treated like a leper, because he had done something that needed to be done.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t the only one,who felt this way. \u00a0There was a significant number of members, who shared his view.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason why they supported Heh-bibin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Heh-bibin is right. \u00a0He is right about all of this.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason why they put their power behind Heh-bibin\u2019s ideas.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">10.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he heard Pitbull had been killed, Sinclair contacted the Hydra guild first. \u00a0If things went sideways here, he knew his life would get very complicated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Sinclair sent the Hydra guild a proposal. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wanted to resolve the current situation through war of words. \u00a0They could argue over who was in the wrong through words. \u00a0He suggested that they shouldn\u2019t worsen the current atmosphere by settling this through armed conflicts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the time, the tone of the conversation hadn\u2019t been too bad. \u00a0Unlike Sinclair\u2019s worries, the Hydra guild didn\u2019t seem inclined to fight them head on. \u00a0They were about to bury this incident in a quiet manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair was sure this had all been quietly resolved..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Hahoe Mask. \u00a0That damn bastard\u2026.:</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everything turned into a mess when the Hahoe Mask made his appearance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask started to avenge his friend\u2019s death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'That little bastard. \u00a0I never expected him to act this way.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask used a method he had never used before. \u00a0He only eliminated his targets. \u00a0He worked in an arrogant manner, and he avenged his friend in a way that was only possible for the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The method used by the Hahoe Mask turned out to be more troublesome than expected. \u00a0If the Hahoe Mask waged a war against the entirety of the Big Smiles guild, Sinclair would have used this opportunity to declare war on the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair had always wanted to kill the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0If he attacked out of his own volition, Sinclair would have been thankful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he hadn\u2019t done that. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask made this into a personal revenge play.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was now a private matter between Users. \u00a0If a 30 great guild stepped forward to interfere, the fallout would be huge. \u00a0This was the biggest problem they would face. \u00a0If they were to kill the Hahoe Mask, they would have to put up with the big fall out. \u00a0When the potential for loss was this large, no one dared to act in a rash manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why the meeting of the officers was called into order.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, another problem arose at this point in time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair was excluded from the meeting of the officers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Heh-bibin\u2026\u2026 \u00a0I\u2019m sure that bastard planned this.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First, Sinclair wasn\u2019t officially an executive officer. \u00a0It was true that he was the best ace inside the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0However, by definition, the guild master, and the two sub-guild masters were considered to be the executive officers. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Right now Sinclair had no choice, but to wake up to what was going on. \u00a0This incident had the fingerprints of Heh-bibin all over it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Heh-bibin had been treated like a useless sack of wheat until now, but it seemed Heh-bibin had found a way to amplify his voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Heh-bibin\u2019s voice was strengthened by the opinions of the regular guild members. \u00a0Heh-bibin hadn\u2019t been overt about his actions. \u00a0He had been a huge advocate for those guild members, who had killed the Pitbull. \u00a0Heh-bibin spoke numerous times about the guild needing to protect these guild members.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone, who hunted Pitbull, probably stood on Heh-bibin\u2019s side. \u00a0On top of it all, the users operating within the Highwood Forest would also side with Heh-bibin. \u00a0These were high level Users, who were over level 230. \u00a0They were the main fighting power of the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'The machination being played by Heh-bibin is no joke.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one thought about it, Heh-bibin\u2019s actions were chilling, amazing and a bit ridiculous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was only a game. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why would he do such an act over a game?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This thought brushed by Sinclair\u2019s mind. \u00a0Of course, Sinclair immediately rejected such notions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'This game wasn\u2019t a joke from the start.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Warlord wasn\u2019t a simple game. \u00a0The makers of this game and the people, who played this game, invested excessive amount of assets into Warlord. \u00a0Too many things were shoved into this game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This game was supposed to be run and managed by the AI, but now it had become a completely different game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Tsk.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He clicked his tongue, and Sinclair organized the complicated thoughts inside his head. \u00a0He simplified the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'If we choose to catch the Hahoe Mask, we have to go all in. \u00a0If we decide not to catch him, we have to be bold in our negotiations with him. \u00a0\u00a0If we put together a half-assed team of 100 guild members to hunt him down\u2026.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He hoped the meeting of officers would avoid choosing the worst option.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The meeting of the officers came to an end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">11.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Brooks. \u00a0Why are you agreeing to such a ridiculous proposal?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the results of the meeting was declared, Sinclair spoke in an accusatory tone towards Brooks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-Both Apollo and Heh-bibin made a fuss, so what can I do? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Apollo? \u00a0What are you talking about?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-Apollo is supporting Heh-bibin\u2019s decision. \u00a0If I have to oppose two sub-guildmasters, I need a good reason.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The reason\u2026\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-Are you saying we should accept the death of the eleven members, who participated in the Pitbull hunt? \u00a0We can\u2019t give everything to the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0What would happen to my name? \u00a0The normal guild members are treating the Users, who attacked Pitbull, like heroes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the mention of heroes, Sinclair snorted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"They aren\u2019t heroes. \u00a0Does that mean the Hahoe Mask is the Hero Slaughterer, since he killed them?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Heh-bibin maneuvered to bring this about. \u00a0In truth, I can\u2019t do anything about it now. \u00a0We have to put this to rest by killing the Hahoe mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair barely kept himself from snorting again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We are going to kill the Hahoe Mask? \u00a0How are we going to do that? \u00a0Do you really think you\u2019ll be able to kill him with only 100 Users?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-This is different. \u00a0We have 11 surefire baits that will net the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair had a thought when he heard those words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'They succeeded in convincing Brooks.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Brooks was trying to convince him, and Sinclair knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to talk Brooks out of this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Heh-bibin had been successful in his plot. \u00a0He pulled Apollo to his side, and he had convinced Brooks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What would happen next?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Heh-bibin will push himself to the fore again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Anyways, I\u2019ll have nothing to do with this venture.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-If the Killer doesn\u2019t join, there will be a lot of talk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It would be worse to fail with me included in the hunt. \u00a0You should leave me out, so there will be an excuse if you guys fail.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-Do you really think we will fail?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair knew Heh-bibin wouldn\u2019t be satisfied with his victory. \u00a0When one succeeds in turning the table, one wants something more than just turning the tables. \u00a0Heh-bibin will try to create a situation where others cannot turn the tables against him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then what?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"From Heh-bibin\u2019s perspective, he has nothing to gain from the plan succeeding. \u00a0Please use your head, Brooks.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the buck stopped with the guild master. \u00a0Brooks would bear the responsibility of all actions taken by the guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-You really think of me as an idiot. \u00a0I brought about a war with Triple Wings alongside the Hands guild, yet you treat me like this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I spoke too harshly. \u00a0I apologize.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-No, you don\u2019t have to apologize.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The conversation ended there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Eleven Users were facing a Wood Devil. \u00a0It was quite common to come across the sight of a party hunting down a Wood Devil. \u00a0However, this party\u2019s composition was very unique. \u00a0Seven of the 11 Users were Strikers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, a Wood Devil Raid needed a high number of Swordsman class Users, but seven Strikers was most definitely a unique composition.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe this was the reason why the Wood Devil hunt wasn\u2019t going well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, a good number of Users were having a hard time focusing on the Wood Devil hunt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What about the Hahoe Mask?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don\u2019t see him yet.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Be on your guard, but let\u2019s focus on the hunt.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Be careful! \u00a0If we are killed by the Wood Devil, this was all for naught!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their conversations was the proof.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In reality, they weren\u2019t gathered here to hunt the Wood Devil.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were bait.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the meeting of the officers, the decision was handed down to the troops. \u00a0They had decided to hunt down the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0This was why this hunting team was formed. \u00a0This team would simultaneously be a bait and a weapon pointed towards the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The plan was simple. \u00a0If the bait was taken, the Hahoe Mask hunting team would move in. \u00a0If the bait was left alone, they\u2019ll announce that the Hahoe Mask\u2019s absence meant he was conceding defeat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I hope the Hahoe Mask shows up today\u2026.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The seven Users, who were placed into the party as bait, waited for the appearance of the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0They were confident in this plan. \u00a0If there had been no preparations, it would be very difficult to kill the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0However, they had made thorough preparations for the appearance of the Hahoe Mask, and they really believed they would be able to take him down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shweee!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Two Wyverns appeared above their heads. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roo!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One Wyvern was made out of flame, and the other was made out of bones. \u00a0It was the Wyvern Fire Golem and the Bone Wyvern. \u00a0The two Wyverns dove downwards, and it was a scary sight. \u00a0However, the eleven Users welcomed the appearance of the two Wyverns.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It\u2019s the Hahoe Mask!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He is finally here!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Be careful\uff01\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If needed, just disengage and run away from the Wood Devil!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Two Wyverns landed on the ground. \u00a0However, that was all they did. \u00a0The two Wyverns just \u00a0looked at the eleven Users, who were battling the Wood Devil.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Huh?'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'What the hell?'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had expected a terrifying offensive attacks, and this unexpected situation made the eleven Users flustered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What\u2019s going on?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Should we run away?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were still battling the Wood Devil, and the Users were unable to assess the situation. \u00a0They were asking for an answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the one to give the answer wasn\u2019t one of their comrades.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah. \u00a0You guys are all gathered here. \u00a0Hello.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahoe Mask made his appearance as he gave his greeting. \u00a0He cleared his throat then he paused before taking out a paper. \u00a0The paper held the drawing of a Pitbull Terrier\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is my friend. \u00a0He said my act of revenge serves no purpose. \u00a0He said he forgives you all. \u00a0I came here to tell you that. \u00a0Have fun with your hunt. \u00a0I hope you received a good drop.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan turned his back after speaking, and he left the battlefield with the Bone Wyvern and the Fire Golem in tow. \u00a0He headed towards the north.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W...What the fuck?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was too unexpected. \u00a0In such a situation, the announcement from the Voice Talk broke them out from their stupor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-Hahoe Mask is going north.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-The bait team will retreat to the back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-The Hahoe Mask hunt team has to take down the Hahoe Mask at all cost. \u00a0Use all methods available to you.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask hunt team started to move.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Ah, wait a moment.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Hahoe Mask is\u2026\u2026:</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In such an urgent and unexpected situation, none in the bait team was able to comprehend what had just happened.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

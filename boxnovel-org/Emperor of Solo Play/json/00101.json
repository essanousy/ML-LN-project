The monster was named Voodoo Chimera, and its attack was fierce. A powerful power was being emitted by its bizarre body, and it used this power to swing its Halberd. The Halberd didn't just slice through the air. \u00a0It ripped through the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng, kwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every time the terrifying attacks came down against the shield, the sound of the impact made the bluish fog retreat in fright. \u00a0That was how frightening the blows were.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-uh! Koo-uh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the Voodoo Chimera let out a most peculiar shout as it delivered each strike. It sounded as if the Curse had manifested in its shout. \u00a0If one went by the sounds of the battle, the Voodoo Chimera sounded as if it was overwhelming its opponent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the eyes showed a slightly different result.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's overflowing with strength.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was wearing a black armor that could be called a little bit too sturdy. \u00a0He stood in front of the Voodoo Chimera's attack with a large black shield, and the Tanker wasn't being pushed back an inch. \u00a0He was calmly blocking the reckless attacks with his shield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn't the only thing he was doing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he was blocking the attack, he was moving. \u00a0He was slowly baiting the Voodoo Chimera into a position he wanted. \u00a0His skill was amazing. \u00a0The sight reminded one of an expert dancer teaching a student the steps to a dance. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was quite good.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only thing better was the Magician's skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHang on a little bit longer.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While the Tanker was occupying the monster, the Magician finished his Casting, and he threw a fireball.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fireball was the size of a person's body, and it floated in the air like a balloon. \u00a0The Magician lightly moved his hand around, and the fire balloon followed the movement of his hand. \u00a0The fire balloon arrived on top of the Voodoo Chimera's head, and it twitched as if it was getting ready to burst.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, the Magician invoked a new magic with his other hand. \u00a0Unlike the magic from before, it was quite intuitive as to how he would use this magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fire Spear! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was 5 meters long, and the design was like any other normal spear. It was simple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Magician threw the Flame Spear as if he was throwing a javelin. \u00a0It wasn't hard to hit the target. \u00a0The experienced Tanker's skill gave the Magician the perfect opportunity to hit it on the back. \u00a0It was like throwing at a dart board. \u00a0\u00a0The only thing the Magician had to worry about was how many times he wanted to hit the monster. \u00a0That was it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shoong! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Fire Spear headed rapidly towards the Vodoo Chimera's spine.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Right before the Fire Spear could land, the Magician clenched the fist that had been controlling the Fire Balloon. \u00a0He timed it perfectly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The twitching fireball finally revealed its true nature.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-hwaht! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An enormous Fire Snake unfurled from the fireball. The Fire Snake appeared with its mouth wide open, and it descended with the intent of biting off the Chimera's head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Duhp-suhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Fire Snake bit the Voodoo Chimera's head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-hwaht!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Fire Spear immediately impacted the Voodoo Chimera's back. \u00a0The Magician didn't end it there. \u00a0He immediately used both hands to summon as many Fire Arrows as possible, and he launched it all at the same time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was skilled enough to manage three magic spells in a single attack. \u00a0It wasn't an easy thing to do. \u00a0If one wanted to be a great Magician, it was a level of skill one would need to possess.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When most monsters were hit with magic, they prioritized their attacks on the Magician. \u00a0The aggro was pulled towards the Magician. \u00a0This couldn't be helped. If it was inevitable, the Magician had to let out as many Magic on the monster as possible! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Voodoo Chimera suffered from the magical attack, yet it was still alive. \u00a0It immediately charged towards the Magician as it burned like a torch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh-ooh!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Magician had a strange smile as he saw the monster charge towards him. \u00a0There was no fear on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When there was a distance of about 10 meters between the Magician and the Voodoo Chimera, the Striker stepped forward. \u00a0The Striker had been on standby as she waited for the monster to close the distance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-oohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hidden striker was a female User. As befitting a female User, she was wearing a stylish yet casual armor. \u00a0There was a good mix of silver and black colored armors. She didn\u2019t have her helm on. \u00a0It seemed she had taken off the helm on purpose to boast her long red-tinged hair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In Warlord, Users like her were categorized as Users, who only cared about their outside appearance. \u00a0The head was the most important part of the body, yet they refused to protect it. \u00a0These were idiots, who were drunk on their own self worth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this female User was too skilled to be put in the same category as those idiots. \u00a0The Voodoo Chimera was charging at a speed comparable to a speeding car on the highway. \u00a0She had ambushed it, yet she was accurate with her strike. \u00a0This wasn't an easy feat. \u00a0This was a bit of an exaggeration, but it was like striking down an arrow in flight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the female User was using the Rush skill to move at high speeds. It was common sense that a speeding car was harder to steer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she combined the Rush with here Lightning Strike, the Striker's sword was easily able to pierce through the thick hide of the Voodoo Chimera. \u00a0Moreover, she was able to create a large wound around the region where she had stabbed. \u00a0It looked like a wound made by a drill. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-uh-uh!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Voodoo Chimera let out a horrible shriek as it was sent flying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Magician shook his head from side to side as he observed the car crash that had occurred in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If his comrade was lacking in ability or she made a mistake, the Magician would be the one on the floor instead of the Voodoo Chimera.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Despite all of that, he was relaxed instead of being taken aback. \u00a0He spoke towards the Striker.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou aren't wearing your helm again, Lily?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhatever.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou'll die someday from having your head crushed. \u00a0I\u2019ll have to get a footage of you getting your head crushed in the future.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou want to die?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey. \u00a0The Voodoo Chimera is getting up.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a level 140 monster, yet these Users were relaxed with the Voodoo Chimera in front of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the Noopy Family.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their average level was 155. \u00a0Their levels weren\u2019t enough to break into the top 100 Ranking, but they were semi-Rankers. \u00a0They maintained the difference of 10 levels between the top 100 Rankers. \u00a0They were a 4 man veteran party, who were active since the start of Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Noopy family focused on regular hunts instead of Raids. \u00a0Their ability to conduct a Raid was lacking, but on the other hand, they were comparable to the members of the 30 great guilds in their ability to take down the mid-sized monsters. \u00a0In fact, they were reputed to be better than the 30 guilds. \u00a0This was how exceptional these players were. \u00a0If the 30 great guilds increased their proficiency in clearing raids, the Noopy family increased their proficiency in taking down the normal monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the Priest spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAn Evil Eye is heading towards us. Hurry up and wrap this up.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The expression of the members immediately changed when they heard those words. \u00a0The Tanker once again engaged the Voodoo Chimera, and the Magician started casting his magic. \u00a0The Striker moved towards a suitable location.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While all of this was going on, short conversations was shared between the group.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEvil Eyes. We can't stack points, because of those bastards. \u00a0Whenever we start getting on a roll, those bastards shows up....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhen will we get the Quest that will allow us to catch those bastards? \u00a0We've already spent one week here.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI've heard from someone else that someone has to reach a predetermined amount of points to acquire the Quest.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally? What's our current Point Ranking?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFourth.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen it won't be possible for us to do it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe can't do it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they were sharing this conversation, all four users immediately thought of one User.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere's the Hahoe Mask.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's just pray the Hahoe Mask reaches the required Points. \u00a0He's already far ahead in 1st place.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's aim for the 2nd place instead of the 1st. \u00a0I'm pretty sure the Reward is determined by the Point Rankings.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After saying those words, they once again focused on their battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Cursed Domain opened, several rumors started to spread.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The source of today's rumor was an NPC.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou did well today. \u00a0If I combine the result of your hunt, it is worth 150 points.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The User made a sour expression at Sarabo's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI caught a big one, yet it is worth only 175 points?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt isn't a big catch. \u00a0It just looks like a big catch.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the Red Beard Sarabo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the name indicated, he was a man with a big red beard. \u00a0He was 190 cm tall with a robust body, and he always had a sword equipped on each hip. \u00a0The NPC was skilled enough to easily take down the normal Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, amongst the numerous NPCs in Warlord, he wasn't top 10 in recognizability, but he was within the top 20.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sarabo appeared soon after the Block Field was released, and he made a temporary town. From the temporary town, he took on the role of handing out Quests to the Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, he was an Event NPC! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the Users were quick to catch on about this fact. \u00a0The appearance of Sarabo meant the Cursed Domain was a stage for an Event! \u00a0It was understandable why all these baseless rumors cropped up from his appearance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Quest content given by Sarabo was quite simple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis place is the Cursed Domain. \u00a0The barrier had sealed this place up until now, but the power of the barrier was finally spent. \u00a0Now this place is disclosed to the public. This was why the Subjugation Association is planning on purifying the Cursed Domain. \u00a0Currently, the Domain has been taken over by the Voodoo Chimeras. \u00a0Those bastards aren't particularly strong, but there are mutated version of the monster, who can use a special Skill named Evil Eye. \u00a0The Subjugation Association has no idea how to deal with them. This might be obvious, but the person who kills the most Voodoo Chimera will get a reward befitting the number of kills.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One didn't have to be smart to understand the content. \u00a0If one enjoyed playing Warlord, it was a simple content that could be understood in an instant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One had to avoid any engagement with the Evil Eyes, and it was basically a start to a competition to see, who could catch the most Voodoo Chimeras.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the famous parties in Warlord had converged on this location. \u00a0The users above level 140, who conducted regular party hunting instead of Raiding to raise their levels, appeared in droves. \u00a0The Users from the Underfoot guilds, and the 30 great guilds came too. \u00a0However, these Users weren't members of the front line group of these guilds. \u00a0They had time to spare in their schedule. \u00a0Also, Rankers with their names up in the Rankings showed up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the war between stars.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Amongst the battle between stars, there was a main character, whose name shone the brightest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Enormous Stone Axe cut the Voodoo Chimera's body in half. \u00a0The axe was wielded by the Minotaur Golem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-oohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Knight mercilessly stabbed the fallen Voodoo Chimera with its sword. \u00a0It was equipped with a really expensive Unique defensive gear, and it wielded the incredibly expensive Golden Mantis Scythe Sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poohk, poohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Two Skeleton Warriors wearing various Rare and Unique Rank Items were also participating in the battle. \u00a0They were surrounded by the Bone Armor, and a horn was grown on top of their helmeted head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-hwaht! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The User's appearance was very simple in design. \u00a0He was equipped with a one-of-a-kind Chronicle Unique Item named Ivan's Sword. \u00a0He swung the sword to dice up the Voodoo Chimera's body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was the Cursed Domain's brightest star.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Your Level has increased.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Skeleton Science Rank has increased to Rank A.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Golem Summon skill has increased to Rank A.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Skeleton Knight Skill has increased to Rank D.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You've acquired the Title 'Butcher of Voodoo Chimeras'] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This was like eating honey. Honey!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He leveled up, acquired a Title and his Skills got a Rank Up! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The three consecutive Announcements would make any Warlord dance in joy. \u00a0Hyrkan had a big smile on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This place is awesome.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been 10 days since he started hunting at the Cursed Domain. \u00a0Hyrkan was at an advantage at the Cursed Domain compared to any other hunting grounds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The most important skill needed in the hunt within the Cursed Domain was mobility. One had to kill as many Voodoo Chimeras, while avoiding the mutated Voodoo Chimeras called the Evil Eyes! Mobility was crucial to accomplishing this task.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One of Hyrkan's best attribute was mobility. If needed, he could unsummon all his forces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, this wasn\u2019t true for a normal party. The Strikers were mobile. \u00a0However, the Magicians, Tankers and Priests were poor in terms of mobility. \u00a0Their Strength Stat was too low. \u00a0The party had to react to problems before it cropped up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan could move even if a problem cropped up. \u00a0This difference was huge. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, problems was something that might or might not occur.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It also helped that the Voodoo Chimera was a perfect monster for Hyrkan. The Voodoo Chimeras were strong, but their defense was on the weak side. \u00a0If one had a User that can tank decently, they were surprisingly easy to kill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lastly, they gave a significant amount of EXP. \u00a0They were level 140 monsters, but the EXP given by the Voodoo Chimeras were close to those of level 150 monsters. \u00a0Hyrkan's level was still in the 120s, so this was an enormous amount of EXP.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is why they probably cleared this in secret.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, he could understand why the Cursed Domain had been cleared in Secret.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a Points Competition Quest. \u00a0If less people knew about it, wouldn't there be less competitors? \u00a0Moreover, this Points Competition held at the Cursed Domain wasn't advantageous to the Users, who were good at Raids. \u00a0It was advantageous for Users, who like to do regular Party hunting. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I should be getting close.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The end to the hunt for points was coming to end soon. \u00a0Sarabo would probably tell him how he'll be able the hunt the Evil Eyes. \u00a0Then the Reward will be handed out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What will come out?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the biggest reward would be given to the User ranked 1st in the Point Ranking. \u00a0It would be given to Hyrkan!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I want something like a Skill Book. Skill Book!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the day finally arrived.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI've arrived at the Cursed Domain.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Already? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A soft green light flowed over the User's armor. \u00a0He stopped for a brief moment to answer the reply he heard in his ears. \u00a0He looked at the sight that was in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a very ominous forest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The User opened his mouth after he looked at the forest for a brief moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll investigate about the Quest first. \u00a0That is my main mission. \u00a0If the situation allows it, I'll eliminate the Hahoe Mask.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The incoming reply was short.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- All right. Keep up the good work. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThanks.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the brief conversation, the User wearing the green colored armor disappeared into the blue fog.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

This was why sometimes one might meet one\u2019s enemies near the fence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, fights didn't occur around the NPC. \u00a0There was a tacit agreement that forbid PK near the fence. \u00a0If one broke this unwritten rule, the User would suffer much more damage than actually losing a single watch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason why everyone kept their manners. \u00a0The only thing they could do was glare at other Users with murderous intent. \u00a0This worsened the menacing atmosphere around the fence. There was a saying in Warlord that said, 'If you want to experience an intense atmosphere, go near a fence instead of going to a Boss Raid!'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy commission is 1 gold..\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In such a rough atmosphere, those who can't keep their cool became the prey.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan knew this better than anyone. \u00a0However, Hyrkan\u2019s expression indicated otherwise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe commission fee is 1 gold. Are you perhaps trying to cheat me out of my commission?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fence NPC continued to speak in a threatening manner. \u00a0As if he finally came to his senses, Hyrkan put his hand into his pocket. \u00a0When Hyrkan finally took out a coin, Hyrkan's expression changed. It was as if he had a couple screws loose. He had a silly smile on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Hyrkan handed over the gold coin to the fence. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The coin wasn't engraved with the number one. \u00a0It had the number 10 imprinted on it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was worth 10 gold.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn't a small amount of money. \u00a0In real money, it was worth around 100 dollars. No one in the right mind would pay 100 dollars for a 10 dollar service. \u00a0Moreover, this fence NPC didn't give back change.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Didn't Hyrkan put his life on the line for .1 gold before?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Something extraordinary was going on here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy commission is one gold.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was something that could be corrected immediately. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's a tip.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan left the 10 gold in place. \u00a0He immediately left after taking the Item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fence looked at Hyrkan with its head tilted in confusion. \u00a0The fence NPC didn't chase after a User if they overpaid. This scenario hadn't been programmed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fence's expression immediately reverted to its normal expression, and it got ready for the new customer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Helm Imbued with the Greenstone Imoogi's Soul] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*Main Properties</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Unique-rank Item</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Strength +144 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Stamina +144 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Required Level : 150 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*Sub-properties </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The Wearer's Stamina recovery speed is increased by 5%</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- If one equips set items\u2018Imbued with the Greenstone Imoogi's Soul\u2019, class-specific stat increases</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- If three parts of the set item \u2018Imbued with the Greenstone Imoogi's Soul\u2019 is equipped, all Stat will be increased by +50</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- If five parts of the set item \u2018Imbued with the Greenstone Imoogi's Soul\u2019 is equipped, all Stat will be increased by +100</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- If five parts of the set item \u2018Imbued with the Greenstone Imoogi's Soul\u2019 is equipped, the 'Greenstone Imoogi's Curse' is activated</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*Miscellaneous </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The essence of a Greenstone Imoogi with a vengeful spirit is dwelling with the Item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He looked at the Stat of the Item stored in his storage. \u00a0Ahn-jaehyun checked the Stats once again, and he let out a sigh that was filled with mixed emotions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Wow.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had read the Item's Option so much that it had been imprinted into his brain. \u00a0However, his heart started pounding when he started reading the Item's Option once again. \u00a0Even if his heart suddenly came to a stop, his heart would probably start back again if he saw the Item's Option.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how incredible the Item he possessed was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun once again let out a sigh admiration.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It feels akin to buying a 1st place lotto ticket that I know will be a winner. \u00a0This is really incredible.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a level 150 Unique Item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, this particular one was produced and circulated solely by the V&amp;V guild. They went as far to never selling it to the public. \u00a0They dealt this Item only within their guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why one couldn't even put a fair market value of the set.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun was well aware of this fact. \u00a0Moreover, this fact brought Ahn-jaehyun's heart back to its normal rhythm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The pounding died down. Ahn-jaehyun drank a sip of his coffee.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It's a jackpot, but the problem is I can't sell it to anyone.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Ahn-jaehyun surmised, he couldn't sell the Greenstone Imoogi Helm to the public.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Wouldn't the V&amp;V guild try to fight me, while foaming at the mouth, when they realize I sold this piece?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the helm appeared in the auction, the V&amp;V guild would immediately take action.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'If you purchase the Imoogi helm, our guild will declare war on you as a service!'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was sure that was how the guild would react. \u00a0As a customer, one would probably be too afraid of the V&amp;V guild to purchase this Item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, if it was a full set, there might be a User, who might risk the danger of crossing the V&amp;V guild. \u00a0However, he didn't have the full set, and the Greenstone Imoogi Helm could only show its true worth when it was in a set.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A single piece wasn't that popular.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why his potential customer was already predetermined.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have no choice, but to return it to its owner.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had no choice, but to sell it to its original owner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The thought brought a smile to Ahn-jaehyun's lips. Ahn-jaehyun found the current situation to be quite humorous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The thief was basically selling the goods back to the owner. \u00a0It was most definitely a ridiculous situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a given, but when the owner receives the purchased Item, the owner will \u00a0step forward to try to kill the thief. \u00a0However, Anhn-jaehyun wasn't too worried about that part.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bastard would have tried to kill Ahn-jaehyun even if this incident never happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was going to fuck over the bastard one more time, so it made Ahn-jaehyun smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Also, from Ahn-jaehyun's perspective, the owner of the Item wasn't the one, who had attacked him. \u00a0There was a possibility that Sinclair had been been gifted the Item or the Item had been loaned to him by the V&amp;V guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Ahn-jaehyun thought a deal could be struck. \u00a0Whether it was a present or a loan, the V&amp;V guild would want to recover something that had been lost. \u00a0It would be tough to see the Item in the hands of another person. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem right now was the fact that he didn't know the identity of the person, who had ambushed him. \u00a0Also, he didn't have any contacts within the V&amp;V guild. \u00a0It wasn't as if he could just search out the V&amp;V guild then ask for a deal from them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was only one answer left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'll contact the V&amp;V guild through the Red Bulls. It'll allow me to make some kind of bridge with them.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to exploit a personal connection.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I never expected the Red Bulls to be so helpful like this.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun felt that it had been worth the effort to develop this personal connection.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI heard you got spanked by the Hahoe Mask, Sinclair? \u00a0How can you lose against a User, who is 30 levels below you? \u00a0It doesn't make any sense.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A woman wearing a robe made out of snake leather spoke. \u00a0She spoke in a sarcastic manner, and it inevitably brought out a reaction from Sinclair. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShut up. The bastard ran away. I didn't lose.\u201d \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a reasonable reaction\u2026\u2026 He reacted in a temperamental manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI heard he stole your watch? \u00a0That means you got spanked.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI got hoodwinked by the bastard. \u00a0He didn't steal it from me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhatever. \u00a0So which Item did you lose? \u00a0Don't you usually fill all three slots?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An answer came out from another source.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe is wearing that armor, yet he doesn't have that idiotic helmet on his head. \u00a0The answer can be easily deduced.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When a stolen watch is re-issued to the User, everything was given back to the User except a single Item stored in each slot. Since he wasn't wearing his helmet, it meant the helmet had been taken from Sinclair's watch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it perhaps the Greenstone Imoogi Helm? \u00a0My god.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The woman had been speaking playfully until now, but her expression became genuinely worried.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf all the.... \u00a0Didn't the V&amp;V guild loan that out to you?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The woman's reaction made Sinclair\u2019s feelings fall off a deeper cliff. Sinclair gritted his teeth instead of answering. \u00a0He didn't want to speak any further. He thought it was fortunate that he was inside a game. \u00a0If this had been reality, his face would have been beet red as if it was about to explode.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit. \u00a0That mother fucking Hahoe Mask.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Naturally, Sinclair though about the Hahoe Mask, and he chewed on his lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Watchman Style? Son of a bitch.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, he was in a state of disbelief. \u00a0He had fallen for a scam called the Watchman style. \u00a0When he searched for the Watchman style online, it returned no result.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This might be a unique method developed to hoodwink a dumb User. \u00a0Sinclair had probably been the first sacrificial lamb for this method.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn't matter how he spun it. \u00a0This was a bad look for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'll kill him no matter what.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The humiliation didn't end there. \u00a0Sinclair was in a much fouler mood, because the much anticipated watch of Hyrkan only yielded a Normal Rank robe. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if they weren't on a similar level, he had expected a level 120-130 Unique Item. \u00a0It was known that the Hahoe Mask was always equipped with expensive Items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, he had stolen the Item of an owner, who owned a masterpiece. \u00a0However, when one opened the wallet, the only thing inside was two 20 dollar bills and couple coins.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Hahoe Mask. \u00a0I'll kill you every time I meet you in this game.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair had to pay the penalty for losing the Greenstone Imoogi Helmet, and his organization was taking care of the aftermath.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First, he would have to have a conversation with the V&amp;V guild. \u00a0Sinclair would have a clear idea where he stood only after he ended his talk with the V&amp;V guild. \u00a0It was best to take all the beating in one sitting. \u00a0It would be the worst if his punishment came consecutively in multiple parts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Above all else, Sinclair had never experienced failure, so his pride had been hurt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His organization contacted him at that moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The Greenstone Imoogi helm that was stolen by the Hahoe Mask was recovered by the V&amp;V guild. For awhile, Sinclair is in charge of any business related to the V&amp;V guild. \u00a0During that time, Sinclair is going to act as a member of the V&amp;V guild. \u00a0Try your best to think of this as a volunteer service, Sinclair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair planted the sword of revenge inside his heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the Corrupt Count Raid, the Red Bulls and Stormhunters maintained a close and friendly relationship.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this relationship was unofficial. \u00a0They were two of the top guilds fighting for the top spot within the 30 great guilds. \u00a0If their friendly relationship was made official, the other guilds would become alarmed, and they would act accordingly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since this close and friendly unofficial relationship had to be maintained, the existence of a hotline was needed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Storm Queen and the Matador had established a hotline where they could contact each other unilaterally.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It sounded pretty good saying it like thatl, but it basically meant the two of them knew each other's phone number.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, Che-sulyun was calling Chev. \u00a0As she was calling him, Che-sulyun's face was covered with some unknown face pack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cChev.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I'm in a Raid right now. \u00a0If you want to talk to me, you'll have to keep it short.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chev was the recipient of the call, and he was in a tense situation. He had picked up the phone during a battle. \u00a0Of course, Chev would be in a foul mood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Che-sulyun wasn't someone, who cared about Chev's mood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI heard a transaction was made between the Hahoe Mask and the V&amp;V guild. \u00a0I acquired information that the Red Bulls acted as an intermediary.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-sulyun's voice was calm, and her expression didn't change. \u00a0This was the effect of the face pack. If she got angry or frowned, the pack would be rendered useless.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Chev didn't know about this, so he was a bit surprised at her reaction. \u00a0He asked her a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Your intelligence capabilities is impressive. \u00a0I never realized it was at such a level.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, Chev had expected a call from Che-sulyun. \u00a0One of the main sponsors of the V&amp;V guild was run by Che-sulyun's family. \u00a0\u00a0A deal had been conducted between the V&amp;V guild and the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0Of course, she would hear about it. It would have been more suspicious, if she hadn't heard about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Chev received a call from Che-sulyun, he had expected her to yell at him with a thunderous voice. Unlike how she looked, she was incredibly terrifying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI thought I made myself clear last time.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Che-sulyun had called to give a warning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Hahoe Mask is ours. \u00a0Don't touch him.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chev smirked at the warning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I didn't touch him. He's the one, who suggested the deal. \u00a0Since I've had couple dealings with him, he wanted me to put down a bridge for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are lucky I have my pack on. \u00a0If we were holding this conversation inside the game, I would have already killed you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Face pack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chev finally realized the reason why Che-sulyun was speaking so calmly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I guess I am very lucky that you have your pack on. Which part of your sentence should I reply to?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGive me all the information you have on the Hahoe Mask.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her voice was still calm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Chev had a feeling that her calmness had reached its limit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn't going to mince his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I'll put this out in no uncertain terms. I won't lie. I have great interest in the Hahoe Mask, and I want him on my team. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmm.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- If this results in my guild warring with the Stormhunter guild, I'm willing to put up with it. \u00a0I want the Hahoe Mask to enter into my team.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that so?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- However, even after such a resolve, I wasn't able to recruit the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0You may glean what you may from my answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHand over the info.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I have no information regarding the Hahoe Mask. I just have a route I can use to make a deal with him. The trade route I am talking about is the Information Merchant, who revealed the identity of the Corrupt Count.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-sulyun's brows twitched at his words. \u00a0A very small wrinkle formed on her pack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- That is all the information I can give you. \u00a0You should consider it a present . \u00a0The fact that I'm even telling you this much is, because I'm taking into account our relationship. Red Bulls are in a cooperative relationship with the Stormhunters. \u00a0We aren't in a master and servant relationship.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-sulyun didn't give an answer. \u00a0Chev was waiting for her to answer, but words weren't coming easily to her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Chev continued to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I\u2019m not speaking as the guild master right now. I'll give you some personal advice. \u00a0Hahoe Mask only does deals. \u00a0He gives only as much as he receives. \u00a0If you really want a closer relationship with the Hahoe Mask, you should try getting him in your debt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-sulyun still hadn't answered him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- If needed, I can act as an intermediary. I plan on contacting the Hahoe Mask soon. \u00a0Are you still on the phone? \u00a0There's no answer. \u00a0Huh? \u00a0Did the call get cut off?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-sulyun was finally able to open her mouth. \u00a0She had a big frown on her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you telling me to become his Daddy Long Legs?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed she would have to buy a new pack.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was looking at his Stats Window, and his Skill List. \u00a0He was very unsatisfied with what he was seeing. \u00a0Of course, any other User would consider what Hyrkan achieved in two weeks to be a huge achievement, but Hyrkan wasn't playing by normal standards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this caused Hyrkan to not realize that people were giving him queer looks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Huh?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was a step slow in realizing the mood of his surrounding. \u00a0He belatedly raised his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he raised his head, the first sight that greeted him was the pretty large tunnel entrance. \u00a0It was large enough for a truck to drive easily through, and at the entrance, there were two frightening sculptures of monsters places on either side. \u00a0In between the two sculptures, red strands that were woven in between were hanging limply.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The area around the tunnel was veiled in thick fog. \u00a0The surrounding fog was so dense that it was hard to see. \u00a0The Users were currently holding their breath within the fog as all of them stared at a location.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was standing where they were looking, and their gazes were a healthy mix of suspense, wariness and hostility.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hyrkan wasn't taken aback when he noticed their gazes a beat too late.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What a panicky group.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He actually welcomed their gazes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The gazes from his peers around him was the clearest evidence that reaffirmed his existence and ranking amongst the Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no reason why he should feel burdened by their gazes. \u00a0Hyrkan boldly walked through the fog. \u00a0He stopped in front of a well made wooden post. \u00a0A skilled User had gathered the wood in the surrounding to make this handmade good. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a single piece of paper stuck to the wooden post. \u00a0It was filled with English, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, and Korean. \u00a0Names were written in various languages, and there were lines drawn through the names on the list.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the admission list for Voodook's tunnel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan used the brush attached to the bulletin board to add his name at the end of the line.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wrote in Korean. \u00a0Hyrkan wrote his name in block letters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I bet someone will upload this to the SNS..\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he was writing his name, he estimated the number of people in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After getting a rough estimate, Hyrkan clicked his tongue inside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It'll take four hours for my number to be called.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were a lot more Users in queue than expected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I guess no information has come out yet.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, there weren't any credible sources of information coming from across the Urugal mountain range.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No castle or town had been found there, so if one suffered a Game Over, one would have to climb the Urugal mountain range again. The fact that one quickly crossed the Urugal mountain range didn't mean a rosy future was in front of the User.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even after accounting for all these factors, numerous Users were climbing the Urugal mountain range.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018They are trying to cross over, because they don't know that hell is awaiting them.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Ruined Kingdom across the Urugal mountain range was desolate and terrifying. \u00a0If they knew what was awaiting them, they wouldn't be so eager.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, there was no reason for Hyrkan to reflect on their future difficulties. \u00a0Hyrkan had to only worry about his own business.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The hunting ground around here is subpar. \u00a0Maybe I should take a break, and come back in peak condition. \u00a0Still, it feels weird sleeping for four hours right now.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It happened as he was trying to digest his current problem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you the real Hahoe Mask?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While he was agonizing over his decision, a voice intruded on his thoughts from behind him. \u00a0Hyrkan turned his head to look.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a very unremarkable looking woman. \u00a0She wouldn't leave a deep impression even if he saw her in the streets. \u00a0Moreover, her armor wasn't something that was equipped with defense solely in mind. \u00a0The armor looked like a slightly casual designer clothes. It was something the female Users wore, because it looked pretty. \u00a0It was seen quite often in regions where low level Users played.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the fact that she was wearing these kinds of clothes here told him a whole different story.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was midway up the Urugal mountain. \u00a0Amongst the currently discovered normal hunting grounds, this was one of the top 5 in difficulty.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn't a stage where one could dress up and be pretentious. \u00a0It meant she had the skills, guts, Items and level to dress in such a manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Hyrkan didn't ignore her. \u00a0Instead of ignoring her, he gave a reply as he tapped at his Hahoe Mask with his finger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don't know. \u00a0Aren't there a lot of fakes going around right now? \u00a0Isn't that true?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The female User immediately replied to Hyrkan's gesture.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of a verbal answer, Hyrkan once again brought up his left wrist.... \u00a0He tapped his wrist, which was covered with armor and glove.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every skilled Users that had reached this point knew what that gesture meant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reaction didn't come from the female User in front of Hyrkan. \u00a0The Users in the surrounding reacted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI think that's the Watchman Style!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWatchman? \u00a0Ah! \u00a0Is that where both Users sever their wrists to exchange their wristwatches and fight?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? \u00a0I thought Watchman Style was a method where one has to sever one's wrist and give one's watch to the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0Isn't this a method used to ask for forgiveness from him?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are all wrong. \u00a0The Watchman Style indicates the price of the wristwatch. \u00a0It always means ten thousand gold. He tapped it once, so if one wants to live, ten thousand gold has to be given to him.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, everyone gathered here had a different definition, but that wasn't a problem. \u00a0The only fact that mattered was the fact that Users rarely got away with starting a quarrel with Hyrkan, and everyone was aware of this. \u00a0That was all that was needed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, everyone was tense, but at the same time, they were entertained with what was going on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAren't they from the Mig guild?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Mig guild\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey are below the Underfoot guilds, but they have a good amount of experts. \u00a0Moreover, this guild is pretty lax in their members transferring out, so a lot of Users use this guild as a stepping stone to move up. \u00a0Many Users from this guild eventually moved on to become members of the 30 great guilds or the Underfoot guilds.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat\u2019s the Hahoe Mask's chance of winning?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahoe Mask will win. \u00a0However, it won't be easy or boring.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf they don't die in a boring manner, the footage would haul in a lot. \u00a0It is \u00a0profitable to be killed by the Hahoe Mask now.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, the Users gathered in front of the Voodoook's tunnel wanted to cross the Urugal mountain range, and they all had the capability of earning a decent amount of money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These Users could monetize a User's death or loss by the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Users that were hidden in the surrounding was adept at maneuvering through these various factors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. \u00a0Wait a moment...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if she could feel the mood around her, the female User quickly waved her hand as she spoke. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don't have any plans to fight with you. \u00a0I just want to make a deal with you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan lightly nodded his head as an answer. \u00a0It basically meant she should speak the terms of her deal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll introduce myself first. \u00a0I've been a part of a lot of organizations, but I'm currently with the Mig guild. \u00a0My name is Queeng.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Queeng. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was unique name, but there was no reason why one couldn't use such a name in the game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The important part was the fact that he didn't remember that name. \u00a0This User has a unique name, yet he didn't remember it. \u00a0It meant this User was probably mediocre. \u00a0At the very least, she was mediocre using Hyrkan's standards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She spoke about what she wanted to achieve.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are 3rd in line. \u00a0Currently, there is an empty spot in my party. \u00a0Would you perhap like to do this with us?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Users had been watching with bated breath, but they all let out an exclamation when they heard her words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah! \u00a0Holy crap!\u2019 \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit! \u00a0I should have offered it first!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018We could have been carried!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Naturally, the interest of the Users in the surrounding shifted towards what the Hahoe Mask would say next.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Will he turn down or accept the offer?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe rights to the battle footage will all be mine.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAgreed.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAlso, you guys have to listen to my directions no matter what.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf it is rational, we will.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLastly, if you plan on fucking me over, I can guarantee you'll have to pray to god that you won't come across me on the other side of the Urugal mountain range.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll keep that in mind.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan accepted the offer.</span></p><br/><p>5.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The average level of the group was 203.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The 6 Users were all affiliated with the Mig guild, and they had all finished their 2nd Advancement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, their party composition was very unbalanced. \u00a0Queeng was the only Tanker. \u00a0There were three Magicians and two Priests. \u00a0This was the 6 members. \u00a0Originally, this party had another Tanker, but he couldn't get on due to personal reasons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason why they offered this deal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had been about to cancel the run. \u00a0They had no choice, but to delay the battle until next time. \u00a0That was when they discovered the Hahoe Mask, and there was no downside in offering a deal to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, they hadn't just broken even in this deal. \u00a0They had hit the jackpot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI told you a pretty face would work on him.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Queeng had the biggest role in making this deal happen, so she was proud as a peacock. \u00a0Normally, the other party members would have laughed at her for referring to herself as a beauty, but they tried hard to suppress their laughter. \u00a0They just nodded their heads.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the atmosphere turned for the worse one minute after they entered the Voodook's tunnel. \u00a0There was a heavy atmosphere pressing down on them. \u00a0They had temporarily become party members with the Hahoe Mask, but he didn't talk to the other members.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it wasn't a situation where a conversation was appropriate. \u00a0They had entered the Voodook's tunnel, and they had work to do. \u00a0This was an Instance Dungeon. \u00a0They had no choice, but to keep going forward. \u00a0The tunnel itself was getting smaller as time passed, and they had to eventually move in a single line.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they arrived at the entrance to the Instance Dungeon, a short conversation began.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was the one that opened up a dialogue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is up to me as to when I want to step forward.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His words shut down the dialogue in an instant.</span></p><br/><p>6.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they exited the tunnel, they arrived at a large pit that reminded one of the Colosseum.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the center of the pit, there was a giant with a snake's head. \u00a0It had the head of a snake, but its muscular body reminded one of an ogre. \u00a0It wore a kilt made out of green leather, and there were various skulls hanging around its neck like a necklace.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Skull Collector! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Queeng was the first to get ready for the fight. \u00a0She wore a bulky black armor, and she had an enormous shield that was as big as her body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Priests behind her had already placed 11 Buff Skills on her, and the Priest spoke the final phrase to her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn the name of the Holy Order.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Queeng heard the System Announcement when the twelfth Buff was placed on her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You've received the blessing of the Holy Order.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[All Buffs will be effective to twice its original time..] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[All Buffs will received 15% increase in effectiveness.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Holy Order. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Buff Priests were a 2nd Advancement Class. \u00a0When the one finished the Advancement, Priest received the blessing of the Holy Order. \u00a0It was a dreamlike skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOk. \u00a0You only live once.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After receiving this dream-like skill, Queeng didn't hesitate to charge the enemy in front of her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCharge!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Queeng closed the distance in an instant, and she impacted the Skull Collector with her shield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skull Collector rolled backwards, and it immediately righted itself. \u00a0Now it was the Skull Collector's turn. \u00a0It jumped into the air, and it brought down its knife on Queeng's shield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A loud sound exploded forth, and Queeng tried to find an opening as she endured the impact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Collector used this opportunity to toss a skull in her general direction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The skull rolled twice before the ground around it started to stir. It started forming arms, body and legs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ooh-uh-uh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It appeared as it let out a long cry. \u00a0It was a combination of a skull and a body of a Troll golem. \u00a0It was 2 meters tall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puh-uhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An enormous fireball flew in, and the dirt Troll exploded as soon as it was formed. \u00a0The aftermath of the explosion was so fierce that the backlash swept by the feet of the magicians and priests, who were keeping distance with the monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, The magic only took out half its body. \u00a0It started regaining its original shape.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The magician spoke a sullen curse as he started his next Magic Casting. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During all of this, the Skull Collector picked out another Skull from his necklace, and it threw the skull. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cQuickly catch the summoned familiars!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Queeng let out a shout. \u00a0The magicians and priest gritted their teeth, since Queeng had shouted in the game and the Voice Talk at the same time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was only one clear method known to the public right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While the Tanker face the Skull Collector, one had to defeat its summoned familiars one by one!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At first, many Users tried to kill it before the Skull Collector could use his Voodoo Summon Skill. \u00a0However, the only one who had been able to succeed using this method was the Storm Queen. \u00a0If one wasn\u2019t as skilled as the Storm Queen, it was impossible to kill it in a short amount of time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why the next logical clear method was to get rid of all of its underlings. \u00a0This method usually required two Tankers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Queeng was the only Tanker in this group. \u00a0This meant the three Magicians had to use all their firepower to prevent the summoned familiars from stacking in number.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The powerful magic continued to bombard the battlefield, and it was effective. \u00a0The first summoned familiar fell as it couldn\u2019t take a third hit from the magic. \u00a0It reverted into being a Skull.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, a third summoned familiar had come into being already.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was all still within expectation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was two things they hadn\u2019t expected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The first one was the fact that the Hahoe Mask hadn\u2019t moved. \u00a0He was just looking at the battlefield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The other unexpected outcome was\u2026..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuhk!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Queeng had been doing well blocking the powerful sword blows from the Skull Collector, but she couldn\u2019t properly block its parallel sword strike. \u00a0She was sent flying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Queeng flew like a bird as she was planted into the wall. \u00a0At that moment, the three Magicians and two Priests were taken aback, but they moved at the same time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReady the Range Magic!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll erect a Firewall!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Magicians readied their magic to buy some time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll leave the rest to you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease give me a Haste Buff.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One of the Priest put his life on the line as he ran through the battlefield. \u00a0He was trying to reach Queeng. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was trying to hold back a laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018As expected, they aren\u2019t skilled enough for me to remember them.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan took off his gloves as he thought this.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

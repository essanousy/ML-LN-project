The burning forest completely erased their presence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They moved towards the Masked Monster Orangutans like assassins, and the Mini Ogre Skeleton Warriors targeted the lower half of the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thighs were stabbed. \u00a0Their knees were cut and their calves were severed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When their legs were attacked, the Masked Monster Orangutans fell in place. \u00a0Two or three Mini Ogre equipped with level 190 Unique weapons fell on the monsters. \u00a0These weapons were too expensive for most normal Users to purchase. \u00a0These weapons started hacking the fallen monsters into pieces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggi-ee! Ggi-ee! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sharp cries that had filled the forest was disappearing one by one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, in this battle, the largest curse wasn't the winter or the flames. \u00a0It was the black fog that was filling this stage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The King Orangutan fell into lethargy.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This monster was the king of the Masked Monster Orangutans. \u00a0The King Orangutan was a level 240 middle boss.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, no Users had any informations regarding this monster. \u00a0This was the only stage where the King Orangutan appeared. \u00a0Moreover, it had been only four days since this Orangutan's Forest was found by a User.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When it became cursed, it started to pound its chest with its two hands like a gorilla.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The King Orangutan's Shout has chased the Curse away.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had nullified all Debuff type Skills, and this was also the first time this setting was revealed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After gaining confidence, the monster unfurled its crouched body. \u00a0It was also the first time anyone saw the 6 meter tall monster stand at full height.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ok.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everything he was seeing now was new. \u00a0However, Hyrkan wasn't flustered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I think I have a rough idea on what is going on.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed he had figured out something. \u00a0Hyrkan immediately gave the command for an attack to the waiting Death Knight. \u00a0It was as if the Death Knight had been eagerly waiting for the signal. \u00a0The Skeleton Steed let out its joy as it charged towards the King Orangutan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was watching from 300 meters away, and he grabbed a Bone Spear. \u00a0As he grabbed the Bone Spear, he immediately put a recovery Item within his mouth. \u00a0It was very sour, and his tongue tingled. \u00a0It was like the candy one ate on a dare. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan furrowed his brow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was sour, but the effect was indisputable. \u00a0His magical energy quickly climbed, and Hyrkan used the magical power to imbue a Curse on the Bone Spear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of everything, this Bone Spear wasn't made out a common Bone Ingredient. \u00a0It was a Bone Spear made using a level 190 Boss Monster as ingredient. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was incredibly powerful, and it was expensive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was burning money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no other way to describe what he was doing, but he didn't worry about the monetary part of the game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't let it linger in his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He only focused on the battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There is no cool time to the Dispel skill, and it can be used in an unlimited fashion. \u00a0However, it has to pound its chest every time it wants to use the Skill.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">King Orangutan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As mentioned before, this monster had never been revealed to the world yet. \u00a0Hyrkan was the first to discover this monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if Hyrkan combined his current experience with his past memories, he had never seen this monster in Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a natural course of events. \u00a0From now on, Hyrkan would experience things he had never experienced before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan wasn't flustered by it. \u00a0There was no reason to be flustered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I just have to stop it from pounding its chest.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had experienced too much to be taken aback by anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He proved that his determined attitude wasn't a bluff when the Death Knight and the King Orangutan started to fight. \u00a0Hyrkan took the situation into his own hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The battlefield was loud. \u00a0It was like trying to make a phone call in a very noisy rock concert. \u00a0It was an annoying environment, yet Hyrkan's concentration allowed him to hit the bullseye. \u00a0It hadn't been a short distance. \u00a0Hyrkan's spear flew 300 meters before it was embedded in the King Orangutan's body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[King Orangutan was hit with the Sloth Curse.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Curse Infection was activated on the King Orangutan. \u00a0The curse has spread to the surrounding.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As predicted, the King Orangutan couldn't dispel the curse. \u00a0The Death Knight didn't give it time to pound its chest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Your Level has increased.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Level Announcement that notified

style=\"\">Even he thought his Level Up pace was ridiculous, yet Hyrkan had an unsatisfied expression on his face. There was an expression filled with worry behind the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0He wasn't worried about his Levels, Stats, Item setting and the current hunting speed. \u00a0There was no way these issues would worry him. \u00a0Instead, he was thrilled about those aspects of the game. \u00a0Before he had returned to the past, he had dreamed about hunting this way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Do I really have to go back?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If looked in a certain way, his progress was the root of his worry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah. \u00a0This is driving me crazy.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was doing too well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan wanted to maintain his Level Up pace. \u00a0Most Users dreamed about hunting like him. \u00a0He had the best Item setting, and he didn't need to hold back in using recovery Items. \u00a0Moreover, he didn't have to worry about gathering crap items, since he was financially well off. \u00a0He was basically monopolizing a hunting ground, and his Level Up pace matched what he experienced when his level was in double figures.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he hated this, he shouldn't be playing this game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he had reached a point where he had to clean up the loose threads. \u00a0He was already level 220. \u00a0After passing the level 200 mark, he had never visited the Class Tower yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to receive the Quests, and I have to learn new Skills.... \u00a0At the very least, I have to visit the Class Tower....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was the fact that he had to cross over the Urugal mountain range to consolidate these loose ends.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, the only rest place in the Black Continent was the town near the Heard Fortress ruin. \u00a0The Heard Fortress town was getting bigger by the day, but it would take a long time for a Class Tower to be erected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had already anticipated the problem. \u00a0In the past, the most annoying part of operating in the Black Continent was the travel. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he had refused to go back at level 210. \u00a0He promised himself that he would go to the Class Tower when he was level 220.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Still, the [Steel Golem] will surely be of help to me. \u00a0I've also gained enough Skill Rank to acquire [Curse Shower].\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was time for him to make good on his promise. \u00a0If he kept pushing back a promise he had made to himself, he might die later on, because he lacked certain Skills. \u00a0It would be better for him to go than regretting his inaction in death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, there was no actual downside in going to the Class Tower for Hyrkan. \u00a0Instead, he would gain a lot by going there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was only upsides to obtaining the [Steel Golem] Skill. \u00a0There was no way he would suffer a loss.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skill allowed him to summon an Iron Golem, and its usefulness was beyond description. \u00a0Its best attribute was defense. \u00a0Its defense couldn't be compared to the defense of the Earth Golem and the Frost Golem. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he used the Clay Play skill to borrow the Spec of a monster with great defense, he could use Hardening to create a massive shield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then there was the romantic in him, who wanted to obtain it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I want to mount Skeleton Magicians on the Iron Golem like Rich Lich....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rich Lich had used a combination of the Iron Golem and the Skeleton Magicians. \u00a0The Iron Golem was like a moving castle wall, and it defended the Skeleton Magicians. \u00a0The Skeleton Magicians let out a continuous barrage of magic behind this protection.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of it all, the fact that he would have 3 Golems was incredible in itself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He'll be able to defend attacks from three sides.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, the Golem were mainly used in two ways. \u00a0The Earth Golem was used to block the road, and the Fire Golem was used to gather the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since most monsters couldn't outnumber him anymore, Hyrkan was able to use this method. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This method was even effective against the Boss Monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In such a situation, what would happen if the Iron Golem appeared to close the third side?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would create a stage. \u00a0It was a perfect stage where the Death Knight could go nuts! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the [Curse Shower] was a very good skill. \u00a0The Skill allowed a shower to fall, which could give Curse Effect to his enemies. \u00a0It was an AOE Curse Skill. \u00a0Recently, his Curse Skill proficiency reached a point where he would be able to learn this skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he gained these Skills, he would basically achieve another Spec Up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the enemies he had to fight weren't merely monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There's the Five Star bastards. \u00a0Moreover, the Stormhunters have gone through a significant Spec Up.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Five Stars and the Stormhunters were also operating out of the Black Continent. \u00a0They weren't as fast as Hyrkan, but they were quickly increasing their Specs. \u00a0They were quickly handing out Unique and Rare Rank level 200 Items to their members. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, Hyrkan's Item setting had remained the same. \u00a0He couldn't Spec Up. \u00a0There were no Items better than the ones he was wearing right now. \u00a0This was the price of being one of the leaders in this race.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In such a situation, there was no better way to Spec Up than to learn a free Skill from the Class Tower.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Recently, the traffic around the Voodook's tunnel has lessened, but.... \u00a0If it comes to it, I could join a party as a third wheel.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The current situation at the Voodook's Tunnel was added to his list of worries.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have no choice.\u2019</span></p><br/><p>3.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Maybe I should have crossed over by dying? \u00a0It took me 2 days to get here, and it'll take me two days to... \u00a0Shit. \u00a0If I could fly over the Urugal mountain range using the Wyvern Golem, I could do a round trip in one day. \u00a0I have a mount I could ride, but the game mechanic won't allow me to fly it. \u00a0Fuck this game.\u2019 \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After obtaining his Skills from the Class Tower, he quickly moved his feet as he looked at the Skill descriptions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every second felt wasteful to him. \u00a0Hyrkan didn't bother hiding his identity as he descended the Class Tower.

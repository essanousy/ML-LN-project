(1)</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">1.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Will you guys really be ok here?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were at the entrance of the Highwood Forest. \u00a0For the past 5 days, they had a pleasant hunt in the Red Desert and the Highwood Forest. \u00a0They had been walking in the same direction for a long time. \u00a0Now Hyrkan and Whistling\u2019s party was facing each other. \u00a0\u00a0When they came to a stop, there was only one reason why they would face each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was time for them to part.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan directed his question towards the three, and they immediately gave their answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We aren\u2019t children. \u00a0If it is just the three of us, it\u2019ll be hard to overcome these monsters, but it won\u2019t be a problem if we run away. \u00a0We can go by ourselves from this point. \u00a0Also, this has been a lot of fun.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You should go take care of your own business. \u00a0We have to part ways here anyways. \u00a0If you want to cross the Urugual mountain range, you\u2019ll have to head west. \u00a0We have to head east. \u00a0Also, this has been a lot of fun.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yojori and Joba didn\u2019t speak one after another. \u00a0They spoke at the same time. \u00a0Their words overlapped, and they even spoke the last sentence at the same time. \u00a0Their two voices weirdly complemented each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was similar to how they overlapped their words. \u00a0They glared at each other at the same time. \u00a0It seemed even their thought patterns were similar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Each thought the other was intruding on their words, and it made them annoyed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During all of this, Whistling and Hyrkan spoke to each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Thank you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No, I\u2019m more thankful. \u00a0If it wasn\u2019t for you, I would have been floundering to find a clue.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The Sand Snake Ice Cream tasted pretty good.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yeah. \u00a0It had a butter vanilla ice cream taste. \u00a0This game is overflowing with such delicious food, but I have no idea why all the expensive recovery Items were made to taste so bad.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You expend a lot to play this game.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is driving me nuts. \u00a0It is too expensive. \u00a0I have to grow these expensive Skeletons. \u00a0I might have to fight more to lower the cost of labor.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling shrugged his shoulders.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan spoke to Whistling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019ll see you next time. \u00a0Ah. \u00a0If someone bothers you, you can contact me. \u00a0I\u2019ll completely destroy them. \u00a0In truth, that is my specialty. \u00a0I mow down bastards, who act arrogant, because they have a little bit of power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling let out snort at Hyrkan\u2019s unexpected words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Whistling let out a smirk of disbelief, Hyrkan kept speaking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m not kidding. \u00a0I\u2026. \u00a0In the past\u2026 \u00a0Yes, in my last game, I was nicknamed the Hero Slaughterer. \u00a0I took down arrogant Rankers like a demon.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is a great nickname.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It was a great nickname.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After those words ended, the conversation came to a brief pause.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What else was there to talk about?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It will leave much to be desired if they just parted ways right now. \u00a0They tried to come up with a topic they could talk about.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, they would have to part in the end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019ll see you.......\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was unknown as to when they\u2019ll meet again, but there was no need to forcefully prolong a conversation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let\u2019s have a beer sometime.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You want to meet in real life? \u00a0Wouldn\u2019t that be a little bit too hard?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Hyrkan\u2019s question, Whistling spoke calmly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It wouldn\u2019t be too hard for me to go to Korea. \u00a0It isn\u2019t as if I\u2019m barred from going there. \u00a0If you are in North Korea, it might be hard.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan slightly reacted to the word Korea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"How did you know I\u2019m Korean? \u00a0Ah. \u00a0I guess my Hahoe Mask gave it away.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even as Hyrkan spoke the words, he laughed. \u00a0Even the youtube page managed by Hyrkan was littered with images of the Hahoe Mask, and he always wore one. \u00a0It was an overwhelming evidence that indicated Hyrkan was Korean.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Even if you didn\u2019t have the Hahoe Mask, it isn\u2019t too hard to figure out that you are a Korean.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the surest evidence that labeled Hyrkan as a Korean was elsewhere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Whenever a game comes out, nine out of the ten Users, who rush to the end of the game, are Koreans.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan\u2019s game style was the prototypical game style of a Korean.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Isn't that to be expected? \u00a0You start a game to reach the end.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling closed both his eyes, and he nodded his head. \u00a0Whistling finally confirmed what the Hahoe Mask was pursuing \u00a0in this game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Hyrkan also came to an understanding too.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019ll see you soon.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If someone messes with you, just contact me.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They parted ways.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was when the others moved in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">2.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Over 10 Users stepped forward. \u00a0At a glance, one could tell they were equipped with sturdy-looking armors and helmets. \u00a0They even had their swords unsheathed, and they looked as if they were prepared to cut down any enemies that got in their way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The members of the Big Smiles appeared to surround them. \u00a0This should have surprised Whistling, but he snorted instead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hoong.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He snorted as he sized up his opponents.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Are they from the Big Smile guild?'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t just Whistling. \u00a0This should have been a surprising situation, yet Yojori and Joba wasn\u2019t acting surprised at all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It has been awhile, since we\u2019ve fought like this.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Give me a buff.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Give me one first.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don\u2019t be so shameful.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Shameful? \u00a0Maybe I shouldn\u2019t give you a buff if you act that way.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yojori and Joba looked very relaxed as they got ready for battle. \u00a0Yojori put a buff on herself, and Joba immediately activated the [Body Revolution] Skill. \u00a0It was a skill that flipped the the Intelligence Stat with the Strength Stat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While the two bickered with each other, Whistling held a conversation as his opponent spoke first.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You are Whistling of the Hydra Guild?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling smirked at the question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You don\u2019t recognize my face? \u00a0I never expected someone to check my identity twice. \u00a0I guess my face is more common than I realized.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We are from the Big Smiles guild.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their opponents didn\u2019t hide their guild affiliation. \u00a0Even if they wanted to hide it, they couldn\u2019t. \u00a0This was the entrance to the Highwood Forest, and the nearby region was the territory of the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0\u00a0If a large group of Users were able to move through this region, it pretty much labeled them as members of the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0The only other User that could pass through this region with impunity was the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Also, the Highwood Forest is under our control. \u00a0This has been confirmed by the 30 great guilds. \u00a0Your guild hadn\u2019t asked for permission to hunt here. \u00a0You\u2019ve participated in an illegal hunt inside the Highwood Forest, so what is your excuse?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They revealed their intention.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hoong.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling once again snorted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'How laughable.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their words were disingenuous. \u00a0They just wanted Whistling to say something they could use as a pretext to an attack. \u00a0If he made an excuse, he would be admitting he had done something wrong. \u00a0They wanted to exact a pound of flesh from Whistling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In such a situation, Whistling wasn\u2019t going to make any excuses. \u00a0He didn\u2019t plan on debasing himself like that. \u00a0He decided to cleanly settle the account. \u00a0If they wanted to exact a price, he\u2019ll pay.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"First, I am part of the Hydra guild. \u00a0I\u2019ll apologize for hunting in a hunting ground recognized officially to be under the control of the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0Next, what if I give back an equal compensation? \u00a0What if we do it through our guild?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even as he spoke, Whistling was already aware of what they wanted. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they really wanted a monetary compensation or an official apology, they would merely have to send the footage of Whistling\u2019s party hunting inside the Highwood Forest to the Hydra guild. \u00a0Then the guilds would negotiate to bring this issue to a conclusion. \u00a0This was the normal procedure. \u00a0It was clean, and the trouble ended right there. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no reason for the 10 Users of high level showing signs of wanting to fight him. \u00a0Moreover, they had waited for Whistling to come out. \u00a0They wasted time by waiting for him. \u00a0This basically meant they didn\u2019t want monetary compensation or an apology from the guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They wanted the opposite.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are the Hydra guild looking down on the Big Smiles guild? \u00a0Huh? \u00a0Or is this an attempt at a revenge? \u00a0Are you trying to avenge your 2nd Head, who was killed by Killer?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed they didn\u2019t want to bring the guilds into this. \u00a0They wanted to resolve this as a personal issue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In Warlord, a personal problem like this was very simple to resolve.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We don\u2019t look down on the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0However, you brought a dozen Users, who are higher in level than us, to catch the three of us. \u00a0I think that is funny.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ooh-ha-ha\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joba let out a big laugh. \u00a0It was a true laugh. \u00a0It was a laugh full of ridicule, and it was very effective.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you trying to pick a fight with us?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did you really think we would beg for our lives? \u00a0Is that what you want to hear?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It seems words will be useless.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Run!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It happened in a flash.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While they were having a conversation, Whistling let out a short command, and he launched himself towards the User, who he was having conversation with.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahg!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling used Body Slam to make the other User fall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-aht!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a flash, Yojori and Joba stepped on Whistling\u2019s body to launch themselves forward. \u00a0They used the gap opened by Whistling to quickly run away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We\u2019ll go there first!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We\u2019ll complete the Quest!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their footsteps were as rapid as their spoken words. \u00a0They were experienced in running for an extended amount of time for the sake of completing a Quest. \u00a0It wouldn\u2019t be a misnomer to say their running away speed was on the level of the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, their trackers weren\u2019t average Users. \u00a0The rest of the group reacted immediately to such a sudden change in the situation. \u00a0They immediately prepared to run after Yojori and Joba. \u00a0Three Users had already ran forward to track them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While this was going on, Whistling stood back up, and he turned to look at the Users, who had stayed behind. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The already scary face of Whistling crumpled, and he looked more menacing. \u00a0Just his appearance made one clench one\u2019s teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While looking like this this, Whistling barked out like an angry fighting dog. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Come at me!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">3.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hyrkan]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Level :

the Heard Fortress ruin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'I gained a lot from this hunt.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His battles always caused him to suffer losses, but he had gained a lot on this venture. \u00a0First, he had reached level 240. \u00a0He was able to acquire the level 230 Skills called [Ice Golem] and [Skeleton Exhibition]. \u00a0\u00a0The highlight of this venture was the [Skeleton Exhibition].</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The [Skeleton Exhibition] was a similar to the Death Knight\u2019s [Commander] Skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The [Skeleton Exhibition] was akin to the default ability of the Death Knight in being able to summon 12 Skeleton underlings. \u00a0The Skill allowed all Skeleton Fragments stored in the Skeleton Exhibition to be summoned all at once. \u00a0This was why it was called an Exhibition. \u00a0He had to store the Skeleton Fragments as exhibits. \u00a0Of course, there was a quota on how many Skeleton Fragments one could put in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeletons summoned through this method was separate from him normal Skeleton summons. \u00a0When he reached Rank A in the [Skeleton Exhibition] Skill, he would be able to handle nearly 100 Skeletons at the same time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The level 230 Skill called [Ice Golem] was something he could learn at a later date. \u00a0In truth, he didn\u2019t need the Skill right now. \u00a0In Hyrkan\u2019s case, the Earth Golem had similar powers to the Ice Golem if he activated the power of Frost. \u00a0Still, there was no downside in having the skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He also earned 4 scrolls containing the Ancient Power. \u00a0He had three Transcendent Rank scrolls, and the high price he paid for them was as expensive as the Item\u2019s name implied. \u00a0However, Hyrkan didn\u2019t think it was expensive. \u00a0Moreover, his greatest gain was the Legendary Rank scroll. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was in a happy spot again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had found the clue, and he now knew what methods were used to hide the ruins within the Red Desert. \u00a0Moreover, he also found the identity of the Elven Artifact. \u00a0If things turn out well, he\u2019ll receive help from Whistling, and he\u2019ll be able to progress in his Quest more easily. \u00a0At the very least, he won\u2019t be digging a bottomless hole.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of everything, he had gained a friend named Whistling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'A friend.......'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan let out a bitter laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He never thought he would get close to someone within this game ever again. \u00a0He had avoided developing any deep relationships. \u00a0He never wanted to suffer that bitter sense of betrayal ever again. \u00a0He never wanted to buck under the misery he had felt before. \u00a0He had tried his best to avoid such a relationship, yet his current situation made Hyrkan smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'........I wonder what Dongsoo hyung is doing right now? \u00a0Is he playing this game?'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he continued playing Warlord, he knew this was something he would inevitably have to confront. \u00a0Hyrkan\u2019s life had changed a lot, because of Warlord. \u00a0He would continue this way of life, and he wouldn\u2019t be free of his past until he reached the end of Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had no intentions of becoming free from Warlord right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Yes. \u00a0Since things have progress this far, I have to see this to the end.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan arrived at the Heard Fortress ruin town on his Bone Wyvern, and the news about Whistling greeted him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">4.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun was looking through the the articles. \u00a0He focused on searching for the words Hydra and Big Smiles. \u00a0However, there weren\u2019t many articles of substance compared to the effort he was putting into this search.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun stopped searching for the articles for a moment. \u00a0He took off his glasses with one hand, and he massaged his eyes with the other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Did the 30 great guilds have some kind of grudge against me in the past life\u2026 Nevermind. \u00a0I guess they were always my mortal enemy.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling had been killed by the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he heard the news, Ahn-jaehyun immediately exited the game. \u00a0Then he brooded over his anger. \u00a0He was having a hard time coping with his anger, but he didn\u2019t throw anything towards the wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Before I returned to the past, it was the Stormhunters. \u00a0Will it be the Big Smiles now?'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In some ways, this might have been inevitable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Yes, it is time for me to bring this to a head.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Big Smiles had put out a statement saying Whistling had hunted in the Highwood Forest without permission, and his death had been a fair punishment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They weren\u2019t wrong. \u00a0Most would accept the the substance behind the Big Smiles guild\u2019s announcement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'They could have tried to kill us when I was with them. \u00a0They killed him after I left\u2026.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was the fact that they didn\u2019t attack them when the Hahoe Mask and Whistling was together. \u00a0They targeted Whistling after the Hahoe Mask left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a clear provocation. \u00a0Since they couldn\u2019t take on the Hahoe Mask right now, they decided to punish those close to the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0This was the substance behind the provocation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'They were not aiming for me. \u00a0They were aiming for my friend\u2026.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was an obvious provocation, and he was sure it would be exploited again in the future.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'These bastards are coming at me in interesting ways.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were only two choices he could choose.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could respond to the provocation or he could just endure this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he looked at it in a logical manner, it would be harmful for the Hahoe Mask to respond to this provocation. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask couldn\u2019t erased Big Smiles guild from Warlord. \u00a0\u00a0Even if they got into a straight fight, it would be a battle of attrition. \u00a0Moreover, even if the Hahoe Mask attacked the Big Smiles guild and won, he wouldn\u2019t be able to steal their Live Channel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'I can just trivialize this by saying Whistling only suffered a death\u2026.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling didn't consider his death to be a loss. \u00a0He had lost a single Item, and he could take a break for 48 hours. \u00a0That was the extent of his damage, so Whistling didn\u2019t ask anything of the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0He hadn\u2019t even notified Hyrkan of his plight. \u00a0He decided to keep it as a personal matter. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t want to unnecessarily put his friend in an awkward situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Still, the mighty Hahoe Mask can\u2019t hide behind his mask. \u00a0A friend had suffered.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In other words, his friend was killed, and if he thought only about calculating profits, he was being unfaithful to his friend.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Moreover, if I show weakness here, it\u2019ll be the end.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Above everything else, it was time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to step on the 30 great guilds at some point in time. \u00a0If he wanted to reach his goal, he had to use the 30 great guilds as his stepping stone. \u00a0He had to climb upwards by stepping on them. \u00a0Moreover, he had numerous methods he could use to conduct this war.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he suffered under the Stormhunters guild, he had come up with a lot of methods for his revenge. \u00a0The tactics, strategies and tricks he came up with was etched clearly inside his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the time, it was impossible to pull off these methods. \u00a0However, he now had the Level, Items and money he could use unsparingly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'The title of the video....... I think I\u2019ll call it Giant Killer.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun\u2019s face was reflected on the Tablet PC, and one could see a smile on his lips.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

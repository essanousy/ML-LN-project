Give me the exact figure.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is 2,355 gold.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is about 100 golds more than what I expected. \u00a0Are you sure you calculated it right?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou insisted on us paying for Apollo-nim too...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chiroro was using all his strength to hold back the swear words from coming out of his mouth as he listened to the conversation. \u00a0As a result, his face was trembling. \u00a0The Big Smiles guild members were turning their gazes or eyes away as they tried to avoid meeting Chiroro's eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he berated his guild members, it wouldn't solve anything. \u00a0Chiroro continued to rage inside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I\u2019m ruined.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't know what the Watchman style was, but in the end, Chiroro had to compensate Hyrkan. Everyone had to empty the golds they possessed, and in the end, 2,355 gold was snatched away from them. \u00a0It was way cheaper than losing their wristwatches, but still it was a pretty large sum of money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, they never carried around that much gold. Unfortunately, one of the guild members doing a party hunt had two gold coins worth 1,000 gold each. He had withdrawn the gold to trade for an Item later.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018We gave him the gold, yet he is being nasty...\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was difference between asking them to send the money later, and shaking down as much money from them on the spot. \u00a0In the end, the amount of money lost was the same, but the latter method seemed much dirtier. It was on a different level.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Maybe we should have just fought him?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chiroro felt regret as if he hadn't made the right decision. \u00a0The situation had come upon him too suddenly. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the regret didn't last too long.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat should we do? \u00a0Should we track Pitbull again...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNever mind. \u00a0We won't be able to catch up to him even if we start pursuing him now.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fact that they had lost Pitbull made him much more vexed. \u00a0When the Pitbull ran away, all their efforts up until now had been all for naught. They had gone through all the hardship, yet they had lost all their money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It might have been better if we had let Whistling kill Apollo.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Apollo had suffered a Game Over by Whistling, their guild would have been justified in their retaliation. \u00a0Instead, Apollo had been killed by the Hahoe Mask. They couldn't justify starting a war with the Fighters guild any more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the Fighters guild could try to avenge Pitbull, but the Fighters guild wasn't dumb. \u00a0Their overall fighting power was weaker than the Big Smiles. \u00a0Anyways, they hadn't been able to kill the Pitbull, so there was no reason why the Fighters guild would start a fight with them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The status of the Game Over was important. If the Pitbull had suffered a Game Over, the Fighters guild would have no choice. \u00a0They would have to retaliate. \u00a0If they didn't, the faith of the normal Users in the guild would have been shaken. \u00a0If a guild did nothing when a guild member was killed, why would the guild members put their trust and loyalty into the guild?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Whistling held a unique position within the Fighters guild. \u00a0He was a normal guild member, but he was worth more than an officer. \u00a0If they didn't get revenge for a User of that stature, normal guild members would have to stay silent even if they got killed by the members of the 30 great guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This business had been an utter disaster in many ways. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Chiroro's mood worsened signficantly when a phone call arrived not too long afterwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- What the hell happened? \u00a0What;'s going on?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he heard Apollo's voice, Chiroro took deep breaths for a brief moment. \u00a0If he didn't, he probably would have said some harsh words. \u00a0After he took several breaths, Chiroro explained the situation. \u00a0After finishing his explanation, Chiroro immediately asked Apollo a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is your relationship with the Hahoe Mask?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Hahoe Mask took down Apollo, he said it was a personal grudge. \u00a0Chiroro had to confirm this fact first. \u00a0If the Hahoe Mask lied, maybe he could used this situation to his advantage. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Shit. \u00a0That isn't important right now. I was taken down by that bastard! \u00a0The Hahoe Mask smeared the reputation of the Big Smiles guild! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Chiroro heard Apollo's rage-filled voice, he intuited what had occurred.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It really had been about a personal grudge.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if one put aside the personal grudge, one just had to look at Apollo's personality. He probably acted in a corrupted manner. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he had run his guild in such a way, it meant he had run afoul of the Hahoe Mask in some way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This exacerbated the problem. \u00a0If Apollo had told everyone the truth, they could talk to each other on the same page. \u00a0However, Apollo was showing no signs of admitting his wrong doings. \u00a0He was just trying to gloss over the facts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Chiroro was sure of one thing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This guy will keep digging himself into trouble. \u00a0He will never untangle himself from the problem he causes.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This meant this business was going to get much much worse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan waved towards a dense group of trees. \u00a0Whistling appeared from behind a thick tree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In short course, the distance between the two closed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI look like a dog?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of a greeting, Whistling repeated the words he heard not too long ago. Hyrkan shrugged his shoulders.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you know anyone who think you are handsome? \u00a0Do you want me to lie about it?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy not?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIsn\u2019t that too much of a bald face lie? The Big Smiles guild members would never believe my words.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat means you really think I look like a dog.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan nodded his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you perhaps expecting me to back down, and tell you that you look like Leonardo DiCaprio?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At those words, Whistling relaxed his face, and he let out a light laugh. \u00a0Of course, he still gave off a fierce energy, but Hyrkan was used to his face now. \u00a0Hyrkan put on a smile too. Of course, Whistling hadn't mentioned the incident, because he had been offended by Hyrkan's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Thank \u00a0you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to set up a suitable atmosphere before he could speak those embarrassing words. \u00a0That was all there was to it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou don't have to thank me. Anyways, you should have contacted me. \u00a0If you had contacted me, you wouldn't have gotten into this mess.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI wanted to contact you only when I have good news.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan smirked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo why did the Big Smiles suddenly attack you? \u00a0Are they planning on starting a war with the Fighters guild?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan immediately changed the topic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This matter hadn't been something normal. Whistling had been able to operate in the Puree forest up until now. \u00a0However, the Big Smiles guild had been hellbent at catching Whistling today. If Whistling had died, the Fighters guild and the Big Smiles guild would have been put on a collision course. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey were basically trying to pick a fight with my guild.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling had an understanding of the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWill it really be ok for you to help me like this?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Whistling was worried about Hyrkan. \u00a0Whistling didn't know about Hyrkan's bad relationship with Apollo. \u00a0Whistling was under the impression that Hyrkan had antagonized the Big Smiles in the course of helping him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour relationship with the Big Smiles guild might suffer, because of me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan snorted at those words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI already have a bad relationship with Big Smiles.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you continue to act this way, the Big Smiles guild won't stay put...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou should join a guild, Hahoe Mask.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before Hyrkan could respond, Whistling immediately continued to put forward a suggestion. \u00a0Hyrkan had a glum look on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou want me to join the Fighters guild?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. I'm not talking about my guild. \u00a0You should join one of the top guilds in Warlord. \u00a0For example, you should join one like the Red Bulls or the Stormhunters.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This sudden suggest made Hyrkan's expression stiffen. \u00a0Of course, Whistling didn't know about Hyrkan's personal sentiment towards a particular guild. \u00a0The suggestion of Hyrkan joining the Stormhunters guild was like suggesting.....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This isn't even funny.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This conversation wasn't funny at all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy are you giving me such suggestions?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahoe Mask. \u00a0Is it correct of me to presume that your goal is to become the best in Warlord?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan didn't give an answer. \u00a0He just swallowed his spit a little bit. \u00a0Hyrkan didn't plan on actively hiding his own intentions, but it felt as if Whistling had read his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you want to be the best, then the answer is to join the best guild.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling's words were an advice rather than a request.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he was overstepping his bounds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI know I'm not qualified to say this, and I know this is very rude....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was well aware of this fact, but he still decided to say it. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou can become the best, Hahoe Mask. However, you are doing everything by yourself right now. You can't even take a breather.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had no doubts that Hyrkan would someday represent Warlord as the strongest and best User. The Black Tree Raid had reaffirmed Whistling's opinion of Hyrkan. \u00a0He could guarantee it. \u00a0There was no uncertainty to his eventual rise. \u00a0The only thing that could derail it was a truck hitting Hyrkan. Hyrkan would become the best.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan was doing everything by himself. It was clear that he was working himself into the ground. A person, who had the potential to become the greatest in this game, might become broken before he had the chance to become the best.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling had suspected this truth from awhile back. \u00a0Nevertheless, he was speaking out now, because Whistling was more worried about Hyrkan's well-being than before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan gave a curt reply to Whistling's advice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll be looking forward to the Circlet of Purification.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It is quieter than I thought it would be.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun busily swiped at his Tablet PC as he drank his coffee. \u00a0In the end, he turned off his Tablet PC.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been four days since the Big Smiles guild had attacked Whistling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun thought a conflict was inevitable, but unexpectedly, there had been no conflict.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Did they agree on some basic agreement?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a high chance that an under-the-table negotiation had gone on. \u00a0Of course, Ahn-jaehyun wasn't privy to the content of under-the-table deal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018So this basically means the Big Smiles still have a lot of power to spare?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could only guess at what was going on. \u00a0It seemed the Big Smiles guild had amassed their resources to fight the Fighters guild. \u00a0When power was gathered, it made one feel antsy to move. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018That bastard Apollo became an officer of the Big Smiles guild, so there is no way they'll leave me alone.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a possibility that he might be Big Smiles' next target, so he kept that possibility in mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun didn't welcome his current situation. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I fight with the Big Smiles guild right now, it'll be....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the probability of the Big Smiles guild using their full resources to catch Ahn-jaehyun was almost non-existent. \u00a0It was an act they could do only if the Big Smiles had fallen into the gutters. To put it in simple terms, if a guild used their entire resources to catch the Hahoe Mask, the world would condemn them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, they'll most definitely try to keep Ahn-jaehyun in check. \u00a0They'll just do it out of the public's eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was Ahn-jaehyun wasn't going to allow them to keep him in check. \u00a0Ahn-jaehyun didn't plan on backing down. \u00a0He planned on meeting fire with fire. \u00a0This will inevitably lead to a proper fight between him and the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why the film he commissioned with the Romani film was important.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I have a lot of bullets, there\u2019s no reason why I wouldn't be able to fight them.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun was thinking about charging admission to watch his Black Tree Raid. \u00a0There was a limit on how much he could earn by letting people view it for free. Of course, he would still be making an enormous profit even if he allowed people to view it for free.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, even such high profits was a drop in the bucket on the stage he was about to enter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I charge admissions for my video, I'll be on track. The war will start from that point on.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If paid video sales was as successful as he expected it to be, Ahn-jaehyun planned to be more aggressive in the future. He'll actively advance to the front. \u00a0He'll overtake the Underfoot guild, then he'll chip away at the 30 great guilds from the bottom to the top. \u00a0His ultimate goal was to topple the head members of the 30 great guilds. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a smile filled with happiness on Ahn-jaehyun's lips when he thought about that day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Wait for me. \u00a0I'll sever all of your wrists.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun's musing continued. \u00a0He imagined himself standing atop the crushed 30 great guilds. \u00a0He would be equipped with the strongest Items, and he would be at the head of a powerful Undead army. \u00a0It wasn't too hard for him to imagine himself that way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the smile on his lips started to fade.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I become the best\u2026\u2026.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was easy to imagine himself becoming the best.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What will I do afterwards?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn't imagine past the moment when he became the best. Ahn-jaehyun,who had been immersed in his imagination, lost the smile that had been on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Storm Queen, Matador, First Head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were the three Users that represented Warlord. They were so busy that it was almost impossible for them to have a meeting at the same time. \u00a0Moreover, it was impossible for them to meet at a single location.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why it had to be this way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">(Che-sulyun-nim has entered.) </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-sulyun-nim : Hurry up and tell me the main point of this meeting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">(Strongest Red Bulls-nim \u00a0has entered.) </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Strongest Red Bulls : Hello? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-sulyun-nim : Are you picking a fight with me?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Strongest Red Bulls : All I did was say hello?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-sulyun-nim : Change your nickname. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">(Strongest Red Bulls-nim's nickname has been changed to Invincible Red Bulls.) </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Invincible Red Bulls : ^0^ </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-sulyun-nim : You want to die? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a reason why the three of them had connected to this outdated chatting program.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After setting up the chatting room, the First Head of the Hyrdra guild had been waiting for the other two to show up. \u00a0The first order of business for the First Head was to fight the keyboard battle going on between the Storm Queen and the Matador.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First Head : Let's stop playing around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">(The room manager has changed Che-sulyun-nim's nickname to Storm Queen.) </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">(The room manager has changed Invincible Red Bulls-nim's nickname to Matador.) </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a flash, the First Head cleaned up the situation, and he continued with his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First Head : First, I want to thank you both for connecting onto this program.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Storm Queen : Main point. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First Head : We've gained information that verifies the identity of the Corrupt Prince as Prince Dean.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Matador : As expected of the Hyrdra guild, you are much further ahead in the Main Quest.

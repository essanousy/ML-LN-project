He had to live an impoverished life. \u00a0It wouldn't have been strange if the Hahoe Mask guild transitioned into a guild that no longer existed. \u00a0His dream and driving force was the only thing that had kept that guild going.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this version of the world no longer existed. \u00a0Hyrkan was the only one in this world, who remembered this line of history. \u00a0In a couple years, even he would start to forget about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Just admit it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he can say for certain that he could still remember all of it right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018In truth, this is a table set up by the Stormhunters. \u00a0If I can't eat everything on this table, I'm the retarded one.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Hyrkan had to monopolize the Frozen Kingdom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn't him simply expressing his resolve.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Stormhunters guild had revealed a comprehensive guide on hunting in the Frozen Kingdom. \u00a0Even a mediocre guild could clear the Frozen Kingdom with the information they had released. \u00a0Currently, Hyrkan was using a secret space found by the Stormhunters. \u00a0It allowed him to avoid the absolute surveillance of the Frost Knight residing at the throne of the Frozen Kingdom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everything had been provided by the Stormhunters guild. \u00a0In such circumstances, if he failed in achieving what he wanted to do, he wouldn't just be regretful. \u00a0He would be thoroughly embarrassed by the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I can't monopolize this by myself, I deserve to quit this game.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would be so ashamed that he wouldn't be able to play this game with a bare face. \u00a0There was no way others would find out about this failure, but this was about Hyrkan's own pride. \u00a0He wouldn't accept failure.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Hyrkan was more serious than ever about this venture. \u00a0He was more serious about it then the time he fought the Immoral Prince. \u00a0In truth, he hadn't fought the Immoral Prince after a thorough preparation. \u00a0Hyrkan had been conflicted as he saw the battle between Storm Queen and the Immoral Prince. \u00a0After a deliberating over his decision, he decided to act.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unlike what he did in the Immoral Prince battle, he had made exhaustive preparations before he crossed the Terube castle wall. \u00a0This was the result of the meticulous calculation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The consumable Items I have left.... \u00a0I have the exact amount left. \u00a0I have just enough to catch the Frost Knight.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, his recent hunt wasn't actually about leveling up. \u00a0He was meticulous in his actions as he set up the battle with the Frost Kingdom's boss monster, the Frost Knight. \u00a0He hunted until he had the requisite amount of consumable left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I hit level 199. \u00a0That was unexpected.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At this point in time, he had predicted he would be around 197 or 198. \u00a0His prediction was off....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Well, that's a good thing.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a pleasant miscalculation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018As expected, the most important part is the Ifrit's Essence.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What consumable Items did Hyrkan prepare to take down the Frost Knight? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was the Essence made by gathering the Ifrit's tears. Then there was the holy water made from the Great Priest's sacred blood, the gum made from the innards of the Glutton Alligator, and the healing clay made from the heart of a Red Troll. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were all very expensive Items. \u00a0Even the 30 great guilds used Items of such high value on the really important Raids.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Amongst these Items, the most important one was the Ifrit's Essence!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One had to catch a rare monster called Ifrit's Acolyte to obtain this Item. \u00a0One had to gather Ifrit's tears then one had to pay a high production cost to create this Item. \u00a0This item had two effects.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fire Attribute Resistance will increase. \u00a0Any penalty received from Fire type attacks will decrease.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ice Attribute Resistance will increase. \u00a0Any penalty received from Ice type attacks will decrease.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ifrit was the Spirit King of Fire. \u00a0With the help of Ifrit's powerful strength, one can become a friend of the fire, and at the same time, one gained the power to resist against the cold.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Originally, this consumable Item was used on Boss Monsters, who had powerful Fire type attacks. \u00a0It was a one time use Item, and there was a time when it easily cost over 4 thousand gold to purchase it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In recent days, the regions where the Ifrit's Acolyte appeared had increased. \u00a0As the monster wasn't as rare any more, the market price had significantly gone down. \u00a0Still, it was expensive. Hyrkan had bought a whopping 20 Ifrit's Essence to use in the Frozen Kingdom. \u00a0He had only one left in his supply. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, he'll have only one chance to challenge the Frost Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, there would be no re-attempt at this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Hyrkan failed at the Frost Knight Raid, he would suffer a Game Over. \u00a0The place he'll be revived was the Terube castle wall. \u00a0Currently, there were numerous Users massing up at the Terube castle wall for the Northland hunt. \u00a0Moreover, there probably was a good number of Users, who had already met the requirement for the Northland Exploration quest. \u00a0These users were already in the Northland. \u00a0If they were skilled and fast, these Users probably had already entered into the territory of the Frozen Kingdom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In such a situation, Hykran would be spending his 48 hours in death. \u00a0To fight the Frost Knight again, he would have to cover a significant amount of distance to get from the Terube castle wall to the Frozen Kingdom. \u00a0When he got here again, he would have to take a number. \u00a0He would have to wait in a queue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the wait time would be significant. \u00a0He could probably climb the Urugual mountain range once in the time he would have to wait in the queue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He shouldn't go into this expecting a second try.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Cast Iron Rhinoceros Gem and...the Bone Explosives. \u00a0All of these Items are worth over 100 golds each.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he had prepared the most expensive Items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had spent an incredible amount. \u00a0If he failed this Raid, the entire time he had in the Frost Kingdom would register as a loss in his budget.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After checking the number of Items he had, Hyrkan felt a resoluteness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He carefully started placing his organized Items into his pockets and pouches. \u00a0He felt tense as he carried out this action.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Items couldn't just be stored anywhere. \u00a0He had to know where these Items were located at, and he had put place it in locations where he could quickly reach it in a desperate situation. \u00a0He had to be thorough in his calculations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The last Item he picked up was the most important consumable Item. \u00a0it was the Ifrit's Essence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was large enough that it was a little bit uncomfortable to put it in one's mouth. \u00a0Hyrkan carefully picked it up, and he looked inside the Item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is worth more than a month supply of food. \u00a0It is expensive yet it tastes nasty.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan unintentionally lost his grip on the Ifrit's Essence. His fingers were slippery from the frost.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Took took! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fallen Ifrit's Essence bounced several times before it quickly rolled towards a wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Uh!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan became frightened. \u00a0He looked towards the wall where the Ifrit's Essence was rolling towards to. \u00a0There was a big crack at the bottom of the wall. \u00a0He didn't have the luxury to express his surprise. \u00a0When Hyrkan approached the wall, the Ifrit's Essence fell into the crack. \u00a0It was like a hole-in-one in golf. \u00a0It had been that accurate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan didn't ruminate over the surprise he was feeling. \u00a0He didn't waste any time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Choo-oong! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I don't have this, I can't beat it. \u00a0I'll have to just return to the Terube castle. Please!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He immediately took out the sword sheathed at his waist. \u00a0He started to scratch at the crack with his sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Choo-roong, choo-roong! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Crying Sword was a famed sword that had taken down numerous monsters and Users. \u00a0Currently, it was considered to be one of the ultimate swords amongst the sword carrying Users. \u00a0It was on par with the Dethroned King's sword. \u00a0In a flash, the Crying Sword had been turned into a pickaxe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe it was because of this fact. \u00a0The Crying Sword could be heard making especially mournful wails.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This sword could make scrap metals of high durability armors, and it could cut through monsters with very high defense. \u00a0However, it couldn't make a scratch in this very plain stonework. \u00a0It was a surprise to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was when Hyrkan's accident started to roll forward again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What the hell?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[This region cannot be destroyed.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The System Announcement answered Hyrkan's question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Uh?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hrykan's mishap came to pause. \u00a0Hyrkan stopped to look up at the plain looking wall. \u00a0The harsh coldness had caused ice to form over the wall. \u00a0He looked at the ice wall. \u00a0Then he looked at the crack that had eaten his precious Item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Finally, Hyrkan felt that something was off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Why is the crack only here?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was at a location about ten square meters in size. \u00a0This alcove reminded him of a cube. \u00a0The path to enter this location was small. \u00a0It was a location where the Cursed Monsters under the command of the Frost Knight couldn't come in. This was the space used by the Storm Hunters guild to safely rest before they had battled the Frost Knight. \u00a0None other than the Storm Queen herself had explained the use of this location, and how important it was to rest here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, every time Hyrkan had to take a break from the battle he had used this location.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There had been such a crack here?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one considered the setting of this stage, even if a User had made a crack, the crack should have been mended over by ice. \u00a0Moreover, the stage becomes reset when a day passes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This basically meant that his crack was clearly intentional. \u00a0It meant that this crack had been placed here by design.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan got up from his seat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Choo-roong, choo-roong! \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Crying Sword, which had been used by its owner as a pickaxe, started to grumble. \u00a0This time Hyrkan used the Crying Sword as a tool to peel off the ice from the wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Suh-guhk suh-guhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sound of the thick ice falling drowned out the Crying Sword's wailing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the wall revealed the Frozen Kingdom's emblem. \u00a0A sun and moon was above a large tree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan put on a smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Yes. \u00a0Luck is once again with me.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had found something the Stormhunters had never discovered.</span></p><br/><p>4.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There had been a kingdom in the Northland that had reached the era of prosperity a long time ago. \u00a0They were closest to the sun and the moon, and various races lived as one in this kingdom. They were the keepers of peace in the world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On a fateful day, a Frost Dragon suddenly appeared, and it crushed the kingdom that was in its era of prosperity. \u00a0Then it placed a curse on the kingdom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was curse where one could never die, and the weather would never change. \u00a0It was a curse where one had to forever fight the people that the kingdom had once helped!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Frost Dragon even bestowed authority to a knight, so it could keep an eye on the curse. \u00a0The Frost Dragon appointed the knight as the owner of the capital, which was a mere shell of itself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the story behind the Frozen Kingdom, and it was also a clue about the Ruined Kingdom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFinally, I receive the reward for long resisting the evil curse of the Frost Dragon.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had found a hidden tunnel, and when he followed the tunnel, he reached a location where a being had chained himself a long time ago. This being was so weathered that its body was falling apart. \u00a0The NPC Nero showed infinite sadness at not being able to die. \u00a0However, Hyrkan couldn\u2019t feel any hatred or confusion from the NPC.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy name is Nero. \u00a0I am the last heir to the kingdom that exists only in a nightmare now.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan decided to be bold. \u00a0He introduced himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy name is Hyrkan. \u00a0I am nothing special. \u00a0The world is overflowing with calamity, and I'm an adventurer that is striving towards hope.\u201d \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I hope the cameras are doing a good job.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had been smart in how he approached this. \u00a0He started recording beforehand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Wasn't this a truth that even the Stormhunters weren't able to find out?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Yes. \u00a0I always felt a bit disappointed at the Stormhunter's videos. \u00a0This is what they missed!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was happy. \u00a0He had to force himself not to laugh. \u00a0It was almost painful. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he wasn't happy about the fact that he found a truth that the Stormhunters hadn\u2019t found. \u00a0This footage would be part of a pay-per-view full length film, which was currently being made by him. \u00a0This would be one more point in the story that would be added to the film about the Frozen Kingdom quest. \u00a0He felt happy about the sweet reward he would receive from it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that so? \u00a0That makes me happy. \u00a0I'm happy that a hero like you still exists in this world.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm not a hero. \u00a0Anyways, I cannot fathom how you came to be in this state.... \u00a0I will undo your chains.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease don't. \u00a0These chains allows me to hold onto my intellect.

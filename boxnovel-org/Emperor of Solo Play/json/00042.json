Payment has been confirmed.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the private moneylender, Park Wuyoung\u2019s words, An Jaehyun turned his gaze towards him. Although it was a mysterious gaze, Park Wuyoung seemed to have figured out what he was thinking, and he smiled lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you suspicious because the trade ended so cleanly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun turned around and avoided his eyes. Although he didn\u2019t like the fact that his thoughts were read, it was exactly as Park Wuyoung said. An Jaehyun found it hard to believe that the private loan contract had ended like some bank transfer. That was what private loans meant to ordinary people.</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun was expecting them to play tricks on him or ask for more money. He had even walked in after preparing himself for any schemes to come.</p><br/><p>Park Wuyoung was quite used to attitude similar to An Jaehyun\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a job you can survive in by being nice, but it\u2019s also not a place that tries to screw over customers who pay their dues on time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be able to do it though.\u2019</p><br/><p>Park Wuyoung was interested in something else.</p><br/><p>When An Jaehyun first came in to borrow money, Park Wuyoung was sure that he would come begging on his knees to save him. Of course, Park Wuyoung had no intention of doing so. Be it selling his body or taking his room An Jaehyun signed as guarantee, he planned to get his money\u2019s worth.</p><br/><p>However, An Jaehyun paid back the money much earlier than it was due.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what caught Park Wuyoung\u2019s attention. As such, he stealthily changed the conversation topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know Warlord makes money, but you must be quite skilled to earn so much in such a short period of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun did not answer the question. Instead, he asked his own.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I get up now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Park Wuyoung also did not answer, and said what he wanted to say. He took out his wallet and gave An Jaehyun his business card. An Jaehyun stared fixedly at the business card.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep it short. If you\u2019re troubled by conversion fees or taxes, feel free to contact me. I\u2019ll take care of it for a much more reasonable price.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did An Jaehyun take the business card.</p><br/><p>\u2018Does he think I\u2019m some pushover?\u2019</p><br/><p>Even as he took the business card, An Jaehyun sneered on the inside.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t come see Park Wuyoung without doing his research. Although many private loaners used V-Gears for their business, not all private loaners earned their money this way.</p><br/><p>Before returning to the past, An Jaehyun worked at a Warlord workshop, and he saw the workshop owner talking with Park Wuyoung multiple times. At the same time that he was a private loaner, Park Wuyoung also made money from illegal VR game money conversion or trade.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a particularly spectacular business.</p><br/><p>To change in-game currency to money, a conversion fee had to be paid. As income tax also applied to money earned from games, many people looked for ways to decrease the conversion fee and tax rate.</p><br/><p>Of course, An Jaehyun had no intention to do business with Park Wuyoung.</p><br/><p>It was obvious.</p><br/><p>A kind private moneylender? Maybe such a thing was possible, but Park Wuyoung certainly wasn\u2019t one.</p><br/><p>This was a trap. Once An Jaehyun did business with Park Wuyoung to lower the conversion fee or income tax, Park Wuyoung would hold An Jaehyun\u2019s weakness. It was clear what would happen to those whose weaknesses were held by private moneylenders.</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun got up from his seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll contact you if I have the chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those were An Jaheyun\u2019s last words to Park Wuyoung.</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>Thwack!</p><br/><p>With an intense sound of a watermelon breaking, a Skeleton\u2019s head fastballed towards Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoop.\u201d</p><br/><p>After narrowly catching the Skeleton\u2019s head, Hyrkan made a sour face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey, go easy. Don\u2019t send heads flying everywhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyrkan put the Skeleton\u2019s head under his arm and began beating it with his hammer. Meanwhile, his Skeleton Warriors raised their hammers high, then slammed it down at the Skeleton on the ground.</p><br/><p>It was terrifying to see up close, but ridiculous if seen afar. Of course, it was a typical scene for Hyrkan. As such, he was expressionless.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can\u2019t do this anymore.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan was currently level 39. Furthermore, he only had 11 percent EXP left to go until level 40.</p><br/><p>From level 30 to level 40, he only hunted Skeletons and Skeleton Warriors. The number of Skeletons he had hunted was well over a thousand by now. He had obtained skeleton-related titles long ago. Rather than to say he was hunting skeletons, it was now better to say he was a skeleton-dismantling machine.</p><br/><p>Of course, the result was more than satisfactory. Even Hyrkan was surprised by his level up speed. His profit wasn\u2019t small either. Although Skeletons didn\u2019t particularly give a lot of money, every little bit accumulated to a rather large sum.</p><br/><p>However, his happy feeling did not last long.</p><br/><p>\u2018So what if I have money? Level 40 items are too much of a luxury.\u2019</p><br/><p>If he could, he would have sold his current items and bought the best level 40 Rare items using the money he had saved up. However, he had another place to use the 3000 gold and donation money he had.</p><br/><p>With the donation money, he had to pay next month\u2019s V-Gear installment fee and Warlord user fee. As for his 3000 gold, he had to buy Magic Power Switching Set, a core uniform for level 30+ magicians.</p><br/><p>That was how bad Hyrkan\u2019s current magic power was. Once he became level 40 and learned Golem Summon, he would have even less magic power. He couldn\u2019t throw away Golem Summon either. Golems changed the entire battle paradigm of necromancers. The existence of a solid tanker was a godsend compared to the brittle skeletons.</p><br/><p>In any case, what Hyrkan was doing was nothing short of amazing. Normally, it was impossible to get all the items one needed using the money earned through gameplay. Most players spent their own money to buy things.</p><br/><p>Even so, the only thing Hyrkan could feel was sadness on the fact that all the money he earned had disappeared into thin air. It was only natural for him to be bitter about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk!\u201d</p><br/><p>After clicking his tongue shortly, Hyrkan angrily chucked the skeleton head he had been holding.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan\u2019s Skeleton Warriors ran after the skeleton head like a dog with a new toy ball, then began hammering down at the skeleton head. Watching this, Hyrkan let out a light sigh.</p><br/><p>\u2018Never mind beef. Looks like I won\u2019t even eat pork for a while.\u2019</p><br/><p>An unspeakable hunger.</p><br/><p>The only thing that could satiate his hunger was Ahimbree, waiting at the Bangtz\u2019s Castle for him to hit level 40.</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>When Hyrkan walked into Ahimbree\u2019s office, Ahimbree drew a symbol in the air instead of speaking. Immediately after the symbol was completed, a book flew up from the pile of books spread out like trash heap. Then, it fluttered towards Hyrkan like a butterfly.</p><br/><p>It was his reward.</p><br/><p>According to Ahimbree\u2019s Teachings (2), Hyrkan would receive 2 rewards upon hitting level 40.</p><br/><p>A skillbook and Pursuer of Corruption Ring.</p><br/><p>Clearly, the book flying in front of him was his skillbook. Hyrkan quickly snatched the book from the air, then silently read its title.</p><br/><p>\u2018Skeleton Science.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan doubted his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018No way.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan read the title once again. Just like he thought, it was Skeleton Science.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan\u2019s expression stiffened up.</p><br/><p>\u2018No freaking way.\u2019</p><br/><p>Skeleton Science.</p><br/><p>It was one of the most desired skill for necromancers using Skeleton Summoning. Although it was only a Rare rank skill, its effectiveness easily made it a Unique rank skill.</p><br/><p>Its effect was simple. It was a passive skill that raised the stats of all skeletons, while decreasing the amount of magic power used.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s not impossible to obtain one\u2026 but I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get it here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan had learned about this skill from Helgen. When Helgen was explaining good skills for necromancers to have, he gave Skeleton Science 4 stars out of 5. At the same time, he said the reason he was able to stand out among all the necromancers was because he was lucky enough to obtain Skeleton Science. After that, he said to pay for information to obtain Skeleton Science.</p><br/><p>\u2018First Madness Helm, now this. As expected of one of the seven disciples of the Great Sage. Everything he gives is fantastic.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was above his expectation.</p><br/><p>It was a skill he had to obtain one day. Although it was a skill he could obtain if he had the money, he didn\u2019t think he would get it here as a quest reward.</p><br/><p>There was more.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ahimbree called Hyrkan over to his desk. Hyrkan quickly rushed to his desk, after which Ahimbree took something out from his desk drawer.</p><br/><p>A ring.</p><br/><p>It was a plain ring that had a rock where a jewel should have been.</p><br/><p>\u2018So this is the Pursuer of Corruption Ring.\u2019</p><br/><p>Pursuer of Corruption Ring.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t know its specific effects, he knew it had to be similar to the Pursuer of Corruption Necklace he had. Although necklaces usually had better options than rings, it would still be a fantastic Chronical Unique nonetheless.</p><br/><p>Above all, it wasn\u2019t easy to get accessories at this point in the game.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis ring was made using the Corrupted Stone you brought. It\u2019s a ring that uses the Corrupted One\u2019s powers. Since you brought the stone, you have the right to own this ring.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this, Hyrkan was all smiles on the inside.</p><br/><p>\u2018After what I went through to get that stone, of course.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan naturally reached out for the ring. He wanted to put it on his finger as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Swish!</p><br/><p>Ahimbree grabbed a hold of Hyrkan\u2019s hand reaching out for the ring. Hyrkan\u2019s froze.</p><br/><p>The hell?</p><br/><p>Hyrkan asked with his facial expression, and Ahimbree answered immediately as if he had read his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have the right to own this ring, but it comes with a responsibility.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyrkan answered without hesitation. Currently, he was ready to jump into a pit of fire if Ahimbree told him to. That was how happy he was.</p><br/><p>\u201cI lost contact with an agent named Migi who was pursuing the root of corruption. His last report came from Churu Castle. Go there and search for him. Then, you will have to finish his mission.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You obtained the quest, \u2018Searching for Migi.\u2019]</p><br/><p>Hyrkan had no reason to refuse Ahimbree\u2019s quest.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I can even tell you who the Corrupt Count is. What\u2019s to finding a person!\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment Hyrkan answered, Ahimbree moved his hand and Hyrkan quickly took the ring in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s\u2026 my\u2026 precious.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan\u2019s face as he put the ring on his finger was exactly like that of Gollum from Lord of the Rings.</p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

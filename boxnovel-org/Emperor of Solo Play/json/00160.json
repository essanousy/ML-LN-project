He was swift in his dodges. He swung the Deposed Prince's Sword, and it scraped Anugas' body. A deep wound was made each time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Its leather has considerable defensive capabilities. \u00a0It might be better to use the Crying sword instead of the Deposed Prince's Sword.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's sword suddenly changed from the Deposed Prince's Sword to the Crying Sword inside Hyrkan's simulation,.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Choo-roong choo-roong!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An additional sound was added in. \u00a0The frozen battle started up once again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Hmmmm.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At a certain point, Hyrkan frowned. \u00a0He had been earnestly fighting when Hyrkan's left arm was caught by Anugas' arm. \u00a0He frowned as he watched Anugas lift him into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I continue to do a close combat, I'll eventually be caught..\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan stopped the gruesome simulation. \u00a0He didn't need to think along this thread anymore. \u00a0He once again reminded the simulation back to the first scene.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He started the same battle again. \u00a0However, Hyrkan had changed his Item setting. \u00a0He also changed his battle style. \u00a0Instead of a straight close combat, he started a hit &amp; run style battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Mmmmm.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They looked like knights on horses with their spears raised. \u00a0They ran at each other. \u00a0It was like a jousting match. \u00a0At the brief moment of contact, they glanced by each other as they gave each other small wounds. \u00a0The battle continued for a long time without anything bad happening.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ughhh.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, at a certain point, uninvited guests dropped in on the battle. \u00a0A massive magical bombardment started falling towards Anugas and Hyrkan. \u00a0The AOE magic covered the battle, and in the end, he lost.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, someone's voice tickled Hyrkan's ears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan. \u00a0Do you know the watchman style?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan once again ended the simulation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan didn't attempt the simulation again. \u00a0Instead, he looked at the ruins of the Heard Fortress. \u00a0He moved his gaze to the side, and he looked towards the thick forest surrounding the Heard Fortress. \u00a0The cries of monsters were exploding out from the forest. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The actual sound that had tickled Hyrkan's ears was the sound of a battle between monsters and a group of Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan frowned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018In the end, the problem is the Pasta bastards.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pasta. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hyrkan wasn't talking about spaghetti.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan called them Pasta instead of Five Stars.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, it was a nickname given to the five guilds trying to monopolize the Black Continent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the nickname Pasta didn't have a good meaning behind it. \u00a0Many Users were dissatisfied with the activities of these five guilds, and they were the subject of derision by the Users. \u00a0When the awesome nickname of Five Stars was given to these five guilds, some wise-ass User decided to call them Pasta. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this didn't mean the capability of the Five Stars was a joke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Five Stars wanted to make the Black Continent their own stage. \u00a0To carry out this monopoly, they showed that they were very thorough in their preparations and planning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One of this plan was to monitor the ruins of the Heard Fortress.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Five Stars experienced a bitter lesson from Anugas, who was the Boss Monster of the Heard Fortress. \u00a0Unless the Five Stars were idiots, it would be natural for them to pay careful attention to Anguas.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In other words, the Five Stars would know in short time when Hyrkan attempted the Anugas Raid. \u00a0At the very least, the Five Stars were prepared to mobilize if such an event did occur.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was another obvious point, but no one would help Hyrkan in the Anugas Raid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFuck.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rough swear words came out of Hyrkan's mouth. \u00a0In the end, the situation forced Hykan to make a choice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, Hyrkan had to choose to share.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018A day like this has finally come.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hyrkan would bear the full responsibility that came with his choice. \u00a0This was why he was letting out the rough cuss words.</span></p><br/><p>8.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou look pretty.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don't care if I look pretty. \u00a0That doesn't mean anything. \u00a0Just tell me what kind of vibe I\u2019m \u00a0giving off.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn truth, a man usually doesn't look too deeply. He'll just think you are pretty, and he won't care what vibe you give off.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow about you, Hahui? \u00a0What do you think?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a loud sound erupted from next to Hatch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cQueen is the best!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch furrowed his brows at the sound. \u00a0Hahui had yelled out without any thought, and Hahui's voice had almost burst Hatch's eardrums. \u00a0Hahui had yelled with all her might from right next to him. \u00a0Of course, his expression wasn't good when he heard such a sound.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch continued to frown as he looked at the beautiful woman, who unfurled her hair. \u00a0He looked at Shir.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It isn't as if she is going out to meet a prospective marriage partner... Jeez.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He reflexively tried to laugh out loud. \u00a0However, Hatch immediately forced down the laughter. \u00a0He knew he shouldn't laugh in this situation. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cQueen.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSpeak.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want to be clear about this. \u00a0It is ok to show good intentions towards him, but please don't do anything that'll cause a loss to our guild. If you do act in such a way, I really am going to leave this guild.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the feeling he had as a loyal subject. \u00a0He had spoken his advice towards the tyrant. \u00a0His emotions was writ large on his face. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow laughable. Your contract runs until 2050.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShut the hell up, 2051.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahui's verbal tackle changed his serious expression into an annoyed expression. \u00a0His terms of contract was Hatch's achilles heel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir spoke calmly as she looked at the two.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want everyone to be on standby.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was calm and forthright. \u00a0After ending her words, she turned her back on the Users that were looking at her. \u00a0Thirty Stormhunters guild members were standing not too far away from Hatch and Hahui.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were nervous as they looked at the back of their leader.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The source of their nervousness....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I never expected the Hahoe Mask to approach us first.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The contact had come so suddenly. \u00a0This was the first time the Hahoe Mask had contacted the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From the Hahoe Mask's perspective, it should have been easy to contact them. \u00a0The Stormhunters guild had sent so many love calls that the Hahoe Mask was probably tired and annoyed at receiving them. \u00a0There had been many opportunities for him to return the love call.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the first time the Hahoe Mask had answered their ardent love call.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this didn't mean the Hahoe Mask was committed to joining the Stormhunters guild. \u00a0The purpose of this meeting was to make a deal. \u00a0Hahoe Mask didn't tell them the content of the deal. \u00a0The only thing he promised was a meeting where they'll talk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he asked Shir to come by herself, and Shir had readily accepted the proposal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, the Storm Queen would have a one on one talk with the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If this goes sideways, our dealing will get endlessly tangled up. \u00a0If it works out, everything will keep getting untangled.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hatch was worried about two things.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First, he worried the Hahoe Mask might attack the Storm Queen. \u00a0He could guarantee it. \u00a0The Storm Queen couldn't win against the Hahoe Mask in a 1on1 battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The other worry was the fact that the Storm Queen had something akin to a crush on the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0He worried she would agree to a bad proposal, because she was influenced by her emotions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was actually worried more about the latter situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018She's weirdly weak in front of the Hahoe Mask.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Storm Queen was interested in the Hahoe Mask, and her affections may be considered to be a crush. \u00a0No, it might be something more. \u00a0However, the Storm Queen's personality didn't allow her to send a love letter with her ardent feeling in it. She had a twisted personality that she destroyed whatever she couldn't have.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, her twisted affection wouldn't help in a rational deal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem with this situation was the stage . \u00a0The Black Continent was a very harsh land that even the Stormhunters guild was struggling against.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In such a harsh land, the Hahoe Mask had approached the Stormhunters guild. \u00a0At the very least, he wouldn't be approaching them with peaceful intentions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Please let it not be about fighting Anugas together. \u00a0We have to avoid doing a Raid against a monster that had suddenly appeared.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch prayed once again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The conversation between the two started as the prayer ended.</span></p><br/><p>9.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Storm Queen and the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were the most skilled Users representing Warlord. \u00a0The worth of the Storm Queen's name by itself was less than the Hahoe Mask, but everyone agreed that these two were the top 2 skilled Users in Warlord. \u00a0Everyone considered it to be fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their sex didn't have to do anything with their rankings. \u00a0In many ways, these two were unprecedented in their accomplishments. \u00a0Each of them were making their own unparalleled storyline in Warlord\u2019s history. \u00a0The two of them were treated almost as equals. \u00a0They were seen as being of equal rank. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unless the Storm Queen and the Hahoe Mask fought for supremacy, this perception wouldn't change.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, there was the Immoral Prince raid footage. \u00a0They had fought together for the first time, yet they were completely in sync. \u00a0Of course, it held the distinction of being the most clicked video in regards to Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two Users were facing each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a first for both of them. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want to thank you for that time.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Storm Queen was the first to speak, and she had thanked someone else. \u00a0This was a first in many ways.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan did show any reaction towards her gesture. \u00a0The only thing that could be seen beneath the Hahoe Mask was his lips. \u00a0He didn't smile or frown. \u00a0His mouth just stayed the same.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After looking at Hyrkan, Shir spoke once again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you don't want a long talk, let's get down to business.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't an exaggeration to say that Shir had the shortest temper in Warlord. \u00a0However, at that moment, Shir wasn't angry. \u00a0Instead, she went out of her way to move the situation along.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan slowly opened his mouth as he looked at her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm going to do the Anugas Raid.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He brought up the main subject of this meeting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir had expected those words, so her answer came out immediately.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo what? \u00a0Are you asking for our help?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWill you help me if I ask for help?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have to think on it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anugas. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Stormhunters guild didn't have a lot of information regarding Anugas. \u00a0The Five Stars held the most information, since they had fought Anugas. \u00a0They had gained information through the not so insignificant sacrifices of their members.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, the rumors had spread. The Stormhunters guild had received the information that this Boss Monster had a ridiculous ability that prevented the Users from using their Skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Hatch had spoken to her. \u00a0If the Hahoe Mask suggested they do a Raid, he told her to turn down the Hahoe Mask no matter what. He told her to ignore all his requests unless the Hahoe Mask joins the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In other words, they would willingly fight with the Hahoe Mask if he joins the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSolo Play.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hahoe Mask crushed Shir's expectation with a single word.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll catch Anugas by myself.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Shir knew what Solo Play meant, yet the Hahoe Mask had spoken again. \u00a0Moreover, Shir felt as if Hyrkan's words wasn't directed at her. \u00a0It was directed toward some other unknown person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir's expression turned to ice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen what do you want from us?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, Shir had wanted such a picture. \u00a0She wanted a situation where the Hahoe Mask shared fate with the Stormhunters guild. \u00a0It was a radical idea, yet she had wished for it. \u00a0However, Hyrkan had stepped on her wish in a single breath. \u00a0Of course, her expression would cool.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want you to block the Five Stars from interfering with me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy should we do that?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf I fail, the baton will be passed on to you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir held herself back from complaining.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo you want us to be the bridesmaid.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been the same in the Argardo raid. \u00a0They had to create a stage where Hyrkan would be able to focus on the Anugas raid. \u00a0If he failed at the Anugas Raid, the Stormhunters guild would hold the rights to attempt the Raid next.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, after fighting a battle with Hyrkan, Anugas would be in tatters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, that was the only merit they'll gain from this. \u00a0It would be hard to expect anything extra.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Above all, the Stormhunters guild would suffer significant damage if they got in the way of the Five Stars.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan used a card he prepared to convince the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI would like you to do me this favor instead of the thanks you gave me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The thanks he had received was in regards to the Immoral Prince Raid. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she hear those words, all traces of emotion was erased from Shir's lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0I can't stand being indebted to anyone.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What kind of expression would Hatch make if he had heard this conversation?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hatch wasn't present in this meeting. \u00a0Moreover, their conversation wasn't being transmitted using Voice Talk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll do it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir gave a firm answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen there will be no debt between us.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0There will be no debt.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a flash, the debt that was between the two was gone. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir was able to finally bring up the subject.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahoe Mask. \u00a0You should join the Stormhunters guild. \u00a0We'll promise you the best treatment.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he heard her words, Hyrkan looked hard at her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A thick silence had descended.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the end of the silence, Hyrkan opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn this game, the Stormhunters guild's symbol...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Toohk toohk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan tapped the left side of his chest with a finger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI will never step onto a battlefield with the symbol placed there.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His gesture reinforced his strong words. \u00a0Shir's expression turned much colder at his extremely strong words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if a snowstorm was about to form around Shir.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat's the reason?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan turned his back to her instead of telling her his reasons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While his back was turned to her, he spoke in a low voice. \u00a0He spoke in such a small voice that the only one that was able to hear his words was Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is the accomplishments I've achieved until now. \u00a0I won't be able to do it, because I would be ashamed of myself.\u201d</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

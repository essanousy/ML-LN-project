couldn\u2019t measure the length of the Dragon with one\u2019s eyes. \u00a0The Dragon was unfathomably large, and it was flying through the darkened sky. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh-whew....\u201d \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A User wearing a Hahoe Mask was looking at the Dragon from the ground. \u00a0He let out a deep sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This game is really fucked up.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After letting out a sigh, Hyrkan raised his head again to look at the Dragon. \u00a0It was one kilometer long. \u00a0It was capable enough to bring calamity to the world. \u00a0It was the final boss with an awesome presence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Its official name was Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the Users added the \u2018of Calamity\u2019 to the short name. \u00a0The title stuck.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I\u2019ll have to climb from the tail to reach its body. \u00a0Then I have to stab the War King\u2019s Spear into the wound on its neck.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In short order, Hyrkan would have to start his monster hunt against the ridiculous Dragon of Calamity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hunting method was simple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the one kilometer long Dragon approaches the ground, the Dragon\u2019s tail will touch the ground. \u00a0As the tail scrapes across the ground, one would have to stick to the tail. \u00a0This was the starting point. \u00a0As the Dragon ascends into the sky, he would have to travel from the tail to the neck. \u00a0He had to crawl up a distance of 1 kilometer, then he would have to find the wound on the neck. \u00a0Then he just had to plant the crude looking spear into the wound.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to be cautious of only one thing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Falling! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dragon\u2019s body moved so roughly that a rodeo couldn\u2019t hold a candle to this. \u00a0The only thing one had to worry about was falling off the Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI really want to see what the bastard, who made this shitty game, looks like.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was obvious, but everything about this was insane. \u00a0Moreover, Hyrkan had to solo this craziness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan already felt queasy. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t have a fear of heights, but he would probably develop one that day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Get ready, Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a clear and very beautiful voice rang out inside the Hahoe Mask\u2019s ears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The tail will reach the ground soon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir had a voice that was very easy on the ears. \u00a0However, instead of smiling, Hyrkan frowned a little bit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI know.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He answered in a brusque voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Bear this in mind. \u00a0When you climb the Dragon\u2019s tail\u2026.. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m more knowledgeable than about the process, so you don\u2019t have to explain it to me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Also, when this game ends\u2026.. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s talk about it when we get to that point. \u00a0Stop treating me like your underling. \u00a0I'm unaffiliated right now. \u00a0Stop telling me what to do.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I\u2019m sorry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Shir apologized when she heard his brusque response. \u00a0Hyrkan suddenly became speechless.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018...this is driving me nuts.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir responded in such a docile manner that Hyrkan had a hard time accepting the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are going to do it even if I try to stop you. \u00a0Don\u2019t worry about it. \u00a0There\u2019s nothing I can\u2018t do now.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Hyrkan caressed the situation instead of baring his teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Fighting. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir gave a cheer for Hyrkan. \u00a0He let out a deep sigh at her words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how the call came to an end. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dragon, which had been circling the sky, was incrementally getting closer to the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, the Dragon\u2019s tail descended towards the ground. \u00a0\u00a0The lowered tail would reach Hyrkan in couple of minutes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan clenched his two fists as he looked at the Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the final battle. \u00a0It didn\u2019t matter if he won or lost. \u00a0He would leave Warlord after this. \u00a0He already gave his announcement to the public. \u00a0If he won, he\u2019ll retire. \u00a0Even if he lost, he\u2019ll give up on Warlord, and he would retire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I\u2019ll probably be too embarrassed to come back.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t go back on his words. \u00a0Hyrkan had already given his announcement. \u00a0He would feel too much shame if he went back on his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he had no regrets.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Yes. \u00a0I have put an end to this long relationship. \u00a0It isn\u2019t as if I can always devote my life to Warlord.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan actually felt relieved.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From the time before he came back to the past and afterwards, his life had been intertwined with Warlord. \u00a0Thanks to Warlord, he had lived through difficult times. \u00a0On the other hand, Warlord now allowed him to prosper in life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had shared the good times and the bad times with Warlord. \u00a0He had experienced all sorts of emotions. \u00a0Now it was time to let it go. \u00a0There was no game in this world that could be played forever. \u00a0Everything in this world had a start and an end. \u00a0An end was needed to start a new beginning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan stood up from his seat. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeletons\u2019 gaze moved in sync with Hyrkan\u2019s movement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Until a moment ago, his Skeleton Warriors, Knights and Death Knight had fought against the warriors controlled by the Dragon. \u00a0The signs of battle was all over their bodies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan hesitated for a brief moment as he looked at the wounds they received from the fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He stopped for a brief moment to look at them. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan unconsciously raised his hand towards the nearest Skeleton Warrior.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ssoo-oohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Warrior quickly dodged the hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan let out a bitter laugh when he saw the Skeleton Warrior\u2019s action. \u00a0Hyrkan once again extended his hand in a swift manner. \u00a0The Skeleton Warrior tried hard to dodge the hand, but at a certain point, Hyrkan had grabbed the head of the Skeleton Warrior.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After grabbing the head of the Skeleton Warrior, Hyrkan brought his head towards it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you for everything.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Toohk\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 Toohk\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn many ways, you guys met a strange owner. \u00a0Still, I was able to reach this point, because of you all.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan lightly and gently knocked heads with the Skeleton Warrior\u2019s skull.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is goodbye.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he spoke his words, Hyrkan took off his Hahoe Mask. \u00a0He had revealed his face to the world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soon, the world will know his face through the Stormhunter\u2019s live channel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Goodbye Skeletons and the Hahoe Mask.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The world would remember the Hahoe Mask Hyrkan. \u00a0However, now they would remember Ahn-jaehyun, who was the Hahoe Mask Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s end this.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan put an end to the very long relationship he had with the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p>3.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want 10 dollar worth of lottery ticket with random draw.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The part time worker had been watching a video on his tablet. \u00a0He paused the video before he calculated the customer\u2019s order.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the customer ordered, he printed out a lottery ticket as he let the machine pick random numbers. \u00a0Then he scanned the barcode of the customer\u2019s other item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSince this is a beef gimbap\u2026. \u00a0The total is 15 dollars.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHere.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0Thank y\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He saw a 50 dollar bill in front of his eyes, so the part time worker naturally raised his eyes to look at the customer. \u00a0The customer was rail thin, and he was wearing thick glasses. Overall, he looked like a pushover. \u00a0The customer looked like someone that will fall for any deceit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Huh?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the convenience store\u2019s part timer felt as if he had seen this person before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he asked a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHave I met you before from somewhere?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of answering, the customer\u2019s brows furrowed a little bit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The part timer thought he had overstepped his bounds, so he quickly gave the customer his change and the lottery ticket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The customer exited the convenience store, and the part timer started up the video on his tablet again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Uh? \u00a0Hahoe Mask! \u00a0The Hahoe Mask took off his Hahoe Mask!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the part time worker stood up from his seat in shock. \u00a0Then he looked out the window. \u00a0He saw the customer get into a very sleek and new lamborghini. \u00a0\u00a0The part time worker yelled as he looked at the customer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy god. \u00a0He\u2019s the Hahoe Mask Hyrkan, Ahn-jaehyun! \u00a0This is crazy! \u00a0I have to get his signature. \u00a0A signature....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The part timer tried to rush out, but the customer\u2019s car was already pulling out towards the road.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh-oh!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the part time worker had to give up on getting the signature.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is nuts. \u00a0How could I not recognize the Hahoe Mask?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was an avid fan of the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0He kicked himself for not recognizing the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After his despair came to an end, he had a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Why did the Hahoe Mask buy a lottery ticket? \u00a0He retired from Warlord, but didn\u2019t he make a lot of money? \u00a0I thought he sold several million copies of his Frozen Kingdom episode.\u2019</span></p><br/><p>4.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had his hands on the sleek handle of the lamborghini. \u00a0He wore a Patek Philippe watch on his wrist, and he was oozing with presence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What he wore and drove was much more expensive than a house. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun opened the beef kimbap he purchased earlier, and he started chewing on a piece.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he ate, he thought about the lottery numbers he had purchased.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I should have memorized the winning lottery number.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFuck the IRS!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Ahn-jaehyun unconsciously let out a wail of despair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun replayed the conversation he had with the agents of the IRS.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMr. Ahn-jaehyun. \u00a0You have evaded paying a significant amount of tax.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt wasn\u2019t tax evasion\u2026..\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he retired from Warlord, Ahn-jaehyun did everything he couldn\u2019t do before, because he had been playing Warlord. \u00a0First, he bought and moved into the best penthouse apartment he could find. \u00a0Then he bought a lamborghini in one lump sum. \u00a0Afterwards, he slowly bought luxury items to fill up his newly purchased apartment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Those were his happy days. \u00a0He was so happy that he sometimes forgot to eat!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, a dark cloud appeared above Ahn-jaehyun\u2019s happiness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun had made an enormous amount of money through Warlord. \u00a0Moreover, he participated in some shady practices to pay less tax, and he had been caught by the IRS. \u00a0Of course, Ahn-jaehyun hadn\u2019t known he had participated in a shady practice. \u00a0The accountant he hired said everyone did it, and he would be an idiot if he didn\u2019t take advantage of it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe don\u2019t care about your situation, Mr. Ahn-jaehyun. \u00a0Our role is to take back the exact amount you owe us in taxes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways, this problem exploded in his face. \u00a0He had never dealt with IRS agents before, so he was at a loss as to what to do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou have two choices. \u00a0We can do this by force. \u00a0Or you can cooperate with us, and we can come to an agreement.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI...I\u2019ll cooperate.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He decided to pay his taxes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was a problem. \u00a0Ahn-jaehyun didn\u2019t have enough liquid assets to pay off the taxes in its entirety. \u00a0The tax bill wasn\u2019t small. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the IRS took his cut of the profit in selling footages of Warlord. \u00a0Moreover, they took his sponsorship money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason behind his purchase of the lottery ticket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He purchased a lottery ticket every time Ahn-jaehyun ate beef kimbap and ramen. \u00a0He prayed for a winning lottery ticket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Should I go to Che-sulyun, and ask her to buy me some meat? \u00a0Shit. \u00a0I acted so bold in front of Che-sulyun, so how would I look if I asked her to buy me some meat? \u00a0Ah, this is driving me nuts. \u00a0I should have just kept my money. \u00a0Why did I have to buy\u2026..\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wallowed in his pain and suffering as he chew on the beef kimbap.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a call arrived.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReceive incoming call!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Ahn-jaehyun yelled out, a hologram picture of a phone appeared in front of his eyes. \u00a0The caller\u2019s name also appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The caller was Che-sulyun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Ahn-jaehyun. \u00a0Tobot Soft officially announced their next project.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- There will be two version to the next project. \u00a0One will be the light version where normal Users will be able to enjoy themselves. \u00a0The other version is the Pro version. \u00a0It is said that no one can beat it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As soon as her words ended, he heard the voice of Tobi Gwynn. \u00a0His voice filled the interior of Ahn-jaehyun\u2019s car.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Was the Pro Version an attempt to dominate the rapidly growing VR eSports market?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- It was the same during the days of Warlord. \u00a0Tobot Soft always strives to make that one special game. \u00a0We make unique products. \u00a0Our next project is a challenge we are putting out to the VR pro-gamers. \u00a0I'll guarantee it. \u00a0This game will be more difficult than any other game in the market.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- How difficult is it?

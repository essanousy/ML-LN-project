Hyrkan\u2019s memory wasn\u2019t that great, but it wasn\u2019t too hard remember the address. The search word was Parung Forest, and the password was 991. \u00a0If he couldn\u2019t remember that, there was something severely wrong with him.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he recalled how he looked as he turned down their offer.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan lowered his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018I guess I was a bit cold at that time.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had coldly refused their offer, and he recalled how unpleasant he had looked.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he now desired their help, so Hyrkan could only let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u2018Will I be able to join the community now?\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course, Hyrkan knew the characteristics of a community, and what role it serves. A community was a lubricant-like existence for Warlord. \u00a0The communities were unexpectedly of great help in numerous situations. \u00a0They were sometimes more helpful than a guild. \u00a0The guild took a long time to give help, but the community could give immediate help, since it was composed of users in the same region.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t uncommon to see a community evolve into a guild. \u00a0Sometimes, the community was on equal footing with the guilds.</p><br/><p>This was the reason why he turned down the offer to join the community.</p><br/><p>The members of a community had a deep and hard to break bonds. \u00a0Once he dipped his foot in, it would be inevitable he would leave behind his footprint. What would happen if they became close? \u00a0It was fine to become close to them. \u00a0Hyrkan was afraid of what would happen after they became close.</p><br/><p>\u201cUghhh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyrkan let out a moan.</p><br/><p>Kwahng!</p><br/><p>Hyrkan\u2019s worries disappeared suddenly with the sound of an explosive boom.</p><br/><p>Hweeek!</p><br/><p>Hyrkan turned his head towards where the noise emanated. It had detonated from a pretty far distance away yet the sound of the explosion was quite powerful. \u00a0Hyrkan, who was far away, heard it with his ear, but he could also feel the explosion with his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyrkan reflexively let out a short exclamation.</p><br/><p>If such an explosion happened in reality, it would cause widespread fear. \u00a0However, the sound of an explosion occurring in Warlord was like a beacon indicating there was something worth watching for the spectators. \u00a0\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cThe power used is quite considerable?\u201d</p><br/><p>In truth, the powerful magic used by high level magicians were quite the spectacle. \u00a0This was the reason why there was a program showing only high level magicians of the 30 Great Guilds using magic. \u00a0It only showed them using magic, but the number of people tuning in was quite considerable.</p><br/><p>However, the magicians didn\u2019t like to use magic of this caliber.</p><br/><p>\u2018So why are they using such magic here?\u2019</p><br/><p>They especially almost never used it against regular monsters on a Field type hunting ground unless it was a Boss monster.</p><br/><p>Basically, the magician\u2019s Magic Stat was on the low side. \u00a0When one levels up, most of the bonus points was invested into Intelligence. \u00a0If one had a lot of disposable income, one could use Recovery Items to cover up the short supply of magic power. \u00a0In that case, the user would invest all the bonus points into Intelligence.</p><br/><p>It was obvious to say this, but the powerful magical spells required incredible amount of Magical Powers. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t something one could use easily. \u00a0The worst situation a magician can be in was when one was short on Magic Powers. \u00a0One would be literally sucking on one\u2019s thumb for the duration.</p><br/><p>Also, the really powerful magic could change the tide of the battle. \u00a0This was why there were some positives and negatives. \u00a0The magic couldn\u2019t differentiate between allies and enemies. \u00a0Even if one was in a party, the swung sword or the magic thrown by an ally could cause others damage. \u00a0This was how the game, Warlord, worked.</p><br/><p>So what happens if one\u2019s allies get swept up in the area of effect of the powerful magic? \u00a0It wasn\u2019t something one could forgive by buying the other party member a dinner.</p><br/><p>However, that kind of powerful magic had made an appearance right now.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mmmm\u2026\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan didn\u2019t dismiss this fact.</p><br/><p>\u2018It happened when I first came here, and then\u2026\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>Usually, \u00a0normal user would dismiss such an event. \u00a0A really strong magic had gone off! The user wouldn\u2019t think any further than that.</p><br/><p>However, Hyrkan was different. He was pitiable and worthless in the real world, but inside Warlord, Hyrkan had more knowledge and experience than anyone. \u00a0His instincts were more outstanding than a wild beast.</p><br/><p>It was like that right now.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan\u2019s mind instinctively organized the situation.</p><br/><p>\u2018Four days ago.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan had witnessed an enormous explosion when he first came to the Parung Forest. \u00a0The explosion that occurred at the time was also the result of powerful magic. \u00a0When he looked into it, a party fighting the Boss monster Red Eye used the magic to buy some time.</p><br/><p>The Red Eye was killed on that day.</p><br/><p>This had been 4 days ago. Now the loud sound of an explosion had rang out once again. \u00a0It may be that the Red Eye was newly regenerated, and some group was trying to take it down.</p><br/><p>However, there was an important fact he knew. \u00a0The Red Eye Ogre took one week to regenerate. \u00a0If the Red Eye was killed 4 days ago, then why was there a such a deafening roar?</p><br/><p>\u2018There should be no Red Eyes here.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was sure of that fact. \u00a0The Red Eye wasn\u2019t currently present in the battlefield nor any other place inside the Parung Forest. \u00a0This current situation was a prime example why Hyrkan was thinking about joining a Community. Once the Red Eye regenerates, it would be much harder for him to hunt and search inside the Parung Forest. \u00a0He had to get his answer before that happened.</p><br/><p>So why did someone use such powerful magic?</p><br/><p>Of course, someone could have used it to blow away a large number of monsters with a single blow.</p><br/><p>\u2018No. \u00a0There aren\u2019t any users here, who would hunt by kiting. \u00a0There aren\u2019t any irrational users here, who would try hunting a group of monsters.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan recalled the parties and guilds he saw in this place, and he hadn\u2019t seen anyone who would have tried kiting the monsters. This place wasn\u2019t ideal to try such a group hunting method. \u00a0This place was overflowing with monster yet someone wanted to kite the monsters? \u00a0One would fail at least once or twice in ten tries. \u00a0Moreover, that one or two failure will lead to a Game Over.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then it means something strong has appeared?\u2019</p><br/><p>This was the conclusion he came up with.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan put on his Shadow Dog Set\u2019s hood.</p><br/><p>[Shadow Hunting Dog Set\u2019s Special Effect \u2018Shadow Hunting Dog\u2019 is activated.]</p><br/><p>His presence became faint, and his body became light.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan started moving swiftly like a Shadow Hunting Dog.</p><br/><p>When the Toon party sent out a request for help, the first one to arrived was the Alto family, who had been the closest to them.</p><br/><p>However, when the Alto family saw the Toon Family surrounded by a group of monsters, they didn\u2019t immediately rush in to help them. \u00a0 Instead, they hid between the black trees as they assessed the situation.</p><br/><p>They had a gut feeling as they viewed the sight.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ooh-ah. \u00a0Isn\u2019t this going to be really hard?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018If we join in, won\u2019t we be killed?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What the hell? \u00a0What are those bastards?\u2019</p><br/><p>The situation was much worse than expected.</p><br/><p>At a glance, they saw at least 8 Black Trolls. \u00a0Moreover, smallfry monsters were surrounding the Black Trolls. \u00a0There were over 20 of them, and they weren\u2019t monsters that could be ignored.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey. \u00a0Why are they suddenly wearing armor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe they formed an alliance with the monster in the Bulkas mountains.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think this is an appropriate time for a joke?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Moreover, the monsters were armed. \u00a0The gears were quite good\u2026. \u00a0It looked better than the gears worn by some users. \u00a0Their gears were clean, and shiny. \u00a0It didn\u2019t show any signs of battle. \u00a0Also, the Black Trolls didn\u2019t have their customary thick wooden clubs for weapon. \u00a0Instead, they possessed blunt steel swords.</p><br/><p>There was more. \u00a0There was a being that drew their gaze more than the group of Black Trolls.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an ogre wearing a helmet.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was 5 meters tall. \u00a0Normally, an ogre would explicitly show off its muscles, but this one wore a silver armor. Its most memorable feature was the eyes that could be seen beneath the horned helmet. \u00a0Its eye was a mixture of red and black.</p><br/><p>There were 30 of them in total.</p><br/><p>The 5 members of the Toon party was surrounded by these group of 30 monsters. The Mage and the Priest was within the Shield Magic. \u00a0The tanker had received a full Buff, and he was trying to block the advancing monsters in front of his party members with his last-ditch effort.</p><br/><p>This formation wouldn\u2019t last long.</p><br/><p>If they were going to help, they would have to help them immediately.</p><br/><p>However, they had never seen these types of monsters before. \u00a0Moreover, there were 30 of them. \u00a0The Alto Family merely had 5 members, so they probably would be able to do nothing even if they did step forward.</p><br/><p>Even during all of this, the Alto Family closely observed the situation. \u00a0They were trying hard to gather as much information as they could.</p><br/><p>Eventually, someone made an observation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ogre\u2019s eyes isn\u2019t red. \u00a0I think it is a mixture of red and black?</p><br/><p>\u201cBlack?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWas it exposed to the power of Corruption?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought the Corrupt Count was killed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if the Corrupt Count is dead, it doesn\u2019t mean the power of Corruption would disappear. \u00a0At a glance, I can tell it is a Quest Monster that appears in the Main Scenario.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even during all of this, they were able to recognize the clue. \u00a0The Alto Family were most definitely worthy of reaching level 100. \u00a0Of course, if they stepped forward to help the Toon Party, they would reach level 100 at a later date.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we could open up a path\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s say we succeed in opening a path. \u00a0If their aggro is drawn towards us, who would take on the aggro of that many monsters?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, the tanker should head out..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026seriously. \u00a0Next time I start a new game I will unconditionally become a magician.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Toon Party was trapped within the group of monsters. \u00a0If the Alto Family wanted to save them, they would have to risk a Game Over. \u00a0First, they had to open up a pathway, but the aggro would land on the Alto Family. \u00a0Afterwards, they had no idea how the situation would turn out.</p><br/><p>The important part was the gravity of word, Game Over.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t light at all.</p><br/><p>Moreover, they were at the cusp of level 100. \u00a0The 48 hours would feel like 48 days to them.</p><br/><p>The Alto Family looked at each other.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah. \u00a0I really don\u2019t want to die\u2026\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Should we just ignore them and head back?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Still, it isn\u2019t as if we are acquainted with the Toon party for only one or two days. \u00a0When we said we ran out of items, they even shared their healing items with us.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018They are good guys\u2026\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t want to step forward.</p><br/><p>However, they also didn\u2019t want to run away.</p><br/><p>As they were thinking hard about the situation, the priest who had been in voice talk with the Toon Party spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe members of the Toon Party saw us.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were seen?</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s face hardened. Now they couldn\u2019t just run away as if they hadn\u2019t seen anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did they say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey said they won\u2019t be able to escape from this place easily. They said to run. \u00a0They don\u2019t want us to die in vain. \u00a0They don\u2019t want us to suffer a Game Over.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment they heard those words, the Alto Family easily came to a decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat son of a bitch. \u00a0He really knows how to butter up a person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be bad form to run away after hearing those words..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not over do it. \u00a0We\u2019ll used some magic to open a path for them. \u00a0We\u2019ll help them only up to that point.</p><br/><p>The Alto Family were gamers, who knew romanticism.</p><br/><p>The situation was already a pandemonium when Hyrkan arrived. Ten users were in a confrontation against a group of monsters. \u00a0Hyrkan noticed the 10 users were divided into three groups, and each group was fighting independently of each other.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t a normal formation.</p><br/><p>This was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018They were attempting a rescue, but instead they were swept up into the fight.\u2019</p><br/><p>Basically, they hadn\u2019t intended to join the fight, but the result of the battle had turned out unpredictably.</p><br/><p>\u2018While they were trying open a path with magic, a portion of the party became cut off by the monsters. \u00a0Moreover, the ones that went into help the other group became surrounded\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan quickly assessed the situation. \u00a0Truthfully, he didn\u2019t need to assess the situation. \u00a0That wasn\u2019t the important part. \u00a0The important part was coming to a decision on what he would do.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan kept a low profile as he watched the scene. Thanks to the effects of the Shadow Hunting Dog set Hyrkan\u2019s sense of presence was very faint.</p><br/><p>This was why\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018If I just stay still like this\u2026\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan\u2019s thoughts were very devious. \u00a0He imagined staying in place and doing nothing. \u00a0</p><br/><p>It was bad manners, but it wasn\u2019t illegal or against the rules to pick up their loot. It was up to the an individual if one wanted to take the dead\u2019s possession. \u00a0Moreover, there were going to be 10 users on the cusp of level 100 dead in the near future. \u00a0The items dropped would be no worse than level 80. \u00a0If a rare item came out, he would easily be able to sell it for over 1000 gold for each one of them. He had the chance to pick up money that was equivalent to a one month salary of the department head at a large company. \u00a0Would anyone turn such an opportunity down?</p><br/><p>If these users had caused even a little bit of hardship for Hyrkan, he would have waited for their death in comfort, while listening to music.</p><br/><p>\u2018That doesn\u2019t sit right with me.\u2019</p><br/><p>However, the current situation was a bit different.</p><br/><p>First of all, the users over there had never harmed Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure.\u2019</p><br/><p>The group of monsters facing them was definitely the group pointed out by the Maeung.</p><br/><p>\u2018These were the troops of Corrupt Monsters that the Immoral Prince had wanted to create.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan was pretty familiar with these troops.</p><br/><p>Warlord users had fought a historically large scaled battle with the Corrupt Army controlled by the Immoral prince. \u00a0Hyrkan didn\u2019t play a main role in this battle, but he had fought with the Hahoe Mask Guild. \u00a0He had fought against numerous smallfrys like them.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan agonized over what he should do.</p><br/><p>\u2018I have to catch that one.\u2019</p><br/><p>The thing he was sure about was the fact that the ogre with the helm had made an appearance. \u00a0If he didn\u2019t catch it now, there would be no next time. When those users fall today, the news about the Helm Ogre would spread.</p><br/><p>Even the users here probably new about the Main Scenario Quest in progress, and they probably knew about the special characteristic. The moment they catch sight of the Helm Ogre\u2019s eyes, they will recall the story about the Corrupter\u2019s Power. \u00a0They will immediately realize that this was a clue for the new Main Scenario Quest.</p><br/><p>If this truth was spread, the 30 Great Guilds would move.</p><br/><p>If he wanted to act, this would be his only chance. \u00a0Moreover,the ten users over there in danger weren\u2019t weak. \u00a0They were all users at the cusp of becoming level 100. \u00a0They were plenty strong, and their desire to stay alive was stronger than anyone else right now. \u00a0If they could live, they would probably be willing to accept anything.</p><br/><p>In the end, these were people, who knew manners, and they had a sense of romanticism.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I join the fight\u2026 I\u2019ll be able to capture it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan took off his hood. \u00a0The darkness disappeared, and his face with the Hahoe Mask equipped was revealed. \u00a0The power of the Shadow Hunting dog receded. \u00a0His feet became heavier, and his presence strengthened. \u00a0</p><br/><p>\u2018Still, they are users, who possess romanticism. Anyone could tell this would be a very hard task, yet they are helping their Community.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan smiled beneath his Hahoe Mask.</p><br/><p>\u2018They are users with such upright characters. \u00a0I\u2019m sure they won\u2019t greet me with empty arms when I save them from the brink of death?\u2019</p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

(1)</span></p><br/><p>1.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone was waiting for this movie. \u00a0The release date hadn't been set, yet it was suddenly out on the market. \u00a0It was analogous to a person receiving a present from one's significant other at \u00a0one's surprise party.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the kinds of feeling evoked when the Hahoe Mask's paid film called 'The Frozen Kingdom' was released.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The film was unprecedented in many aspects.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fact that it had a running time of 153 minutes was shocking in itself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, it wasn't just footages of several monster fights, and the Boss Monster Raid. \u00a0There was a single overarching plotline from start to finish. \u00a0It was edited like a movie, and it attempted things that had never been tried before in the market of Warlord. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was unprecedented.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was also priced at 9 dollars. \u00a0Normal paid videos sold for an average of 1.6 dollar. \u00a0It was an unprecedented price where it was almost 6 times the average price.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The most unprecedented part was the fact that the video had sold a million copies on the day of its release.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a string of unprecedented results, and eventually, it drew out a public response that was worthy of such unprecedented events.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Wow! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I can't believe footage from Warlord could be use to make such a video. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- This isn't a simple video. \u00a0It's a movie! \u00a0\u00a0A movie!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- How much would a movie of this scale cost using CG in Hollywood?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- This movie could be shown at the theaters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- It is better than most movies that are coming out right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The praise from the audiences had started in earnest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Frozen Kingdom. \u00a0It is a making of an art piece instead of a product.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hahoe Mask. \u00a0His competition next year isn't the 30 great guilds. \u00a0Instead, it'll be against other Oscar nominees.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[For those who dream about being in a movie in the future, this film is like a bible to follow.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the press was also full of praise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The world was sending praise towards the Hahoe Mask, and the interest didn't end just there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A rush of love calls started.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Various media companies has sent love calls to the Hahoe Mask of 'The Frozen Kingdom'!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It is quickly being considered for an Oscar. \u00a0Will this open the door to the era of Virtual Reality?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahoe Mask's movie was submitted into famous movie festivals, and a community within the movie industry argued for the formation of a new category. \u00a0Some officials within the movie festivals argued for a VR movie award. \u00a0Then there were the movie production companies and distributing agencies in Hollywood, who boasted a long and storied heritage, that wanted to distribute Hahoe Mask's movie. \u00a0A variety of offers to sponsor and work with the Hahoe Mask was made.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahoe Mask's unprecedented movie had simply moved past the world called Warlord, and it was influencing various field of business in the real world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the unprecedented move was a shock to some people. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask's biggest rivals were the 30 great guilds, and they were so shocked that it made everything in front of their eyes turn white.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This doesn't make any sense.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chev watched the 153 minute movie in a subdued manner. \u00a0He was agonizing over his thoughts instead of marveling at the movie.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018No matter how I think about it, this doesn't make any sense.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At first, he was in awe. \u00a0He hadn't been mesmerized by the Hahoe Mask's excellent battle skill. \u00a0There was a story here. \u00a0It wasn't just a hunt. \u00a0There was a reason behind why he caught the monsters, and the Hahoe Mask\u2019s actions all foreshadowed the battle with the Frost Knight. \u00a0The storyline culminated like a flower blooming at the Frost Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018How did he think of such.... \u00a0No, this isn't just about coming up with an idea to do this. \u00a0How was he able to attempt it in such a manner? \u00a0How did he know his Quest would progress like that?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask was an adversary of the 30 great guilds. \u00a0He hadn\u2019t hesitated in declaring a guild war on the Big Smile guild, but no one had taken it too seriously. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask never backed down against the 30 great guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask boasted the ability to produce high quality paid videoes, and he was bringing in a significant amount of income. \u00a0However, the 30 great guilds had the live channels. \u00a0Basically, they were in a different market from what the Hahoe Mask did.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask always showed surprising result, but it had always been within expected standards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this time the Hahoe Mask had exceeded the standard. \u00a0Chev had thought the 30 great guilds were running next to the Hahoe Mask as competitors. \u00a0Chev had thought the Hahoe Mask was just slightly in front of them in the race. \u00a0However, it seemed the Hahoe Mask had been running to launch himself into the air for flight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask was an irregularity, and he always messed up the status quo. \u00a0Now the 30 great guilds would have to react to the new standard set by the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Do we have to follow after the Hahoe Mask's footsteps? \u00a0Or should we battle him with some other exclusive contents? \u00a0Will we have to go out and scout movie professionals? \u00a0How much of our budget would we have to allocate in such a venture? \u00a0How long will it take for the project to deliver results? \u00a0In Warlord, it is critical to swiftly put out new contents. \u00a0Will we be able to make a movie in such a short amount of time?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chev was bombarded with worry upon worry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, at the same time, all the officers of the 30 great guilds were going through a similar thought process as Chev.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the first one to come up with an answer was the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don't care how much we spend. \u00a0There is a subsidiary company that received investment from us. \u00a0I want you to recruit movie professionals from that company.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAfter gathering the individuals, I want them to immediately using the footages we have as the groundwork. \u00a0I want them to start producing short movies that lasts around 30 minutes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want to you to make sure that we have a new movie ready to be broadcasted every Friday at 9 PM. \u00a0We have to have our first airing next Friday no matter what.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf there is a problem in production, I don't want you to dick around. \u00a0I want you to contact me directly.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMoreover, I want you to contact the Hahoe Mask through his Youtube page. \u00a0Tell him our side wants to be in charge of distributing his movie. \u00a0Tell him we will give him the full treatment.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? \u00a0Wouldn't he just ignore it?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJust do it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-sulyun couldn't even finish the Hahoe Mask's video. She moved immediately after 10 minutes into the movie.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She spoke to the members of the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEvery member that is above level 180 will cross the Urugal mountain range.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- What? \u00a0If it is above level 180, we have around 300 members. \u00a0You want all of them to cross the Urugal great mountain range?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The current power structure was crumbling right now, and if they wanted to survive, it was important for them to be aggressive. \u00a0As a guild master of a 30 great guild, she knew this better than anyone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- If I say there's a problem, what will happen to me?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll can you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- After much thought, I have no problems with the plan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had the power to cause change in the Stormhunters with a single word.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then there were those that didn't merely react to the unprecedented event. \u00a0There were those that insisted on resisting against it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It is war now.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Sinclair saw the Hahoe Mask's video, he knew they couldn't coexist in Warlord. \u00a0This hunch became reality in an instant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[We have to eliminate the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0He is our top priority. \u00a0If you find his tracks, use every method and scheme to eliminate him.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A new era truly dawned on Warlord.</span></p><br/><p>2.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Black Hound.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was similar to the one that appeared at the entrance to the Urugual mountain range. \u00a0It was one of the most difficult mid-sized monster amongst similar level monsters. \u00a0It was especially problematic that it was programmed to attack the Priests first. \u00a0This was why it had the nickname of Priest Hunter, and it caused a lot of headache for the Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, in an online game world, nothing was superior to level!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kuh-hung, kuh-hung! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the same for the Black Hound. \u00a0It could only let out a pitiful cry in front of the level difference. \u00a0It was merely a pathetic dog.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kuh-hung! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Its front right leg and left hind leg were severed. \u00a0Its entire body was covered in wounds, and a large amount of ice was forming on the wound. \u00a0The Black Hound was beyond looking pitiful. \u00a0It looked to be in a brutal state.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The more devastating fact was that the enemy that had put it in such a state was still in front of the Black Hound.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a Knight instead of a Skeleton Warrior.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, it wasn't just a simple Skeleton Knight. \u00a0It was equipped with the Great Battle Hero's Sword, which was one of the strongest weapons in Warlord. \u00a0It also wore a level 190 Unique defensive set called Blood Ogre set. \u00a0At its peak value, this set was sold for 20 thousand gold. \u00a0The Skeleton Knight was equipped with such strong Items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, it was letting out a bluish cold energy thanks to the Ancient Power of Frost. \u00a0Then there was the passive ability of the Blood Ogre set that decreased the enemy's Stats by 15%.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Knight taking down the Black Hound was akin to killing a chicken with an electric saw.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No human in this world would use an electric saw to slaughter a chicken.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I made a very firm pledge that I'll hunt down every single of you bastards.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was retribution.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the distant past, he had travelled the Urugal mountain range to visit the Blacksmith Olf. \u00a0He had been humiliated by the Black Hound during this trip. \u00a0At the time, his heart was filled with frustration and a desire for revenge. \u00a0Hyrkan was burning away this desire at that moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he wasn't at the Urugal mountain range just to fulfill his pledge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan raised his head to look at the summit that was veiled by fog. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I can't believe it took me over two weeks to get here.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A lot of things had happened as he was coming here. \u00a0It wasn't just the volume. \u00a0It was also the magnitude the events.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The production process of the Frozen Kingdom he released yesterday hadn't been easy. \u00a0He had to put it out as fast as possible. \u00a0When he tried to accelerate the production process, naturally the cost skyrocketed. \u00a0He invested almost twice the production cost he had initially estimated. \u00a0The cost was being discussed in terms of hundred thousand dollars.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Aside from his movie, Hyrkan had a lot of things to do. \u00a0He had to sell the Items he had earned in the Frozen Kingdom, and he also had to sell the Items that weren't needed by his Skeleton underlings. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he had to purchase new Items. \u00a0All the Items he purchased weren't cheap, and a significant amount of money were exchanged in the deals. \u00a0He had to focus on the details of deal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the real world, he was busy meeting his lawyer, accountant and solicitors. \u00a0He had to take numerous consultations and measures in regards to his taxes. \u00a0He had been lax with his taxes, since he was busy with the game. \u00a0However, the amount of money he was earning and spending was too large now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then there was that one incident when he purchased the 6S Model V-Gear. \u00a0He paid an enormous amount of money to buy it, but there was a problem during the test phase. \u00a0There was a range of preexistent setting, but none of them was suitable for Hyrkan. \u00a0He was non-standard, so they had to program a new setting for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While this was all going on, he continued on the 2nd Advancement Quest. \u00a0The 2nd Advancement Quest wasn't easy. \u00a0It was annoying in the fact that he had to travel all over to meet the NPCs scattered all around the large continent. \u00a0The ingredients from the monsters were scattered too. \u00a0It was almost as if he was making pilgrimages to various locations in Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he had to focus on leveling up as he was doing all of this. \u00a0There were a lot of Users that picked a fight with him, and he had to deal with all of them. \u00a0He also got into a small war with a guild with a significant number of members. \u00a0He was targeted more than any other User in Warlord. \u00a0He was worth as much as a Boss Monster, so everyone in Warlord was his enemy now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a mouthful to explain everything. \u00a0He had to digest his busy schedule, and the fact that he was here was a miracle in itself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had taken him a long time to come here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, the fact that it took him a long time meant that he was finished with his preparation. \u00a0He had organized everything around him, so he could focus on his game for awhile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Frozen Kingdom movie wasn't just something that had made a lot of money. \u00a0It was an iconic piece that had a huge effect on Warlord and the VR market. \u00a0Hyrkan had taken the nickname of Rich Lich from Subrata Duta. \u00a0Unlike the original Rich Lich, he didn't have 5 million dollars to wield as a weapon. \u00a0However, he was now able to buy most Item sets he wanted in a lump sum payment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had finished his 2nd Advancement. \u00a0His Class as Necromancer had advanced to Lich, and he had gained the new Skills he had been waiting for.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He also bought the expensive consumable Items. \u00a0Instead of looking at the price, he bought the most effective consumables.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Above all, he had finished solidifying his resolve.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan no longer stared at the summit of the Urugal mountain range. \u00a0He looked beyond it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Let's do this.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn't matter what was across the Urugal mountain range. \u00a0From now on, the obstacles won't be things he already knew about. \u00a0New and surprising contents would unfold in front of him!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan didn't plan on being taken aback by it. \u00a0He had no thoughts of hesitating or backing down from the new challenge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if he was broken into pieces from encountering a wall, he planned on running into it with full force.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, his opponent was the Urugal mountain range, and he was at the midway point. \u00a0He met the gatekeeper that guarded the waist of the mountain. \u00a0It was the Skull Collector.</span></p><br/><p>3.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the Hahoe Mask had opened the era of the Northland exploration, the Stormhunters guild opened the era of climbing the Urugal mountain range.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was hard to open the door to both these locations. \u00a0If one hadn't made thorough preparation for these two places, these locations were ruthless in separating the users. \u00a0It quickly and ruthlessly sorted out the prepared and the unprepared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one wanted to reach the Frozen Kingdom from the Northland, one had to cross the frozen land. \u00a0This stretch of land judged the Users. \u00a0In the Urugal mountain range, the foggy mid-slope of the mountain held a single tunnel that all Users had to pass. \u00a0There was a judge dispatched at this location to sort out the Users. \u00a0It was the Skull Collector 'Voodook'.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Voodook was an expression used by the Elven race of Warlord. \u00a0The word signified a warrior that used the Vodoo arts. \u00a0At the end of the Voodook's tunnel, there was a middle boss monster named the Skull Collector.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was level 200! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were various skull of monsters hung around its neck, and it used the skulls to summon guardians that would defend the path. \u00a0Alongside the summons, it used Voodoo skill on its enemies. \u00a0It was a snake-headed giant that boasted enormous power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if one gave this explanation, most Users wouldn't be able to understand the overwhelming presence of this monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monster was very strong, and it was very troublesome to face. \u00a0Moreover, the guardians under the control of the Skull Collector was frightening. \u00a0In terms of its offensive capability, it was currently one of the top monsters in Warlord. \u00a0It was something that couldn't be described unless one had faced it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why a simple explanation was devised to describe the Skull Collector.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahoe Mask-like bastard.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow will we catch that Hahoe Mask-like bastard?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0That Hahoe Mask-like bastard is driving me nuts.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahoe Mask-like Bastard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, this was the Skull Collector's nickname. \u00a0It had strong offensive capability like the Hahoe Mask, and it commanded summoned familiars like the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0Moreover, this monster was aggressive in participating in battle to show off its powerful offensive capability like the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0This was why this nickname was attributed to this monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of it all, there were other factors that made this monster troublesome.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a monster that appeared in an Instant Dungeon, and an Instant Dungeon only allowed 7 members to enter. \u00a0Moreover, once a party enters, one needed to wait 7 minutes before the next group can go in. It was a Dungeon that had a significant wait time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an instant Dungeon, and there weren\u2019t any towns or castles near the Urugal mountain range. \u00a0When one suffered a Game Over, one had to start over at a faraway location. \u00a0This was why many considered it to be annoying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was called the alleyway to meet the Skull Collector, and there were a lot of challengers lining in front of the Voodook\u2019s tunnel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He appeared at this location.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Mercy guild failed? \u00a0This isn't something to take lightly. \u00a0I don\u2019t think any more clear methods will be released.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, \u00a0Hey.\u201d \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow many days have we wasted here because of the Hahoe Mask-like bastard? \u00a0This is driving me nuts.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBe quiet.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI said shut up.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Hahoe Mask is here!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat's right. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask-like bastard is....

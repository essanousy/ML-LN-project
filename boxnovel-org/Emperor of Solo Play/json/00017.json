To kill this weak monster, he toiled for ten whole minutes.</p><br/><p>When this player raised his sword to deliver the final blow, someone slammed him with his shoulder. The player fell on the ground, and the one that pushed him cut off the slime dog\u2019s head with a slash.</p><br/><p>The player watched this happen from the ground.</p><br/><p>The one who pushed him down, a player named Haybola, smiled at the player on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>It clearly wasn\u2019t an apology. He had clearly ran into him on purpose.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The player that had been pushed down jumped up from the ground and shouted. If this was reality, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to call the police.</p><br/><p>But this wasn\u2019t reality. It was a VR game world. There was no law nor police. There was only the fist.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What did you just say?\u201d</p><br/><p>At the shouting player, Haybola\u2019s expression immediately changed. He put up an intimidating face and glared at the player.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Haybola\u2019s friends, the remaining two members of the Ralph Family, stealthily appeared.</p><br/><p>3 vs 1.</p><br/><p>It was enough to calm someone who had anger management issues.</p><br/><p>Haybola sneered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI made a little mistake and apologized, but this bastard here suddenly yells and curses at me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Who dares to curse the Ralph Family\u2019s leader?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMistakes happen in games. Who gets mad over that? What a fucktard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Haybola hit the shoulder of the stiff player, and the player faltered back.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay that again. I dare you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Haybola hit the player\u2019s shoulder a couple more times, and the player continued to step backwards. Haybola followed and stepped forward.</p><br/><p>Watching this scene, the other two laughed heinously. It went without saying that they had planned this out, and were now in the middle of enjoying it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Haybola\u2019s acting skills are getting better every day.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018We can probably pull some good views from filming these now.\u2019</p><br/><p>For the victim, the situation could only be infuriating. It didn\u2019t take a genius to understand what was happening or what the aggressors wanted.</p><br/><p>In the real world, most people would bear with it, but it was a different story in the game world. It was very rare for people to be patient even in games.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t stop now, I won\u2019t stand for it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Ralph Family\u2019s target this time was one of the less patient ones. Even though he continued to step backwards, he wasn\u2019t intimidated. In the end, he erupted while looking at Haybola through his strange mask.</p><br/><p>\u201cPuhaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Watching their victim burst out in anger, the Ralph Family laughed wholeheartedly. It was as if they were watching a comedy show. The two listening from the back were cracking up, while Haybola barely held it in and smacked the cheek of their victim.</p><br/><p>\u201cWon\u2019t stand for it? What are you going to do, eh? Tell me!\u201d</p><br/><p>From their repeated provocations, the lone player was clearly pissed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you continue, I\u2019ll have no choice but to fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFight? Did you just say \u2018fight\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>With Haybola yelling loud enough for his friends to hear, the two behind him were ready to pass out from laughing too hard.</p><br/><p>\u2018I swear.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s been a while since we baited someone so fun.\u2019</p><br/><p>To them, the victim\u2019s angry reaction was akin to the feeling of a fish biting down on the bait. It was fun catching the fish, but the real fun came from the fish resisting and trying to get away.</p><br/><p>Haybola was also excited to screw over their tasty find. In fact, he found it increasingly hard to hold himself in check. His whole body was itching to have a go.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then! Let\u2019s fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>So he accepted.</p><br/><p>No, he wasn\u2019t accepting a fight. What he would be doing was a one-sided violence, akin to killing ants. It was his opponent that would be struggling desperately.</p><br/><p>Then, as soon as Haybola accepted his victim\u2019s declaration of war.</p><br/><p>Stab!</p><br/><p>A knife pierced through his right eye.</p><br/><p>\u2018Huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>Haybola didn\u2019t understand what just happened. He couldn\u2019t even recognize the knife tip entering his field of vision. That was how quick it happened.</p><br/><p>Of course, as a result, vision disappeared from Haybola\u2019s right eye.</p><br/><p>Immediately afterwards\u2026</p><br/><p>Stab!</p><br/><p>The knife that pierced Haybola\u2019s right eye pierced his left eye as well. The bright world in Haybola\u2019s eyes quickly turned completely dark.</p><br/><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><br/><p>Even now, Haybola was unable to understand what had happened to him.</p><br/><p>This was his first time getting the blind penalty. It was very rare for players to have both their eyes attacked.</p><br/><p>Warlord players would specialized in PvPs and PKs had to be knowledgeable about the blind penalty. It was the very basic to avoid having their eyes attacked. It was more important than even the heart or the head. In the first place, players didn\u2019t instantly die unless their heads were chopped off. Even if their eyes were taken away, it was important to not panic.</p><br/><p>But what if you did?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then the meaning of levels disappeared.</p><br/><p>While Haybola was panicking, the Ralph Family\u2019s prey, Hyrkan, pushed Haybola\u2019s head with his left hand. As his head tilted back, his neck was open.</p><br/><p>Stab!</p><br/><p>Hyrkan immediately stabbed into his neck.</p><br/><p>And it wasn\u2019t just once.</p><br/><p>Stab stab!</p><br/><p>He stabbed into it without rest. As if he was a sewing machine, his hand moved at an frightening pace.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just stabbing either. He was making a dotted line. He was clearly trying to make it easy to rip off his neck. The knife which began in Haybola\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple quickly moved to the back of his neck. In an instant, over six knife cuts were made.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Haybola let out a scream.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t because of pain. What pain he could feel would only be that of someone harshly poking his neck.</p><br/><p>The problem was the circumstance. His vision had suddenly turned dark, then something sharp began stabbing into his neck. Who would be used to something like this? How many would even have experience with something like this?</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t surprising for him to have panicked.</p><br/><p>Haybola tried to struggle by flailing his arms around, but as if he had already predicted it, Hyrkan moved behind Haybola and continued stabbing at his neck.</p><br/><p>Stab stab. This eerie noise continued to sound out like the ticking of a clock.</p><br/><p>All this happened within a single breath of time.</p><br/><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>There was no way for Haybola\u2019s two friends to respond in time.</p><br/><p>Just a moment ago, the two of them were on the verge of passing out from laughter. But now, they were completely in a daze as they stood witless.</p><br/><p>In a brief moment, one of the two, who had some battle experience as a swordsman, snapped out of his daze.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaybola!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he yelled out his comrade\u2019s name, the priest next to him snapped out of it as well. The swordsman player immediately pulled out his sword.</p><br/><p>Chwing!</p><br/><p>It was not the default item from the Subjugation Association, but one that he had purchased from the money he had saved up by PKing. Although the sword gave off a frightening aura, the swordsman only stood his ground.</p><br/><p>Save his comrade? How? How could he save his comrade who was already held by his back?</p><br/><p>Thoughts like these filled his mind.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, having heard the swordsman pull out his sword and with his knife still in Haybola\u2019s neck, Hyrkan put his hands in his pocket and quickly threw Skeleton Warrior fragments towards Haybola\u2019s comrades.</p><br/><p>The Skeleton Warrior quickly revealed its splendor.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA skeleton?\u201d</p><br/><p>With the sudden appearance of the Skeleton Warrior, their overloaded minds finally exploded.</p><br/><p>\u2018He wasn\u2019t a swordsman?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018A necromancer?\u2019</p><br/><p>They had thought he was a swordsman. They had no choice but to. If someone fighting with a slime dog for 10 minutes with his sword wasn\u2019t a swordsman, then what class would he be?</p><br/><p>But a skeleton warrior appeared. It wasn\u2019t an ordinary skeleton warrior either, but one made using a blue werewolf as the material. His skull was clearly that of a wolf\u2019s, and since there was no skin on a skeleton, its protruding mouth and fangs invoked fear from anyone watching.</p><br/><p>Plus, Warlord players encountered undead type monsters around level 30. For difficulty\u2019s sake, players only dealt with easy monsters like slimes until level 20. It was a result of Warlord\u2019s overflowing generosity.</p><br/><p>As the two of them would never have experienced undead monsters, they had no choice but to panic.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Haybola was also in panic as he wasn\u2019t getting any help from his comrades. Listening to the sound of their flustered breathing in a completely dark world, Haybola was ready to go crazy.</p><br/><p>Stab stab!</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Hyrkan continued to stab at Haybola\u2019s neck. It almost began to sound like an instrument. While continuing his work, Hyrkan turned his body. Haybola\u2019s body turned along with Hyrkan, and they were now facing the two comrades of Haybola.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is self-defense. I didn\u2019t want to do this. I am not at fault.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t something someone doing such a frightening thing would say. It was like he was some sort of a psychopath.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Hyrkan whispered into Haybola\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no faults. You agree, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Haybola shuddered. At the same time, he was infuriated. As a result, he finally opened his tightly shut mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Hyrkan\u2019s sword penetrated Haybola\u2019s mouth. Haybola felt like he was biting down on a towel, but his chest felt like blowing up from the fact that he couldn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>This was all Haybola could feel. However, his two comrades watching from the side were completely frozen from this torture.</p><br/><p>\u2018W-What do we do?\u2019</p><br/><p>Although they were thinking the same thing, that was it. They could only worry in their mind.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan noted their reactions from across his hahoe mask.</p><br/><p>\u2018Early 20s or late 10s.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan had long ago noticed them targeting him.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t anything hard. Mt. Bima wasn\u2019t a popular hiking place. It didn\u2019t have a hiking trail in the first place. As such, the pathway was wherever people were walking. But someone was following him. If he stopped, they stopped. They didn\u2019t try to strike up a conversation with him either.</p><br/><p>It was blatantly obvious what their goal was. There was no way Hyrkan wouldn\u2019t have noticed, as he had many experiences with such situations.</p><br/><p>So he had long ago formed a plan to screw them over. He would hide his identity as a necromancer and act as if he was having a hard time killing a slime dog. Stepping backwards and making distance between Haybola and his friends, and letting their guard down by looking weak was all part of Hyrkan\u2019s plan.</p><br/><p>And such a plan was necessary.</p><br/><p>He was against 3 people, all who were higher level than him. Just Haybola\u2019s strength stat should be several times that of Hyrkan\u2019s. It was simply impossible to overwhelm them with power. If Haybola regained his cool and tried to shake off Hyrkan, he would have long disappeared from Hyrkan\u2019s grasp.</p><br/><p>To prevent such a thing from happening, Hyrkan showed absolute cruelty. Stabbing both of his eyes from the start, constantly focusing on his neck, and baiting him to talk then penetrating it with his sword, these were all part of Hyrkan\u2019s plan to cause him to panic.</p><br/><p>A skilled, experienced player would have responded to Hyrkan\u2019s aims.</p><br/><p>\u2018The lowest of the low.\u2019</p><br/><p>In other words, the Ralph Family, according to Hyrkan\u2019s standards, was the lowest of the low.</p><br/><p>At the same time, this served as proof. Proof that they didn\u2019t receive proper education from a guild!</p><br/><p>And that meant one thing.</p><br/><p>\u2018No need to worry about payback.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was no problem with Hyrkan completely plundering these guys.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan smiled.</p><br/><p>\u2018Thanks for the meal.\u2019</p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

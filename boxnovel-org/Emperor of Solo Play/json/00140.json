It was always prepared for battle. \u00a0Bagel was in its office, yet it was in its armor. \u00a0This was why one couldn't see the wound beneath the armor. \u00a0It still possessed the evidence of betrayal perpetrated by Prince Dean and the White-eyed swordsman Argardo. \u00a0It still had the sword wound.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bagel was lucky to be alive. \u00a0The wound was so severe that it was shocking that Bagel was still carrying out his duties, while equipped in its armor. \u00a0This was why Bagel didn't complain about its slow recovery.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm fine. \u00a0I'm all right.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he heard the moan, the guest got up from his seat to approach Bagel. \u00a0Bagel waved him away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm just thankful that I am alive. \u00a0I don't want to burden a hero like you, because of this.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guest put on an awkward smile, and he sat back down. Bagel moved to the corner of its office where its books were organized. \u00a0It immediately pulled out a book.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is something I acquired a long time ago.\" \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From its outward appearance, the book was thick. \u00a0However, the book wasn't filled with many pages. \u00a0The reason being the thickness of each page. \u00a0The book was filled with woodblocks. \u00a0Bagel took out the book, and it carefully looked over the engravings on the pages. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis was before I became the captain in charge of the Terube wall. \u00a0This was even before I followed him when he became the Guardian of the Northern lands.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The woodblocks were filled with engravings of a map. \u00a0Bagel took the book, and he sat atop of his desk. In the process, his heavy armor moved, and it seemed the wound had been disturbed again. \u00a0Bagel's expression crumpled, but it didn't moan this time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Bagel's pained face resolved itself, it took out the woodblocks contained in the book. \u00a0It started piecing them together as if they were pieces of a puzzle. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Hyrkan had surmised, the woodblocks were a map.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is the map of the Northern land. \u00a0This was before this era where the endless battle hadn't started yet.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His explanation was grandiose, but the content of the map was quite poor. \u00a0Most of the map was drawn in an abstract manner. \u00a0There was a long road, and there were monsters that were letting out flame next to the road. \u00a0The mountain was drawn like a big lump of cotton. The trees inside the forest was drawn like doodles, and there were no markers naming everything. \u00a0Moreover, the map was incomplete. \u00a0The top part of the map was missing. \u00a0It was as if the map's head had been cut away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is a relic from a long time ago, so it isn't perfect.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bagel tapped on top of of the table as he tapped at the empty portion of the map.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn the end, I never found out what is here. \u00a0Moreover, there is no one alive that knows this information either.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guest, who had listened to it in silence, finally asked some questions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What do you think is over there? \u00a0Do you perhaps know any other information regarding the place?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Bagel had heard all the information available, so it let out a long sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have my hand full from defending the Terube castle wall. \u00a0At times, I tasked a subordinate to investigate what was on the other side of the castle wall. \u00a0However, they just came back with warnings of overwhelming number of monsters, or they went missing. \u00a0If I wanted a thorough investigation, I would have to lead forth a large army. \u00a0I couldn't send a large army across the thick castle wall, and through the mysterious barrier to explore the Northern land. This is especially true, since I'll be doing it just to satisfy my curiosity.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guest said couple more words to Bagel. \u00a0Bagel gathered boths its hand, so it could prop its chin on top. \u00a0It spoke in that position.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. It is as you said. \u00a0The power of Corruption may be... \u00a0That upright person might have a clue about the power of Corruption. \u00a0This is why I was curious about what was there in the past. \u00a0However, I felt I had a duty to find out what was there. \u00a0However!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That word was filled with heavy implication. \u00a0The guest was about to ask a question, but he swallowed the question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo one was allowed to explore this place.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bagel immediately put on a big frown. \u00a0It wasn't caused by his wound.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere are already movements set in motion. \u00a0A large-scale change is coming. \u00a0For now, no one will be able to assume the power of the Northern land. \u00a0In such a situation, no rewards will be given. \u00a0There will be a ban placed on the Northern land. \u00a0The Hiban kingdom, and even the Subjugation Association won't lend a hand. \u00a0This is a search conducted to find the unknown, and there will be no prize awarded. \u00a0The only way you will be able to receive a reward is to bring back \u00a0result.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bagel maintained its expression, and it immediately asked him a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you still want to go to the other side of the castle wall?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of answering, the guest nodded his head. \u00a0Bagel immediately got up from its seat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Afterwards, Bagel worked with practiced ease. \u00a0It painted ink over the woodblocks, and Bagel placed a white parchment over it. \u00a0The very rough map was handed over to the guest. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBe safe.\u201d \u00a0</span></p><br/><p>2.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBe safe.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Quest 'Across the Terube Castle Wall' has started.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Bagel said those words, Hrykan heard the Quest Announcement. \u00a0Hyrkan's expression was twitching right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was forcefully trying to hide his expression. \u00a0It seemed he wasn't trying to hide a favorable expression. \u00a0It was quite evident that he was trying to hide a negative emotion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had a reason for it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is the word I told those before you, who are willingly throw one\u2019s body forward into danger for the peace of the world. \u00a0I will also say those same words to you. \u00a0Be safe, and I hope you bring hope like before.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Someone had arrived before him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Some bastard came here before me?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one wanted to go to the Frozen Kingdom, this place was the door everyone had to pass through. \u00a0When Hyrkan arrived at the Terube castle, he was greeted fondly by Bagel. \u00a0Hyrkan was the Hiban kingdom's hero, and he was the Arbiter of Corruption. \u00a0Moreover, Hyrkan had defeated Argardo, who scored a deep wound on Bagel. \u00a0Hyrkan was Bagel's savior and hero.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was to be expected. \u00a0Bagel had been a bit prickly in the past, but it wasn't like that at all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of it all, Hyrkan felt uncomfortable when he saw what kind of expression Bagel had on when it looked at Hyrkan. \u00a0It was as if a young junior was looking at a cool senior with longing and expectation mixed within its gaze. \u00a0Moreover, the gaze was coming from a pretty boy, and Hyrkan had never received such a gaze from anyone before. \u00a0From Hyrkan's perspective, it was beyond uncomfortable. \u00a0It was close to unsettling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how the conversation had started, and Hyrkan's inside started to feel a wrenching sensation as the conversation continued along.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the conversation came to an end, Hyrkan's inside had moved on from feeling a wrenching feeling. \u00a0His inside were in a knot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I don't know who, but that bastard cost me one Title.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Someone had already met Bagel, and this someone was already headed towards the Frozen Kingdom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This fact in itself didn't put him in a good mood. \u00a0No one would welcome the appearance of a competitor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Noble Walk Title.... \u00a0It increases one's Stamina by 50 points, yet I lost it to someone else. \u00a0Before I did my other tasks, I should have come here to get the Quest and Title beforehand. \u00a0Shit!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From Hyrkan's perspective, the preceding visitor had stolen a Title that was rightfully his.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018In the end, I was only able to earn the Noble Explorer.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Title \u2018Noble Explorer\u2019 was something one earned when one gained the incredibly important Exploration Quest. \u00a0It increased one's Intelligence by 25 points.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan felt wistful at losing the Title 'Noble Steps.' </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a Title given to the first one to receive the Quest and the Noble Explorer Title. \u00a0It increased one's Stamina by 50 Points. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had lost a Title that would have raised his Stamina by 50 Points. This wasn't something he could simply get over by feeling sorry for himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Which organization was it?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His insides were hurting so much that it felt as if his insides were rotting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, his pain shrivelled away when a thought that made a chill run up his spine popped up inside his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Was it perhaps the Stormhunters?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One couldn't go across the Terube Castle just because one wanted to.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First, one needed a prior relationship with Bagel. \u00a0At the same time, one needed to have done a lot of jobs related to the Subjugation Association. \u00a0If one did a lot of work related to the Subjugation Association, it meant one probably had to catch a hideous amount of monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At this point in the game, the only ones that had the qualifications to start the Frozen Kingdom Quest was the highest Ranked Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the Stormhunters sufficiently met this criteria. \u00a0Before he returned to the past, the Frozen Kingdom had been monopolized by the Storm Hunters. \u00a0This was why Hyrkan was well informed about the Titles. \u00a0The Stormhunters monopolized the Frozen Kingdom, and they revealed the Titles, Skill Books and Items that were obtained there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, he didn't discount the idea that maybe some Items were fated to be in the hands of certain individual. \u00a0He couldn't discount the fact that this was meant to be. \u00a0At this point in the game, it was quite possible that the Stormhunters were progressing in the Frozen Kingdom Quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, this version of the Stormhunters guild was much stronger than the one that had attempted the Frozen Kingdom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is driving me nuts.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnderstood.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While he was deep within thoughts, Hyrkan was trying to wrap up the conversation, so he spoke the words that would basically put an end to their exchange.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since he put an end to the conversation, he was about to get up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you planning on heading there immediately?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bagel suddenly grabbed Hyrkan. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt will be a dangerous road. \u00a0I was thinking maybe you should make a little bit more preparation.... \u00a0I readied something that'll help you in your exploration.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan put on an awkward smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Bagel hadn't been such a character before... \u00a0Things are turning a bit weird now that our Affinity is high.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan had no choice, but to sit back down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Well, I did kill someone, who had tried to kill him. He wouldn't send me into a deadly situation without giving me anything. \u00a0Absolutely.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since it said it will give him something, he wasn't going to turn it down. \u00a0Moreover, Hyrkan had spent much more than he had planned on his recent purchases.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Give me a Skill Book. \u00a0Please.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he gained the [Chivalry] skill, he once again purchased No Name Skill Books to gain the [Leader] Skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the result was a complete loss.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he thought about that, Hyrkan eventually frowned. \u00a0He had tossed money into the air. \u00a0Of course, he wouldn't feel good about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWait a moment.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Bagel didn't know Hyrkan's true feelings. \u00a0It vacated its seat to get the present for Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he was alone, Hyrkan once again agonized over his thoughts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018For reals. \u00a0Who was it?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He kept worrying over it... \u00a0He was worried he had missed something important.</span></p><br/><p>3.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Natal had his Hologram Window in front of him, and he was looking at something. \u00a0He was looking at portraits.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sohank discreetly appeared behind him. \u00a0He had shown enough of a presence as he approached Natal. \u00a0He didn't want to surprise Natal. This was also why Natal was able to answer in a calm manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is the portraits of the Users that gained the Quest from Bagel after us.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Portrait. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In Warlord, one could film from all kinds of angle unlike in reality. \u00a0However, if the Users being filmed had turned off the facial recognition setting, there was no way one could film their faces. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why this method was developed. \u00a0A User that was adept at drawing would draw a portrait after seeing the target with his own eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In Warlord and any other virtual reality games, everything was made possible through cutting edge technology. \u00a0In such a world, the people who were good with their hands were more valuable. \u00a0It was ironic that they were more valuable in a virtual world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Sohank and Natal didn't care if it was ironic or not.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo basically the one we are chasing may be in one of these portraits.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The appearance of the Users that had a face to face meeting with Bagel was saved. \u00a0This was to gather information on their competitors beforehand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFortunately, there aren't anyone famous here.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you say we are fortunate, we are fortunate.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If there had been a famous face amongst them,there was no downside in being vigilant against the famous User. \u00a0Still, even if they were unknown Users, there was a chance they might become a big competitor. \u00a0There was no reason why they shouldn't gather information on everyone like this. \u00a0It might not matter to any other guild, but it was very important to the Hydra guild. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They knew the importance of data and information. \u00a0Their guild used both as weapons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis one looks pretty hopeless.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, not everyone was determined to be a competitor. \u00a0Sometimes, one could discount a person just by looking at his face. \u00a0One shouldn't be prejudiced when making a judgement in a game. \u00a0On the other hand, these habits were hard to break.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0Doesn't this guy look like a real pushover?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Natal wasn't also free from judging a book by its cover. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI am hesitant to make judgements based on a person's look, but even I think this guy isn't one of our competitors.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI feel the same way. Still, it could be possible, right?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is what people who purchase lottery tickets think before they purchase it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Natal smirked at Sohank's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he heard Natal's laughter, Sohank discreetly changed his expression. \u00a0He spoke in a slightly calmer voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is going to be quite an annoying mission. \u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m just here as the muscle, but the rest of eight heads \u00a0have to assess all possibilities.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIsn\u2019t that our role?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSometime I wonder if I cause harm to our guild.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he spoke those words, a bitter smile appeared on his lips. \u00a0\u00a0He was on break, but it seemed Sohand was unable to take a break. \u00a0It seemed he felt apologetic towards his comrades, who had to constantly use their intellect.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Natal immediately shot down that idea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is the case at all. \u00a0We can't do this through our heads only. \u00a0We were able to get to this point thanks to Sohank-nim.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. We are lacking with just me. \u00a0In truth, I already know how I measure up to others. If our Stats are the same, I might be able to go up against the Matador, but I know I will lose to the Storm Queen. \u00a0Then there is the Hahoe...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two of them were about to have a more frank discussion, but....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The monsters have appeared! \u00a0There are nine of them. \u00a0I don't think it'll be easy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An urgent voice was heard through the voice talk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sohank didn't finish his words before he started speaking out new directions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll be there. \u00a0Before I get there, put the Tankers at the center, and defend! \u00a0Don't attempt any rash attacks until I get there!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Yes! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before the conversation could end, a terrifying roar rang out. \u00a0Sohank and Natal moved together. \u00a0They didn't have to speak to coordinate with each other. \u00a0There was no carelessness or leisure in their movements.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This place was a location beyond the Terube castle walls. \u00a0Even the Hydra guild's best troops couldn't be careless. \u00a0This place was filled with level 200 monsters, and they were of a different quality from all the monsters they had faced before.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

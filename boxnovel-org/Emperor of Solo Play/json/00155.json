Uh-whew. \u00a0Just the thought of it gives me nightmare.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He once again thanked the stars that his Skeletons weren't an enemy he would have to face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, such sentiments didn't last long. \u00a0This wasn't some significant milestone where he should get lost in sentimental feelings. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan once again shook his head from side to side, and he shook off the unimportant feelings. \u00a0Then he immediately looked forward. \u00a0The eyes within the Hahoe Mask glazed over.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Some kind of a building was reflected in Hyrkan's eyes. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He use the expression 'some kind', because it was hard to judge the shape of the building.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First, the building was half-buried in the ground. The part that stuck out from the ground was reminiscent of an earthworm. \u00a0It was hard to discern the shape of the building, since it was covered in tree roots. \u00a0If one glanced at it, one might not even notice it was a building. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, one could feel a mystical energy coming off of it even if it was faint.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The most eye-catching part of the building was the bricks that were giving off this mystical energy. \u00a0Each brick was carved with various symbols. Instead of an engraving, it was embossed. \u00a0The shapes stood out in relief, so the shapes were quite noticeable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Is it a temple?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His admiration ended there. \u00a0The Skeleton Warrior, which had defeated the Golden Goblin, was returned to its Skeleton Fragment form. \u00a0Then he entered the building. \u00a0There was only one tunnel that lead inside. \u00a0It was so small that he had mistaken it for a window, but he was able to squeeze his body into the space.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His shoulders were hunched and his head was lowered. \u00a0He walked slowly like a turtle with his back hunched. \u00a0Hyrkan was able to stretch out his back after ten steps. \u00a0A deep darkness greeted Hyrkan when he straightened his back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A bright light formed on top of Hyrkan's head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Underneath the bright light, he re-equipped the glove he had taken off to activate the light app on his wristwatch. \u00a0Hyrkan quickly looked at his surrounding as he put on his glove.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It is a temple.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The outer appearance of the building was too damaged to confirm his suspicion, but the basic components were present. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had seen the bricks before he entered the building, and each of them were embossed with letters. Moreover, there were pictures instead of wall papers within the building. \u00a0Everything was carefully crafted to imbue symbolic significance, and this was why Hyrkan thought this place was a temple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I hope something decent comes out.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was hopeful, but Hyrkan didn't think there were any treasures here in the temple that would make his eyes turn round.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only thing he'll be able to find here would be clues.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Toohk toohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan scattered two Skeleton Fragments on the floor as he got ready to search for the clues.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Warriors quickly gained their forms, and their outer appearance was strikingly different from the standard Skeleton Warriors. \u00a0It was less than 1 meter tall and they weren't wearing armors made out of steel. \u00a0They were wearing leather armor that made them look agile. \u00a0Moreover, the weapons they held in their hand were suited for their size. \u00a0The swords were small enough to be called daggers. \u00a0If a normal User held this weapon, it would look like a knife.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, unlike their outer appearance, these Skeletons were terrifying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These particular Skeleton Warriors were made from a level 180 monsters called Mini Ogre. \u00a0Hyrkan had never summoned these Skeletons in public. \u00a0He also didn't put them in his videos.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Weapon! \u00a0This was a secret weapon that he had hidden away! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan stationed the Skeletons near the entrance, and he started his search.</span></p><br/><p>6.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn the end, this is a game.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch spoke as he looked at the remnants.... \u00a0He looked at the walls that was being propped up by pillars and something that couldn't be seen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSince it is a game, there is always a solution. \u00a0If there isn't a solution, it is a bug instead of a game.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Stormhunters guild had found a ruin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Stormhunters guild had took the most important first step in the Ruined Kingdom episode.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this was a momentous first step for the Stormhunters guild, but they didn't stop to appreciate the moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe've found the entrance! \u00a0It is an entrance to the underground!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the entrance to the underground was found, they once again moved at a desperate pace.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch immediately started giving orders. \u00a0Hatch looked at Hahui, and he pointed his finger towards the newly discovered entrance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had already formed an expedition group for such a situation. \u00a0Hahui was chosen to be the leader of the expedition group.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch's gesture meant for Hahui to get ready. \u00a0Hahui soon finished her preparations. \u00a0When she moved near the newly discovered entrance, the members of the exploration team started to gather around her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were a total of 12 Users. \u00a0Hatch spoke to Hahui in front of the team.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahui.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYeah.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a weird atmosphere that emanated from their short conversation. \u00a0The other members of the expedition team tilted their heads in confusion. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'What the hell?'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Could it be?'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were puzzled expressions on their faces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, these expressions didn't last long.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou stubbornly insisted on being the leader of the exploration team. \u00a0I want you to do your work properly now that I made you the team leader.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf there is a problem, I want you to turn back. \u00a0I don't want you to suddenly attack the enemy, because it annoys you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you trying to lecture me right now?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs isn't a lecture. \u00a0I'm giving you an advice.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The weird atmosphere disappeared in an instant. \u00a0Hahui and Hatch spoke like their normal selves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone realized that they misread the strange atmosphere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou want to die?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a phrase everyone heard the most from Hahui. \u00a0Hatch suddenly stopped speaking at this point.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Usually, Hatch gave up on the conversation at this point, and he would gloss over the conversation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was different right now. \u00a0If these were normal circumstances, he wouldn't have even given her the advice. \u00a0The problem was the worst case scenario of suffering the Game Over. \u00a0The normal Game Over penalty was steep, but it could be overcome. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was different right now. \u00a0If Hahui suffered a Game Over, it would take her 4 days to get back here assuming everything went smoothly. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, the mess at the Voodook's tunnel meant it might take her 10 days to get back here instead of 4 days.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Hatch gave another warning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon't die. \u00a0Just don't die. I don't care what you do, but don't die. \u00a0Please don't die. \u00a0All right?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of answering Hatch's words, Hahui smirked as she turned her back to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe exploration team is going in!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Hahui's exploration teamed moved, Hatch didn't even have time for a break. \u00a0He had to pick up another thread of conversation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHatch.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0Please speak.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir immediately spoke to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you think about the newly formed alliance?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She immediately asked her question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a sudden and out of the blue question. \u00a0If one had just heard the question, it would be hard to discern the purpose behind the question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hatch immediately figured out the intent and purpose behind the question. \u00a0He gave his opinion as if he had been waiting for this question. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There is the V&amp;V, Big Smiles and Wul-gahng. \u00a0It is inevitable that they\u2019ll team up together. \u00a0I'm not sure about this, but there is a high probability that these three guilds formed an alliance with the Sweepers guild and the Blossoms guild. \u00a0Of course, this is my personal hunch, and it is only an educated guess.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre these five guilds the only ones that joined forces?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch scratched his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOn the surface, there doesn't seem to be any other movement. \u00a0In the past great battle event, there were the guilds that sat out the event with the V&amp;V guild. \u00a0We'll have to assume those guilds are sympathetic to the V&amp;V guilds, and they'll move in their favor if needed.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you think they are trying to do right now?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTheir plan is obvious. \u00a0They basically want to trample over everyone with superior numbers.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Numerous conflicts and unrest occurred as the new stage called the Black Continent \u00a0emerged.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The biggest and most recent mess was happening around Voodook's tunnel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several guilds of the 30 great guilds were sending a massive amount of members towards the Black Continent. \u00a0Of course, there were so many people in queue that the wooden post was inadequate to post the list of the line.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a restriction on how many Users could go in at a fixed interval, and congestion inevitably occurred when high number of people gathered at this location. \u00a0As the congestion grew, the discontent also grew.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI believe the ruckus created in front of the Voodook's tunnel was planned.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The mess was deliberately created to change the mind of the Users that planned on crossing the Urugal mountain range.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they planned that far ahead, Hatch was able to sufficiently discern their motive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm sure of it. \u00a0The five guilds have allied with each other, and they plan on monopolizing the Black Continent. \u00a0This is obvious, but they'll start eliminating competitors once enough members cross over to the Black Continent.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Solo Stage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they took advantage of the Voodook tunnel's special characteristic, it wasn't an impossible task.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir asked another question after she heard Hatch's explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid these 5 guilds offer an alliance with us? \u00a0Did they contact any of us?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo offers were given.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBasically, we are one of their enemies.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. We might have to play it safe. \u00a0It might get too scary to play this game.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Play it safe....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir let out a sneer instead of a bitter smile. \u00a0Hatch had the same expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They weren't really going to play it safe. \u00a0The sneer on their faces indicated the opposite.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's ruin exploration didn't take too long. \u00a0In the first place, he couldn't really call it an exploration. \u00a0The ruin he had found wasn't that large. \u00a0Excluding the space he had entered in the beginning, he had searched exactly two more locations before his exploration came to an end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After concluding his exploration, Hyrkan discovered the out-of-place artifact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The out-of-place artifact he had found was a conch carved out of wood. \u00a0It was pretty simple figuring out how to use the Item. \u00a0Hyrkan put his ears against the opening of the Wooden Conch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- We are requesting for help.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Wooden Conch immediately let out a sound.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Heard Fortress. \u00a0The Dragon's army is coming towards the Heard Fortress.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The voice was filled with desperation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I'll say it again. \u00a0The Heard Fortress is requesting for help. \u00a0The Dragon's army is coming this way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The voice within the Wooden Conch ended there. \u00a0The sound was too disjointed, and it was hard to decipher the content unless one heard it again. \u00a0However, Hyrkan didn't need to hear it again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Quest 'Remnant of the Heard Fortress' has started.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a notification system that would be more informative than listening to the conch again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Hyrkan heard the System Announcement for the Quest, he immediately opened the Quest Window.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Remnant of the Heard Fortress] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Quest Rank : Rare </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Quest Level Range :

it was familiar to Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'm guessing the reward for this Quest will merely be a Transcendent Rank Ancient Power.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Hyrkan wasn't too worried about the content of the Quest. \u00a0It was within his expectation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Heard Fortress\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was the word Heard Fortress.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018They changed the terminology.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the first time Hyrkan had heard of the word.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The terminology that appeared in Warlord was controlled by the AI system, and it was able to make small changes as needed. \u00a0Still, this knowledge wasn't able to erase the bitter taste from Hyrkan's mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan didn't frown at the bitter taste. \u00a0Instead, a small smile formed on his mouth.</span></p><br/><p>7.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Big Smiles guild had started it. \u00a0The 5 guilds within the 30 great guilds tirelessly crossed the Urugal mountain range. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the process was very perilous. \u00a0If twelve Users attempted it, around half would be forced back to the starting point.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skull Collector was trivial to the User wearing the Hahoe Mask, but it was a enemy that couldn't be beaten without skill and luck for the others Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Users that were able to make the arduous climb over the Urugal mountain range were basically treasures to the guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the Big Smiles guild wanted to protect their treasures, so they started their activities with the safety of guild members in mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hunting of monsters were done in large groups. \u00a0It was excessive even when one considered the monsters' level and quality. \u00a0Moreover, one had get permission to use any of the consumables. \u00a0These were Items that they had drank like water in the past.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They basically gave up doing tasks Users normally had to do in the game. \u00a0They gave up on exploration and leveling up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In such a situation, the Big Smiles guild was able to find a ruin. \u00a0Luck was on their side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeard fortress. \u00a0Doesn't this seem like a really important Quest?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Big Smiles guild was able to learn an important clue about the Heard Fortress.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were currently promoting safety over all else at that moment. \u00a0It was inevitable, but a discussion arose regarding what they should do with this important clue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIsn't it obvious? \u00a0We have to do that Quest.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIsn't

</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSince we are insisting on safety above all else, the discontent amongst the guild members have reached the boiling point. \u00a0They aren't able to level up, and they can't earn money through hunts. \u00a0Basically, they are wasting time by connecting into the game right now. \u00a0We have to appease them. \u00a0We have to carry out this Quest.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess we have no choice. \u00a0So who'll carry it out? \u00a0If we want to minimize the risk, should we sent our best team?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span

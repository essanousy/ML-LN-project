The Relic Guardians were the type of monsters that had high defense and a lot of HP. \u00a0Its attack power, attack pattern and skills were above average. \u00a0It wasn't an easy monster to face, but the difficulty was much lower than the unusually scary monster called the White-eye Knight Argardo. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one could buy time with the Immoral Prince, it was ok to have a small Relic Destroyer Team. \u00a0It was possible to do the Immoral Prince Raid with a small group.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, if Shir could occupy the Immoral Prince by herself, it was possible for the Stormhunters \u00a0to accomplish their tasks even with a team of 25 Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir was confident about the plan. \u00a0She was confident that she was stronger than anyone in Warlord. \u00a0The only one that affected her opinion about this fact was the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0However, even he could only affect her opinion. \u00a0Shir thought very highly of the Hahoe Mask, but she had never thought she was worse than him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, there was good reasons why she was able to have so much confidence in herself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Immoral Prince.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Blacksmith Olf had found a mysterious and marvelous metal that had been found by an ancient kingdom. \u00a0Its existence hadn't even been recorded in history. \u00a0Olf had created a very large ash-colored armor. \u00a0Prince Dean was already a large man, but the armor made him look several times larger. Moreover, the helmet placed on top of this large armor looked different from normal helmets. \u00a0It was shaped like a crown, and the helmet had a T-shaped opening where one should have been able to see the Immoral Prince's eyes. \u00a0However, one could only see black light being emitted from where its eyes should be. \u00a0Then there was the cape that was around his enormous armored body. \u00a0It had the print of a trigonal symbol on it. There were three snakes biting each other's tail.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It made one breathless when see the dignity flowing off of the Immoral Prince. The thought of facing it was daunting, yet the Storm Queen lived up to her reputation... \u00a0No, she was performing beyond her earned reputation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018My god. \u00a0She lasted for 5 minutes.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018In truth, I thought this was a suicidal mission. However, at this pace... Maybe we might succeed in this Raid.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Five minutes. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the amount of time Shir had been able to occupy the Immoral Prince.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They weren't evenly matched, but the battle was a close call.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If she was an average expert, her body would have been flung backwards from the powerful attack. \u00a0However, she just swayed once after she blocked the attack. \u00a0Another powerful attack that would have destroyed her defensive gear and body was sent towards her. \u00a0She was able to dodge it even though she had lost her balance. \u00a0\u00a0There was a overwhelming difference in their battle capability, but she refused to stay on the defensive. \u00a0She went on the offensive against the Immoral Prince. \u00a0She made it so that the Immoral Prince couldn\u2019t swing its sword properly. \u00a0She was like a shield trying to bait attacks to defend.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a fierce fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahui!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes! \u00a0I\u2019ll endure!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a hard fight with an asterisk attached to it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Shir's shout, Hahui threw herself towards the Immoral Prine.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018How dare you do that to the Queen! You are dead!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had watched Shir's battle, and Hahui's body had been itching to carry out her mission. \u00a0Hahui's charge was fierce.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Hahui was facing off against the Immoral Prince, Shir backed out. \u00a0The three Priests on standby crowded her as they started chanting their prayers. \u00a0They had started to cast their buffs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was what allowed her to carry out this fierce battle. \u00a0She had Full Buff. \u00a0Five minutes was how long the Buffs were active.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, one couldn't disparage her skill for this reason. \u00a0The Immoral Prince was strong. This became immediately apparent when it fought against Hahui. \u00a0She had similar Specs as Shir, and she had also received the Full Buff. \u00a0However, Hahui received a critical wound only after 1 minute had passed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was unable to parry the sword swung by the Immoral Prince. \u00a0Hahui's left arm flew backwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shweeek! \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a flash, the Immoral Prince had sliced through her elbow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Hahui was flustered, three Striker on standby charged towards the Immoral Prince. \u00a0Two of them attempted an attack on the Immoral Prince, and the remaining Striker exited the battlefield carrying Hahui like a luggage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI can do this! \u00a0I can hang on!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahui struggled, but her arm had been severed. \u00a0Of course, her movements were weakened compared to her normal self.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As they bought time, Shir had once again received a Full Buff. \u00a0She let out a yell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm ready!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Priests and Swordsmen engaged in the battle ebbed away, and Shir once again charged towards the Immoral Prince like an arrow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then everyone wordlessly watched the battle that had started up once again.</span></p><br/><p>5.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Iron Golem wasn't that small. \u00a0It possessed a body that was 3 meters tall, and a diamond larger than a man's fist was placed on the crown of the Iron Golem's head. \u00a0The diamond was embedded in so deep that it couldn't be extracted unless the Golem's iron head was split open.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the Relic Guardian.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was two Tankers in front of the Relic Guardian, and they were constantly drawing its aggro.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During all of this, a magician was circling around the golem at a high speed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPosition! \u00a0Get in position! \u00a0Just stay as you are. \u00a0I'll work around you!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ballista Hatch. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Normally, he was known for his unfunny sketches with Hahui. \u00a0He was someone who always complained. \u00a0Unlike his ridiculous and lame look, he was one of the top 5 Magicians in Warlord. \u00a0He was incredibly skilled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His specialty was using the Moving Casting skill in battle. \u00a0He was able to move constantly in battle, yet he was always accurate with his strike.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he wasn't moving just for the sake of moving. \u00a0His constant movements had a purpose. \u00a0He was able to dodge the attack of enemies in real time, and it lessened the burden placed on the Tankers. \u00a0He could move around the monsters engaged with the Tankers. \u00a0This meant the Tankers didn't have to lure the monsters towards a specific location or a direction. \u00a0Hatch would find the location and timing of his attack on his own.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon't over do it! \u00a0I'll take the aggro, and while I buy some time, you guys brace up for battle! \u00a0Give us another round of Buffs!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Tankers were about to falter, Ballista had drawn the aggro towards himself. \u00a0While he was being chased, he kept using his magic. \u00a0He was buying time, so his comrades could reform the battle line. \u00a0Hatch was considered to be the number 1 magician every Tanker wanted to hunt with.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He clearly had an in depth knowledge about the monsters, and he had the ability to adapt to various situation adroitly. \u00a0He was able to comprehend battle situations in real time, and he was able to come up with solutions through his analysis. \u00a0He was also capable of commanding others. \u00a0This was why Hatch had been the obvious choice to lead the hunt against the Relic Guardians.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, the plan was progressing very smoothly and stably under the command of Hatch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFull Buff is complete.!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe next Tanker will take on the Aggro.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been 7 minutes since they started the battle with the Relic Guardian. \u00a0There hadn't been any casualties or even injuries during that time. \u00a0If 100 was the full score, his great command would be scored at over a 90.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This isn't that hard, but\u2026\u2026.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hatch wasn't satisfied with the battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This might take longer than expected.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The battle was smooth, but there was no breaks. \u00a0Moreover, the speed of the battle was changing constantly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018We\u2019ve hit it numerous time, yet it is showing only a crack\u2026. \u00a0I never expected it to be like this. \u00a0At the very least, we\u2019ll need 15 minutes to catch it. \u00a0If we are to catch the other Guardians, it would take over 40 minutes\u2026..\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hatch thought about the update he heard a moment ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir's first engagement had lasted 5 minutes. \u00a0Hatch had be very surprised at the news. \u00a0Shir had said she would buy enough time for them, but he had never expected her to keep her word.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Queen is a monster amongst monsters.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he heard the news, his faith in his leader was renewed. \u00a0She was an incredible woman. \u00a0Her amazing ability allowed Shir to run the guild in a near dictatorship, and all the guild members followed her. \u00a0Shir didn\u2019t hesitate or back down from any problems, and she was always in the frontlines to make the breakthrough</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the following update made Hatch\u2019s heart feel heavy. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018\u2026\u2026however, the rest of us are just merely good at gaming.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had heard Hahui had barely lasted a minute, and her arm had been severed. \u00a0He didn't look down on Hahui's skills. \u00a0He was well aware of the skill difference between Shir and Hahui. \u00a0There was no way there was such a large gap in skills. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t large a enough of difference where one would have lasted a minute and the other lasted 5 minutes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This meant one of them was overworking herself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir had boldly declared that she would be able to last for an hour, but from Hatch's perspective, he estimated she would last about 15 minutes. \u00a0He was willing to bet his 2 years of experience that the situation would deteriorate towards the end of the 3rd exchange with the Immoral Prince.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit. \u00a0Why aren't those bastards contacting me?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, they needed outside help. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if they had read Hatch\u2019s mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An urgent news arrived.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- This is bad! The Hydra Guild and the Red Bulls Guild just started their live Immoral Prince broadcast! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fact that the two guilds had started their broadcast meant the two guilds were already here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch closed his mouth tight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Yes. \u00a0Instead of losing everything, it is better to gain something. \u00a0This is the right thing to do.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He knew he wouldn't receive praise for his actions. \u00a0However, in Hatch's judgement, he was sure his plan would bring a better result than Shir's plan of doing this alone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The two guilds have announced their plan. \u00a0They are going to destroy the Relic Guardians, while the Stormhunters act as bait..... \u00a0Did we agree to this?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hatch's expression didn't last long. \u00a0His firmly closed mouth unconsciously dropped open.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch realized it at that moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018These assholes are trying to fuck us\u2026.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The people he had called in were tigers, and he had briefly forgotten about this fact. \u00a0However, he realized that truth at that moment.</span></p><br/><p>6.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Red Bulls guild and the Hydra guild entered the Immoral Prince raid, they didn't even bother speaking to the Stormhunters. \u00a0They immediately started to hunt down the Relic Guardians. The two guilds moved in perfect sync to catch the Relic Guardians. \u00a0It looked as if the three guilds had planned this. \u00a0It looked as if the Raid had been planned like a surprise party.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From the outside, the three guilds were perfectly in sync in their actions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhich son of a bitch was it!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, from the Stormhunters' perspective, they couldn't help, but let out curse words. \u00a0Actually, the current raid was being broadcasted on the Stormhunters' live channel, and Hahui was continuously spitting out swear words. \u00a0She was about to drop everything and attack the Red Bulls or the Hydra guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhich son of a bitch betrayed us!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, Hahui had made several accidents in the past, so there had been measures taken. \u00a0Her words didn\u2019t come out through the broadcast speakers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyway, she was rightfully angry. \u00a0It was understandable. \u00a0This mission wasn\u2019t known to outsiders, so there shouldn't have been any intervention or intrusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In other words, there was most definitely a betrayer amongst them. \u00a0Since she was channeling their anger for them, the guild members didn\u2019t commit any rash acts. \u00a0In such an atmosphere of anger, if someone who represented their anger spoke, they would naturally listen to her words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, there was only one person that could give an answer to her question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the betrayer. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- It was me. \u00a0I passed along the information to the other two guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hatch confessed the fact that he was the betrayer. \u00a0At that moment, everyone shut their eyes tight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Of all the\u2026\u2026.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone expected Hahui to yell in an earsplitting rage. \u00a0They were sure she was going to let out a thunderous roar towards Hatch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? \u00a0Why? \u00a0Really? \u00a0Why did you do it?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hahui's response was unexpected. \u00a0Instead of anger, she asked questions that was filled with genuine shock. \u00a0Even the guild members that had known her for a long time had never seen this side of her before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This instead made everyone become more flustered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch's betrayal.... \u00a0They were having a hard time accepting it. \u00a0Hatch always complained, but he was someone who worked harder than anyone for the Stormhunters. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, what did he gain from betraying them? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No matter what angle they looked at it, Hatch didn\u2019t have much to gain from this betrayal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top it all, Hahui\u2019s reaction added to the confusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The confused atmosphere created a state of disorder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFocus on the battle.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir was the one that organized the atmosphere. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had dropped out of battle to receive another Full Buff. \u00a0After speaking that short sentence, she gritted her teeth like a boxer clamping down on her mouthguard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was expressing her intent of only focusing on the battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The effect of the \u2018Candy from the Bloodsucker Tree's Sap' was activated.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She immediately started her fight again. \u00a0Hatch's betrayal or the intrusion by the two guilds didn't register in her head. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the same for the Immoral Prince. These events were happening within the barrier it had raised to hide its body, yet it didn\u2019t lose its calm. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Shir once again charged forward, the Immoral Prince didn't show any particular signs. \u00a0It lightly opened its hand, and a stream of fire rose up into the air. \u00a0The stream of fire transformed into a large bird, and it flew towards Shir.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The attack was endlessly flashy and powerful, but it was merely a normal attack for the Immoral Prince.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggee-ah-ah! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Fire Bird let out a cry as it swallowed up Shir. \u00a0Armor was useless in front of the Fire Bird. \u00a0The Fire Bird wormed its way into the gaps in Shir's armor, and her skin was being charred. \u00a0Her HP was being ruthlessly chipped away. This was only a game, yet her body suddenly heated up as if she was in a sauna.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was evidence that she had taken a massive amount of damage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, her HP started to recover immediately. \u00a0It was thanks to the 'Candy from the Bloodsucker Tree's Sap'.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the Fire Bird didn't slow down Shir's charge in the least.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a flash, Shir had closed the distance with the Immoral Prince, and flame was still encircling her sword from the Fire Bird's attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immoral Prince had no thoughts of dodging Shir's attack. The Immoral prince also lightly swung its sword. A red aura was being retained by the sword swung by the Immoral Prince.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir stopped everything in fright, and she forcefully twisted her body to the side. \u00a0At the same time, the sword swung by the Immoral Prince split the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soo-ooht! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sound was very reedy. \u00a0The sound was too light. \u00a0It gave off the impression as if the sword hadn\u2019t been swung.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, accompanying this light sound, a large sword scar appeared on top of the ground and in between the vegetation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if the world had been cut in half.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir rolled on the ground after she forcefully avoided the attack. \u00a0The Immoral Prince turned its back on Shir.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed the Immoral prince was going to destroy the new groups that was destroying its relic. \u00a0It was about to move in to destroy them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she was ignored, Shir gritted her teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou should focus on the battle with me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She spoke through her gritted teeth. \u00a0She didn't sound resolute. \u00a0Her voice was more of a mixture of restlessness and a bit of gloominess. \u00a0She worked hard to ignore her feelings, and she ran in towards the Immoral Prince. \u00a0At that moment, she couldn\u2019t pay attention to what was going on in her surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, she had no idea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018\u2026\u2026isn't this the stronger version of the Crescent Moon Cut named Red Moon Sword Qi? \u00a0If I had been hit by that\u2026\u2026 I would have died in a really preposterous manner.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had no idea that the person she wanted to possess the most was nearby in the battlefield. \u00a0She had no idea Hyrkan was there.</span></p><br/><p>7.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Red Moon Sword Qi.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This skill would probably make the Swordsman Class Users' blood boil in couple months time. \u00a0This fearsome skill had made a deep scar on the ground next to him. \u00a0Hyrkan was doing his best to shrink his body next to this scar. \u00a0He carefully used the hologram monitor to check the live broadcasts of the 3 guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What a shit show.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A mocking smile rested on Hyrkan's lips. \u00a0No one knew Hyrkan was here right now. \u00a0The Red Bulls had a contract with Hyrkan, but they thought he was resting after he finished leveling up. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I knew this would happen.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason why Hyrkan deceived the Red Bulls.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was two reasons behind his deceit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First, his contract didn't forbid him from doing this. \u00a0Hyrkan didn't have to follow Red Bulls' Raid plan. \u00a0It was actually the opposite. \u00a0If the Red Bulls wanted to broadcast footage of Hyrkan, they would have to work around Hyrkan's schedule.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The second reason was the fact that he had predicted this would happen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Well, it doesn't matter if it's the cow bastards or the snake bastards. \u00a0They all act the same.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a cold situation where the two guilds were trying to take away the meaty part of the reward, while the Stormhunters was used as bait. \u00a0It hadn't been too hard to predict what they were going to do. \u00a0It was said like attracts like. \u00a0These bastards thought alike, so it wasn't too hard to discern their intent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018As expected, I don't like these kinds of people.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan turned his head once again to look at Shir, who was earnestly fighting the Immoral Prince. \u00a0He looked at the guild members of the Stormhunters looking intently at Shir's battle. \u00a0They were so focused on the battle that there was no chance they would notice Hyrkan's existence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The tail end of Hyrkan's lips rose as if it had been hooked by a fishing hook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a situation where the Stormhunters had become the bait. \u00a0In some ways, this improved Hyrkan's mood. \u00a0It felt as if his hurting inside improved in the span of a morning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, he shouldn\u2019t be smiling. \u00a0The current situation wasn\u2019t that great.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan returned the corner of his mouth to its original position. Then he tried to reason with himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018First, I have to put aside the feelings I have towards the Stormhunters. \u00a0Let me think after I put away those feelings.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their current situation wasn\u2019t that great.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If the Storm Queen dies here, it doesn\u2019t matter how many Users are left in the Stormhunters guild. \u00a0They\u2019ll be uncooperative no matter what.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Stormhunters were the first to cause a problem, but the Red Bulls and Hydra guild responded with similar type of behaviors as the Stormhunters. \u00a0During all of this, if Shir suffered a Game Over, the Stormhunters would never cooperate with the other two guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018We\u2019ll be fortunate if they don\u2019t interfere with the Raid.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the worst situation comes to pass, the remaining Stormhunters guild members might attack the other two guilds. \u00a0They would interfere with the Immoral Prince Raid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if that doesn\u2019t come to pass, the Stormhunters might abstain from the battlefield. \u00a0In the end, the Red Bulls, Hydra, and the Hahoe Mask would have to face the Immoral Prince.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, they could do it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018However, if the Stormhunters drop out, I might be in the same position as Che-sulyun.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the two guilds cooperate with each other, it was unknown as to whether Hyrkan would be able to hold the floor with them. \u00a0That was the problem. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I don\u2019t want to die, I have to fight with my life on the line.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no way the two guilds knew about Hyrkan\u2019s situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, they could, at the very least, predict that Hyrkan would fight desperately against the Immoral Prince. \u00a0It was a given that Hyrkan wouldn\u2019t just standby and do nothing in the Immoral Prince hunt. \u00a0The price of failing to kill the Immoral Prince was annihilation. \u00a0Moreover, from Hyrkan\u2019s perspective, Hyrkan needed to have the biggest role in the Immoral Prince series.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Anyways, I never expected Che-sulyun to fight so well. \u00a0If I work with the Stormhunters, the chance of victory is over 90%.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, it wouldn\u2019t be easy to kill the Immoral Prince if the Stormhunters pull themselves out of this Raid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While the Stormhunters stood back from the Immoral Prince Raid, there was a good chance that multiple groups might turn against him. \u00a0There was a high probability of the two guilds wouldn\u2019t help out, while Hyrkan faced impossible odds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the worst case scenario, the Hahoe Mask would buy them as much time as they needed against the Immoral Prince to complete their tasks. \u00a0Afterwards, the Red Bulls and Hydra guild could join hands, and they would be the only ones that would get a happy ending. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Anyways, I can't trust those two guilds \u00a0no matter what.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Hyrkan was asked to name the guild he hated the most in the 30 great guilds, he would say it was the Stormhunters. \u00a0However, this didn't mean he had inexhaustible amount of faith in the other 29 guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was also true for the Red Bulls. \u00a0He had decided to work with them, but he didn't trust them. \u00a0They were all doing this for profit. \u00a0In other words, if Hyrkan aimed for their share in the profit and he caused a loss for the Red Bulls, their attitude and stance towards him would change.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So what was the best case scenario?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be for best if the 3 guilds were all wiped out, and Hyrkan was the last man standing. \u00a0This wasn\u2019t a guarantee. \u00a0It was only a guess, but if the Hahoe Mask could monopolize all the rewards given in the Immoral Prince series, he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about Items anymore.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this scenario was unrealistic. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As always, the best case scenario rarely came to fruition. \u00a0This was why a person should act in a way where they could avoid the worst case scenario. \u00a0One had to do this instead of working towards the best case scenario.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In his current situation, the second best policy was to choose the path with the highest probability of killing the Immoral Prince.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was beyond considering the risks and returns. \u00a0He must catch the Immoral Prince, and he had to choose the method where his survival was guaranteed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To accomplish this, Shir had to survive, and the performance of the Stormhunters was critical.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan regulated his breathing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018My life is really fucked up.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A lot of thoughts passed through his mind. \u00a0There were a lot of regrets in his past experiences, but at the same time, those experiences had nothing to do with his current situation. \u00a0The memories of those times no longer existed now, and these thoughts flitted through his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The thought of his past experiences made this choice very hard hard to swallow. \u00a0In the end, Hyrkan had to convince his pride more so than anything else.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t helping the Stormhunters and Che-sulyun. \u00a0This was a necessary task he had to accomplish if he wanted to step over everyone\u2026 \u00a0It wasn\u2019t a brief amount of time, but he was finally able to convince his pride with regards to his course of action.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan pulled himself together as he got up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is for me.\u2019</span></p><br/><p>8.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one kept sprinting in consecutive races, one's record would get worse instead of getting better.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Battle was similar in that aspect.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir was able to last 5 minutes in her first battle with the Immoral Prince. \u00a0However, she was only able to buy 4 minutes on her second try. \u00a0On the third attempt, she had started the fight when she hadn\u2019t been able to pull her emotions back together.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why she started to rapidly waver after 3 minutes into her 3rd battle. \u00a0Eventually, an accident happened. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immoral Prince\u2019s sword was dyed red, but Shir didn\u2019t stop her charge as the Immoral Prince used the Red Crescent Moon skill. \u00a0She changed her steps to lean herself diagonally, and she was barely able to dodge the Red Crescent Moon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She used the Dash skill at the same time as she dodged the attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a flash, she closed a distance of about 15 meters. \u00a0As she closed the distance, she used her Booster skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She even used the Crescent Moon Cut skill. \u00a0This meant there was no way she would be able to evade backwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She didn\u2019t care about the damage. \u00a0When her attack reached it, the Immoral Prince would start the battle with her again. \u00a0This was what Shir was aiming for.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If it dodges backward, I\u2019ll use Body Slam to initiate a close combat\u2026.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, inside Shir\u2019s head, the next move, the next move and the next next move was formulated. \u00a0She was thinking three moves ahead. \u00a0If she was incapable of thinking ahead, her head would be useless.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was her decrease in stamina. \u00a0Her judgement was becoming dulled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir was trying to think about her next move, so she wasn\u2019t able to counterattack or even dodge the Immoral Prince\u2019s attack. \u00a0She also missed the fact that the Immoral Prince had used a much faster version of the Dash skill she had used. \u00a0She wasn\u2019t able to immediately recognize this fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Shir became aware of this fact, the Immoral Prince\u2019s sword was already touching Shir\u2019s shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sword sliced through her black armor and her left shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, the Immoral Prince followed up with a Body Slam. \u00a0Shir had lost her arm, and her body was in a baad state as she rolled across the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The first one to move in this situation was Hahui.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Usually, she would charge in while yelling \u2018My Queen!\u2019, but she silently charged forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She wasn\u2019t in a Full Buff state, and she hadn\u2019t even used her own Buffs on herself. \u00a0The speed at which Hahui was charging forward was the worst move one could pull against the Immoral Prince.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwee-reek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immoral Prince stepped aside as if it was evading a charging bull. \u00a0It easily evaded Hahui\u2019s Body Slam. \u00a0As if it had been waiting for Hahui, the sword flew in parallel to the floor like rock skipping over water. \u00a0It was swift.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soo-oohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sword cut through her left thigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahui had lost a leg, so she fell over to the floor. \u00a0The sword that had been swung by the Immoral Prince was reversed in an instant. \u00a0It planned on pinning its sword through Hahui\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had all happened in such a brief amount of time, so no one was able to react to the critical situation. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Aside from reacting to it, no one had been able to process what was going on. \u00a0That was the reality of the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the guild members hadn\u2019t moved. \u00a0A third party had stepped in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying a sudden sound of an explosion, a third party had appeared out of nowhere as he swung his sword towards the Immoral Prince.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of exchanging a greeting with the Immoral Prince, he shared the sound of steel with it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

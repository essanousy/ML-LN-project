However, the two were in completely different states.</p><br/><p>One stood straight and tall, while the other was kneeling on the ground. The latter\u2019s arms were held by Skeleton Warriors, as his eyes were full of brutal injuries.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, I swear I\u2019ll get my revenge on you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The kneeled player grit his teeth as he spoke to the standing man with hatred. The standing man, of course, was Hyrkan. Wearing an almost spotless armor, Hyrkan smirked at the kneeling player\u2019s child-like curse.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, sure. If you\u2019re coming, bring some more expensive items. I\u2019ll be waiting. See you in 48 hours. Sleep tight. Good night~\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Hyrkan stared at the three Skeleton Warriors surrounding the kneeling player.</p><br/><p>Snap, snap!</p><br/><p>Hyrkan snapped his fingers twice, making two Skeleton Warriors pulled on the player\u2019s arms. The remaining Skeleton Warrior raised his sword and stabbed the gap between the player\u2019s helmet and breastplate.</p><br/><p>Stab, stab!</p><br/><p>As if once wasn\u2019t enough, the Skeleton Warrior stabbed consecutively. Hyrkan only watched on emotionlessly. Rather than emotionless, it was more correct to say Hyrkan erased the battle just now from his memory. Only a number was recorded.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s the 15th one now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Two weeks had passed since Hyrkan came to the Lizard Swamp. After the first day\u2019s disturbance, Hyrkan put his focus on leveling up. The result was great, as he achieved 7 levels during that time. Considering that it takes an average player one month to go from level 20 to level 30, Hyrkan\u2019s level up speed was comparable\u2026 no, much faster than the Rankers.</p><br/><p>However, hunting wasn\u2019t the only thing he did.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s almost one per day.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was attacked. Not once, but nine times, for a total of fifteen players.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come on, this isn\u2019t even the real world. All this, just to look good to girls in a VR game? If they like girls so much, why don\u2019t they go play dating sims or a blind date game?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa\u2026 I guess it really is hard to find normal people in Warlord.\u201d</p><br/><p>The attackers\u2019 motive was revenge.</p><br/><p>The three beauties that approached to play Hyrkan, but got played by Hyrkan. Instead of reflecting on their mistake, they coaxed other men to get revenge on Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>\u2018What a bunch of snakes. At least their fishing skills are top notch.\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course, Hyrkan didn\u2019t have a shred of regret about screwing over those girls. He had not physically harmed them in any way. It\u2019s just that there was a little accident during their hunting, which was caused by the three girls, not Hyrkan. In fact, Hyrkan was more help to them than harm. After all, he killed nine Lizardmen for them. If anything, he should be rewarded.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Warlord wasn\u2019t a place where such logic applied. If three beauties accused a strange man wearing a hahoe mask and leather clothing of assaulting them, there were bound to be people who believed them.</p><br/><p>Some of them would have their normally nonexistent sense of justice provoked and come out to judge said sexual deviant.</p><br/><p>\u2018Their acting skills are just too good. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they debuted as actresses soon.\u2019</p><br/><p>In reality, Hyrkan could easily justify himself, but Hyrkan didn\u2019t do so.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, I\u2019m thankful to be honest.\u2019</p><br/><p>Looking at the wrist of the player in the game over state, Hyrkan grinned.</p><br/><p>This was why.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan didn\u2019t need to justify himself in any way.</p><br/><p>\u2018This one was trash too, but looking at his items, he must be around mid to late 30s. That means his items should be at least level 30. Now, if I can get a level 30 rare item\u2026 I can have some meat for dinner tonight.\u2019</p><br/><p>Why would he say no to human-form monsters delivering themselves to his doorsteps? Not to mention, they drop already crafted items.</p><br/><p>More importantly, although Hyrkan was unbelievably strong against monsters, he was even more monstrous versus players. Furthermore, it was hard to find good players from the self-righteous fools trying to look good to a bunch of girls.</p><br/><p>Of course, Hyrkan didn\u2019t forget to remind himself.</p><br/><p>\u2018If they\u2019re going so far to get back at me, for two weeks no less, then they\u2019ll have to pay the price. If I catch them again, I\u2019m going to play soccer with their cut-off heads.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan told himself to get back at the girls when he got the chance. Otherwise, they would never stop.</p><br/><p>In any case, thanks to these reasons, the Lizard Swamp, which was no different than hell to other players, was nothing less than heaven for Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>He leveled up fast, and people even came to donate him items. There was truly no better hunting ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Could that be why?</p><br/><p>Hyrkan felt a sense of shame again. He would have to leave the Lizard Swamp soon. After all, he couldn\u2019t stay here forever.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a shame.\u201d</p><br/><p>After picking up the watch, Hyrkan looked around. He had long grown accustomed to the area, showing just how long he had stayed. Soon, he would have to leave.</p><br/><p>\u20183 levels left to go\u2026 I\u2019m hoping I can get at least 5 more watches until then.\u2019</p><br/><p>Level 30.</p><br/><p>That was Hyrkan\u2019s current goal. Once he achieved level 30, he planned to search the Lizard Swamp thoroughly to clear his Nested Egg quest. And if he couldn\u2019t find it?</p><br/><p>Then he would have no choice but to move on to the next place. He couldn\u2019t stay in one place forever. Not unless he knew for certain that this was the quest area. However, even if Lizard Swamp wasn\u2019t the quest area, he didn\u2019t need to feel bad.</p><br/><p>\u2018If this isn\u2019t the place for the Nested Egg quest\u2026 I\u2019m going to put out all the videos I collected from here.\u2019</p><br/><p>If this wasn\u2019t the testing ground Ahimbree mentioned, it wouldn\u2019t be one of the places suspected by the ones who approached Hyrkan. In that case, it would be fine to make his videos from here public.</p><br/><p>In any case, Hyrkan would benefit.</p><br/><p>Thinking about this, the corner of Hyrkan\u2019s mouth once again curled up into a smile. With that, Hyrkan shook his pocket full of watches.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s been a while. Why don\u2019t I go cash in?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>Ttzzzz!</p><br/><p>As a thick piece of meat fell onto a heated pan, an enticing burning smell filled the air. The taste of a savory steak could be easily imagined through the smell.</p><br/><p>\u2018God, it\u2019s been so long.\u2019</p><br/><p>In front of such a smell, An Jaehyun couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ku! What a shame I can\u2019t drink beer with this.\u2019</p><br/><p>2,530,000 won.</p><br/><p>That was the amount that entered his bank account today.</p><br/><p>He had transferred the money he made so far into his bank account. YouTube donations and the amount from selling Lizardmen\u2019s crafting materials. Of course, these two didn\u2019t account for much of his earning. The secret lied in the watches he exchanged.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can\u2019t believe I got a level 35 Rare weapon.\u2019</p><br/><p>A level 35 Rare weapon, a sword no less. Just this was 800,000 won.</p><br/><p>\u2018I also can\u2019t believe that was all he could do with a weapon like that\u2026 talk about casting pearls before swine.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was thanks to this weapon that Hyrkan\u2019s usual dinner menu of glucose candy and cheap coffee turned into the current tenderloin steak. With his long awaited protein ahead of him, An Jaehyun was feeling happier than ever.</p><br/><p>\u2018No, I\u2019m grateful. Bless them, really. It\u2019s because they spent their money in this game that I\u2019m able to eat like this. If I see them again, I should greet them. Maybe I\u2019ll even give them a hug.\u2019</p><br/><p>The smile on Hyrkan\u2019s face didn\u2019t seem to want to disappear. That was how happy An Jaehyun was. He felt like he was soaring in the skies. After plating his steak, he put the macaroni salad and potato salad he bought form the supermarket next to him.</p><br/><p>Gulp!</p><br/><p>He would feel even better once he put the meat in his mouth, as he would achieve absolute bliss.</p><br/><p>But Hyrkan\u2019s happy feeling\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMm? An email?\u201d</p><br/><p>Was destroyed when he saw a certain email.</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>\u2013 I am Stormhunter Guild\u2019s head scout. Hahoe Mask Hyrkan, I saw your YouTube videos. I was mesmerized by your skill and talent. Thus, we, the Stormhunter Guild, would like to invite you for a formal talk. Between 10 A.M. and 6 P.M. Korea time, setting aside lunch time of 1 P.M. to 2 P.M., tell us when you are free. We will be awaiting your response.</p><br/><p>It went without saying that those who could make a name for themselves by uploading personal videos to YouTube received attention from numerous groups \u2013 Video content creation businesses, management companies, and Warlord guilds, etc. Scouting offers from groups like these were like a medal of honor for Warlord YouTubers.</p><br/><p>Just one of such offer would make one happy, and even more so as they accumulated.</p><br/><p>However, when An Jaehyun saw this medal of honor, joy was furthest from what he was feeling.</p><br/><p>\u2018Stormhunter\u2026 that damn name.\u2019</p><br/><p>Scouting offers weren\u2019t outside of his expectations. He had already been receiving offers from management companies and guilds. If one wasn\u2019t blind, it was easy to tell An Jaehyun\u2019s battles were incomparable to other players\u2019. Although most of his offers came from no-name guilds, he had received some from fairly well-organized, mid-size guilds. He even got offers on how to raise an all-strength necromancer.</p><br/><p>In that sense, this was truly a big deal. Although An Jaehyun\u2019s YouTube page was getting popular, it wasn\u2019t to the point one of Top 30 Guilds would make a scouting offer. The Top 30 Guilds were generally busy pulling the weeds out from those that applied. They didn\u2019t bother to look for players on their own accord. Even if they did, they had their pride. Because of this pride, they didn\u2019t easily do such a thing.</p><br/><p>However, he had gotten an offer from a Top 30 Guilds for the first time. Most Warlord YouTubers would have contacted them without turning back. They would be drunk in happiness.</p><br/><p>However, An Jaehyun still remembered clear as day.</p><br/><p>\u2018At the very least, I\u2019ll never hold hands with that bitch.\u2019</p><br/><p>Why was he here?</p><br/><p>It was because of the Stormhunter Guild and Choi Sulyeon. Just remembering her face made him grit his teeth. The sense of hatred, pain, and despair he felt because of her and others, he could still feel it.</p><br/><p>It went without saying that An Jaehyun didn\u2019t have the faintest idea of accepting this offer.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if there\u2019s a knife to my throat\u2026 well no, I\u2019ve already experienced that many times.\u2019</p><br/><p>As such, this offer only put his mood in a dumpster, nothing more and nothing less.</p><br/><p>\u2018That bitch. At least she\u2019s got good standards.\u2019</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun immediately deleted the email. Then, he went back to eating. However, the taste of the meat was no longer on his mind. An Jaehyun chewed on the meat as if he was chewing on rubber.</p><br/><p>His eyes shined with menace.</p><br/><p>The Stormhunter Guild\u2019s scouting offer evoked the wrath of a king. An Jaehyun was remembering his original intention.</p><br/><p>\u2018Right, this isn\u2019t the time to sit and chew on some meat. An Jaehyun, don\u2019t think you\u2019re free to eat meat just because you\u2019ve got some money now.\u2019</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun struck down on the steak with his fork. Is this the time to leisurely eat meat?</p><br/><p>\u2018If I\u2019m satisfied with where I am, that\u2019s all I will ever be. An Jaehyun, get your shit together.\u2019</p><br/><p>No.</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun. His goal was to take everything on alone. To become the best in Warlord.</p><br/><p>To become the best, he had to give up everything. The life of wealth and honor could wait until he achieved his goal. Before then\u2026 he had to be a starving predator.</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun got up from his seat. He put his steak and salad into the trashcan. Then, he boiled water and threw in a handful of glucose candy into a cup.</p><br/><p>Beeeep!</p><br/><p>Only the sound of a kettle filled the surrounding air of loneliness.</p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

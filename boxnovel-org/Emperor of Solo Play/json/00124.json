They were walking, so the distance they could cover in 20 minutes wasn't that large.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why the Corrupted army urged their feet to move faster. \u00a0Their foot speed was slowly increasing. \u00a0If they had been taking 10 steps, they had increased their pace to take 12 to 13 steps.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koong,koong,koong,koong! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no obstacles that could stop them, and there was increased power behind their charge. The sound of the ground shaking was getting louder, and the force they were pushing forward with got stronger. They were like a living bulldozer. They were shoving everything out of their way. After they plowed up everything in front of them, they trampled everything to finish the deed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If this scene was seen from the front, it would be a terrifying sight. For example, this was like a person standing in the middle of a train track built to connect two cliffs. The train was coming towards the person standing on the track, and it was making a lot of noise. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dizziness! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, this wasn\u2019t a normal dizziness. \u00a0It was a dizziness that threatened to swallow the kaleidoscope of thoughts that was in one's head. \u00a0This dizziness completely filled one's mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were times when a tragedy close at hand might seem comedic from afar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Corrupted army was a symbol representing tragedy. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A person looking from afar would liken the army to this description right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was like a wild animal running crazily as if its tail was on fire! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the figure of speech implied, the Corrupted army's tail was on fire, and it wasn't a pretty sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The most eye catching part was the grisly sight of monster corpses strewn about behind the Corrupted army. \u00a0The corpses hadn't been disassembled, and they hadn't melted yet. The irrefutable evidence of the grisly process of the killing was on full display. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The next eye-catching part was a group of monsters dressed in similar gears. They were devastating the members of the Corrupted army. \u00a0These monsters all wore similar armors, and they looked as if they had some kind of a dress code. \u00a0The difference in terms of power was apparent between the two groups. The difference in power made the horde that symbolized tragedy to look almost comedic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Six Bone Explosives and 3 Skeleton Warriors are needed for the Corrupted Armor Orc.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The one directing this comedy was Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The size of the bag containing his Bone Explosives had noticeably decreased in size. \u00a0After he took out three Bone Explosive, he threw it towards a Corrupted Armor Orc. \u00a0The Bone Explosives crumpled the Orc's armor. \u00a0The dishevelled Orc put on a rage-filled expression as it turned to charge towards Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan gave the signal to three Skeleton Warriors, who had just arrived after finishing their battle. \u00a0The Skeleton Warriors had just recovered from a broken knee, ribs and shoulders. \u00a0They followed their owner's orders as they ran in towards Orc.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan didn't watch the battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason why he couldn't recall any memorable battle scenes from this protracted battle. The only scene he remembered was himself throwing the Bone Explosives. \u00a0Basically, he remembered a variation of the same scene as if a camera was taking multiple shots at once.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead, Hyrkan remembered a number.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018118.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been 10 minutes since the battle had started, and he had caught 118 Corrupted Monsters. There were over a thousand of them, and the the number was closer to being two thousand. \u00a0The number of monsters he had killed was like a thorn in the Corrupted Army's side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan broke down the battle into numerical figures. He felt this approach left much to be desired. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Corrupted Werewolf. \u00a0Use 6 Bone Explosives, and dispatch the Skeleton Knight.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was like a finely tuned machine. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He honed in on a target, and he used just the right number of Bone Explosives to crush the armor. \u00a0After he finished acquiring aggro and armor breaking, he dispatched the right amount of force needed to take down the monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This type of battle gave off a little bit of a different feeling than the any of the battles from before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Intelligent. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The cool time of the Curses has been reset. I should get ready.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He calculated the cool time of all his skills, and he put the right number of underlings in the right locations. The way he was conducting the battle was possible not because of his experience or intuition.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, it wasn't as if Hyrkan stood back as he commanded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He stepped in when there was an emergency. If he determined his underling was about to be killed, he didn't hesitate to step forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the exact situation he was in. \u00a0A Kobold has swung its hammer, and it had destroyed the knee of a Skeleton Warrior. \u00a0The Skeleton Warrior fell in place, and the Kobold's hammer was about to fall like thunder on top its head. \u00a0Hyrkan was already next to the Kobold as he used Body Slam with his sword placed right in front of him. \u00a0He sent the Kobold flying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had a powerful weapon called the Black Kobold King's Sword. For this battle, he looked the other way as he purchased the weapon for a slightly higher price than its usual market price. \u00a0The weapon, which he had paid a hefty sum, pierced through the Kobold's armor and skin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He carried the Skeleton Warrior on his back, since it hadn't recovered for its injury yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The magical energy consumed in repairing the Skeleton Warriors wasn't a problem. \u00a0However, if a Skeleton Warrior was destroyed, there was a cool time before it could be re-summoned. \u00a0This was why Hyrkan had stepped forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was very hard to participate in a battle, and think at the same time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Furthermore, the situation on the battlefield changed a lot when Hyrkan participated in the battle field. \u00a0Every move he made required a new calculation, and Hyrkan was able to quickly carry out the calculation. \u00a0Hyrkan would survey the battlefield, and he was able to finish his calculation based on this information. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an incredible feat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, it was something very unusual.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So what made Hyrkan different from the normal Users? \u00a0Moreover, why did this difference allow him give an effort of 120%?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to get my money's worth. \u00a0No matter what...\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the answer was very simple.</span></p><br/><p>5.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In life, a person's voice was an incredibly important tool. \u00a0On a brutal stage like a war, if one's voice couldn't reach other's ears easily, it would lose its worth. This was why people used other tools in battle. They used tools like horns or drums that mimicked the rising heart rate of men to communicate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was a tool that was worth more than one's voice in Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat's the current status of Team 8 and Team 9?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Team 9 is on standby. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Team 8 is on standby.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Voice Talk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Warlord allowed the use of this endlessly useful program. It was able to transmit one's voice in the midst of the very loud and bone chilling sounds of battle. \u00a0Its worth as a tool was highlighted in battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is up to the discretion of Team 9 and Team 8 to join the battle. \u00a0Aside from Team 1 to 5, the rest of the teams will move after Team 8 and Team 9 moves.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big K spoke as he looked forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018They are finally here.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be false to say the Corrupted army was far away. \u00a0One could now see the advancing corrupted army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Kay was part of the team that'll defend the region in the front.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">of course, this sector was the hardest to defend. It was a stage where everyone didn't want to be, and at the same time, it was the region that required the most skilled Users. \u00a0Since this stage held such significance, Big K was put in charge of this stage. \u00a0He\u2019ll also have the final say in what happened. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, Big K didn't want to be in charge of this stage. \u00a0If it wasn't for the orders from Red Bulls, he would have used the tips disseminated to everyone by the Hahoe Mask to hunt. \u00a0He would have been out there doing the Gnawing method.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was one of the reasons why Big K let out a sigh with the battle in sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Jeez. \u00a0What kind of a game...\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Red Bulls didn't allow guild members to join the great battle as representatives of the guild. \u00a0They were allowed to join as individuals. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guilds were looking at the big picture. \u00a0Several big factor were preventing them from participating in the great battle in earnest. \u00a0However, none of the 30 great guilds had given up on the great battle. \u00a0Naturally, they expected a time to come when they would have to enter into the fray in earnest. This was why the 30 great guilds were doing advanced work. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two tasks they were trying to accomplish.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Goodwill. The guild members had to unhesitatingly do the dirty work as individuals. \u00a0This will naturally build the trust of the Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Experience. \u00a0While they were doing the hard work, they would gain more experience compared to the Users, who only did the easy work. \u00a0This was a given.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of it all, the two tasks were also a measuring stick for the guilds. \u00a0Every \u00a0company had to choose people, who had the potential to move up in the corporate structure. \u00a0One had to separate out the elite amongst the workers that had just entered. \u00a0After separating out \u00a0the elites, these Users had to mature and be tested on a special stage. \u00a0This was such a task for Big K. \u00a0There was no reason why he should feel bad about it. \u00a0If his results were good, he would move into the 1.5 Raid team at the end of the great battle. This was where the flower of the Red Bulls guild was placed. \u00a0He would be placed in a rank that would give him a lot of face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he felt pressure. \u00a0A test was a test. \u00a0Currently, several dozen Users like Big K was spread across Warlord. \u00a0Seeds were spread far and wide. \u00a0The ones that grew the best would be place where there would be most light.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he couldn\u2019t take root in the stage called the great battle, he\u2019ll be returned to the dirt. \u00a0Even if he was able to germinate and sprout, he wouldn\u2019t be picked if his stem thin, his roots weren\u2019t deep, and his leaves were dry. \u00a0He wouldn\u2019t be pick, and he would have to wait for the next opportunity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to do well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, he had to do better than everyone else.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Hahoe Mask.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Big K was having a hard time forgetting about the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0No matter how he thought about it, he felt as if the existence of the Hahoe Mask would give him a chance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, while Big K was thinking this through inside his head, the battle started. \u00a0The battle couldn\u2019t be delayed.</span></p><br/><p>6.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHold out!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Tankers linked shields to make a concave battle line, and the priests stood behind that line. \u00a0The magicians were lined up behind the priests. \u00a0The group leader, who directed the battle, was behind the line of magician. \u00a0This was the Centurion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had created a crescent-shaped line, and the armored monsters with pitch black eyes swarmed against it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-ahng, kwah-ahng, kwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monsters tirelessly banged against the shields, and the power of the monsters' weapons were incredible. The blunt weapons crushed the shields, and the sharp weapons ripped through the shields. \u00a0The Tankers had placed their shield in front of them, and the shields were losing their luster as it turned unsightly. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, there were few shields that still held its dignified appearance as it shone against the fierce attacks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Tankers next to the owners of the shields made comments towards them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Albino Beetle Shield is amazing.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnique Items are quite something.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The owner of the shield spoke with a proud smile on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is why people use all their money to gain this type of Items. Instead of buying three mediocre shields, it is better to just buy one good shield.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou whined when you bought that shield. \u00a0You said you regretted buying that....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These three Users proved they could joke around even in a tight battle. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Casting complete! \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While this was going on, the magicians started whispering into the Centurion's ears that their casting was complete.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One, two, three\u2026\u2026 When he counted to ten, the Centurion raised his voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReady the magic bombardment!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sound increased the nervousness felt by everyone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ones who were the most nervous were the Tankers. \u00a0Explosions will be going off in front of their shield. The powerful magical spells would start to destroy the monsters, and the after effects would spread to the surrounding. \u00a0This was worse than taking a fragments from a grenade. \u00a0The monsters, who were attacking would trip, fall or be pushed back. The strength that emerged from this process would be enormous. \u00a0Any living organism displayed its strongest power in its struggle to live.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There is no way I'll make a Tanker ever again.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to do all hard work. It \u00a0is the best to be a healer.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Tanker's nervousness passed, the priests prepared themselves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFire the magic!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ten magicians threw various magical spells as they synchronized with the Centurion's signal. They threw it over the line as the magical spells fell on the head of the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The first spells to take effect was the electricity magic. \u00a0Two lightning marbles fell on the head of the monsters, and the electricity was discharged.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-ji-jeek, pah-ji-jeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Armor was useless against electric discharge. Some parts of the armors acted like lightning rods as it took in the electricity. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-uh-uh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monsters let out a roar as they took in the electrical discharge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As this attack was taking effect, two fire marbles fell on the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roo!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Each fire marble created a sea of fire about 330 meters in size. \u00a0Its immediate damage wasn't that high, but it damaged the monsters over time. \u00a0It was the strongest Persistent spell available. \u00a0It was the most useful magic when maintaining a face to face confrontation. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ice was synonymous with magic in Warlord, and it wasn't missing from the party. \u00a0One Ice marble fell to the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It broke against the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After it broke open, the Ice Fog that was filling the marble started to spread to a wide area. \u00a0The fog disappeared as fast as it had appeared. \u00a0However, when the fog disappeared,it left behind completely frozen monsters. \u00a0There were only ice statues left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ones to break the ice statues were the nearby monsters. \u00a0The monsters didn't hesitate to trample over their comrades. \u00a0The frozen monsters were broken completely like glass or they were broken in piecemeal. \u00a0However, there were almost no traces left when the heavy footsteps of the monsters trampled over the broken pieces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A mayhem ensued, and this mayhem was pounding against the Tankers. \u00a0The Tankers yelled out with their shields in front of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEndure!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-raht-cha-cha!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSomeone sing me a song!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even now they were cracking jokes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was a place where jokes weren't forthcoming.</span></p><br/><p>7.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Team 10 has fallen! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a one-sided communication given to Big K as a report. They weren't asking for help. They were just telling others that their work was done, and they'll be high tailing it out of there. It was a missive that expressed support to the rest of the teams left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big K didn't get angry at those words. It would be great if they could all enjoy the battle as they laughed. \u00a0However, even if all the troops of the 30 great guilds were sent in, Users would still suffer Game Overs. \u00a0\u00a0This will make the Users drink alcohol for 48 hrs. Tragedy happened no matter what work you did in this world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, one couldn\u2019t feel anger or relief at such news.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGood job.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- You did well Team 10.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Please get ready for the next battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He decided they should stay to defend their region. \u00a0It was the right answer to leave alone the location of the breach. \u00a0If they split apart their forces to patch up the breach, a lot of Users will suffer Game Overs. They'll receive a long reflection period of 48 hours. \u00a0This had been proven time and time again in other battles. \u00a0The report card on this strategy was dismal. \u00a0It would be stupid to follow the same failing formula again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Big K assessed their chance of winning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It's been 10 minutes since the battle started yet the Corrupted Army broke through one place.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The pace wasn't that great. The fact that they hadn't been able to hold out for 10 minutes wasn't the important part. The fact that they couldn't last 10 minutes meant that they weren't able to kill many monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were only 1000 Users gathered at the Shezga castle, and the defeat was already preordained before the battle even started. It was clear that they'll have to do the street battles soon. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, this was a long-drawn-out battle. \u00a0There was the outside of the castle, castle gate and inside the castle. These were the three stages where battles would be fought. \u00a0Of course, every monster one kills in the earlier stage meant it would be a boon in this protracted battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018As expected, we can't do this.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had taken down far less than expected. \u00a0This was why the probability of victory was lowered in Big K's head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It happened at that moment...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- This is Team 11.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Team 11 contacted him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Huh?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Team 11 and Team 12 held slightly different roles than the other teams. These were the Users with styles that was was least useful in the great battle. \u00a0It was a group made out of Strikers. \u00a0Instead of exchanging blows, these teams were made out of Users adept at doing hit and run attacks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is it Team 11?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These teams had been in charge of carrying out the Gnawing method.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they weren't careful, these were the teams that would suffer catastrophic accidents like Team 10. \u00a0Since they were doing a hit and run, there was no way they would be annihilated. \u00a0Of course, they were also the teams that spoke the least on Voice Talk. \u00a0When someone who rarely speaks says something, there was more weight to their words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the content of the words also added to the weight of the words being spoken.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The Hahoe Mask is active in the rear of the the Corrupted Army. What should we do? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the Team 11 Centurion's words, it was as if a well full of frogs were croaking at the same time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Wow! \u00a0The Hahoe Mask is really at the rear?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I thought he left after throwing couple Bone Explosives. Was he perhaps been at the rear this whole time?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Wow. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask is really a crazy dude. Was he just on the tail? Or was he fighting the whole time?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Croak croak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Voices were coming from every avenue, and it almost made Big K lose his mind. \u00a0It didn't matter for others if people kept speaking. \u00a0However, it was Big K's job to hear everyone out. \u00a0He had to parse through even the meaningless words. \u00a0There was nothing more annoying than to have a job where one has to listen to garbage. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cQuiet.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Big K spoke a word.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- How many monsters did the Hahoe Mask.... \u00a0Ah. \u00a0I'm sorry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When one person stepped up to act as an inquisitor, it extinguished the fired that had roiled the atmosphere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big K spoke again when the atmosphere had settled down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo how many did the Hahoe Mask take down?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had spoken in a manner that was akin to how an inquisitor spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Pffft. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A laughter leaked out of the Voice Talk. \u00a0Since Big K didn't know the reason behind the laughter, he wasn't in a good mood. \u00a0It was quite fortunate that the others couldn't see his expression. \u00a0A small relief bloomed in his chest from the fact that this wasn't a video chat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, the Centurion of Team 11 was a man of few words, and he hadn't been carried along by the atmosphere of others. \u00a0He answered in a calm fashion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The number I witnessed is 11. He is catching one per minute. \u00a0It's been 110 minute since the Corrupted Army went into its Siege mode. \u00a0If he had maintained this pace, at the very least, he would have caught over a hundred of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At those words, the frogs could no longer croak.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

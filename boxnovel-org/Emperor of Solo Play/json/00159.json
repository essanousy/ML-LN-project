159 \u2013 Catch it or Be Caught (2)</span></p><br/><p>4.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you know the Watchman Style?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A User wearing the Hahoe Mask asked the question. \u00a0He was standing with his sword resting on his shoulder. \u00a0Instead of an answer, the magician unfurled his middle fingers to flip him off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The User wearing the Hahoe Mask snorted at the magician's response.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The magician sat on the floor with a mocking smile on his face. \u00a0Hyrkan stabbed his sword through the magician's chest. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After being stabbed by the sword, the magician fell backwards. \u00a0When the back of the magician touched the ground, the sword embedded itself deep into the ground. \u00a0The sword in the magician's chest took root.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the magician was pierced by the sword, he didn't react in any way. \u00a0He wasn't dead, but he was basically like a corpse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Forced Logout.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had the pleasure of watching the magician's death live, and the magician had given a token resistance. \u00a0Hyrkan gave him what he deserved.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poohk, poohk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He gave the body just enough damage that it would kill the magician. \u00a0He didn't abuse the corpse in anger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After finishing his hunt, Hyrkan immediately became a hyena. \u00a0He searched the magician's body then he took the wristwatch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He put the Items into the Black Box, which he had strapped on like a backpack. \u00a0A variety of consumable Items and four wristwatches was inside the box. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This brings the total number up to five.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan added the 5th wristwatch into the Black Box. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of moving on to his next target, he let out a long sigh. \u00a0It was the first time he had let one out since the mess had started.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sigh was like a comma that allowed him to take a breather from the commotion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Anugas made its appearance, everything had turned into a perfect shit storm. \u00a0The Big smiles and the Clover unit decided to spread out in all direction to catch Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had realized that a battle with Anugas was impossible. \u00a0A one-sided slaughter awaited them if they faced Anugas. \u00a0They came to this realization when 2 Strikers, who represented the Clover unit was killed, and RootBeer lost his left arm in his escape.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Afterwards, Hyrkan immediately recovered the Black Box he had left behind, and he flipped roles by becoming the hunter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan wasn't gracious enough to let go of opponents, who had messed with him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was something beyond being greedy for wristwatches and loots. \u00a0They dared to push Hyrkan into the brink of suffering a Game Over. \u00a0Hyrkan had to retaliate in such a way that they would never forget about crossing him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was time for him to end his quest for retribution.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I do more than this, I'll get caught by Anugas. \u00a0That'll be the end of me.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan checked the status of his magic. \u00a0Currently, his magical energy was recovering. \u00a0It meant that the open-eyed Anugas wasn't nearby.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this didn't mean Hyrkan could be at ease. \u00a0There was always the possibility of Anugas tracking him with its eye closed. \u00a0While its eye was closed, its Special Ability didn't activate. \u00a0Anugas' ability only manifested when it was about to appear in front of the target it tracked down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, it was too late when one's magic disappeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan clicked his tongue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is why I hate illusion type monsters.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Illusion Type.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a new type of monster, which appeared in the Black Continent, in the Ruined Kingdom Episode.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Illusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It is as the word said. \u00a0The body of the monster that one could see wasn't the real body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one delved deeper into the background story, one would find that these monsters were created artificially. \u00a0A dragon used its power in the distant past to create an army as a means to defeat an ancient kingdom. \u00a0Anugas was a member of the Dragon's army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Frost Knight and the Blaze Slime Dragon were similar type monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One of the biggest characteristic for this Illusion type monsters was the fact that they could ignore the constraints of terrains.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The most classic case of this feature being used was the Blaze Slime Dragon. \u00a0When the Blaze Slime Dragon was at a disadvantage, it gave up on its territory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the case of Anugas, it moved in a shape that others couldn't see, and it appeared only when a battle had started. \u00a0Moreover, there were those that could swim through the ground as if it was in an ocean, and some monsters could even ride a shadow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was obvious, but even if monsters had the same Spec, the difficulty level depended on the Illusion type monster's special characteristic. \u00a0The difference in difficulty could be night and day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, all the past experiences regarding hunting monsters were useless here. \u00a0If one exaggerated the situation a little bit, one could say the Users were facing a situation akin to what they faced in the beginning of the game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of it all, Anugas was the most difficult Illusion type Boss Monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Of all the monsters, why did Anugas have to show up? \u00a0I'm pretty sure it isn't suppose to come out at this point in the game.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan once again let out a sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't a sigh of relief that came from his life having been spared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah. \u00a0This is driving me nuts.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a sigh in regards to the horrible reality he would have to face.</span></p><br/><p>5.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018How could things get fucked up so badly?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair had received live reports as the events occurred. \u00a0When he once again summarized the situation, Sinclair was baffled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Were we unlucky? \u00a0Or was this also a ploy that was pulled off by the Hahoe Mask?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask was the biggest fish amongst the big fishes, and the opportunity to catch him was right in front of their noses. \u00a0He had thought it would be safe to say the fish had been caught. \u00a0Basically, the hook had been dislodged from the fish's mouth, and the only thing left was to take a commemorative photo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He received a live report stating RootBeer and the Hahoe Mask was exchanging blows, and the team was in position to attack. \u00a0Sinclair made a fist. \u00a0He had jumped the gun, and he had already started his victory ceremony. \u00a0He thought he had it in the bag.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was all ruined when the bastard called Anugas suddenly made an appearance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I know there are a lot of unreasonable monsters out there, but....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anugas had appeared alongside Hyrkan. \u00a0Sinclair spent more time in the game of Warlord than reality, yet he was having a hard time judging the capabilities of this monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It could hunt down its prey without showing any outward signs. \u00a0When it appeared, it \u00a0pretty much nullified the nearby Users' magic, magic recovery and the effects of the magic recovery Items. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had a terrifying Special Ability!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had been very fortunate in the fact that only 7 members from the Clover unit and Big Smiles guild members had died.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair was now able to organize his thoughts after seeing Anugas' Special Ability, yet he couldn't come up with a plan to defeat the monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018So this is what they meant when they coined the term Over Balancing......\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair had immediately sent a short report in regards to the Special Ability of Anugas to his superiors. \u00a0During their last exchange, he was ordered not to go after Anugas.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, even if he had been ordered not to do so, Sinclair wouldn\u2019t have wanted to fight this monster. \u00a0Moreover, Sinclair didn't think there was any User in Warlord, who could kill this monster. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even the Hahoe Mask had run away from Anugas. \u00a0Unfortunately, the Clover unit got caught up in this mess. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Sinclair's thoughts on what he would do changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To be precise, his orders had changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Still, this might be to my benefit.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He needed to research it further, but he had discerned that Anugas used the Heard Fortress as its base.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was only a conjecture, but there was a high probability that the Heard Fortress would become the first foothold within the Black Continent once Anugas was killed. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, the Black Continent will continue to be a harsh stage. \u00a0It won't allow the Users to progress in the game comfortably unless Anugas was killed. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, it seemed inevitable that the Users would become stalled in front of Anugas. \u00a0It would be the start to a gridlock.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In this process, the ones that would gain the most would be the 5 guilds, who were trying to monopolize the Black Continent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, the influence of the 5 guilds were absolute in the Black Continent. \u00a0In such a situation, Anugas would make this place a birdcage with no exit. Basically, the other Users in the Black Continent was like rats in a hole.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the rat he wanted to catch the most was within this hole.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018We've located the location of the Stormhunters guild. \u00a0For the near future, the Hahoe Mask will probably operate out of the newly opened region. If I want to catch him, I'll be able to.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had failed in catching the Hahoe Mask this time, but while Anugas was still alive, he'll be able to attack the Hahoe Mask as many time as he wanted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair had work to do now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Do you know the Watchman style?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahoe Mask's voice flowed out from the video at that moment. \u00a0It was a footage sent by a fallen User affiliated with the Clover unit. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this was all coincidences.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair put on a big frown when faced with such coincidences.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'll kill you no matter what, Hahoe Mask.\u2019</span></p><br/><p>6.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The coffee made by the capsule coffee machine was overflowing with flavor, yet he dropped grape candies into it. \u00a0Ahn-jaehyun brought the coffee cup to his mouth as he looked at the 6S V-Gear he purchased recently. \u00a0The machine was quite splendid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This item was many times more expensive than the security deposit of his one room apartment. \u00a0This caused the installation engineers, who had come to install the 6S Model V-Gear, look at him with great suspicion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFuck.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even as he looked at the V-Gear, cuss words roughly came out of his mouth. \u00a0Maybe it was thanks to the luxurious coffee, but his mouth was filled with the smell of coffee as he let out a torrent of swear words. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anh-jaehyun didn't have a deep understanding about the flavors of coffee, and he didn't have the presence of mind to pay attention to such things.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018How did everything get so tangled up?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun sipped his coffee. \u00a0His expression expressed more than anger. \u00a0It looked as if he was about to cry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reason being...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Catch it or be caught.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The position he found himself in right now was the cause of these emotions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the root of his worries was Anugas.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His life was saved thanks to Anugas. \u00a0However, he wasn't in a situation where he could celebrate this fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anugas had appeared as the boss of the Heard Fortress.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn't turn the Heard Fortress into a foothold until he killed Anugas. He had to kill the bastard, then he had to go to the ravine that was located beyond the Heard Fortress... \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he was successful, he would be able to walk past the Block Field .</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anugas wasn't simply a stumbling block. \u00a0It was an obstructor that prevented the Users from progressing along the road.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he wasn't able to catch Anugas, the group of Users on his tails would catch up to him. \u00a0Ahn-jaehyun would be caught.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to catch it or he\u2019ll be caught.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Why the hell is Anugas showing up at this point in time? \u00a0He shouldn't be out yet.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, Ahn-jaehyun hadn't been able to predict this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To his knowledge, Anugas appeared about 2 months after the Blaze Slime Dragon was caught. \u00a0At the time, the Users were near level 230 when they faced Anugas. \u00a0The Users were able to somewhat acclimatize to the Black Continent as they went through a big Spec Up using the 2nd Advancement and the Ancient Power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Despite all of this, it hadn't been easy to take down Anugas.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun could clearly remember the result.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Sweepers, Red Bulls and the Triple Wing.... \u00a0The three of them had to team up to take it down.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Sweepers guild boasted the strongest magical fire power amongst the 30 great guilds. \u00a0The Red Bull possessed many Tankers. \u00a0Then there was the Triple Wings, who possessed a massive number of guild members on par with the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0The combined forces of these 3 guilds failed twice, and the prior failed experiences were the foundation in how they succeeded in their third Raid attempt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Is it a Balancing error?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The appearance of Anugas meant the Warlord's game system thought this was the right time for this Boss Monster to show up right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From Ahn-jaehyun's perspective, it didn't make sense for it to show up right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Then there's the appearance of Frost and Fire, which are Mythos rank powers... \u00a0The events that should be happening couple months in the future are happening consecutively right now.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun shook his head from side to side, and his glasses went askew. \u00a0Ahn-jaehyun repositioned his glasses. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Ahn-jaehyun didn't have the luxury to worry and ponder about the Warlord's system.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The core issue hadn't change.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he wasn't able to catch Anugas, Hyrkan would be caught. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Who'll catch him? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He'll be caught by the 5 guilds, which included V&amp;V and the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask had already confirmed their intention with his body. \u00a0Moreover, he had felt the might of the people gunning for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Clover unit was strong. \u00a0If it hadn't been for Anugas, Ahn-jaehyun would be drinking alcohol instead of coffee right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, it would be impossible to operate in the Black Continent with Anugas on the loose. \u00a0The raw number of members brought over by the 5 guilds into the Black Continent was too much.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If someone else can catch it....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he could evade danger until someone else took down Anugas. \u00a0This was one of the options he could choose.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7but it is unlikely.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this wasn't the answer either.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One needed the 30 great guilds to step forward if one wanted others to catch Anugas. \u00a0However, there hadn't been many of 30 great guilds, who chose to enter the Black Continent right now. \u00a0Most of the forces in the Black Continent was from the 5 guilds, who had allied with each other. \u00a0The other 30 great guilds lost the motivation to cross when they saw the queue they\u2019ll have to wait out until they\u2019ll be able cross the Voodook's tunnel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The 5 guilds don't have the incentive to catch Anugas right now.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was actually beneficial for the 5 guilds to leave Anugas in place. \u00a0Their first mission would be to take out the Hahoe Mask and the Stormhunters guild, who will eventually become trouble in the future. \u00a0Moreover, they would be easier to catch than Anugas.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then there was the last option.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If it's the Stormhunters.....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Stormhunters guild also had some staying power here. \u00a0They had enough forces to attempt the Anugas raid, and they had enough power to have a chance of winning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If it's the crazy bitch, she would try it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of everything, the one leading the guild was the Storm Queen Shir. \u00a0Even Ahn-jaehyun considered her to be a crazy bitch. \u00a0If she had a bone to pick, she would fight even if the battle looked impossible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Ahn-jaehyun didn't consider the probability of her succeeding the Anugas Raid to be high. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unless Ahn-jaehyun told them how to clear this Raid, the probability of them succeeding was in the single digits.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFuck.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a cuss word came out again from Ahn-jaehyun's mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn\u2019t a cuss word that came out because the series of worries he had.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, it was an attempt for him to avoid reality.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun had only one answer he could choose.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Catch, or be Caught</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun didn't plan on being caught. \u00a0He'd rather die at the hand of Anugas than be killed by the 5 guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was only one answer left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis fucking game.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun started a simulation of the Anugas raid inside his head.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

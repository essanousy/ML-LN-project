All Stats will be decreased by 10%.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[After 19 minutes, you will get frost bites.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The powerful cold has swept over your armor, and the coldness will decrease its durability.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The powerful coldness has swept over you, and your senses have been dulled.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This had never been experience anywhere on Warlord before. \u00a0The intense cold was more terrifying than imagined. \u00a0In this terrifying cold, two Users were facing each other. \u00a0Sohank and Sinclair ignored the terrifying cold. \u00a0They held swords that was almost impossible to determine the market prices. \u00a0These expensive swords were pointed at each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was their second meeting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, their first meeting hadn't been under such a dire situation. \u00a0It had been a long time, since the two had met... \u00a0They met during the time when the combined level of both Users were barely over level 100. \u00a0It wasn't a long meeting. \u00a0They just knew about each other's reputation. \u00a0Since they were just curious about each other's reputation, they looked each other's face, and they parted after shaking hands. \u00a0That was it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There hadn't been any subsequent meetings. \u00a0Most of the 30 great guilds asked for help from the Hands guild, but the Hydra guild was firm in not negotiating with them. \u00a0Hydra guild put the most importance on gaining and protecting secrets. \u00a0Of course, this was the stance they would take.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even after such a long gap between their meetings, they didn't share any small talks. \u00a0They were in a situation where they had to kill each other. \u00a0They had no doubts in their hearts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Strikers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They always pierced through whatever that is in their way in the front lines. \u00a0They was no reason why they should pay attention to their surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They only had one task to do here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'll kill him.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'll end this.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had to find a way to kill the other User. \u00a0That was it.</span></p><br/><p>4.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was why this frozen land was so harsh. \u00a0There was no place to hide from the blizzard. \u00a0If one stayed still, one would receive a penalty. \u00a0Moreover, when one reached the point of getting frostbites, one's HP started to decrease. \u00a0If one wanted a true rest in this frozen land, one had to make a shelter with one's hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The method was unexpectedly easy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Igloo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One had to gather a lot of snow to make a mound, and one had to dig in like a rabbit. \u00a0The igloo was surprisingly snug.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Natal was within this snug space, and the felt disgusted at sharing the same space with the User next to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The new officer of the Big Smiles, Apollo....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo was standing next to Natal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I remember seeing his portrait, but I never thought he had such a skill.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To state the obvious, Natal wasn't in the same Igloo as the other man, because he liked the other User.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been about two week since the Hydra guild had crossed to the other side of the Terube castle. The Big Smiles guild was close on the Hydra guild's tail. \u00a0The two groups were within a distance that could be travelled within 24 hours. \u00a0It took 24 hours for the field to reset. \u00a0Basically, the Big Smiles guild was able to see the track left atop the snowfield. \u00a0The chase had basically ended there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018At a glance, he just looks like a greedy big....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The chase was pointless. \u00a0The only thing left to do was to fight. \u00a0This was why the two guilds agreed to a guild war.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The losing side would give up on exploring the Northland. \u00a0Each side would pick a champion, and everything would come down to a 1on1 battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn't anything special. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An all-out guild war.... \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the past, the Big Smiles and Triple Wing guild had put their existence on the line as they performed a guild war. \u00a0However, that kind of guild war rarely occurred. \u00a0However, the guild war that was occurring right now happened quite frequently between the 30 great guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn't make sense to fight an all-out battle for an owner-less mountain. \u00a0It was better to determine the owner of the owner-less mountain through a single combat. \u00a0This was the most profitable way to come to a decision. \u00a0At the same time, if the 30 great guilds shed their bloods to claim ownership of this mountain, a third party would be reticent to object to the result. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the deal was made, everyone except the combatants moved far away from the battle site. \u00a0If one watched the battle from up close, it would just increase the probability of something disgraceful happening.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Above all else, this was a courtesy given to one's opponents. \u00a0There would be no recordings allowed for this battle. \u00a0This wasn't for personal glory. \u00a0This was a fight for one's organization. \u00a0There was no reason to clap for the winner, and there was no reason why they should console the loser. \u00a0The only thing that needed to be recorded was the result of the fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I never expected him to be a genius tracker.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Natal wasn't thinking about the guild war, Sohank or Sinclair. \u00a0He was thinking about Apollo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, when Natal received the portrait, he hadn't even known that Apollo was an officer of Big Smiles. \u00a0Moreover, he didn't want to waste space in remembering him. \u00a0According to the information gathered by the Hydra guild, he wasn't anything special. \u00a0He could be ignored.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, a pursuit team led by Apollo had caught up to the Hydra guild in just a week.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Natal was shocked when he saw the Big Smiles' guild symbol on Sinclair's chest, but the more surprising part was the fact that they had been tracked down so quickly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm guessing you are a new officer.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Natal had created this space.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to find out if Apollo is the genius tracker or maybe it's someone else.... \u00a0I have to find this out.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sohank was fighting for his guild with his life on the line, so of course, Natal had to use his own method to fight for his guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no way Apollo knew what Natal was thinking. \u00a0Instead of an answering, Apollo smirked as he slightly nodded his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo was overbearing as he sneered at Natal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Does he have something?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His smile made Natal nervous. \u00a0Natal was Hydra guild's Eight Head. \u00a0The User in front of him was a new face to the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0His position and reputation was all relatively new. \u00a0There was no reason why Apollo should be looking at him in such an overbearing manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In other words, there was a high chance that something allowed Apollo to act in this overbearing manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Natal didn't get mad. \u00a0He just continued the conversation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour skill is great. \u00a0I can't believe you guys were able to track us down. \u00a0There had been a great distance between us.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI just chased after someone that was very careless with his pouch. \u00a0I wouldn\u2019t call that as having a great skill. \u00a0It wasn't hard at all.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After saying those words, Apollo overtly sneered at Natal. \u00a0There was no deep reason behind his smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Hydra guild isn't that great.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo was able to raise his nose high into the air with impunity against a Head of the Hydra guild. \u00a0It felt awesome.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Careless with one's pouch?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Natal had the opposite reaction when he heard Apollo's words. \u00a0From Natal's disordered thoughts, a new suspicion was starting to build.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Perhaps?\u2019 \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ongoing blizzard was colorless.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ongoing blizzard looked drab.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of the white snowfield, Sohank and Sinclair was fighting a fierce battle. The snowfield was being greatly disturbed. \u00a0Sword Energies was sent forth every time the Cool Time ended. \u00a0The Sword Energies had the power to demolish the ground. \u00a0No matter how severe this land was, it was impossible to maintain its pristine condition when the sword strikes impacted on the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The harsh lands couldn't stand up against the sword strikes, and of course, the armors worn by the two Users couldn't be in a good state after facing such attacks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the very least, the armors were maintaining its original shape. \u00a0The continuous attacks had laid bare the two Users' arms and shoulders. \u00a0It was hard to call those parts as being armored. \u00a0The helmets were also dented and split open.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the swords they held were fine.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Both Users had the best weapons one could acquire. \u00a0They didn't care if they fought with no armor! \u00a0This was the resolve that befitted the two of the greatest Strikers in Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the part that was tormenting them the most wasn't the damage inflicted by others.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You are frostbitten. \u00a0Your health will quickly deteriorate.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[In 10 minutes, you will be in a critical condition from the frostbite.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The coldness will start dominating your body. \u00a0All Stats have decreased by 20%. \u00a0Your movements have slowed.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These wounds could easily be resolved by a Priest's Buff and Heal Skill. \u00a0However, without the administration of a Priest, the prior wounds were turning into critical wounds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the two had promised beforehand. \u00a0They agreed not to use any consumables.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There are too many variables changing on this stage. \u00a0Nothing good will come from taking my time.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I shouldn't wait for luck to shift towards me. \u00a0I have to end this with my skill.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two didn't want to lean on luck. \u00a0They wanted to resolve this using their own skills. \u00a0This was evidence that they were confident in their skills. \u00a0At the same time, if luck was on the other\u2019s side, it would mean the other User had no chance of winning. \u00a0This was the evidence of how much pressure was on them. \u00a0One could never predict as to who the Lady Luck will smile on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The battle continued as no one could easily seize the victory, and they were close to reaching their limits. \u00a0They unconsciously started wishing for luck to be on their side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I don't care what it is. \u00a0I want you to make a mistake.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I can't lose here no matter what.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, luck favored one side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lady Luck smiled on Sinclair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were swinging their sword, and the sound of steel rang out as their swords collided with each other. \u00a0Then a goosebump inducing sound like grinding teeth was heard. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggee-dook ggeee-dook!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sohank was starting to be pushed backwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why was he being pushed back? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of questioning his fortune, Sinclair let out a mighty shout, and he started pressing \u00a0harder against Sohank. \u00a0Sohank's arms flew backwards without him willing it to do so, and Sohank's chest was revealed. \u00a0Sinclair executed a Body Slam.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggwah-gwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying the loud sound, Sohank fell over backwards. \u00a0Sinclair stepped on the chest of the fallen Sohank. \u00a0He didn't make any small talks. \u00a0Sinclair reversed his sword, and he brought it down. \u00a0The sword headed towards Sohank's chest region.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggee-ee-ee! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The armor let out a sharp sound. \u00a0It was the sound of steel being cut.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poohk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One could here the flesh being pierced.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When an expert reached their limits, one critical blow was enough to end the User.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I won.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sohank suffered a Game Over. \u00a0The first one to realized this was Sinclair, and at that moment, he was satisfied.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Finally, glory is in my hands.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The satisfaction he felt was appropriate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had fought and won against a tough opponent. \u00a0Moreover, it allowed him to achieve something he always wanted. \u00a0He had suffered, and fought hard to feel this senses of satisfaction. \u00a0Of course, he was content.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This feeling of contentment stole the tension from Sinclair's body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It's cold.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He hadn't felt the cold before, but now he felt it. \u00a0It was as if his skin was being cut... \u00a0No, it wasn't that cold. \u00a0Still, it was cold enough that it didn't feel good.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair turned his head to look at the raging blizzard. \u00a0When he pierced through this blizzard, he would return to where everyone had stayed behind. \u00a0He thought about the glory that would unfold in front of him. There was a smile around Sinclair's lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the sight in front of Sinclair's eyes darkened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You have died.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Sinclair's world became dyed in black, he heard that short phrase.</span></p><br/><p>6.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Two piece of news was delivered to both Natal and Apollo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Natal received an apology from Sohank. \u00a0Apollo received a message from Sinclair saying he's been ambushed by someone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they received those messages, both of them smashed through the igloo at the same time. \u00a0Natal gritted his teeth when he came out into the blizzard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018We lost everything.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sohank had lost. \u00a0\u00a0Now the Hydra guild will have to retreat from this frozen land. \u00a0They'll have to return to the Terube castle wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They would be returning without gaining anything! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Natal thought about the time he had invested for this exploration quest. \u00a0It wasn't a loss that he could just get over after being sick to the stomach. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEveryone gather!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo was swept up in his rage. \u00a0At Apollo's shout, the Big Smiles guild members gathered around him. \u00a0Apollo shouted as if he wanted Natal to hear it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow dare you screw me over!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Natal had become despondent, so he was having a hard time understanding Apollo's reaction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe won the match! \u00a0So why did you take revenge on him?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Natal thought for a brief moment when he heard Apollo's question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In such a volatile situation, Natal didn't have much time to think. \u00a0Moreover, the questions he could ask at this moment was limited. \u00a0Natal worked his brain hard in that short amount of time to come up with the most forthright and effective question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs Sinclair dead?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you plan on dodging the blame!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo's rage allowed the disarticulated thoughts inside Natal's head to start piecing itself together like puzzle pieces. \u00a0The thoughts inside his head started finding its old pattern.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha ha.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Natal couldn't help, but laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other side, Apollo was getting ready to immediately start a small guild war. \u00a0It had been a one on one battle. \u00a0They had won fair and square, yet a third combatant had interfered. \u00a0Now Sinclair was dead. \u00a0Apollo couldn't stand idly by.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the atmosphere was getting harsh, Natal swallowed the sneer he was about to direct toward Apollo, and he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt wasn't us.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of answering, Apollo glared at Natal. \u00a0When they heard Apollo's words, the Big Smiles guild members took out their weapons, and they started their Magic Casting. \u00a0As if they sensed something was about to go down, the Hydra guild started getting ready for battle too.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEven if we had lost, we wouldn't have been such an underhanded losers like you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere's the proof?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cProof?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Natal retorted with a question to Apollo's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you have proof that we attacked Sinclair?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you look at the circumstances\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou made a judgement after seeing only the circumstances. \u00a0You only have circumstantial evidence yet you are willing to break the deal by attacking us?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At this point, Apollo closed his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll say it again. \u00a0I accept our defeat. \u00a0The Hydra guild will pull out of the Northland.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo's thoughts became complicated as Natal continued to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The victor, Sinclair, \u00a0had died from a sudden ambush. \u00a0If one looked at the circumstances, the probability of the Hydra guild being behind the plot was high. \u00a0Apollo determined the probability to be 99 percent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, the Hydra guild had just admitted defeat, and they were going to pull out of here. \u00a0It would be foolish to ignore the previous deal to attack the Hydra guild first. \u00a0It would be a burdensome act.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, their victory wouldn\u2019t be guaranteed by attacking first. \u00a0It was a situation where the two guilds had lost their Ace Cards, and none of the other cards could guarantee a victory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Apollo had achieved the desired result.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I gained what I came here to gain.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had carried out a guild war against the Hydra guild, and he had won. \u00a0Apollo's standing within Big Smiles guild would change after this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In such a situation, he didn't want to force the issue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Did they really not do this??\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he still had questions. \u00a0If the Hydra guild hadn't lashed out from their loss, then who killed Sinclair? \u00a0Sinclair had been clear in his message. \u00a0He said he had been ambushed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was he attacked by a monster? \u00a0Or was there really a third party?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Natal was the one that resolved Apollo's worries.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe'll find the answer when we get to the place where the two had fought.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo yelled out instead of answering him. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStand down!\u201d</span></p><br/><p>7.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the fierce battle died down, the battlefield started to be covered by snow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why when the Hydra guild and Big Smiles guild arrived at their destination, they could barely see the traces left behind by the battle. \u00a0Instead, they saw the two corpses lying next to each other, and someone was standing over them like a guardian.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a single User\u2026\u2026 He was wearing leather clothes lined with white fur. \u00a0In the blizzard, it was hard to make him out. \u00a0However, Natal knew who this User was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It's the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0Yes, if it was the Hahoe Mask....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was only one User that would conspire against the 30 great guilds by himself. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho are you!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One didn't need to ask the question asked by Apollo if one had a decent head above their shoulders. \u00a0One would be able to assess the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time we've seen each other. \u00a0It'll be more convenient for me if you are a little bit more quick on the uptake.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahoe Mask?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as Natal had surmised. \u00a0The User in front of his eyes was the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask had set this up. \u00a0When he saw Sinclair with the Big Smiles, Hyrkan wanted them to fight Sohank and the Hydra guild. \u00a0It worked out better than expected. \u00a0They readily fought each other, and they died easier than he had expected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At this point, Apollo and Natal diverged in their actions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow dare you, Hahoe Mask! \u00a0Do you think you'll be fine after you meddled against the Big Smiles?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo raged.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, Natal thought over the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He didn't really have to reveal his role in this. \u00a0The fact that he revealed himself.... \u00a0He plans on taking further action.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of facing the conflicted Natal, Hyrkan dealt with the raging Apollo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don't have a good relationship with Big Smiles. \u00a0Moreover, didn't you try to fuck me over in the past? \u00a0Now I see you were from the Big Smiles.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's finger was pointing at Cho-oohroong. \u00a0It was impossible to see his face, since Cho-oohroong was wearing his helmet. \u00a0However, Cho-oohroon unconsciously turned his gaze away when Hyrkan pointed at him. \u00a0It was to be expected. \u00a0There was something to feel guilty about.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's finger slightly moved to point at Apollo. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI also

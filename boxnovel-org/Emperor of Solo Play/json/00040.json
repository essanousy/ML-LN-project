It was never the case that one of the two were much higher than the other. Even so, this did not mean that they distributed the stat points from level up equally. If so, down the line, they would only be suited for PKs.</p><br/><p>Typically, players chose either the strength or stamina stat to focus most of their stat points, then filled the other stat point through items.</p><br/><p>In the case of Join, he chose stamina with his level up stat points and strength with his item choices.</p><br/><p>Join\u2019s current stamina stat was 149.</p><br/><p>That was enough to determine the outcome of this match.</p><br/><p>Crash!</p><br/><p>Hyrkan\u2019s hammer struck Join\u2019s helmet like a bell. Join staggered, during which time Hyrkan\u2019s Skeleton Warrior struck him with its hammer. Join\u2019s body flew up in the air, then landed on the ground with a thud.</p><br/><p>\u2018Shit.\u2019</p><br/><p>Join got up from the ground slowly. He felt his body heavier than ever before.</p><br/><p>\u2018He even knows curses.\u2019</p><br/><p>Demon Curse and Slow Curse.</p><br/><p>These two curses were currently hindering Join. He felt as if he was wearing shackles on both his hands and feet.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who is he?\u2019</p><br/><p>Not to mention, the magician that was supposed to help him was long dead. When Skeleton Warriors suddenly jumped on Int, he had no way of avoiding and death was inevitable. Although magicians were strong, that was it. His magic had dealt a fair bit of damage to one of the Skeleton Warriors, but the other ones didn\u2019t miss the opening created after his attack. It was Game Over with just one swing. Once a magician fell down, he didn\u2019t have enough stamina to sustain being hit continuously.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Join did not despair, but rather considered his opponent\u2019s strength once more.</p><br/><p>\u2018A necromancer with 4 skeletons. He raised strength and is also a curse magician.\u2019</p><br/><p>He knew his role in this situation. There was no chance of him escaping alive. His allies had already begun fighting the Golden Skeleton. What he had to do now was to deliver as much as information as possible to his allies.</p><br/><p>Join raised his sword.</p><br/><p>Watching this, Hyrkan charged towards Join.</p><br/><p>Before the distance closed, Join turned his sword horizontally to slash at Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>Before that\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBooster!\u201d</p><br/><p>He used a skill.</p><br/><p>The moment the skill was used, Join\u2019s sword moved with incredible speed, just like the sword had a booster attached to its hilt.</p><br/><p>Whoosh!</p><br/><p>Even so, Join\u2019s sword only slashed through thin air. Hyrkan had lowered his body and dodged the attack. Immediately afterwards, Hyrkan swung his hammer at Join\u2019s knee.</p><br/><p>Crack!</p><br/><p>Join\u2019s knee made a strange sound before his body spun a full circle and landed in place.</p><br/><p>While he was staring into the sky feeling dizzy\u2026</p><br/><p>Crash!</p><br/><p>A hammer slammed down his face.</p><br/><p>Crash crash!</p><br/><p>It rained down endlessly.</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>-We got taken out.</p><br/><p>When the message from the Joint duo came, the Golden Skeleton hunting team was already in action.</p><br/><p>They had no choice.</p><br/><p>Their two priests had already used their buffs and their strongest magician had already finished casting his strongest spell. Most importantly, the Golden Skeleton was in front of their eyes.</p><br/><p>Giving up and going back at this point was\u2026 something they couldn\u2019t afford to do.</p><br/><p>In the end, two swordsmen led the way while the magician supported them from the back. Meanwhile, one of the priests talked to the already dead Joint duo using the voice talk program.</p><br/><p>-He\u2019s not normal. Even though he\u2019s a necromancer, both he and his summons are strong. It seems we fell into his trap.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrap?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Otherwise, why would someone so strong pretend to be a weakling? The one he was fighting wasn\u2019t a monster, but his own summon.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Trap.</p><br/><p>The priest wasn\u2019t surprised. He only thought what was meant to happen, happened.</p><br/><p>\u2018I knew this would happen.\u2019</p><br/><p>Dead Woods was a hunting ground for level 30+ players. Players who were above level 30 at this point in the game were people who spent a fair amount of money in the game. They weren\u2019t the kind to sit back and do nothing when they were PKed without reason. Without a doubt they would surely try to get revenge. Because of this, PKs generally only worked at levels 10s and 20s. Past that, there was a huge risk involved. If one didn\u2019t find great joy in PKs, most opted to do PvP, a fair 1v1 dual.</p><br/><p>Of course, there was no way the Golden Skeleton hunting team didn\u2019t know this. That was why they placed so much emphasis on ending this early. Once they finished what they wanted to do and left, there was lesser chance of receiving retaliation. Their faces weren\u2019t filmed, and they could simply change what they were wearing. It\u2019s not like there were security cameras or finger print scanners.</p><br/><p>However, it seemed that one of their victims had a strong backing. They didn\u2019t think someone so skilled would come in such short period of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure it was just one person?\u201d</p><br/><p>-Just one. No one else.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne person\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other hand, it seemed that the victim could only find one person in such short amount of time.</p><br/><p>This fact made the priest unsure.</p><br/><p>\u2018If it\u2019s just one, maybe we can deal with him.\u2019</p><br/><p>If a group of players came, they would have no choice but to run away. But with just one, it was a different story.</p><br/><p>Of course, Join\u2019s thoughts were different.</p><br/><p>-I\u2019m telling you, he\u2019s not normal. You guys should take care of him first before you get to the Golden Skeleton.</p><br/><p>The priest refused Join\u2019s suggestion.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we miss the Golden Skeleton today, we\u2019ll have to try again tomorrow. By that time, there will be more people after us.\u201d</p><br/><p>If they wanted to kill the Golden Skeleton, now was the time. They had delayed it long enough. Any more would be too risky.</p><br/><p>-But\u2026</p><br/><p>Join knew this as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust tell me how he looks like again.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Alright.</p><br/><p>Join decided not to continue with his suggestion. He was already in Game Over state, and he had no choice but to hope for his allies to succeed.</p><br/><p>Everyone else agreed as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to do it, we have to do it now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said it was just one, right? Even if he comes here, I\u2019ll just take the aggro, and everyone else can pounce on him. It won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s hurry up and finish.\u201d</p><br/><p>They knew that if they couldn\u2019t kill it today, it was better to leave Dead Woods.</p><br/><p>The Golden Skeleton hunt started in such a way and went on as if the two missing people weren\u2019t needed.</p><br/><p>All members were at their maximum concentration, and they were already experienced in dealing with the Golden Skeleton. Because of it, they were able to coordinate well with each other.</p><br/><p>Above all, the one they had been wary of never came. Not even skeletons and Skeleton Warriors, which often arrived after hearing the commotion, showed up. The Golden Skeleton hunting team could put all their energy and focus onto the Golden Skeleton.</p><br/><p>As a result\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cGet ready to chase!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s phase 2!\u201d</p><br/><p>They were quickly able to lower the Golden Skeleton\u2019s HP to half.</p><br/><p>Once the Golden Skeleton\u2019s HP dropped to half, the Golden Skeleton dropped aggro and ran away as fast as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cCatch it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let it escape this time!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was why it was so hard to hunt a Golden Skeleton. If the Golden Skeleton went out of vision, the game system decided that it had successfully escaped. In that case, the hunters would have to wait another day.</p><br/><p>The Golden Skeleton hunting team had already failed two times. They didn\u2019t want to fail a third time. Experienced from its last two escapes, they didn\u2019t blindly chase after it. They set up a formation and moved accordingly.</p><br/><p>Swordsmen, magicians, and priests all took part in the chase.</p><br/><p>The five moved as one.</p><br/><p>And\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s finally starting. They did better than I thought they would.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan, who had been hiding and watching, made his move.</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to get an apology.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the Golden Skeleton hunting team successfully caught up with the Golden Skeleton, they couldn\u2019t help but yell in excitement.</p><br/><p>Once the pursuers caught up with the Golden Skeleton, it stopped running and fought back. At this point, finishing it off wasn\u2019t too big of a problem.</p><br/><p>However, a strange player suddenly appeared in a strange getup, wearing a strange mask, while saying strange things. The Golden Skeleton hunting team stood dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>They had already received a report.</p><br/><p>The Joint duo told them about Hyrkan\u2019s characteristics, and they weren\u2019t the ones to be forgotten so easily either. They had even made a plan to remove him if he appeared.</p><br/><p>Even so, they couldn\u2019t help but be shocked by the absurd thing Hyrkan was saying.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan repeated his words at the two priests standing in the back.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour acts of bad manner have not gone unnoticed. Countless players have been PKed by you already. I\u2019m here to get an apology.\u201d</p><br/><p>He continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to cause a ruckus. All I want is an apology, a sincere one. I also want you to return the watches of all the players you PKed. That is all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyrkan\u2019s polite and composed words were undoubtedly just. Since they PKed, he wanted them to apologize and to return the watches! There was nothing unfair about it.</p><br/><p>However, for the ones hearing it\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018The fuck is he saying?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Is he messing with us?\u2019</p><br/><p>It was complete nonsense.</p><br/><p>It was so absurd that their faces were frozen in stupefaction.</p><br/><p>When Hyrkan finished his speech, everyone snapped back. They opened their mouths to prepare for action.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long can you last alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine for 2 or 3 minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and come back in 3 minutes. That guy\u2019s nuts.\u201d</p><br/><p>To fight, a swordsman had to lead. Although he was alone, he was a necromancer who had skeletons at his disposal. They couldn\u2019t just fight him with magicians and priests.</p><br/><p>As such, one of the swordsman fighting the Golden Skeleton turned back to face Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the other swordsman attacked the Golden Skeleton to draw aggro to himself.</p><br/><p>The swordsman raised his sword up high and charged at the Golden Skeleton.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrash!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the swordsman yelled out, his sword lit up.</p><br/><p>Shining Sword.</p><br/><p>The Golden Skeleton swung its own sword towards this sword, and the two swords clashed.</p><br/><p>Crash!</p><br/><p>Rather than the sound of metal, a sound of explosion rang out.</p><br/><p>In the midst of that explosion, the Golden Skeleton was clearly eyeing the swordsman.</p><br/><p>\u201cI got the aggro!\u201d</p><br/><p>Having succeeded in drawing the aggro, the swordsman shouted out. Meanwhile, the two priests quickly ran back, away from Hyrkan. It was the most basic of basics to aim for the priests first.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the swordsman that had turned back stood between Hyrkan and the two priests. He immediately swung his sword at Hyrkan. Horizontally, vertically, diagonally\u2026 he slashed at him without any delay.</p><br/><p>Whoosh, whoosh!</p><br/><p>The sound of air being cut continued to ring out in Hyrkan\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, just buy time. I\u2019ll send a hot one flying over soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The magician, of course, began casting his magic. It wasn\u2019t a strong one, but one that could be casted quickly. If need be, he would risk losing the swordsman to finish Hyrkan off. After all, they were up against just one person, and the Golden Skeleton hunting team had two priests.</p><br/><p>At this, Hyrkan gave one final warning.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just need an apology. If you do this, I will have no choice but to retaliate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, there was no response to his warning. There was no need to.</p><br/><p>At the same time\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018How is this guy dodging so well?\u2019</p><br/><p>The swordsman couldn\u2019t help but be surprised as he watched Hyrkan dodge all his attacks with the slightest movement. He could even afford to blabber.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the magician\u2019s report, the swordsman looked for a timing.</p><br/><p>\u201cBooster!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he used an attack speed boosting skill.</p><br/><p>Whish!</p><br/><p>The heavy sound of the sword quickly turned sharp. At the same time, the magician grabbed a hold of a heavy fireball. He estimated the distance between them as he prepared to throw.</p><br/><p>At that moment\u2026</p><br/><p>Clack, clack!</p><br/><p>A horned Skeleton Warrior wearing Bone Armor began to charge towards the magician like a bull.</p><br/><p>Watching this, one of the priests quickly arrived next to the magician and held his palms out.</p><br/><p>\u201cLight Shield!\u201d</p><br/><p>A tent-sized barrier surrounded him and the magician. The Skeleton Warrior swung its hammer toward the shield.</p><br/><p>At the same time\u2026</p><br/><p>Whish!</p><br/><p>The magician threw his fireball at his ally and Hyrkan without hesitation. The fireball made a perfect parabola as it began to fall toward Hyrkan\u2019s back. Then\u2026</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>The fireball exploded and fire shards exploded out in all directions.</p><br/><p>\u201cShit!\u201d</p><br/><p>A scream was heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound came from the swordsman who had been keeping the Golden Skeleton\u2019s aggro.</p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

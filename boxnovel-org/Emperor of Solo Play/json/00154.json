Ruins (1)</span></p><br/><p>1.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When one entered Voodook's tunnel, nervousness and fear was usually intermixed with the thick fog. \u00a0However, when one exits the Voodook's tunnel, it felt as if all those feelings were let go. \u00a0This was why when Users exited the Voodook's tunnel, they looked as if couple screws were loose in their heads.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the six Users that had exited the Voodook's tunnel right now was different. \u00a0There wasn't a single ounce of looseness in their expression or atmosphere. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead, it was quite apparent that a feeling of tension had replaced the looseness. \u00a0One could feel the tension emanating from them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Users were still hanging around the exit of the Voodook's tunnel for various reason, and they naturally they became curious when they saw the six Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What is up with their expressions?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Six Users? \u00a0Did a party member die?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018They entered with seven. \u00a0They did above average if six survived. \u00a0At the very least, two or three people usually die in there.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Wait a moment? \u00a0I don't see any traces of a fight.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one wanted to survive in Warlord, one had to be quick on the uptake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All of the Users here that had caught the Skull Collector and exited Voodook's tunnel were experts at survival. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why they were suspicious of this new group that had exited. \u00a0The quick-thinking Users were moving closer to satiate their suspicion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, their doubts were washed away when they saw the final figure that had appeared behind the tense group of 6 party members. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It's the Hahoe Mask!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The rumors that said the Hahoe Mask was attempting the Urugal mountain range hadn\u2019t been spread throughout the world, but the news had spread to most of the Users present at the Urugal mountain range.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the information was precise. \u00a0If one wanted to find out about it, one could easily dig up when the Hahoe Mask had entered the Voodook's tunnel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why the Users in front of the exit of the Voodook' tunnel could quickly make the calculations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It took them only 30 minutes to pass through the Voodook's Tunnel.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018My god. \u00a0It would take a skilled party one hour to clear it, yet he cut the time in half.....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He is monster amongst monsters.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Voodook's tunnel took about 1 hour to clear for a skilled party, yet he had come out in 30 minutes. \u00a0He had cut the time in half. \u00a0The Users were filled with admiration, jealousy and other emotions. \u00a0These emotions were infused in their gazes as they headed towards the Hahoe Mask like arrows.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the Hahoe Mask wasn't interested in the other 6 party members any more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After observing his surrounding, Hahoe Mask's gaze headed towards the top of the Urugal mountain range. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask just stood there staring at the summit, so several Users followed his gaze to see what he was looking at.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Does he plan on catching the owner of the Urugal mountain range?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Is he really going to do it by himself?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a different type of tension emanated from the Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The owner of the Urugal mountain range was the Blaze Slime Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were a lot of nicknames attributed to the Blaze Slime Dragon by the Users. \u00a0Amongst the nicknames, the one that stuck in the head of everyone was the Strongest Boss Monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this was a controversial topic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was the Frost Knight, which was defeated by the Hahoe Mask, more difficult? \u00a0Or was the Blaze Slime Dragon, which was defeated by the Stormhunters guild, more difficult to take down? \u00a0The participants of the Raids were excluded from the discussion as the debate started, and it was surprisingly fierce. \u00a0People started exchanging numbers that would make an engineer's eyes spin to support their arguments. \u00a0At the end of the debate, Blaze Slime Dragon was crowned as being the current Strongest Boss Monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the Blaze Slime Dragon was hunted down using the full might of the Stormhunters guild, so the Hahoe Mask was seen as the superior player. \u00a0After the Hahoe Mask and the Stormhunters guild, no Raid team had been successful in taking down the Frost Knight or the Blaze Slime Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In such a situation, what would happen if the Hahoe Mask took down the Blaze Slime Dragon? \u00a0What would this implicate?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be indisputable. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask would become the strongest existence in Warlord at this current stage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wouldn't just be equal to the 30 great guilds. \u00a0He would be seen as being more powerful than the 30 great guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Is he really going to attempt it?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If it is the Hahoe Mask.... \u00a0He'll be able to do it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, it was a very foolhardy thing to do, but there was one person that nonchalantly did the impossible in Warlord. \u00a0It was the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hyrkan wasn't going to fulfill their expectations. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan wasn't looking at the summit of the Urugal mountain for this reason.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'm glad I don't have to catch that bastard.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Relief. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, he was thankful for the fact that he could get past the Urugal mountain range without fighting the Blaze Slime Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he had to kill it, he would have done it. \u00a0The killing of the Blaze Slime Dragon was a must if he wanted to get across the Urugal mountain. \u00a0However, the Stormhunters guild had killed it, so they had already paved the way for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, the Stormhunters guild got all the benefit from being the first one to kill the Blaze Slime Dragon. \u00a0Of course, Hykran would be able to make a lot of money from killing the Blaze slime Dragon by selling various parts. \u00a0However, the Titles that came with killing it first....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wouldn't be able to gain the Titles like the Dragon Slayer title. \u00a0On the other hand, he would be able to gain a lot of money from the Raid footage. \u00a0Then there was the Ingredients that allowed one to make level 200 Unique Items. \u00a0There were still a lot of potential for profit here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It isn\u2019t a bad idea to catch it, but there\u2019s no need to rush it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, he would have to take a risk that was as large as the benefits he would gain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn\u2019t an ordinary risk. \u00a0\u00a0This was evident in the fact that 14 teams challenged the Blaze Slime Dragon when it respawned after 10 days. \u00a0However, none had succeeded in killing the dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These weren\u2019t just mediocre players. \u00a0These were expert players that had easily gotten past the Skull Collector. \u00a0\u00a0Even these types of Users were having a hard time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be the same for Hyrkan. \u00a0No, in some ways, the Blaze Slime Dragon was a poor opponent for Hyrkan. \u00a0Enemies like the Frost Knight was easier for Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was well aware of this fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There\u2019s no point in hanging around the entrance.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Urugal mountain range was a door.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A door had meaning only if one got past it. \u00a0The safe itself wasn\u2019t the price. \u00a0It was meaningful only if one obtain what was across the other side of the safe\u2019s door.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Hyrkan started to walk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Users saw him move, they immediately typed posts online.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hahoe Mask will challenge the Blaze Slime Dragon!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A new rumor regarding Hyrkan formed at that moment.</span></p><br/><p>2.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Stormhunter guild killed the Blaze Slime Dragon, any Users that passed the Voodook's tunnel could cross the Urugal mountain range.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Users were able to reach the land across the Urugal mountain range, and they called this place the Black Continent. \u00a0\u00a0They attempted this location wanting to be a trailblazer. \u00a0\u00a0The Users were able to earn Items above level 200 here, and they wanted to find new monsters. \u00a0Then there was the clues regarding the third Main Scenario Quest. \u00a0They wanted to find a hunting ground that was the land of milk and honey.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were the words spoke by these Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe don't have to to complain. \u00a0Run!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf this wasn't the Black Continent, I would have stood my ground and fight!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJust run!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Black Continent was hell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The lowest level monsters here were level 200. \u00a0This land was crawling with level 200 and up monsters, and it was a bit too much for Users that had just reached level 200 not too long ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, the penalty given to Users from dying was greatly increased in the Black Continent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In Warlord, there were various penalties that were given to the Users, but the biggest penalty was being shut out from the game for 48 hours. \u00a0This penalty was still present.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the Black Continent didn't have a Restart Point. \u00a0It was the locations where the Users would respawn.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one died here, one would immediately sent back to the other side of the Urugal mountain!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the result of failing here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That wasn't the only problem. \u00a0There weren\u2019t any place to rest here, and there were no markets where one could trade Items. \u00a0Inevitably, one had to hunt monsters to get ingredients, and one had to make one\u2019s own consumable Items. \u00a0Since no one knew which monsters gave ingredients to magical and health recovery consumables, it was impossible to produce the consumables.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, this place was hell! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, if one wanted to survive in \u00a0hell, one had to become a devil.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The first group of Users that attempted to become devils were the Stormhunters guild. \u00a0They were the one that had opened the door to this place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCurrently, we've brought over a total of 157 members. \u00a0We decided to rotate our playing time, so we divided everyone into 4 teams. \u00a0I sent you the the roster for the 4 teams. \u00a0I e-mailed it to you yesterday.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Shir saw the Hahoe Mask's Frozen Kingdom movie, she made a bold decision. \u00a0After finishing their 2nd Advancement, she brought 157 guild members to the Black Continent. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It hadn't been an easy feat. There were a lot of tasks that needed to be finished for the Users over level 200. \u00a0Moreover, the Stormhunters guild possessed a lot of programs on their live channel. \u00a0If they wanted to broadcast a variety of contents, skilled Users had to be assigned to do a wide range of tasks. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had brought most of them here, so for a while, the guild wouldn't be able to produce meaningful contents. \u00a0The Stormhunters would suffer huge loss in this process. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had made the decision in spite of this. \u00a0If they wanted to survive in the Black Continent, they needed a force of this size.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI think we've located a Dungeon.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only thing left was to find a place where they could permanently reside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In Warlord, one wasn't safe just from building a wall or a wooden fence. \u00a0The most important part was to find a place where monsters didn't regenerate. \u00a0This was why towns or castles were used as waypoints for Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, they hadn't been able to find such a location in the Black Continent. \u00a0There weren't any castles or towns.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Hatch had come up with the idea of finding a Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unexpectedly, the Instance Dungeons possessed similar qualities as towns and castles. \u00a0A good number of Instance Dungeons prevented Regeneration.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was an unexpected consequence of a game mechanic they could take advantage of.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If there were invisible walls that were caging in a pack of wild beasts, one wouldn\u2019t be safe standing in front of them. \u00a0However, the surrounding region would be the safest place to be.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSince we found one, I hope it's a real Dungeon.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the best thing for them was to find a real Dungeon instead of an Instance Dungeon. \u00a0The real Dungeons were single use Dungeons. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they could find a single use Dungeon, it would be the end of their search.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as the word implied. \u00a0The single use Dungeon didn't regenerate monsters after it was cleared. \u00a0It was the ultimate shelter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, single use Dungeons were located in hard to find places. \u00a0Even the monsters would have a hard time finding the location. \u00a0Basically, it was a fortress bless with natural barriers </span><span style=\"\">for defense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the Stormhunters guild wanted to overtake the Black Continent, they needed such a place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, there was someone else here that knew better than anyone as to the benefit of such a location.</span></p><br/><p>3.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Where is it? \u00a0Where is it?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A User was busily moving his head from side to side as he looked at his surrounding. \u00a0Hyrkan yelled out when he caught sight of a golden glint.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere it is! \u00a0Catch it!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if reacting to his words, the Skeleton Warriors in the surrounding started to move. \u00a0Hyrkan also started running towards this golden being.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018You son of a bitch! \u00a0I'll catch you this time no matter what!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been two days since he had climbed over the peak of the Urugal mountain range.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The world was waiting for Hyrkan to catch the Slime Dragon for the past two days, but Hyrkan was actually using his time to chase after the Golden Goblin. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I don't catch it this time, it'll become a big headache.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From Hyrkan's memories, the Lost World.... \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know who had named it the Black Continent, but he knew how he would be able to survive here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the Golden Goblin being chased by Hyrkan was one of this methods.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Golden Goblin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a level 200 monster, but it wasn't worth anything. \u00a0Its EXP was non-existent, and it wasn't as if it dropped any good Ingredient Items. \u00a0It was also very weak. \u00a0A level 100 User could kill it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since it was weak, it hid in a shelter where monsters and Users couldn't find it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Golden Goblin's shelter was a Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, a Dungeon at the Black Continent was a Ruin. \u00a0He was sure of it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The vestige of the Ruined Kingdom! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was where the third Main Scenario would start.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One had to go into the Ruins of the Ruined Kingdom to find the clues. \u00a0After obtaining the quest, one had find more clues to advance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What kind of power did the Ruined Kingdom have? \u00a0What had they fought, and what had caused its demise!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When one finds out about this truth, the Ruined Kingdom episode comes to an end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why the Golden Goblin, which was being chased by Hyrkan, was important. \u00a0The bastard was the starting point for the Ruined Kingdom episode.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit. \u00a0Why the hell is it so fast?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it wouldn't be caught easily. \u00a0The Golden Goblin was unbelievably fast. \u00a0Even the great Hyrkan would lose sight of it sometimes. \u00a0If it was any other User, it would have already escaped.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, there was no point in just catching it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One had to chase after it. \u00a0He had to make it so that it ran towards its hideout. \u00a0This was why it was driving Hyrkan nuts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? Uh!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had summoned Skeletons to herd it. \u00a0However, the Skeletons possessed AI for fighting monsters, so they were sometimes more trouble than help.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSto\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Don't kill it!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Warriors were able to chase it down and kill it. \u00a0However, it didn't have much talent at herding it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before he could flick his finger to put it in defensive mode, one Skeleton Warrior got in the path of the Golden Goblin. \u00a0It immediately cut the Golden Goblin into two.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-ahhhhhhh!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how Hyrkan failed for the fourth time.</span></p><br/><p>4.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair raised his head. \u00a0He saw the Urugal mountain range, which was surrounded by a thick fog.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair turned his head. \u00a0He saw the thousand Users, who were following his orders. \u00a0They were the guild members of the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair smiled. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This doesn't feel too bad.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The most recent events brushed by Sinclair's thoughts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The very first memory that came to mind was the fight with Sohank. \u00a0When he caught Sohank in the Northland, he had become the Big Smiles' biggest asset. \u00a0He received the VIP treatment. \u00a0Of course, he lost to the Hahoe Mask, but no one considered it a loss for Sinclair. \u00a0No one spoke disparaging remarks towards Sinclair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how the VIP treatment had started, and it was sweet. \u00a0All the issues regarding the main Boss Monster Raids and the deployment of troops in the Big Smiles guild was now in his hands. \u00a0If one compared this to how a country was run, he had basically received control of the army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Naturally, his reputation had increased. \u00a0The Big Smiles guild had a massive fan following in China, and the guild had wanted someone like him to show up. \u00a0The guild was busy portraying Sinclair as a hero. \u00a0The shows that featured Sinclair always received a lot of views and interest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair\u2019s control and the influence of his words deepened further. \u00a0Moreover, with the help of Sinclair, Brooks was able to become the very first guild master of the Big Smiles. \u00a0As promised, Apollo became a master of a sub-guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The product of his power could be seen behind Sinclair.Thousand Users would try to cross the Urugal mountain range. \u00a0They would be fortunate if half of them were able to pass the Skull Collector. \u00a0However, Sinclair was indifferent about it. \u00a0He had risen to a position where he didn't need to worry about such things.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, his guild wasn't the only one doing this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Smiles and V&amp;V guild were allies now. \u00a0A total of 5 guilds had decided to ally with each other, and they would attempt the crossing together.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their goal was 10,000 Users!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They would send incredible amount of Users towards the Black Continent, and they\u2019ll for a kingdom over there with the 10,000 Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Hahoe Mask. \u00a0No matter how much you struggle over there you\u2019ll be by yourself. \u00a0You won\u2019t \u00a0be able to face a kingdom without any help.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Warlord was in disorder, and they were going to unify Warlord under their rule.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair put on a deep smile as he thought about the future.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

If we use our magic, you might be swept up in it! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it wasn't easy to help him either. \u00a0Magician's had to be judicious with their magic. \u00a0They had to avoid harming their allies. \u00a0However, the magicians could barely see the tip of their noses. \u00a0No matter how accurate these magicians were, it was an impossible situation where they couldn't fully use their abilities.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Fire!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Sohank yelled out again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I'm sending it! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, a magician gave an answer, and at the same time, he threw the ball of fire in his hand forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ball of fire thrown by the magician started to roll forward. \u00a0As it rolled forward, it started to expand, and in moments, it took the form of an enormous bear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-wah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Flame Bear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This scary magical spell was charging forward as it melted the snow away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Sohank was the one in the path of the charging Flame Bear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Aigo.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was the one that had ordered the use of the magic, but he never expected the Flame Bear to charge at him from his rear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sohank took short breaths. \u00a0The important part will start now. \u00a0If he did nothing, he would be sandwiched by the two bears. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the moment of truth. \u00a0Sohank moved when he saw an opportunity. \u00a0The Ice Bear had been continuously ramming into his shield. \u00a0Sohank lashed out at the Ice Bear with his shield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggwah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A loud sound exploded forth, and the Ice Bear's body was shifted slightly to the side. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-roo-roo....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Ice Bear had been about to let out a roar, but now it was letting out a low growl. \u00a0It was a sound made when a beast has reached the peak of its anger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, when the Ice Bear reorientated its head to express its anger, Sohank had disappeared from its field of vision. \u00a0When he hit the Ice Bear on the head, Sohank had immediately escaped from his current location.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sohank had leaped into the air, and he landed on the Ice Bear's nape.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he landed, Sohank took out the dagger equipped on his leg, and he stabbed it into the neck of the Ice Bear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-kahk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The dagger was planted inside the Ice Bear's neck. \u00a0It was in only up to the depth of the middle knuckle. \u00a0It couldn't be considered to be a deep wound.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ah-ah! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was enough to drive the Ice Bear into a rage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Ice Bear suddenly stood up. \u00a0At the same time, it turned to look towards its back. \u00a0Sohank was hanging on by grabbing onto his dagger. \u00a0Instead of shaking Sohank off, it planned on biting him. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-oh-oh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was great timing. \u00a0The Flame Bear threw itself at the Ice Bear, and it swung its paw. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puh-uhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Flame Bear's front paw let out a rough sound as it violently struck the Ice Bear's head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hweeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Ice Bear's head snapped to the side, and a terrifying claw mark appeared on its face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the Ice Bear's anger wasn't directed at Sohank at all. \u00a0It was directed towards the Flame Bear. \u00a0The two bears immediately started to fight each other. \u00a0The two bears stood on their hind legs, and they used their front paws to strike at each other. \u00a0Neither bear backed down, but it wasn\u2019t a good battle to watch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Ice Bear was much more stronger than the Flame Bear. \u00a0The Flame Bear could only leave scratches and wounds on the Ice Bear's body. \u00a0The Ice Bear's attacks took chunks off of the Flame Bear's body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two bears exchanged about 10 blows in total, and the Flame Bear became mangled. \u00a0It started to disappear into the snowstorm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During all of this, Sohank created wounds on the Ice Bear's back and waist. \u00a0Again, the wound wasn't deep, but the location from where he struck was exquisite. \u00a0He was at a location where the Ice Bear's limbs and teeth couldn't reach him. \u00a0He was basically in its blind spot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From such a location, Sohank yelled out again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFire!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of answering back, the magicians used more magical spells. \u00a0Accompanying the incantation of the magicians, fireballs and thunder strikes headed towards the Ice Bear. \u00a0Moreover, it was also coming towards Sohank, who was sticking close to the Ice Bear's body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-oh-oh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Ice Bear let out a roar as it struggled. \u00a0As the Ice Bear flailed, Sohank started to accumulate a significant amount of damage. \u00a0Sohank continued to attack it to keep the aggro on him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This really was a gambit where Sohank had put his life on the line.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In such a battle, the rest of the party could do nothing. \u00a0Natal, who was the leader of this party, didn't say anything. \u00a0At this moment, he couldn't even come up with a word of encouragement for Sohank.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Natal couldn't do anything. \u00a0He could only regret over his decision.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His regret started 8 days ago. \u00a0It was when they first arrived at this frozen land. \u00a0As if by magic, the snowstorm had appeared, and Natal was conflicted as to how he should proceed. \u00a0He wondered if he should allow the group an adjustment time period before they earnestly started their search. \u00a0On the flip side, they could start searching first, then they could get used to everything.....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, they planned on following the former plan. \u00a0They were going to start their search after they got acclimated to this place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the problem was the urgent news he received.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If it wasn't for the Big Smiles....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The urgent news said a large contingent of Big Smiles guild members had crossed the Terube castle wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, this was within the realm of possibilities they had postulated. \u00a0\u00a0If one had a decent head on one\u2019s shoulder, it was easy to connect the dot between the Northland and the third Main Scenario Quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018No. If it wasn't for Sinclair...\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair was within this group.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn't known to the world, but he was a User that was on par or better than the officers of the 30 great guilds. \u00a0He was also a person that had received aggressive love calls from all the 30 great guilds, yet he was unwavering in switching his affiliation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yet he was wearing a Big Smiles guild symbol now. \u00a0Moreover, Natal received information that Sinclair was one of the figures leading the group. \u00a0Natal couldn't help, but be thrown into a state of confusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This put a lot of pressure on him. \u00a0If it was just the Big Smile, he could just treat them as a big dog that moved into the neighborhood. \u00a0However, this was the Big Smiles guild with Sinclair included in the party. \u00a0A feral beast had just moved into the neighborhood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Natal decided to accelerate their timeline in finishing the Quest instead of facing off against the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the frozen ground was starting to cause significant delays.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If things head along this way, they'll definitely catch up to us.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were in a obstacle race, and they were having a hard time getting past the obstacles. \u00a0They were pretty much stuck.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, they would be caught by the latecomers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- We got it! \u00a0Stop! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Sohank's voice was heard in Natal's ears. \u00a0At the same time, the Priests ran towards Sohank. \u00a0They used the Healing skills to quickly mend the wounds. \u00a0Then they started putting the Buff skills on him as a precaution for the unforeseen circumstances that might occur.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNatal!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he was receiving the skills from the Priests, Sohank immediately called out to Natal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Natal approached Sohank, and he gave orders to his subordinates through Voice Talk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cListen! \u00a0We don\u2019t have much time, so we\u2019ll be brief in taking footage for data. \u00a0Once you guys finish filming, we\u2019ll immediately butcher the monster. \u00a0Clean up after yourselves. \u00a0Don't leave behind any Ingredient Coins.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll say this again. \u00a0We can't leave behind any trace. \u00a0The Ingredient Coins won't disappear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His warnings were almost approaching the level of nagging. \u00a0Even though, he had given his warnings, Natal didn\u2019t look to be in a good mood. \u00a0His expression was screwed up as he started a conversation with Sohank.</span></p><br/><p>2.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-oohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A wide and nimble sword was embedded deep within the Hammerhead's single sharp eyes. \u00a0The Hammerhead's body started to shake. \u00a0It was such a deep wound that the Hammerhead couldn't even let out a scream.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kooh-oohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the Hammerhead weakly fell to the ground as if it was a large piece of log. A User descended using the fallen Hammerhead's body as a staircase. \u00a0Sinclair immediately flipped over the Hammerhead's body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Swhoook! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After flipping it over, he immediately extracted his sword from the Hammerhead's single eye. \u00a0Sinclair sheathed his sword. \u00a0It was the surest gesture that signified the end of a battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone, who had been watching the battle, let out exclamations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAmazing. \u00a0You are really amazing.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSinclair-nim! You are really incredible!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then there were those, who swallowed their exclamations. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018How preposterous. \u00a0He just climbed atop the Hammerhead's head? \u00a0If it went awry, he would have been swept up in the Head-butt.... \u00a0I'll never be able to do such a thing.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I know he has the Items, but it is also his incredible skills. \u00a0Why haven\u2019t such a skilled User gained any notoriety yet?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Why did such a skilled User enter our guild?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, not everyone was letting out or swallowing exclamations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou did well.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of an exclamation, Apollo spoke as if he was a noble giving praise to his subordinate. \u00a0He spoke in a disinterested tone. \u00a0Sinclair also responded in a disinterested manner. \u00a0He slightly nodded his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo's expression crumpled a little bit. \u00a0His presence was being continuously marginalized, so it seemed Apollo didn't welcome the current situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair also didn't like the situation he was in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I know this is a job, but I can't believe I have to lower my head to this guy.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had operated without publicizing his face in the past, but Sinclair had been treated with utmost respect and care by everyone as a Helper from the Hands guild. \u00a0Apollo was nothing if he didn't have his father's influence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he didn\u2019t look kindly to Apollo holding a role of being his superior.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Be patient. \u00a0This will come to an end soon.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He knew the importance of this job, so Sinclair firmly preached patience to himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It won't be too long.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After they moved beyond the Terube castle wall, Sinclair led the Big Smiles guild member in a chase after the Hydra guild. \u00a0They had only one purpose. \u00a0They were going to start a guild battle against the Hyrdra guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, they didn\u2019t plan on fighting a full scale battle. \u00a0From the Hydra guild\u2019s perspective, they weren\u2019t keen on a full scale battle either. \u00a0They would work to avoid that outcome. \u00a0Reinforcements weren\u2019t anywhere near them, and there were no castles or towns beyond the Terube wall. \u00a0If they performed a fullscale war, it would be basically be akin to a suicide bombing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, they\u2019ll decide do a 1on1 battle. \u00a0A great match would ensue, and this was the result wanted by Sinclair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I kill Sohank, everything will change.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sohank was the strongest User in the Hydra guild. \u00a0What was the worth of winning a 1on1 battle against him?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had no idea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was incalculable, but just the thought of it was enough to make him smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A smile formed on Sinclair's lips. \u00a0One User saw his smile, so the User spoke up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt seems you are in a good mood.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNothing. \u00a0I just saw you smiling, so I....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The one that asked the question was Cho-oohroong. \u00a0He was the one that had built an affinity with Bagel by playing on the Battlefield stage. He was also the one that was able to receive the Northland Exploration Quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unlike Apollo, Sinclair had a high opinion of Cho-oohroong. \u00a0Cho-oohroong had helped out Sinclair in various ways, so Sinclair treated him well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll be fighting a skilled User soon. \u00a0The anticipation I have for the fight must have revealed itself through my expression.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Sinclair revealed some of his true feelings in front of Cho-oohroong. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs expected, you are incredible.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho-oohroong had an expression filled with admiration as he looked at Sinclair. \u00a0Sinclair's smile deepened when he saw this particular expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This is what he wanted. \u00a0He didn't want everyone to look at him as just some nobody. \u00a0He wanted them to look at him with respect. \u00a0He didn't want to be the expert that only other experts knew about. \u00a0We wanted to become world famous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSinclair-nim is probably the only one in this game that feels happy about the prospect of fighting Sohank.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm flattered. \u00a0However, if I don't win, this would have all been an act of reckless bravado.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. \u00a0From what I just saw now, you will definitely win. \u00a0Of course, this is assuming the other side doesn't do anything foul.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The dayy will come soon. \u00a0Even people, who didn't know Sinclair, would look up to him!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair's smile deepened further. \u00a0It was so deep that his smile couldn't get any more broader.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It happened at that moment....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?

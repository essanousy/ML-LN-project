The Hahoe Mask is participating in the great battle at the Shezga castle! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the reaction to start of any rumor was weak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- What about it? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Even that weird bastard is lurking there. So what do you want us to do about it? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- What does the Hahoe Mask participating in the great battle at the Shezga castle have to with us?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Most weak rumors went away before it could gain steam. However, there were times when the weak rumor evolved into something bigger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The Hahoe Mask is doing a Hard Carry in the great battle! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the latter case.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Hahoe Mask? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Great battle? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Hard Carry! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The combination of these three words captivated the fans of Warlord. \u00a0Their attention was kidnapped towards the Shezga castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In that moment, the fertilizer needed for the news to prosper was laid.</span></p><br/><p>9,</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Your Level has Increased.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had heard the Level Up announcement more than 160 times, so it failed to make his heart flutter. Hyrkan focused his gaze on the pandemonium in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, groups were dispatched to various sectors to block the Corrupted army. \u00a0A fierce battle was going on, but the defenders of Shezga castle was being pushed back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Overall, the Corrupted army held the upper hand in the battle. \u00a0It was like two fighters from different weight classes fighting against each other. \u00a0Still, the defenders of the Shezga castle didn't fall immediately. \u00a0They were still holding out. \u00a0Naturally, the advance of the Corrupted army came to a crawl.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan licked his lips at the sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The licking of the lips was a representation of how he felt after he finished his Eat the Tail method.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The pieces were already in place, so everything happened as he expected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was able to do the Eat the Tail method only until the Corrupted army's advance came to a halt. \u00a0If one tried the Eat the Tail method when the Corrupted army was stalled, the risk would be smaller than fighting from the front. \u00a0Still, the Eat the Tail method would become riskier than the Gnawing method.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Bite it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan once again chewed on his lips. His lips were already wet, but we once again worried over his lips. \u00a0The meaning behind this action was clear. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anxiety.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, Hyrkan was anxious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I've already showed you this much. \u00a0Just bite the bait.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His goal wasn't to gain EXP. \u00a0He had another goal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018You bastards call yourself gamers. \u00a0Do you really want to run away like a dog with its tail between its legs?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why did people play games? \u00a0It wasn't a complicated question. \u00a0There wasn't some philosophical meaning behind why these people chose to play this game. \u00a0They played it, because they wanted to. They played this game to be better than others, and they wanted to play it in style.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan targeted this mentality.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Look at me! If you are with me, you'll get likes, follows or whatever admiration you want! \u00a0You'll be able to be cool for a day as you play this game today!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, it wasn't hard for Hyrkan to win over the Centurions. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t as if the Centurions were given salaries for taking the position. \u00a0These Users insisted on doing the dirty work, since they would be able gain some profit through their position as Centurion. \u00a0The Centurions would willingly work with Hyrkan if their interests were aligned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, the Centurions didn't have as much control over the groups as they would like to think. \u00a0The Users gathered under them weren't their underlings. \u00a0If the Users were unwilling to do something, they left the stage. \u00a0If the Users left, the Centurions were useless.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Hyrkan had tried to win over the normal User to his side from the beginning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All his actions up until now was to put hot air into the hearts of the normal Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The rumors should be spreading right now.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the normal Users were in the midst of a battle, so they couldn't check up on Hyrkan's exploit with their own two eyes. \u00a0They didn't have the time to spare, and even if they had the time, they wouldn't have done it. \u00a0Still, this didn't mean all the Users in battle were solely focused on the battle at hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if an important tests was around the corner, most students in school didn't stay focused throughout the whole class. \u00a0Most students got sidetracked at any given moment. Just because this was a battle it didn't mean the Users didn't get sidetracked. \u00a0Tankers were in a different position where they had to stay focused at all time. \u00a0However, it was easy for the priests and magicians to become sidetracked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This inevitably led to one of them witnessing the Hahoe Mask's exploite from somewhere. What happens after someone witnesses Hahoe Mask's exploits? \u00a0It was like passing notes in class. \u00a0The information would spread to the surrounding Users. \u00a0Since they had the Voice Talk program, they didn't need to pass around a note. \u00a0They just had to move their mouth couple of times.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After a certain amount of time passed, they reached a point where the atmosphere became disarrayed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When that moment came\u2026\u2026. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahoe Mask!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the ones in charge would have to straighten out the distraction. \u00a0To do this, they would have to come find the source of the distraction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ok.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A light smile appeared on the lips he had tortured.</span></p><br/><p>10.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Team 5, 6, 11 and 12 will move out of the battle region. \u00a0Team 1 and Team 2 is on standby. \u00a0The remaining team's Tanker line and Priest line will remain. \u00a0All magicians will climb the castle wall!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big K started to command his troops.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If it was normal times, this kinds of commands wouldn't take root. \u00a0If a User, who had come to a hunting ground to catch monsters were given an order completely unrelated to the task at hand, most of the Users would leave the party and logout.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't as if this wasn't happening amongst the Users here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy is he suddenly acting this way? \u00a0We were in the midst of a good hunt.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCrazy. \u00a0Is he really going to attempt it? \u00a0How come they are making such a unilateral decision!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is driving me nuts. \u00a0Why am I obligated to do this? \u00a0Those bastards aren't my responsibility. \u00a0Ah. Whatever. I'm out.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this was a relatively few number of Users. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A significant number of complaints were cut down from the value placed on the name of the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI heard the Hahoe Mask isn't playing around in the rear.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI think he caught several hundred by himself.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSeveral hundred? No way. Even if he could catch one monster every minute, it would take him 5 hours to catch 300 monsters.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0If he summoned 100 Skeletons, he could easily take down 300.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStop speaking such nonsense.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, let's at least try it out once. \u00a0It isn't as if an opportunity to hunt with the Hahoe Mask will present itself again. \u00a0Moreover, the Hahoe Mask must have some kind of a plan in mind. \u00a0Truthfully, if we stop the Corrupted Army here, wouldn't it be a big deal?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Hahoe Mask said he'll allow us to take screenshots with him afterwards no matter what. \u00a0It doesn't matter if we win or lose. Let's do this.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, wait a moment. \u00a0Let me update what is happening on Facebook.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The rumor related to the Hahoe Mask had already gotten out of control. \u00a0The truths became stretched, and it was spread amongst the defenders of the Shezga castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Some of the rumors said the Hahoe Mask had summoned 100 Skeletons, a Death Knight had appeared, a Fire Golem had appeared to turn the battle field in a sea of flame, the Hahoe Mask was able to contract space using magic... \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Any rational person that heard the rumors knew it was absurd, but the truth wasn't that important to the Users gathered in the Shezga castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First, this sounded fun. \u00a0If they were really able to succeed in defending the castle, it would look incredibly cool!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These reasons allowed the users to be able to work in perfect order.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Big K had commanded, the Tanker line alongside the Priests bought time as the Magicians quickly climbed to the top of the castle wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the magicians started to arrive at the top of the castle wall, a new order was given.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The Tanker line should narrow itself as you perform a slow retreat. You don't have to block every monster! If you don't think you can do it, just let them pass! We are going to let the monsters bang against the castle wall!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Give up the castle wall! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was another debate going on in regards to this order, but from the perspective of the Tankers, this would give them time to recuperate. \u00a0In truth, they were happy with the order, so they followed order without any complaint. \u00a0The Tankers started to retreat from the battlefield as the priests took care of the Tankers. \u00a0Of course, the Tankers and Priests that had retreated was put on standby.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Ready your magic, magicians! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was time for the magicians to shine. \u00a0The magicians immediately rained down their magic against the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Don't use your strong AOE magic. Use the single shot target magic!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unlike before, they were going to use the meat and potato spells.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Don't think of it as killing them with magic. \u00a0You should think of it as destroying the defensive gears worn by the Corrupted army with magic! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The magicians became skeptical when they heard their orders.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Destroy their armors?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Wouldn't that mean we won't be damaging them?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Usually, the magic spells of the magicians were mainly used to deal damage. It wasn't used to destroy the armor. \u00a0However, it wasn't as if it wasn't possible to do so.They could throw the low-grade magic at the monsters, but it would be an inefficient use of their magic considering their level.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, they needed an explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- After we destroy their gears, we'll have the deciding match inside the castle!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This explanation wasn't enough.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- This is the Hahoe Mask-style hunting method! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, his following words erased the need for the magicians to get a full explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If the Hahoe Mask want us to peel it, we'll peel them like cloves of garlic.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The magicians readied their magic. They weren't using the powerful magic they learned after their 1st Advancement. \u00a0They were using magic spells they used a long time ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's been a long time since I've used the Fireball.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's been so long since I've use any ball type magic.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI never used ball or bolt type magic before, so my proficiency is very low. \u00a0Will that be ok?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow should I know? \u00a0Ask an intellectual about it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Not everyone followed the orders given. \u00a0There were magicians, who decided to ready their big spells. In this world, there were always those who did the opposite of a given order.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there weren't many Users like this, so it wouldn't greatly change the balance of battle. \u00a0They didn't need everyone to follow orders. \u00a0They just needed most of them to follow directions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStart the bombardment!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Magicians started to throw magic. Moreover, the magical spells were thrown without any rest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ball and bolt type magic neither had a long cool time nor a long casting time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One person couldn't throw it endlessly, but several hundred magicians could endlessly cover the battlefield with magic if they matched their pace. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The magic was starting to create cracks in the armors worn by the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the moment when the battle entered into a new phase.</span></p><br/><p>11.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe magicians on top of the castle wall will break the armors worn by the monsters. \u00a0Then congestion would start to occur at locations where the gate or the walls fall. \u00a0The elite Tanker line will block as the big magic spells will be deployed.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Users dispatched outside will Gnaw at the monsters that are too busy entering the castle gate.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWouldn't the Gnawing method take too long? \u00a0In the end, wouldn't there be a large number of monsters entering into the castle?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt will be a piece of cake to kill unarmored Corrupted monster in the street battle.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat should the command structure be like during the street battles? We won't be able to control every small battle that breaks out.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCommand structure doesn't matter in this. It'll be the same as hunting in the field. \u00a0Each party will decide on a structure, and they can catch whatever monster they want.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf we do this through the street battles, the damage to the castle....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you have some kind of real estate investment in the Shezga castle?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big K didn't have a retort to Hyrkan's words. \u00a0Big K just closed his mouth, and he smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIncredible.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's strategy wasn't overly complicated. \u00a0Actually, it was very simple. Since it was simple, he was able to quickly run the scenario inside his mind. For such a simple tactic, the result that was being drawn in his mind was surprising. \u00a0Hyrkan's strategy wouldn't guarantee them a 100% win, but it put them in a shouting distance of actually being able to win this battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the defenders in the Shezga castle numbered over 2,000, Hyrkan's method would guarantee a win. \u00a0Of course, this was assuming a very competent commander like Hyrkan was present to direct the progress of the battle. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If the 30 great guilds use this strategy... We'll win every time.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Big K was truly surprised, so he asked Hyrkan the question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow did you come up with this plan?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan wasn't able immediately give an answer to this question. \u00a0Big K thought the snort was directed at him. \u00a0It was as if he was saying, 'Do I really have to explain single detail?' \u00a0Big K thought that was what Hyrkan's snort meant. \u00a0In a way, it could be seen as an arrogant gesture. \u00a0However, Big K thought it wasn't arrogant. \u00a0He saw it as Hyrkan's self-confidence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He isn't just good at fighting. \u00a0Does this mean he is also good at coming up with tactics? \u00a0Is that how it is? \u00a0He really has everything.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Big K understood why Chev thought so highly of Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, there was a reason why Hyrkan hadn't answered the question. \u00a0No, he couldn't answer it. \u00a0The reason was simple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Your guild created this tactic.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The tactic that he proposed was something taken out of the Red Bull's manual.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Corrupted army went into Siege mode, one used Eat the Tail and Gnawing method to chip away at the Corrupted army. \u00a0Then the magicians used a large amount of magic to disarm the Corrupted Monsters, and the number of monsters were significantly reduced when the congestion occured. \u00a0Afterwards, the street battles were used to finish off the Corrupted army. \u00a0If they took this a step further, the remaining monsters in the castle could be herded outside of the castle, and they could be taken out with a bombardment of AOE magic. \u00a0This last method was called the 'Hangover' method.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one wanted to defend the castle, one had to minimize the damage to the castle. \u00a0However, this was only true in real life. \u00a0Warlord Users didn't have to care a whit about damaging the castle. \u00a0This was also the impetus that led to the creation of this method.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This method was put out by the Red Bulls, and this method became the standard tactic in the great battle. \u00a0The entirety of the 30 great guilds followed the Red Bull's method, and the great battle quickly came to an end with the Users coming out on top. \u00a0In the process of all of this, the Red Bull's stock rose considerably.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now that stock increase would happen to Hyrkan. \u00a0Hyrkan was slightly sorry about doing this, but his heart quickly swallowed up that feeling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Well, who cares. I'm doing this to fatten up the 30 great guilds.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, wasn't he doing something that would benefit the 30 great guilds? This thought made Hyrkan's stomach ache.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018No. If I'm being honest, I'm doing so much for the 30 great guilds right now. \u00a0It wouldn't be enough even if they paid me money.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It happened at that moment. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big K listened to his Voice Talk program, and he suddenly asked Hyrkan a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahoe Mask. \u00a0There is an interview request...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big K was about to speak, but he closed his mouth. \u00a0He remembered that Hahoe Mask rarely gave an interview to the media. \u00a0He realized he had made a big faux pas by asking for an interview. This was evidence that Big K's thoughts were all jumbled. \u00a0He had let those words slip, since this was an urgent situation. Of course, Big K was ready for Hyrkan to refuse the offer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cInterview? With the Red Bulls?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of turning him down, Hyrkan replied with a question. \u00a0One of Big K's eyebrows lifted slightly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. \u00a0It's the Fruit Post.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fruit Post.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow are you acquainted with the reporter?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have personal connections\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou have quite a strong network of contacts. \u00a0You are able to get in touch with a reporter from the Fruit Post.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Peach Saga V-Gear Series was released, the first order of business was creating a media company that dealt with the improving virtual reality contents. It was called the Peach company, and at the time, the company purchased a struggling traditional media company that was unable to adapt to the age of smartphones. \u00a0This was how a new media company called Fruit Post came to be.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, they covered a wide variety of contents regarding the virtual reality. \u00a0Moreover, they were most popular for their work regarding Warlord. In terms of dealing with the weekly Warlord contents, their influence and impact was in the top 3 in regards to media companies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big K was close with several reporters from the Fruit Post, who dealt exclusively with Warlord. One of them had caught wind of the situation, and the reporter was trying to get an interview through Big K.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From the perspective of the reporter, it was akin to poking at a persimmons that was out of reach.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. I'll do the interview.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan agreed to do it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The persimmons had just fallen into the open mouth of a reporter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big K was surprised, but he immediately reigned in his surprise. He swallowed his spit couple times before he asked a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhen do you want to schedule it?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll do it now.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have time until the street battle starts. \u00a0I have nothing to do until then. \u00a0I'll do the interview here. \u00a0Just connect them to me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p>12.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The Hahoe Mask's interview is up! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Is it a live interview? \u00a0\u00a0Give me the Fruit's coordinate! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 37\u00b0 22\u2032 12\u2033 N, 122\u00b0 2\u2032 24\u2033 W </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 Crazy son of a bitch.

His face was uncovered. \u00a0One could see the sight of the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahoe Mask Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, Warlord was gripped with shock, fear and fanaticism. \u00a0The one to put Warlord in such a state returned to the eye of the storm. \u00a0He appeared at the place where the earthquake originated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh-whew.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After catching his breath for a short moment, Hyrkan turned his head to look at the Highwood Forest. \u00a0He had participated in an incredible battle here. \u00a0The war waged here so intense, and the implications were immense. \u00a0Even now he could bring up the memories of the battle at will. \u00a0The memories and the feelings he had felt in the war was clear inside his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I did it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, at the end, he had mounted the Bone Wyvern, and he had yelled out his destination. \u00a0The Bone Wyvern split the winds and they had flown past the Highwood Forest. \u00a0The feeling he felt from the air was also clear inside his mind. \u00a0As he vividly recalled the sensation he felt, Hyrkan\u2019s body felt an electric charge run up his body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whether it was before he had returned to the past or after he had returned to the past, he had always wanted to accomplish this task, and he had done it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He ruthlessly stomped and crushed a 30 great guild. \u00a0Now he didn\u2019t have to to run away. \u00a0He was able to hold his head up high with pride and aloofness. \u00a0He was able to look down on their heads, and he could dictate their response.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Yes. \u00a0This is me. \u00a0This is the person I am within Warlord.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had wanted to show them all. \u00a0Hyrkan wasn\u2019t someone they could step on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before he returned to the past, he had been crushed before he could even struggle. \u00a0It had been a one-sided affair, but this didn\u2019t mean he was inferior to them. \u00a0Hyrkan had suffered not because he had been pitifully weak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wanted to improve himself to prove a point.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018....if I hadn\u2019t been betrayed, I would have seen this sight before I returned to the past.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a sight that could only be seen after stepping over people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had really wanted to see it, and he had been sure he would be able to see it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had thought he would be able to step above the 30 great guilds if he stayed together with the Hahoe Mask guild. \u00a0He had been able to see a sight that he always wanted to see with the Hahoe Mask guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now he had elevated by stepping on the great guilds by himself, and he could admire the scenery. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was still short in achieving his dream, but he was in the process of bringing it to bear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan turned his head to look at the endless Red Desert.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was only the bottom of the scenery he wanted to see.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan walked towards his vision.</span></p><br/><p>5.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Your Level has increased.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he heard the Level Up announcement, Hyrkan slid down the Sand Snake\u2019s body as if he was on a slide.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he turned his head to look at the status of the Sand Snake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Sand Snakes were called the assassins of the Red Desert. \u00a0However, it was in such a pitiful state that it felt shameful to attach such a notorious nickname to the Sand Snake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A Sand Snake was tangled up with the body of another Sand Snake. \u00a0\u00a0It was a sight akin to thick ropes tangled in a mess.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Ingredient Gem of a Sand Snake had a very low drop rate, yet Hyrkan had used the Clay Play skill to create a Sand Snake Earth Golem. \u00a0This was the first time he had tried this strategy, and it was very effective.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. \u00a0Should that be the title of my next video?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan looked at the wretched sight of the monster, and he had a satisfied expression on his face. His plan had panned out, so he felt satisfied.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this wasn\u2019t a cheap plan either.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Sand Snake\u2019s Ingredient Gem was currently being traded for a very high price. \u00a0Moreover, this result couldn\u2019t be achieved with a normal Golem. \u00a0A Golem had to be reinforced by the Transcendent Rank Ancient Power to replicate this sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, the only one able to use this method in Warlord was Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This was clean.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a key point.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan knew the Big Smiles guild wouldn\u2019t continue to leave him alone. They\u2019ll attack Hyrkan when the opportunity presents itself. \u00a0No, they\u2019ll try to create the opportunity by using all kinds of tricks. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, this was no longer only about the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0Most of the 30 great guilds would consider the Hahoe Mask as an enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been so in the past, and there was no reason that would lead him to believe that things would change this time around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he didn\u2019t plan on avoiding a fight. \u00a0He\u2019ll fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As an exchange, it wouldn\u2019t be on a stage where it gave them the advantage. \u00a0Hyrkan will fight them on a stage where he\u2019ll have the advantage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to go deeper.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to move deeper into locations where powerful monsters were populated. \u00a0He had to be at locations where there were a lot of obstacles and strife.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The 30 great guild\u2019s era of prosperity would burst like a bubble. \u00a0Everything Hyrkan possessed would become effective weapons against them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The war that had started would end there. \u00a0It\u2019ll end when he reached the deepest location in this game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan raised his head, and he looked at the large forest that looked like a mirage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Let\u2019s see this through to the end.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He\u2019ll go to the deepest point inside this game. \u00a0He\u2019ll reach the end of this game, and it\u2019ll be the final stage for his war.</span></p><br/><p>6.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Elves with red skin was aiming their arrows towards Hyrkan. \u00a0The arrowheads were frighteningly sharp.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan was relaxed as he faced the arrowheads, and he folded his arms as he took everything in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a warrior of the Red Elf tribe in front of Hyrkan. \u00a0The NPC named Hing was looking over the lump of gold. \u00a0It had red skin and black eyes. \u00a0It was also wearing an armor made out of ingredients gathered from the Sand Snake. \u00a0The Red Elf was beautiful, \u00a0but the sense of alienness was larger than sense of mystery he felt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It would have been great if Whistling\u2019s Family saw this.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could imagine what Whistling and his two comrades would say. \u00a0The man and the woman would talk endlessly. \u00a0Hyrkan had a faint smile as he shook his head a little bit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed he would have to set a date to meet. Them. \u00a0He would meet everyone over some beer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he didn\u2019t, he realized he might regret not meeting them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Hyrkan\u2019s movement, the arrowheads of the Red Elves moved too.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a warning signal telling him not to move.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan stopped moving.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Hing also came to a stop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwee hwee!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hing whistled a sound that resembled a chirping bird.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying the whistle, the arrowheads pointing at Hyrkan was lowered towards the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You\u2019ve gained the

heard the Announcement for acquiring a title, Hyrkan unfurled his arms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere did you get this, human?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hing approached Hyrkan, and it asked him the question. \u00a0Its black eyes glared at Hyrkan, and Hyrkan spoke as he always did. \u00a0He answered in a friendly manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI acquired it from the Den of the Rebels located inside the Red Desert.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A User should always be friendly in front of an NPC! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even as many things changed, this was the golden rule that must be kept by Users of Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow did you get in there?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAn enormous snake created a path, and I followed it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Mirage Snake is still alive\u2026..\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Hing spoke, it looked over Hyrkan once again. \u00a0Hyrkan didn\u2019t avoid its gaze.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan also made observations about Hing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018From what I know, the Red Elves didn\u2019t come out even when Warlord was pretty far down the road\u2026..\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had never heard about the Red Elves before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the same for the large snake named Mirage Snake. \u00a0He hadn\u2019t known about the existence of such a large monster. \u00a0Moreover, he couldn\u2019t have have even imagined such a storyline.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he could guess at what was going on by looking at these events.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Hmmm.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A piece of a puzzle became clear inside Hyrkan\u2019s head. \u00a0The puzzle was close to being completed, so Hyrkan had a pleased expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll take you to our chief now. \u00a0Please don\u2019t think about doing anything foolish.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan\u2019s expression turned neutral when he received Hing\u2019s threatening words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It happened at that moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs expected, it\u2019s you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A short dwarf slowly appeared from between the group of Elves. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When it made its appearance, the Elves parted to let it through.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe meet again.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span

when he saw the NPC he desperately wanted to encounter. \u00a0He gave a short answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour path would have been difficult, and you did well in getting here.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m trying to save the world. \u00a0I can\u2019t avoid a task, because it is difficult.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of answering Hyrkan, Olf looked towards Hing. \u00a0Olf sent some kind of signal with his eyes. \u00a0Hing once again let out a whistle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before the whistle could come to an end, the Elves started to retreat. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Olf waved his hand towards Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBefore you meet the chief, I have to talk to you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat would you like to say to me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll tell you about the beings we have been fighting up until now. \u00a0Moreover, I\u2019ll tell you about the beings we\u2019ll have to fight in the future.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he heard those words, the puzzle inside his head was completed.</span></p><br/><p>7.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis occurred in the distant past\u2026. \u00a0There was a time when every living creature walked on the ground. \u00a0It was a brilliant era. \u00a0However, when this brilliance turned into arrogance, he appeared.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho was it?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA Dragon. \u00a0You can think of him as them or him. \u00a0You can even think of him as multiple beings.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat did the Dragon do?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJudgement. \u00a0He showed, who was the owner of this land. \u00a0He gave judgement to the arrogant beings, who considered these lands to be theirs.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhen you refer to it as a judgement\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn the beginning, he used the Power of Corruption. \u00a0It didn\u2019t matter if one traversed this land by ground or air, he corrupted them all. \u00a0Then he started a war with the beings, who insisted on being the owners of this land.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0That\u2019s the power used by the Immoral Prince\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBayan Dean Un\u2026.. \u00a0No, I guess I should call him the Immoral Prince. \u00a0That\u2019s right. \u00a0\u00a0His power was the same as the power from before. \u00a0The Immoral Prince found the Power of Corruption, and he started researching ways to use this power. \u00a0That was\u2026. \u00a0It was the same for the owners of the Ruined Kingdoms. \u00a0They fought against the Power of Corruption. \u00a0They used the power within the Power of Corruption. \u00a0They used a power called the Ancient Power. \u00a0They knew it was inevitable. \u00a0They knew the judgement of the Dragon would arrive some day. \u00a0They knew it, because it happened before in the distant past.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo what happened next? \u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Dragon raged. \u00a0This was why he used his five Powers to curse the world. \u00a0The north was cursed with Frost. \u00a0The Urugal mountain range, which bisected the world, was cursed with Fire. \u00a0The south\u2026...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt all fell. \u00a0I saw what happened. \u00a0I saw the result.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, the prosperous regions fell to the Curses. \u00a0The Kingdoms of that time became ruins. \u00a0However, not every Kingdom fell. \u00a0While the Dragon was using its power to spread the Curses, an Ancient King, who was referred to as the War King, took up a shield and spear capable of defeating the Dragon. \u00a0He confronted the Dragon. \u00a0This king had used the world as bait, so the Dragon would turn his five Powers into Curses. \u00a0He waited for the only opportunity he would be able to defeat the Dragon.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span

to show itself once again in the future. \u00a0However, all the Kingdom had already fallen by the five Powers of the Dragon. \u00a0The world was already in ruins. \u00a0The Dragon\u2019s Army and the Corrupt Army was still destroying the world. \u00a0The Barbarian King was carrying out the Dragon\u2019s Judgement as proxy. \u00a0He is now in a stasis. \u00a0He could carry out his duty when needed. \u00a0In front of such opposition, no new kingdoms could be built. \u00a0This was why the rebels went underground as they prepared for the counterattack. \u00a0Then they started leaving hints all over the world about this fact. They planted flags that\u2019ll be held up by the rebels in the future.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo it is possible to counterattack now?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe method had already been revealed before. \u00a0You need Powers that\u2019ll counteract the Dragon\u2019s five Powers. \u00a0You also need the War King\u2019s shield and spear.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe five Powers?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe four Powers has already been acquired. \u00a0The only one left is the Power of Judgement. You have to acquire the Power of Storm from the Barbarian King. \u00a0The Barbarian King is sleeping right now. \u00a0He could wake up at any time. \u00a0A small stimulus could awaken him from his sleep. \u00a0This is why the Arch Mage\u2019s barrier was placed over the sleeping place of the Barbarian King. \u00a0This was to make sure the Barbarian King couldn\u2019t be awoken easily.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo we just have to kill the Barbarian King.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...it isn\u2019t as easy as it sounds. \u00a0The Barbarian King carries out the Dragon\u2019s Judgement. \u00a0He controls the Power of Storm. \u00a0He also keeps numerous number of monsters to act as his hands and feet. \u00a0If you rashly awaken this being, you might mistakenly turned the world into ruins again.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHowever, we can\u2019t always avoid this. \u00a0We can\u2019t wait for the Dragon to heal from its injury. \u00a0We have to kill it before that happens. \u00a0Isn\u2019t that the right answer?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7can you actually defeat the Barbarian King?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch, who had been listening to the story, spoke in a confident manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are the Storm Hunters. \u00a0I don\u2019t know about anything else, but we can control the Power of Storm.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahimbree thought over Hatch\u2019s answer. \u00a0After a brief moment, it brought out a Golden Conch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is the key that will show you where the artifact of the War King is hidden. \u00a0This will be enough to waken the Barbarian King from its sleep. \u00a0You don't even have to dispel the barrier. \u00a0You just have to move close to it, and the Barbarian King will break through the barrier. \u00a0My teacher Bokan had created this barrier. \u00a0It was meant to keep people out. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t meant to cage the Barbarian King. \u00a0I\u2019m afraid my teacher would be furious if he heard my words right now.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease do not worry. \u00a0I guarantee we\u2019ll defeat the Barbarian King.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt might not be possible with only your forces. \u00a0You should request help from the Hiban Kingdom. \u00a0Their elite knights are called the Order of the Steel Lion. \u00a0They\u2019ll open up the path for you. \u00a0When they arrive here, you can go with them.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnderstood, teacher.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After his conversation, Hatch grasped the Golden Conch.

Please hold.]</p><br/><p>The alert came after the cooling sound. An Jaehyun spat out the mouthpiece he was biting down on, and he heard the V-Gear unlock with a clunk. An Jaehyun then took off the heavy V-Gear and the thick gloves. He was covered in sweat as he lay on the bed with his running shirt and underwear. It wasn\u2019t simply because of the VR game. His one-room itself was scorching. The indoor temperature was reaching 28.5 degrees Celsius (Editor note: about 83 degrees Fahrenheit), unbefitting of January 3rd.</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun swept back his sweat-covered hair with his hands.</p><br/><p>\u2018The heating bill\u2019s going to kill me.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that his heater broke or that he made a mistake. He had raised the temperature intentionally. Playing Warlord for a long time, he found that he could perform best between 27 and 29 degrees. This was important. If his physical body\u2019s condition fell, his in-game condition fell as well. If it remained severe, the Forced Exit System would activate. Normally it would be fine to adjust game play according to the physical body\u2019s condition, but in critical situations and raids, winning or losing depended on how well one could play at their best condition.</p><br/><p>\u2018The heating bill\u2019s going to cost several hundred thousand, and if I add the loan interest and monthly game-cost, I\u2019m going to be sucked dry.\u2019</p><br/><p>Warlord was a money-eating game.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t easy to make a living with such a game. An Jaehyun let out a sigh. He hadn\u2019t planned on logging out of the game just yet, but he had a reason for doing so.</p><br/><p>\u2018This isn\u2019t the necromancer I knew.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was to confirm.</p><br/><p>He used his Skeleton Warrior in battle, and the more he did, the more he was disappointed. Eventually, the disappointment turned into a sense of danger. The problem wasn\u2019t just that it didn\u2019t know how to fight.</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun wasn\u2019t stupid. He had watched necromancers\u2019 battle videos. On January 1st, after he returned to the past, went to the private loaners, borrowed money, and bought the V-Gear at the Peach Store, he had taken some time to watch various necromancers training. He even researched their training method.</p><br/><p>However, he couldn\u2019t find any information on why his Skeleton Warrior was so stupid.</p><br/><p>The Skeleton Warriors in the videos he saw all fought pretty well. They properly defended with the shields they were holding, and they counterattacked with their swords or spears after defending. 10 Skeleton Warriors lined up and advancing looked quite cool.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why is my skeleton so shit?\u2019</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun was the type to face things head-on and learn rather than theorize.</p><br/><p>But now wasn\u2019t the time to face anything head-on.</p><br/><p>If he really wasn\u2019t feeling it, he had to start over from the beginning. He didn\u2019t have much time. He had to show results within 3 months; otherwise, he would have to waste time paying off his debt at a workshop.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s no other choice.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was only one thing he could do, pay money to buy information and training method.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll have to pay for it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Warlord made money. It only made sense that important money-making information was expensive.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just expensive. Information that made money or hunting strategies went for millions of wons. It was the same for information on character training. Such a thing didn\u2019t come up on the videos either. Some cream of the crop information was only passed through 1 on 1 lessons. Lessons ranged from as little as 100 thousand wons to several million.</p><br/><p>Information may not seem so important, but Warlord wasn\u2019t just a mouse and keyboard game. Any information that allowed one to make money or fix their errors could go for a lifetime.</p><br/><p>Approaching this information was easy.</p><br/><p>There were high-level players that released videos for free. One just had to contact them through the email.</p><br/><p>However, since An Jaehyun didn\u2019t have much money to spare, he hesitated. He never thought he needed to buy information for something as basic as Skeleton Underlings. He wanted to think about it after hitting level 10 in the Training Dungeon, but it seemed that he was too na\u00efve.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, if I\u2019m going to do this\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun thought of his bank account. He didn\u2019t have much left from everything he had to buy; furthermore, the amount left was what he had to work with for the next 3 months. It wasn\u2019t an easy decision to spend a large sum now, but he knew he had no other choice.</p><br/><p>\u2018might as well do it well.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>It had been 11 months since the launch of Warlord. The highest level player was the level 85 player Sulwoo, titled First One. The current Top 100 Level Ranking ranged from level 79 to Sulwoo\u2019s 85.</p><br/><p>However, it wouldn\u2019t be wrong to introduce oneself as a Ranker if one\u2019s level went above 70. If one\u2019s level just went over 60, one could call oneself a top level player. The time they spent in the virtual world was no less than the time they spent in the real world.</p><br/><p>Helgen. He was a necromancer who had reached level 61 in such an environment. He was most likely the current highest leveled necromancer, and his YouTube channel had over 300,000 subscribers. From his free-video ads and paid-video revenues, he made over ten million won every month.</p><br/><p>His side job was coaching. There wasn\u2019t much information about the necromancer class, making his know-hows extremely popular.</p><br/><p>His know-how lessons were split into stages, and the lowest of them was a million won. Earning so much for a lesson video may seem like a con, but the demand was high. People who played necromancer weren\u2019t in the right mind in the first place. Plus, he didn\u2019t just send a lesson video. He also gave feedback on any question one might have. He even met some buyers in-game and helped them out. This was big. Some people paid hundreds of thousands of won just to see female VJs act cutesy on stream.</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun paid for this reason.</p><br/><p>Because of the recent rise in won-to-dollar conversion rate, he paid close to 1.1 million won.</p><br/><p>He immediately received a video from Helgen. His video contained various, detailed tips vital for necromancers. An Jaehyun first watched the Skeleton Fragment skill part from the various summoning magic available.</p><br/><p>\u2013 This part is on the Skeleton Fragment skill.</p><br/><p>In the video was a man wearing a huge, snakeskin robe. Behind him stood twelve skeletons at attention.</p><br/><p>\u2013 Skeletons have excellent Combat AI. At the same time, they have excellent learning ability.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcellent my ass.\u201d</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun commented while watching the video with a stern, serious expression.</p><br/><p>\u2013 In the beginning, if you summon a Skeleton Warrior and order it to attack, my words may sound like a lie.</p><br/><p>Snap!</p><br/><p>Along with those words, Helgen snapped his finger once. Then, the Skeleton Warriors behind him held their shields up front and held themselves in a defensive stance. Because their boney bodies weren\u2019t big, their bodies were perfectly hidden behind the shields.</p><br/><p>\u2013 The problem is that although they have high intelligence, they have little knowledge. Another problem is that battle itself is a very complicated thing. If someone were to tell you to watch an MMA match and write an essay on all of the moves, you would be hard pressed to do so. It\u2019s the same with skeletons. If you tell them to do something so complicated when they\u2019ve never experienced it, they would never understand how. That\u2019s why there is a Defense Mode and an Attack Mode.</p><br/><p>At this part, An Jaehyun let out a realization.</p><br/><p>\u2018I see.\u2019</p><br/><p>The explanation continued.</p><br/><p>\u2013 It is important to train them in their Defense Mode first. Defense Mode isn\u2019t hard at all. The skeletons just have to use shields to block their opponents\u2019 attacks. It lessens the damage done to the player.</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun understood.</p><br/><p>\u2018Defense is easy to learn, and if you can defend well, you can more easily read your opponents.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was no way a master like An Jaehyun wouldn\u2019t know the importance of defense.</p><br/><p>Even the brainless Skeleton Warrior should be able to learn how to defend.</p><br/><p>Plus, once you\u2019re able to defend, you can read the enemy\u2019s next move. Opponents react to how one defends. They might try to pierce directly through the defense, or they might try to bypass it. They might even choose not to attack and wait. Of these 3, the defender only had to deal with 2 of them. If the opponent tried to pierce through the defense, the defender had to endure it. If the opponent tried to bypass the defense, the defender had to stop him from doing so.</p><br/><p>If the opponent managed to pierce through, that\u2019s that.</p><br/><p>But if the defender managed to hold out successfully, there was a chance for a counterattack. It may not be easy to succeed in counterattacking, but it wasn\u2019t a hard thing to do. It was simple, yet difficult.</p><br/><p>As An Jaehyun was thinking this, Helgen began to command his Skeleton Warriors for a demonstration. He showed himself directing his Skeleton Warriors hunt a monster. After they had blocked the monster with their shields, they used the opening to pierce through the monster with their spears. Their form of raising their shields again showed absolute discipline.</p><br/><p>-Through trial and error in battles, the Skeleton Warriors grow quickly. By the time you get to level 20, they should be able to fight better than most players. Then, you\u2019ll realize what excellent AI they possess.</p><br/><p>Defend first, attack after.</p><br/><p>That was Helgen\u2019s know-how for handling Skeleton Warriors. It wasn\u2019t anything hard once one knew it, but before one heard it, it was hard to understand.</p><br/><p>Helgen did his money\u2019s worth. He went on to explain the best way to enhance Skeleton Warriors\u2019 Combat AI. What monsters to fight with, what level difference was best, what monsters were best for creating Skeleton Warrior cores, etc. An Jaehyun truly felt his money was well spent.</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2019s good. It\u2019s worth the money.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was a reason Helgen was a good necromancer.</p><br/><p>Consumers didn\u2019t spend money on content they would lose money on. Conversely, if it was worth the money, they didn\u2019t hesitate to splurge.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why was someone like this unpopular?\u2019</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun was also curious.</p><br/><p>At this point, even if not one of the top Rankers, a level 60 necromancer should be famous to a certain degree. But why was a player like this not in An Jaehyun\u2019s memories? If he was at least decent, An Jaehyun should have remembered him.</p><br/><p>There were two possibilities.</p><br/><p>First was that he quit Warlord. The second was that he reached a limit.</p><br/><p>\u2018Warlord isn\u2019t a game you can quit because you want to. Not unless you run into an unjust problem.\u2019</p><br/><p>This was the main point.</p><br/><p>Helgen\u2019s method wasn\u2019t bad. It was both logical and effective. Defend first, attack after. With this method, he trained his skeletons to be soldiers.</p><br/><p>\u2018But this is only effective on small fries.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was a huge flaw in this system. Defend first meant one had to give the opponent the first attack. It was fine versus weaker monsters. However, it was a different story for large-type monsters that were above one\u2019s level and even had a fierce spec. There was a high chance the skeletons wouldn\u2019t be able to endure that first hit.</p><br/><p>\u2018Rich Lich covered this problem with money.\u2019</p><br/><p>By pouring money into the game, Rich Lich raised his Skeleton Warriors\u2019 specs to an unprecedented level. It was something no one else could do.</p><br/><p>In other words!</p><br/><p>\u2018This is not the way to go.\u2019</p><br/><p>With Helgen\u2019s style, he would only remain an ordinary necromancer. It wasn\u2019t the path for An Jaehyun.</p><br/><p>But An Jaehyun wasn\u2019t disappointed. In fact, this matter gave him a certain confidence.</p><br/><p>\u2018They aren\u2019t stupid.\u2019</p><br/><p>What An Jaehyun was most worried about was that his Skeleton Warrior\u2019s Combat AI was lower than his expectation. Thanks to Helgen, he learned that it wasn\u2019t that Skeleton Warriors lacked intelligence, but that they lacked knowledge.</p><br/><p>They were like blank slates, ready to absorb any knowledge.</p><br/><p>\u2018Absorb\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun stood up. He grabbed a mouth full of glucose candy, then put on his V-Gear.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s do some dancing.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>Thwack!</p><br/><p>With a harsh, resounding sound, the Skeleton Warrior\u2019s head flew off. It was flailing its arms around to regain balance when Hyrkan sent a low kick to its knee.</p><br/><p>Thud!</p><br/><p>With another resounding sound, the Skeleton Warrior fell on the ground as Hyrkan yelled towards the Skeleton Warrior.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet up!\u201d</p><br/><p>At his words, the Skeleton Warrior got up and picked his head up before plopping it back on his head.</p><br/><p>The skeleton\u2019s eyes, made up of blue flames, were shaped into Xs, making it look rather cute.</p><br/><p>But Hyrkan did not laugh looking at its state. He didn\u2019t sneer or scoff at it either. As soon as its eyes returned to normal, Hyrkan sent another punch to its head. This time, the Skeleton Warrior tilted its head to the side, avoiding the punch.</p><br/><p>Thwack!</p><br/><p>But when Hyrkan bent his elbow, it met with the Skeleton Warrior\u2019s head. Its head was shaken up, and during the time the Skeleton Warrior stood dazed, Hyrkan swiped his leg at its ankle. The Skeleton Warrior\u2019s body became parallel to the ground before it fell with a thud.</p><br/><p>Rattle rattle!</p><br/><p>The sound of bones hitting each other resounded out from its body.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan yelled at such Skeleton Warrior.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you get hit, don\u2019t just stand there! Move! Be wary and continue dodging!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Skeleton Warrior gave no reply; instead, it just stared blankly at Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>In reality, this was to be expected. Skeleton Warriors couldn\u2019t attack their master. In other words, Hyrkan\u2019s Skeleton Warrior couldn\u2019t counterattack to any of Hyrkan\u2019s attacks.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan knew this as well. All he wanted was for it to dodge his attacks.</p><br/><p>\u2018The defend first, attack second method won\u2019t work in the long-run, when you start fighting proper monsters.\u2019</p><br/><p>Defend first, attack second did not work.</p><br/><p>Then?</p><br/><p>\u2018Dodge first, attack second is the answer.\u2019</p><br/><p>The best way was to evade the first attack. Dodge instead of being hit. Dodging was also a way of defense, but it was totally different from blocking.</p><br/><p>If this failed?</p><br/><p>\u2018If this fails, I\u2019ll quit the necromancer class and restart as a swordsman. It\u2019s a waste of time and money, but it\u2019s better than throwing away my second chance.\u2019</p><br/><p>Give up when needed.</p><br/><p>What won\u2019t work will never work.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan swung his fist at the Skeleton Warrior that had stood back up. It was the same attack route as the previous time, and the Skeleton Warrior dodged the punch by tilting its head to the side. Hyrkan then bent his elbow. The Skeleton Warrior bent down, increasing its evasion radius and successfully avoiding Hyrkan\u2019s elbow.</p><br/><p>Whish!</p><br/><p>Hyrkan immediately swiped his leg at its ankle, but the Skeleton Warrior easily avoided it by lifting its foot.</p><br/><p>However, as soon as Hyrkan\u2019s legs came back around, he swung his other leg around in a huge motion.</p><br/><p>Whish!</p><br/><p>The Skeleton Warrior bent its body back, avoiding the kick.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>Thud!</p><br/><p>It fell to the ground. Because it bent back too far, it had lost its balance.</p><br/><p>Watching this, Hyrkan\u2019s let out a slight smile.</p><br/><p>\u2018Not bad.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was absorbing everything. The Skeleton Warrior had a surprising advantage as well. Because it was only bones, its joints had much better maneuverability. Even if its joints got dislocated, it could easily restore itself.</p><br/><p>It had all the right conditions for evading well. It just had to use its head and utilize its advantages.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan!</p><br/><p>It just needed to be around his level.</p><br/><p>If it could\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018If there\u2019s ten like me, that\u2019s a real dream-team.\u2019</p><br/><p>Grin!</p><br/><p>Hyrkan\u2019s slight smile had now turned into a full grin.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan touched his wristwatch and activated its music app. Immediately, music filled his surroundings.</p><br/><p>It was one of Michael Jackson\u2019s masterpieces, Billie Jean.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, it\u2019s time to dance.\u201d</p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

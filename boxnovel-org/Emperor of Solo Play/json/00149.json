I got the Frost! \u00a0Ooh-ha-ha-ha!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had caught the Frost Knight 8 hours ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He immediately logged out after finishing the Frost Knight Raid. \u00a0When he came back to reality, he went straight to sleep.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't as if he didn't have work to do. \u00a0Actually, he had too many things on his agenda to do. \u00a0He had to organize the footages he recorded, then he had to check what was going on in Warlord. \u00a0He also had to calculate his bottom line.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he just went straight to sleep. \u00a0It was true that he was tired from the Frost Knight Raid, but that wasn't the deciding factor. \u00a0There was another reason.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His head was too crowded with miscellaneous thoughts. \u00a0The inside of his head was a jumbled mess, and he couldn't organize his thoughts in his tired state. \u00a0This was the reason why he had slept.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then 8 hours had passed.... \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the longest sleep he had in the past year, so his head felt clearer than ever. \u00a0Ahn-jaehyun could easily process the various types of joy he felt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Ahn-jaehyun was able to savor his own overflowing happiness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Well, let's see the effect of the Frost\u2026 \u00a0It can pretty much be used on anything.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The most joyous part was the fast that he had gained the Ancient Power of Frost.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, the Ancient Power could only be used on Rank A Skills. \u00a0He couldn't use it on the Skills he had gained recently. \u00a0On the other hand, it could be used on the Skills that he used as his main power. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I guess the the Skeletons would change first. \u00a0I wonder what kind of effect it would have on them?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had no idea what effect would be applied to them. \u00a0He just knew it'll be powerful. \u00a0He was filled with happiness just from thinking about it. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this wasn't the end to his good news.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I do well on this Frozen Kingdom episode, I can get over 3 million purchases on my paid video.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, the part he was anticipating the most in the Frozen Kingdom episode was the profit from selling his paid video. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before Ahn-jaehyun returned to the past, the Stormhunters guild didn't broadcast the Frozen Kingdom episode live. \u00a0The entire episode was filmed, and edited. \u00a0Then they put the film on their live channel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the time, live broadcasts were considered to be the best way to deliver a content. \u00a0However, the Stormhunters decided to try a new method. \u00a0Since it was new, it was risky. \u00a0However, this attempt lead them to striking gold.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, they didn't succeed just because they attempted something new. \u00a0The Frozen Kingdom episode was played over a 15 day period, yet they edited it down to 3 hours of footage. \u00a0Moreover, the video wasn't just done as if it was footage from a game. \u00a0They planned out the scenario and plot. \u00a0They produced it like a real movie. \u00a0In this process, the Stormhunters had hired a famous Hollywood director. \u00a0They basically created a movie using the Warlord as stage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018At the time, they had sold an incredible 3.9 million tickets to the paid broadcast.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been a huge success! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Frozen Kingdom episode film put out by the Stormhunters didn't get nominated in the Academy awards or Cannes film festival, but it did gain entrance in some famous film festivals. It received favorable review. \u00a0This wasn\u2019t something one just forgot about after seeing it once. \u00a0It was accepted as a piece of art.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, no one had attempted this yet. \u00a0If one wanted to attempt this, one needed a Main Scenario Quest type story to pull it off. \u00a0However, no guild had monopolized the Corrupt Count or the Immoral Prince episode. \u00a0The Hydra guild had attempted to monopolize the Corrupt Count episode, but in the end, they weren't able to kill the most important figure, the Corrupt Count. \u00a0This pretty much nullified their attempt at a monopoly of a content. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be possible to make one with the Immoral Prince episode, but any deal needed the Hahoe Mask's approval.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Ahn-jaehyun's attempt at this would be awesome and fresh to the audiences.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he was looking forward to this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I wonder if the Romani Films would be able to digest this.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, this was a full-length film. \u00a0This would require a lot more professional editing than a regular movie. \u00a0It was possible that the Romani film might become overwhelmed by this task.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the production cost would skyrocket. \u00a0He had to expect the cost to be in the range of being able to buy one or two mid-sized sedans.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Whatever.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Ahn-jaehyun had enough money to pay it off in a lump sum.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It's been advertised properly. \u00a0I'll have to do this even if I have to empty my bank account.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Main Scenario Quest's content had suddenly changed, but on the other hand, Warlord had given out an incredible free advertisement for Hyrkan. \u00a0Everyone would be anticipating the new footage from the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0They'll be curious as to how the Hahoe Mask had opened a new era.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he got past this part, he wouldn't have to spend money on Items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There aren't that many level 200 Items available, and I wouldn't immediately have to spend money in purchasing those Items.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the past, he had to change his Item setting every time he leveled up. \u00a0Moreover, it wasn't just about upgrading the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0He also had to take care of each of his Skeletons too, and he had to figuratively sell his spine to equip them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this wasn't the case any more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Ruined Kingdom episode had just started, and the Items above level 200 would start to come out in earnest. \u00a0These would be Items for the Users that went through the 2nd Advancement. \u00a0In other words, Ahn-jaehyun didn't have to purchase any more new Items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he needed to find a place where he needed to spend his money, it would be to equip the Death Knight he'll be able to summon soon. \u00a0This would be after he went through the 2nd Advancement to become a Lich. \u00a0However, it shouldn\u2019t cost too much.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'll have to give either the Crying Sword or the Dethrone King's Sword to the Death Knight.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knight was like a Lich's clone. \u00a0Basically, any permanent Items that were bound to the summoner could be equipped by the Death Knight. \u00a0If he wanted to, he could even put a Hahoe Mask on it. \u00a0Of course, the Death Knight wouldn't complain about being handed down used Items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, that was the most joyous part of all of this. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask will show the fastest progress starting now from the Ruined Kingdom episode. \u00a0The difference between the Hahoe Mask and the 30 great guilds would widen further.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he brushed his teeth, Ahn-jaehyun saw a rosy future in front of his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Should I move to a new place?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Should he move to an incredible penthouse? \u00a0It would look over the Han River. \u00a0Maybe he'll get the high-rise apartment where he'll be able to play the game with his V-Gear in front of the view of the Han River.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018\u2026\u2026No. \u00a0I have no problem playing this game here. \u00a0The internet speed is quite fast here. \u00a0Ah! \u00a0Maybe I should buy a car?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could fill the parking lot with expensive sports car, and he could take a different car out each day. \u00a0He thought about diligently playing a game with cool cars in a house with a garage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018\u2026\u2026however, there is no point in buying an expensive car right now. \u00a0I don't have anywhere I want to go, and I don't have the time. \u00a0Moreover, the insurance price would be high. \u00a0On top of that, the value of a car halves the moment I buy it. \u00a0So what should I do? \u00a0There must be a luxury item that I can splurge on right now. \u00a0What kind of luxury item do I want?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, he wasn't easily able to imagine this incredibly rosy future.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Yes. \u00a0I'll use this opportunity to buy the level 6 V-Gear! \u00a0I wonder what kind of expression the Peach Store employees will have when I buy the level 6 V-Gear with a single payment.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun could now properly imagine his rosy future. \u00a0He spat out the liquid through his smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he washed his face, Ahn-jaehyun put his glasses back on. He was in a good mood as he turned on his Tablet PC.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I bet it'll be plastered with stories about me.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was at that moment he saw it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? \u00a0What? \u00a0The Stormhunters?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had missed an incredible development during the 8 hours he was asleep.</span></p><br/><p>4.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a monster with a half-translucent body, and it had a red light that was surrounding its body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bastard could spit out endless amount of flame, and it was hot enough to melt anything in its path. \u00a0When the monster was at a disadvantage, it ascended to the top of the Urugal mountain, which was barren. \u00a0It was able to avoid any disadvantage by turning the summit into a lake of flame. \u00a0It also had the unreasonable ability to completely recover from large wounds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It also had the most health of any monster that had appeared up until now. \u00a0When it was angry, no one could take more than three attack from it. \u00a0It was that strong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blaze Slime Dragon! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It protected the summit of the Urugal mountain range, and it was a monster amongst monsters with various unreasonable settings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only logical part about this monster was the fact that the Tankers and Strikers could draw its Aggro. \u00a0Then the Magicians could do the damage dealing... \u00a0The only way to take it down was using this simple plan. \u00a0This simple plan that was needed to clear it was the only part that gave comfort to the participants.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, a marathon was a race where one ran for 42.195km. \u00a0In concept, it was a very simple sport, but the answer in how to finish it was tough to come up with. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no easy answer to defeating this monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why the strongest Users of Warlords, who had played Warlord for a number of years, gave up on this monster. \u00a0These Users had defeated countless monsters that had been called the strongest, yet they openly abandoned this raid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this monster had fallen in front of her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You've gained the Title 'One who Conquered the Urugal Mountain Range.'] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You've gained the Title 'Dragon Slayer.'] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You've gained the Title 'Owner of the Urugal Mountain Range.'] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Stormhunter Queen Shir. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Most of her silver armor had melted away from the effect of the Slime Dragon's Slime Breaths. \u00a0Even the skin underneath her armor was darkened. \u00a0Of course, her hair and face was burnt too. \u00a0She looked unsightly, and one couldn't even tell, who she was. \u00a0However, she was alive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was alive as she looked at the Slime Dragon's end. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-wah! \u00a0Ooh-wah!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were only two of them left. \u00a0Hatch was with her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe really caught it! \u00a0Ooh-wah!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In other words, they were the only two survivors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thirty Users had participated in the Blaze Dragon Raid, but their number quickly diminished as time passed. \u00a0There would be no reattempt after this. \u00a0The Slime Dragon's Breath targeted the Priests before they could do anything. \u00a0Even the Tankers couldn't survive against its attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cQueen! \u00a0We did it!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the dead didn't just stay silent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Hey! \u00a0Hatch! \u00a0Hatch! \u00a0What happened? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Has it ended? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Did we really catch it?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The dead Users were still using the Voice Talk from outside the game to speak to those still in the game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch answered them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe caught it!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At those words, cheer and silence started mixing with each other. \u00a0The Voice Talk turned into a bedlam. \u00a0Hatch had to hear all these sounds at once, and it was hellish to experience it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hatch enjoyed the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is crazy! \u00a0We did it!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had experienced failing this Raid once, and they also viewed the Raid footage from the other 30 great guilds. \u00a0With these information, they had come up with a battle strategy, but still it hadn't been easy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, this was the most difficult Boss Monster that the Stormhunters guild had come across.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The worst part was the new phase that no other team had reached before. \u00a0In an instant, the Blaze Slime Dragon had activated a self-destruct attack. \u00a0It used the Slime Buster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As it self-destructed, its body had become a huge bomb, and the fragments flew everywhere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The unexpected attack had done an incredible amount of damage. \u00a0This single attack had instantly killed 11 Users. \u00a0When they all suffered Game Over, Hatch wondered what dramas we would watch in the next 48 hours. \u00a0He thought nothing good would come out of this run.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Shir didn't give up in such a situation. \u00a0There would be no second chance for her. \u00a0She immediately drew the aggro of the Slime Dragon, and Hatch became in tune with her movements as he used his magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt as if they were throwing eggs at a boulder. \u00a0They were fighting for the sake of fighting, since they hadn't died.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the egg had eventually broken the boulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cQueen!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her appearance was unsightly, but at that moment, Shir really looked like the Queen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir replied when she saw Hatch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hatch!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Shir called his name, Hatch had a deep smile on his face as he opened both his arms. \u00a0In such a scene, didn't the surviving members suppose to hug each other?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Shir's hug wasn't what came towards Hatch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you know what this Ancient Power is?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?

It was an AOE attack, and it was incredibly powerful. \u00a0It was an AOE attack on the same tier as the Frost Fog he suffered at the end of his battle with the Frost Knight. \u00a0It wasn't something one could avoid. \u00a0It was an AOE attack where the only solution was to endure it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, Hyrkan had prior knowledge about these types of attacks, so he was able to plan for it. \u00a0However, the Stormhunters guild had gone in blind, and they had succeeded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this wasn't their first attempt. \u00a0They had pretty much perfected the method to clear the early and mid portion of the Raid, but it was still an incredible accomplishment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What is going on?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the more surprising part about this was the fact the Storm Queen obtained a Mythos Rank Ancient Power. \u00a0She had the biggest impact on the Blaze Slime Dragon Raid, so she had gained the Flame.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What changed?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If events followed like Hyrkan's memories, the Ruined Kingdom episode started when one conquered the summit of the Urugal mountain. \u00a0Afterwards, the Ancient Power content had appeared. \u00a0However, the Mythos Rank Ancient Power appeared two months after the Blaze Slime Dragon was taken down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Mythos Rank Ancient Power had appeared as a reward for clearing the Frost Knight and the Blaze Slime Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this wasn't too strange of an occurrence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Did they change the difficulty of the Quests?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">According to Tobot Soft, the AI selected the difficulty based on how fast the game was progressing. \u00a0Moreover, this determination process was so complex that developers wouldn't be able to change the difficulty on their own. \u00a0If they changed it, it would cause a System Error.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, this was the cumulative result of the recent events. \u00a0This was the answer given by Warlord to match the swift progress shown by the Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In other words, the information he knew wasn\u2019t the answer any more. \u00a0It can only be used as reference material.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan closed both his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Until a moment ago, he had been so happy in many ways that he couldn\u2019t get a handle on his thoughts. \u00a0However, his head was surprisingly cool right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have about 43% left before I reach level 200. \u00a0I don\u2019t have the Ifrit\u2019s Tears, but if I hunt as I travel towards the Terube castle wall\u2026.. \u00a0I\u2019ll be able to reach level 200 in one or two days.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His cool head had to face up to the reality.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t behind, but that didn\u2019t mean he was far ahead either.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wouldn\u2019t be running the race by himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, he had only one thing he could do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Yes, let\u2019s do this. \u00a0Let\u2019s see who gets trampled.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to sprint with all his might to shake off his competitors. \u00a0This was what Hyrkan had to do.</span></p><br/><p>Translator's Note</p><br/><p></p><ol><br/><p></p><li>\u00a0Go-dae means ancient, but it is also a shorthand way to refer to Goryeo university in Seoul. \u00a0 Goryeo=&gt;Go. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 University=&gt;Dae-hahk-gyo=&gt;Dae</li><br/><p></p></ol><br/>\n</div>"}

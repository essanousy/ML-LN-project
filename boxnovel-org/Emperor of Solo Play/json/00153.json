</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Surprisingly, the watch came off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Item Slot Change Mode has been deactivated.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The System Announcement immediately tickled his ears, and he grasped his wristwatch with his right hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hand and arm holding the wristwatch was shaking. \u00a0Hyrkan grasped the wristwatch as if he was about to crush it, and a black smoke started emanating from between his hand holding the wristwatch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From the top to the bottom, the smoke started to elongate, and the black smoke became a thin line. \u00a0Then the line started expanding as a space appeared in between the smoke. \u00a0There was a dark world beyond the smoke, and a being was starting to reveal itself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, a Knight wearing an armor that was made from bones of an unknown giant appeared from between this crack. \u00a0Then a sturdy Skeleton Steed made out of thick bones started to appear slowly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knight had appeared.</span></p><br/><p>8.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Steed was enormous, and the Death Knight was riding atop it. \u00a0The Death Knight's overpowering nature was ratched up from a 1 to a 10, and every factor that made up the Death Knight was overwhelming.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The first factor was its height! \u00a0One would have to look up to be able to see eye to eye with the Death Knight. \u00a0It was about 4 meters tall, and it had a massive build.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the Skeleton Armor worn by it was splendid and imposing. \u00a0It\u2019s appearance was so imposing that one had to question if the armor had any practical value. \u00a0Then there was the black smoke continuously coming out from between the armor. \u00a0It created a pool of smoke around the Death Knight, and it made any layman become wary. \u00a0It created an overpowering and ominous atmosphere. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The imposing Knight was on top of the Skeleton Steed, and it was as imposing as its master. \u00a0It was made entirely out of bone, yet black smoke came out of its snout. \u00a0It refused to hide its enraged spirit against the Skull Collector. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Steed was made out of bones, but the bones were so thick that \u00a0it didn\u2019t look skinny. \u00a0Moreover, the thick bones made it look as if the Steed\u2019s body was filled in. \u00a0This was the impression it gave off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knight tapped against the Skeleton Horse\u2019s side to calm down the beast. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the Death Knight wasn't planning on becoming a gentleman here. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After calming down the Skeleton Steed, the Death Knight unsheathed the sword hanging on its left hip, and it raised the shield that had been hanging on its back. \u00a0When the shield was removed, a red cape founds its freedom, and it billowed out behind it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knight pointed its sword towards the battlefield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Special Skill \u2018Leader\u2019 has been activated.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When it pointed its sword, Skeletons started exiting out of the pool of black smoke around the Death Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Knight showed itself first. \u00a0Afterwards, 9 Skeleton Warriors and two Skeleton Magician charged out of the black pool. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the effect of the Special Skill called Leader.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Death Knight was summoned, it could automatically summon Skeletons including a knights, and it didn't consume any additional magical energy. \u00a0At the same time, the Death Knight\u2019s Stats increased as the number of Skeleton Knight and Skeleton Warriors was summoned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The biggest advantage was the fact that the Skeletons summoned by the Death Knight didn\u2019t count against how many the Necromancer could summon. \u00a0In a flash, he would be able to summon 12 additional Skeletons. \u00a0Of course, \u00a0a single Special Skill wasn\u2019t the end of of splendor displayed by the Death Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Special Skill \u2018Undying\u2019 has been activated.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Special Skill, Undying, was the pool of black smoke that formed when the Death Knight was summoned. \u00a0The Skeletons within this pool wasn\u2019t able to die. \u00a0It could receive critical damage, yet it will recover. \u00a0Moreover, it didn\u2019t consume any magical energy to repair the Skeletons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the Undying skill did consume the magical energy of the summoner to maintain itself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Special Skill \u2018Fear\u2019 has been activated.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The last Special Skill was Fear, and it was the Fear attack that was commonly used by Undead types or Spirit type monsters. \u00a0It couldn\u2019t affect monsters that didn\u2019t feel fear, but all other monsters were struck with fear of death. \u00a0It was a debuff skill that decreased the enemy\u2019s mobility speed by 20%.. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had various Curse skills that stacked, and it could be used against Boss Monsters</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Special Skill \u2018Chivalry\u2019 has been activated.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Special Skill \u2018Commander\u2019 has been activated.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the appearance of the Skeleton Knight activated its two Special Skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The result was overpowering in many aspects! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chal-kahk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan once again put on his watch after seeing the result.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Everything is great, but there\u2019s a problem.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, this was the biggest problem concerning the summon of a Death Knight. \u00a0Unlike the other summons, the summon of a Death Knight took several steps that consumed time. \u00a0In a dire situation, he wouldn\u2019t be able to summon it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, Hyrkan didn\u2019t hurry his actions. \u00a0He slowly put on his wristwatch, and glove.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He looked full of bravado from afar, but Hyrkan\u2019s action looked dignified to those watching up close.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As in evidence, Queeng\u2019s party members gulped when they saw his actions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan looked elegant. \u00a0It was if he was in a play as he put on his watch in a relaxed manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While he was putting his watch back on, the had already started.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The \u00a0Death Knight pointed its sword towards the battlefield, and it kicked the Skeleton Steed hard on its belly. \u00a0As if it had been waiting for it, the Skeleton Steed charged towards the battlefield. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-baht, pah-baht! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was running like the wind. \u00a0The Skeleton Knight and Skeleton Warriors charged behind it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The summoned familiars of the Skull Collector gathered as if they were trying to create a wall to intercept the enemies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During that time, Hyrkan had thrown his Skeleton Fragment as if he was throwing chips at a casino. \u00a0He lightly threw it in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chwa-ahk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Fragment was spread in a fan shape, and they started to take shape.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had scattered 8 Skeleton Fragments, and all 8 of them weren\u2019t holding sword. \u00a0The Skeleton was wearing robes, and they were holding staffs. \u00a0They were all Skeleton Magicians.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After they formed, the Skeleton Magicians looked at the battlefield. \u00a0They were waiting for an order, and Hyrkan gave that order.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddahk ddahk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan started the battle accompanying the short command.</span></p><br/><p>9.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Death Knight appeared, the Skull Collector had thrown the 4th skull around its neck to the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While the skull rolled across the floor, the Death Knight swung its sword towards the second familiar summoned by the Skull Collector. \u00a0It swung its sword towards the Lizard Warrior, which was made out of dirt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skull Collector's familiars were able to receive three powerful blows from magicians that had finished their 2nd Advancement. \u00a0It wouldn't be easy to cut through a familiar with a single sword strike.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shweeeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the Death Knight's single sword strike easily cut through the arm of the familiar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chul-puh-duhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the familiar's severed arm fell to the floor, the Skeleton Steed trampled it. \u00a0It was as if it was high stepping as the Skeleton Steed changed direction. \u00a0It moved on its own as it was mindful of its owner's next strike. \u00a0The Skeleton Steed repositioned itself, so the Death Knight could unleash its next blow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if to answer the Skeleton Steed\u2019s consideration, the Death Knight stabbed deep into the armless familiar of the Skull Collector.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, everyone that was watching was taken aback.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018How high is its attack?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018How is such a thing possible?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, everyone was shocked at the Death Knight\u2019s fearsome attack capabilities.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it wasn't as if all Death Knights could show such overwhelming firepower.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It better earn its keep. \u00a0I could buy an apartment with the amount of money I spent on its setting.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knight was holding the Deposed Prince's Sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One of the strongest sword in existence in Warlord was being used by a Death Knight. \u00a0Moreover, it was summoned by the strongest Necromancer Hyrkan. \u00a0This was the result of these two factors meshing together. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it wasn't effective to cut the body parts of an Undead type monsters. It didn't cause much drop in its HP. \u00a0The Undead monsters recovered pretty quickly from those wounds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why one needed magic to do sure damage!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Magical spells were flying towards the battlefield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was 10 spells instead of one! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the result of Hyrkan summoning 8 Skeleton Magicians, and the Death Knight summoned 2 Skeleton Magicians.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roo! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ten fireballs sizzled as it flew in an arc, and it didn't bother with differentiating between allies and enemies. \u00a0The Skeleton Warriors lead by the Death Knight, and the Skull Collector's summoned familiars were swept up in the conflagration.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng, kwahng, puh-uhng, puh-uhng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the sound created by the detonation of 10 magical spells. \u00a0The accumulation of such sounds was very loud to the Users watching this sight. \u00a0It made them furrow their eyebrows.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pandemonium! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the large explosion, the surrounding was roiling with flame. \u00a0The group of Skeletons and the group controlled by the Skull Collector were all in a sorry state.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, as time passed, the flame died down, and the Skeleton Warriors and Knight regained their dignified appearance. \u00a0The summoned familiars of the Skull Collector were barely able to keep themselves together. \u00a0They were still in their sorry state.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Undying! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unless the Death Knight was taken down, the Skill wouldn\u2019t allow the Skeleton Warriors and Knight to be destroyed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy god.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Priest, who was Queeng\u2019s peer, let out those words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he wasn\u2019t a real priest. \u00a0In reality, he was a software programmer, and he was an atheist. \u00a0Whenever he had to use a Priest\u2019s Skill that had an incantation, he had to pray towards a deity. \u00a0He always had an expression of repulsion every time he repeated the incantation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, at that moment, it was as if he had found a god inside the game. \u00a0The sight in front of him looked like a completely different from the game he had been playing up until now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he wasn\u2019t the only one that was gloomy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The three Magicians was watching from behind Hyrkan, and they were more depressed than surprised.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What kind of magical fire power...\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018How much damage dealing can he do?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The continuous barrage of powerful magic from the 10 Skeleton Magicians was the root of their depression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it one went simply by power of one's magic, the Skeleton Magicians couldn't compare to a real Magician no matter how many there were. \u00a0The three magicians gathered here could, at the very least, show twice the damage shown by the 10 Skeleton Magicians.... \u00a0In reality, they could actually deal three times the damage. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, that was the problem. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fact that they could make a comparison was a problem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Magicians were only a portion of Hyrkan's power, yet they could be compared to a magician that had finished one's 2nd Advancement. \u00a0This hurt the pride of the magicians!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, this was something intentionally done by Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Don't you dare attack me. \u00a0I'll humiliate anyone that does in my video.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was using this battle as a warning to anyone that was planning on coming after him.</span></p><br/><p>10.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Collector's summoned familiars hadn't fared well against the continuous magic bombardment by the Skeleton Magicians. \u00a0Naturally, the battle turned into a one on one battle between the Skull Collector and the Death Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This battle was different from any battle shown by Hyrkan's Skeleton up until now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a horse involved.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, it wasn't an ordinary horse. \u00a0The Skeleton Steed used its incredible charging and leaping abilities to its advantage. \u00a0It even showed off an incredible trick by jumping over the Skull Collector. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These tricks weren't all for show.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Skeleton Steed jumped over it, the Skull Collector had no choice, but to turn its body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the Death Knight used this to get through the Skull Collector's defense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Skull Collector turned its body, the Death Knight stabbed at its shoulder. \u00a0The Skeleton Steed let out a black smoke from its snout as it immediately charged towards a wall. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skull Collector's body hit the wall, and a large sound emanated from the blow. \u00a0The Skull Collector was buried within the wall, and it was having a hard time moving.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shweek, poo-oohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skull Collector tirelessly stabbed and slashed its sword towards the Death Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It looked as if the Skull Collector had been driven into a corner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koohng! \u00a0Koohng! \u00a0Koohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While the Death Knight swung its sword, the Skeleton Steed unleashed a short, but powerful headbutts against the Skull Collector's body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It was as I saw in the Rich Lich videoes. \u00a0The Death Knight's AI capability is on a different level.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan knew better than anyone how scary a Death Knight was in battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was the beneficiary of the Death Knight's battle capability, but it was powerful enough to give him goosebumps.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I had to catch a monster of this caliber\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this wasn't free by any means.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It is very gluttonous in its consumption of magic.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan bit down on the Magic Recovery Candy hidden inside his mouth, and he carefully swallowed it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The flow of the battle was overwhelmingly in Hyrkan's favor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, Hyrkan's magical energy was being consumed as if there was no tomorrow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fact that he had summoned 10 Skeleton Magicians signaled he wasn't planning on doing this battle through only his own magical energy. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeletons recovered thanks to the Undying Skill of the Death Knight, and each recovery didn\u2019t cost him any magical energy. \u00a0On the other hand, the magical consumption for maintaining the Undying was high.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, if he released the power of Frost, he wouldn't be able to maintain his battle capability even \u00a0if he used his recovery Items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I head across the Urugal mountain range..... \u00a0I'll have to find Inoogas.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan didn\u2019t try to conserve his magical energy. \u00a0Instead, he spread 10 more Skeleton Fragments on the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After taking shape, the Skeleton Warriors were ready to charge into the battlefield. \u00a0Queen and her party members were no longer surprised by this. \u00a0They unconsciously let out a long sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were the expression Hyrkan wanted to evoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the audiences saw his footage, their expressions would be identical to the ones on Queeng and her party.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Hyrkan ate another Magic Recovery Candy hidden in his mouth. \u00a0Even the 30 great guild Raid teams hesitated to use such expensive consumables, yet he had just eaten another one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This really tastes nasty.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For reference, the candy tasted like Chinese herbal medicine.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In many ways, this battle was bitter to his mouth.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

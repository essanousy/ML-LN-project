Whistling\u2019s chest, turned, and she started to run towards an unknown destination. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t just a single Elf. \u00a0\u00a0Numerous Elves, who looked similar to a pink colored buds of a cherry blossom, was running through the forest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You have acquired the title \u2018The Great Benefactor of the Elves\u2019.] </span></p><br/><p><span

Announcement regarding the acquisition of his Titles. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Announcement would have given goosebumps to most Users. \u00a0This might be one of handful of Titles coveted the most in terms of worth. \u00a0The eyes of most Users would have flipped around from jealousy. \u00a0It was a valuable Title. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the value of the Title didn\u2019t register in Whistling\u2019s ears or eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were at a half-moon shaped lake located in the southeast region of the Black Continent. \u00a0It was called the Ohokal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The lake was a stage with a forest filled with cherry blossom trees next to it. \u00a0The region was always fragrant, and it always gave off a fresh feeling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Simia tribe was an Elven tribe, who decided to reside in this region. \u00a0They wore outfits that went very well with their surrounding. \u00a0The Elves of the Simia tribe always had on accessories that reminded one of a cherry blossom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the surface, this region looked very beautiful, but it was crawling with monsters over Level 220.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, even amongst such difficulties, the Simia tribe protected and maintained their way of life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, a being that the Elves wouldn\u2019t be able to win against was coming towards their lands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Barbarian King! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Stormhunters guild had awakened this monster about a month ago, and it was roaming around the Black Continent. \u00a0Every region it passed through turned into hell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the Barbarian King had brought several thousand monsters, and they were getting ready to cross the Ohokal Lake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the Simia tribe decided to fight back against the Barbarian King. \u00a0They decided to mount a defense for their land by the lake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They would meet their end here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOppa!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They\u2019ll fall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Whistling didn\u2019t want to make such guarantees, but the Simia tribe wouldn\u2019t be able to defend their land from the Barbarian King. \u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The System called Warlord wouldn\u2019t allow it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Warlord\u2019s System would only allow Users to defeat the Barbarian King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This truth was revealed by the Steel Lion Knights, who crossed the Urugal mountain range. \u00a0They cut through the wall of Level 240 monsters like butter to reach the Barbarian King, but they were crushed in a horrible manner. \u00a0The Barbarian King hadn\u2019t received even a scratch in the fight, and it gave credence to this truth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Whistling couldn\u2019t accept the excuse that this was merely a game. \u00a0He wouldn\u2019t take this situation lying down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYojori! \u00a0Joba! \u00a0You guys get out of here!\u201d

style=\"\">After hearing his words, Yojori and Joba had the same expression on their faces. \u00a0They were dumbfounded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling wanted to stop the Barbarian King?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There had already been many attempts to pull off such a feat. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Numerous Raid teams were formed for the purpose of killing the Barbarian King. \u00a0These were raid attempts with a good deal of preparation and forethought behind it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All of them failed miserably.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reason why the Barbarian King was coming to this place was the fact that all previous Raid Teams had failed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yet he wanted to stop the Barbarian King?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was an absolutely absurd statement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOk. \u00a0Let\u2019s do this.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe worst that can happen is a Game Over. \u00a0Let us fight together. \u00a0Anyways, our Quest is gone, because of the Barbarian King.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe act of walking back to the Heard Fortress ruin town will be arduous. \u00a0Let\u2019s just die and get sent there at once.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe can\u2019t turn back now. \u00a0We have to try something. \u00a0Absolutely!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Yojori and Joba had already evaluated the situation that\u2019ll unfold soon. \u00a0Their faces relaxed, and they put on bright expressions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling gritted his teeth at their words. \u00a0The two of them were choosing to suffer through a Game Over for him. \u00a0He was thankful, and he was sorry. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, at that moment, Whistling didn\u2019t express those two feelings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0Let us become heroes for once.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They would show their will. \u00a0Their will was inelegant and worthless, but they would express their will.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was no way they would become heroes.</span></p><br/><p>5.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You Level has

</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You\u2019ve acquired the Title \u2018Slaughterer of the Tattoo Scorpions\u2019.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were so many consecutive System Announcement that it was almost tiring to hear it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Each accumulation of these Announcements was good news, but Hyrkan\u2019s ears didn\u2019t pay attention to the sound.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He raised his head, and he looked at the monster he was stepping on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His foot was on the Tattoo Scorpion\u2019s tail. \u00a0It was a 7 meters long monster with tattoos all over its body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Doohk ddoohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big drops of poison was falling from the tip of the Tattoo Scorpion\u2019s tail. \u00a0It was the size of a man\u2019s head. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan\u2019s HP slowly fell as the poison dripped. \u00a0Hrykan bit down on the red candy inside his mouth. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying a taste akin to a spicy garlic, his HP started to rise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since he had a time for a breather, Hyrkan looked at his defensive set. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t invincible, but the spotted armor had more defense than any other defensive set in Warlord. \u00a0However, the Dark Spot set had holes in various locations right now, and the holes were the size of the stinger on the Tattoo Scorpion\u2019s tail.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It is time for me to change it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dark Spot set.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had used it for a very long time, and it was finally time to say goodbye to this Item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a late goodbye. \u00a0Even if it was a very good Item, it was only a level 180 set, yet it was being used in a level 260 hunting ground. \u00a0If one expected one to be fine using such an Item here, one would be expecting too much. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was also the reason why he was killing the Tattoo Scorpions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Well, I\u2019ll have to use this opportunity to switch out everything.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tattoo Scorpion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a mid-sized Level 260 Monster. \u00a0When one went deeper into the Red Desert, one would arrive at the Red Wasteland. \u00a0One could encounter this monster there, and it was the highest Level monster encountered by Users in Warlord as of now. \u00a0Moreover, it had the best Option amongst Rare Rank Items that could be crafted from normal monsters over Level 240.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The best feature activated when one wore all 5 parts. \u00a0The effect of the Tattoo Scorpion\u2019s Tattoo Pattern was quite good.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When one attacked, it could impose a Poison Status on one\u2019s opponent. \u00a0Moreover, the poison was quite powerful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan decided to use this opportunity to equip all his Skeletons with the Tattoo Scorpion Set.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been about a month, since the Barbarian King had appeared, and this was why Hyrkan had stuck to hunting only the Tattoo Scorpions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now he was reaping the benefit of staying in this location for a month.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had reached Level 253.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One could find Hyrkan\u2019s name in the Level Rankings now. \u00a0There was only a 12 level gap between him and the First One.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he had gathered a lot of Items. \u00a0He had obtained enough Items to equip 30 Skeletons with a full set. \u00a0Thirty sounded small, but each set had five parts. \u00a0Basically, he had acquired 150 Rare Items. \u00a0\u00a0Normal Users wouldn\u2019t even be able to imagine the process involved in killing so many Tattoo Scorpions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Hyrkan was able to earn a profit through the footage. \u00a0Hyrkan poured his money into this hunt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t as rich as the old Rich Lich, but it wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that Hyrkan was spending as much as him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Despite this fact, Hyrkan\u2019s account was in the surplus. \u00a0Even as he went nuts in spending his money, there was always money left in Hyrkan\u2019s Wallet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the best.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His incredible Level Up pace had him in spitting distance to First One, who was 1st in the rankings. \u00a0His free-handed investments allowed him to quickly raise the Skill Ranks, and he had \u00a0acquired Level 250 Rare Items by killing powerful monsters. \u00a0All of this process was being consumed by voracious viewers. \u00a0His viewers didn\u2019t hesitate to pay for his content. \u00a0They wanted to see everything he did.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While he was doing all of this, the Black Continent was slowly descending into hell thanks to the efforts of the Barbarian King. \u00a0All of Hahoe Mask\u2019s competitors were being killed under the tyrannical rule of the Barbarian King. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahoe Mask was leaving everyone in the dust.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This situation was unbelievably great for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he realized he had returned to the past, he had been really glad that he would be able to play this game again. \u00a0At the time, he could have never imagined that he would reach such an optimal situation, yet Hyrkan had climbed to the top.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So why was he feeling this way? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7this is boring.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A yawn came out of his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had achieved the goal he had always pined for. \u00a0Riches and fame was within his grasp, and it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say he was the best in this game. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the recent Tattoo Scorpion Hunt was the most boring period of time he had experienced since he started Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I was never bored when I fought against the Stormhunters guild\u2026.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a first.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Hyrkan played Warlord, the game sometimes made him annoyed and angry. \u00a0There were many instances where he swore at the game. \u00a0However, he never thought that the game of Warlord was boring.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even when he was warring with the Stormhunters guild, \u00a0he cussed them out in anger. \u00a0He was sick and tired of them. \u00a0However, he never thought the game was boring.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he killed five to six guild members of the Stormhunters guild, he felt joy. \u00a0He felt happy when he broke through the tribulation in the style of the Hero Slaughterer. \u00a0\u00a0He had enjoyed Warlord in those moments.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan turned his head. \u00a0His surrounding was filled Skeleton Warriors, who had been brilliant in their fight against the Tattoo Scorpions. \u00a0The Skeleton Warriors were staring back at him. \u00a0They were waiting for their master to give a new order.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Now that I think about it, they fight intelligently even without my training.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He thought about a fond memory of his. In the beginning, he had ruthlessly pushed the Skeleton Warriors to train them. \u00a0However, they no longer needed his training. \u00a0The Skeleton\u2019s Combat AI was a finished product. \u00a0It was splendid. \u00a0The repeated training and battles allowed them to become extraordinary warriors. \u00a0At the very least, they would be able to hold their own weight in any fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeletons were better than most Users, and he had 100 Skeletons under his command. \u00a0In the near future, he\u2019ll also use the Transcendent Ancient Power on the Death Knight when it became Rank A. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Who\u2019ll be able to rival him at that point?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Royal Road! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The road of an emperor could be seen in front of him right now. \u00a0If he followed this road, he\u2019ll surely become the best.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan wasn\u2019t interested in what was waiting at the end of the road.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan lowered his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if he was trying to avoid the gazes of his Skeleton Warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7fuck.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, a swear word came out of his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The one to break his dull and boring day was a call from his friend.</span></p><br/><p>6.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I want to borrow your name, Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling had contacted Hyrkan out of nowhere, and the request was quite sudden.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before Hyrkan could reply to his request, Whistling quickly explained his situation. \u00a0He sounded desperate as if he was being chased by something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- You don\u2019t have to do anything. \u00a0I know this is asking a lot from you. \u00a0I just\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0I need your name. \u00a0Please let me borrow your name.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan calmed him down before asking for an explanation. \u00a0Afterwards, Whistling calmly explained the plan he came up with.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I\u2019m planning on killing the Barbarian King. \u00a0However, as you probably know, the 30 great guilds won\u2019t participate in the Barbarian King Raid. \u00a0In the end, the regular Users have to be gathered to form a Raid Team\u2026. \u00a0I plan on using the Hahoe Mask name to gather the normal Users. \u00a0If it becomes known that you\u2019ll step forward forward for the Barbarian King raid, many Users will participate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the end, he gave his apologies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I know this request is a bit much. \u00a0This is why if the Raid fails\u2026. \u00a0I\u2019ll tell them I made it all up. \u00a0I\u2019ll tell them I sold you out. \u00a0Still, there might be some backlash towards you\u2026. \u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m asking for a favor. \u00a0I can\u2019t leave the Barbarian King alone. \u00a0Even if this is only a game, I can\u2019t just stand by and watch this unfold. \u00a0I don\u2019t want to wait as I pray for the 30 great guilds to move.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Finally, the meat of the conversation started.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo you want to kill the Barbarian King?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The Users are pretty much fed up. \u00a0They are very unsatisfied with the Barbarian King. \u00a0If it becomes known that you want to catch the Barbarian King, there are a lot of Users, who would want to help you. \u00a0No, you don\u2019t have to do anything. \u00a0I\u2019ll say this again. \u00a0All I need is\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat clear method will you use to take down the Barbarian King? \u00a0You have to destroy the Protection Gem at Phase 1. \u00a0That wouldn\u2019t be too difficult. \u00a0However, you don\u2019t have any method at your disposal that will allow you to damage it once it enters the 2nd phase called Storm Judgement Mode.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I researched the Main Scenario Quest, and I found a clue. \u00a0Moreover\u2026 \u00a0The next attempt at the Barbarian King Raid would be the 31st attempt. \u00a0I plan on using the clue as the basis for the next clear method.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is that method?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The method is\u2026... </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling first told him about the clue he was able to find in the Main Scenario quest. \u00a0Then he started explaining his clear method.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-hahaha.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he listened to Whistling\u2019s words, laughter suddenly erupted from Hyrkan\u2019s mouth. \u00a0The excessive amount of laughter indicated that Hyrkan was delighted. \u00a0\u00a0He was having a hard time stopping his laughter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSorry. \u00a0Ah. \u00a0I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was barely able to suppress his laughter, and he gave his apology.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Were you in the middle of something?

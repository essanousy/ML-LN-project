The Skeleton Knights were facing overwhelming number of foes, but they didn't hesitate. \u00a0They threw their bodies towards the 30 Zombies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shweeeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Knights swung their swords. \u00a0\u00a0A sharp sound emanated as each sword stroke severed various parts of the Zombies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chul-puh-duhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The severed parts sloughed off like mud. \u00a0Moreover, the stumps were quickly regenerating the missing part.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ooh-uh-uh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Zombies shuffled forward as they let out a cry. \u00a0It was hard to discern if they were crying or screaming.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Voodoo Lizardmen kept shaking their staffs as they danced. \u00a0It was as if they were cheering on the Zombies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggi-ee! Ggi-ee!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sometimes they even let out a weird cry as they looked at the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan threw Skeleton Fragments towards them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Too-toohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Fragment fell near the feet of the Voodoo Lizardmen, and it quickly gained its form. \u00a0He hadn't planned this out, but the Skeleton Warrior ironically had the shape of a Lizardman. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was made from a level 180 Fanged Lizardman's bones as ingredients. \u00a0These monsters were famous for their sharp canines.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Fanged Lizardman had a unique battle style where it bit its enemy with its sharp canines.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When it took form, it immediately bit the Voodoo Lizardman in front of it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kieehhhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Voodoo Lizardman let out a scream in fright, the Zombies turned towards their owner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Naturally, the Skeleton Knights were shown the backs of the Zombies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Would you look at this?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Zombies had ignored the Skeleton Knights, and the Skeleton Knights started chopping off their heads as penalty for their action. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puh-uhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Knights and Hyrkan were like walking guillotines. \u00a0They unhesitatingly unleashed violence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The most striking part was that Hyrkan's sword strike didn't make any sounds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-hwaht! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Knights let out a sound that could be easily discerned as a sound a sword makes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soo-oohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's sword sounded like a shaving blade cutting facial hair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no cry. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This meant the sword wasn't the Crying Sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So what was identity of the sword in his hands?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the Deposed Prince's Sword! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was using the sword that he had previously equipped on the Death Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It's effectiveness was a given.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan moved forward as he severed the necks of the Zombies. \u00a0When the Zombie's head fell to the ground, he crushed it as if he was stepping on rotten tomatoes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the Zombies didn't just die from such an attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were called Zombies, because they were Undead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was just buying time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was buying time, so his Skeleton Warriors could take down the Voodoo Lizardmen without being harassed by the Zombies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggieh! \u00a0Ggieehhh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While the owner of the Skeletons and the Skeleton Knights displayed their prowess, the Skeleton Warriors loyally performed their duty.. \u00a0The sudden cry and scream from the Voodoo Lizardmen was like a live update on how the Skeleton Warriors were faring against them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Warriors finished their battle around the 3 minute mark. \u00a0They answered their owner's trust with a huge gift.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You level has increased.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Level Up! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was now level 207. \u00a0However, at that moment, he wasn't feeling happy about his Level Up. \u00a0Regret was the first emotion he felt. \u00a0He should have used up all his magical energy by summoning a Skeleton Warrior or the Golem before he leveled up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'm overflowing with money, but I'm not able to spend it anywhere right now. \u00a0Jeez.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, his account was overflowing with money, but he still had a lot of consumable in his possession. \u00a0If he went out and bought more, it would be a waste of money. \u00a0\u00a0He was a little bit irritated that he still lived on a fiscally conservative budget. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t bring himself to waste his Items on luxury items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018In the past, I saw Rich Lich\u2019s interview. \u00a0He said even if he had a lot of money, there wasn\u2019t much he wanted to spend it on. \u00a0I wanted to punch him in the face when he said it. \u00a0However, now I am in his position.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was definitely feeling the pressure being felt by the numerous Users, who had stepped onto the Black Continent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, the biggest problem tormenting the User on the Black Continent was the consumable Items. \u00a0It was too hard to obtain them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The 30 great guilds are always the problem. \u00a0This is especially true for Big Smiles and V&amp;V\u2026 \u00a0If I catch them, I'll....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the past, there had been several Users, who had taken advantage of the high market price. \u00a0They acted as mules as they moved consumable Items through the Voodook's tunnel. \u00a0This was why Users had been able to trade Items near the summit of the Urugal mountain. \u00a0It had been expensive, but at the very least, they had the option to purchase these Items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, five guilds were trying to push through the Voodook's Tunnel right now, and they were causing an enormous amount of traffic. \u00a0The possibility of trading with these enterprising Users were gone now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been fully ready when he came here, but he never expected such a development. \u00a0This was why hate was burning inside him towards the source of the traffic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His loss didn\u2019t just end there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan let out a sigh as he dismantled the corpses of the Voodoo Lizardmen, which had been defeated by the Skeleton Warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He dismantled the scaled corpse, and he found a Gem Ingredient from one of the melting body. \u00a0He carefully put the Item into the pouch where he stored the recovery Items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Gem Ingredient that came out of the Voodoo Lizardman could be used to produce an Item. \u00a0Basically, there were two types of Gem. \u00a0One could be used to repair Items, and the other could \u00a0be used to make recovery Items. \u00a0If one chewed on an Ingredient that was used to make a recovery Item, one could still receive some recovery effect.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, no User would use it in such a manner. \u00a0It was like finding truffles in the mountain. \u00a0It was akin to eating these truffles, because one was hungry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I can\u2019t belive I have to eat this.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Voodoo Lizardman\u2019s Gem Ingredients were used to make level 200 Rare Rank defesnive Items. \u00a0Currently, a level 200 Rare Item with decent Option were trade for around 1000 gold.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to feed on such Item Ingredients to recover his magical energy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I have to quickly find the Heard Fortress. \u00a0I have to progress in the Quest to make that region into a foothold.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This hurt him as much as losing to a monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If not, I might die from an upset stomach. \u00a0Eventhough I have a lot of money, I can\u2019t keep doing this with a sound mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this hardship wasn\u2019t indefinite.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t sure about it, but in his memories, he remembered the Fortress turned in a foothold when one finished the Quest. \u00a0When the Heard Fortress becomes a foothold, the NPC would return. \u00a0There would be cubicles where he\u2019ll be able to make Items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was similar to what had happened at the Cursed Castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This would also be the most important part of the Ruined Kingdom episode.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The first one to forge the road would have a hard time, but the benefit given to the person, who paved the first road was significant. \u00a0It would be equal to the amount of hardship one faced.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In other words, he had to avoid being in 2nd place. \u00a0The 2nd place User wouldn\u2019t get anything. \u00a0The only thing waiting for the 2nd place User was a heartburn.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan raised his head, and he put the Wooden Conch, which he had found in the Ruin, to his ear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> - To the east. \u00a0To the east.... </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan turned his head towards the east when he heard the announcement from the Wooden Conch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-uh-uh-uh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From beyond his eyesight, an unknown monster roared as it called out towards Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I get a windfall of Items, I\u2019ll spend my money in a crazy way.\u2019</span></p><br/><p>2.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They didn't run into each other by luck. \u00a0It was fate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's the Hahoe Mask!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Big Smiles guild received the Heard Fortress Quest, they decided to proceed with the Quest in a safe manner. \u00a0They created an exploration party, and Apollo was made the leader of this party.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Apollo wanted to look out for his own safety. \u00a0So he picked out an advance group from within the exploration group, and he sent them ahead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He picked 7 Users for the advance group. \u00a0There were 4 Strikers, 2 Priest and a Magician in the party. \u00a0They started investigating the direction pointed out by the Wooden Conch they found at a Ruin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they heard the sound of battle between a User and a monster, they naturally headed towards the sound. \u00a0Both the monsters and Users had to be investigated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, there weren\u2019t that many groups heading towards the Heard Fortress. \u00a0The fact that they met Hyrkan was intended by god.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRun!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the advance group discovered the Hahoe Mask, they immediately ran away. \u00a0Hyrkan saw the group of people run away as soon as they saw him. \u00a0When he felt their eyes on him, Hyrkan immediately gave up on the monster he had been fighting. \u00a0He immediately became a pursuer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Where are they from?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan didn't immediately know the identity of these Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, they had run away as soon as they saw Hyrkan. \u00a0He was sure they didn't hold any good intentions towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, if they were able to get here, they weren't mediocre Users. \u00a0If he let them go, they might aim their swords at him next time they met. \u00a0They were potential enemies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The only way I'll live is to kill all these bastards.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan came to a conclusion that he had to move in a desperate manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, the 5 guilds including the V&amp;V guild and Big Smiles guild were making an enormous mess at the Voodook's Tunnel. \u00a0He was well aware of the fact that they were sending a massive amount of Users to the other side of the Urugal mountain range. \u00a0This was a main topic of discussion on websites that catered to contents from Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could guess what these 5 guilds were aiming for. \u00a0They weren\u2019t sacrificing guild members, so the Users that came later would have an easier time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They planned on showing the tyranny that could be conducted by the large guilds. \u00a0It was a level of tyranny that was unimaginable to a normal User!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan had faced the tyranny from the large guilds before. \u00a0He received the punishment from facing up to such tyranny. \u00a0He knew well the despair and dirty feeling that came with it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His preparations were all done for this day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'm glad I invested a lot of money in this.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was something he had prepared for Users, who would run away from Hyrkan. \u00a0It was his secret weapon. \u00a0It was meant to be used to whittle away his enemies. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan took out Skeleton Fragments from the Skeleton Fragment Pouch hanging off of his waist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The four Skeleton Warriors that showed up were small in stature. \u00a0It was the Mini Ogre Skeleton Warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These weren\u2019t the normal ones. \u00a0These 4 were wearing level 170 Unique Rank defensive set. \u00a0They wore the Forest Pursuer set.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The set Item could only be made by catching the Chameleon Jackal, and this monster was only accessible through Quests related to the Elven tribes. \u00a0Currently, there were only a few amount of these sets in circulation. \u00a0The Movement Speed option was greater than any other Unique rank set Items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At one point, a single set was traded for 30 thousand gold. \u00a0In recent days, if one wanted to obtain the set in a swift manner, one had to give up 10 thousand gold for it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of it all, Mini Ogres were geniuses at pursuing foes. \u00a0Their small bodies contained an explosive power, and even a seasoned Striker couldn't shake off their pursuit. No Users attempted a pursuit battle against the Mini Ogres.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The finishing touch was the Madness Helm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These expensive pursuers were created solely for chasing down targets. \u00a0The horned Mini Ogre Skeleton Warriors were able to close the significant gap between its preys in an instant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, it was inevitable that the slow footed Priest became the sacrificial lamb. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The attack of Mini Ogre Skeleton Warrior wasn't aimed at the chest. \u00a0It was inevitably aimed towards the knees and thighs. \u00a0The Priest fell to the ground from a single blow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-ah-ah!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Priest's world spun round and round. \u00a0He reflexively let out a scream. \u00a0The scream ended only after the priest fell face down on the ground. \u00a0The priest raised his head from the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Aigo. My head....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed the Mini Ogre Skeleton Warriors had already moved past him. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t see any of them in his surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Huh?

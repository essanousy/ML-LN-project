(3)</p><br/><p>8.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Let's see....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun, who had been looking at his Tablet PC, repositioned the glasses on his face. \u00a0Then he started flicking his finger on the Tablet PC.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI spent 3,223 gold for magic recovery Items, 2,550 gold for health recovery Items, and 10,000 gold for Bone Ingredients....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He already had a rough estimate on how much he had spent, but the calculation was concluded faster than expected. \u00a0The final total hadn't come out yet, but Ahn-jaehyun stopped moving his finger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end a very soft and spiritless sigh came out of his mouth. \u00a0It was a wretched sound.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is driving me nuts.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was having a hard time letting out a sigh. \u00a0Afterwards, the words he was about to say got stuck in the back of his throat. \u00a0Ahn-jaehyun could only complain and moan about his problems with a small voice inside his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, his fermenting discontent led to annoyance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Bone Dragon... \u00a0How can they only made such expensive Skills?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been 10 days since the Hahoe Mask hunted inside the Highwood Forest, which was under Big Smiles' management.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It isn't as if I could abstain from using it, since I have to increase the Skill Rank... \u00a0I caught so many Wood Devils, yet I came out at a loss.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For the past 10 days, the Hahoe Mask's hunt to level up had proceeded very smoothly. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t just smooth. \u00a0He had worked at peak efficiency. \u00a0In 10 days, he had raised 4 levels, and he had reached Level 235. \u00a0Before he returned to the past, Hyrkan had worked with the Hahoe Mask guild to level up. \u00a0It took them 31 days for him to go from Level 230 to Level 240. \u00a0His current Level Up speed was ridiculous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the drain on his money was as fast as his Level Up speed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit. \u00a0Was this Skill really made with the intention of Users using it?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the main culprit of his loss was the Bone Dragon Skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In their own ways, the Skeletons under the Hahoe Mask was great at eating money, but the Bone Dragon Skill was on a whole different level compared to the Skeletons. \u00a0He had to dress, decorate and feed the Skeletons. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt like pouring water into a jug with a hole at the bottom. \u00a0The Bone Dragon Skill made him feel as if he was pouring the water straight onto the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The scarier part was the fact that he hadn't really even started using this Skill yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The current level 200 Dragon Type Boss Monster is called the Crypt Dragon. \u00a0If I wanted Bone Ingredients equal to a whole Dragon... \u00a0Seventy thousand gold.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the real deal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When one went over Level 200 mark to find a large Dragon Type Boss Monster, the price jumped up to a whole different level. \u00a0This was especially true for the Dragon Type Boss Monsters that were in the large category. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the high side, the Skill could require around 100 Bone Ingredients. \u00a0Of course, the price to gather such a high number of Ingredient Coins was exorbitant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the Bone Ingredients one paid for an exorbitant price dissipated when the battle ended. \u00a0When he thought about it, his body shook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After his body stopped shaking, Ahn-jaehyun decided to stop worrying about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018First, let me worry about increasing the Skill Rank. \u00a0The terrifying problem of.... \u00a0Let's ignore it for now.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he worried about it right now, it would only lead to a stomach ulcer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun once again started to tap at the Tablet PC's screen. \u00a0He restarted the calculation he had stopped a moment ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I want to buy additional Consumable Items, and the Ingredients for the Bone Dragon.... \u00a0\u00a0I'll have to \u00a0purchase around 100,000 gold. \u00a0I'm spending my gold much faster than expected. \u00a0I purchased 100,000 gold not too long ago.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he started to worry once again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The transaction fee involved in swapping 100,000 gold... \u00a0It'll be higher than what I spend on food each month.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Uh-whew.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Ahn-jaehyun gave up on his calculations.</span></p><br/><p>9.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Bone Wyvern flapped its wing as it landed at the Heard Fortress ruin town's main square. \u00a0Its wings was made out of bones, so it didn't cause the winds to stir. \u00a0The Bone Wyvern was pretty large, but the landing process was quieter than expected. \u00a0However, the commotion it caused in its surrounding wasn't quiet at all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it a NPC?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Wyvern Delivery NPC possesses a Bone Dragon too? \u00a0Doesn't it normally use 5 normal Wyverns?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Users in the square caused a large commotion, and it caused the other Users to gather. \u00a0They came to see what the fuss was about. \u00a0When the Users were about to converge into a mass resembling a cloud, a User on descended from the back of the Bone Wyvern. This user used the Bone Wyvern's bones as handholds. \u00a0The User was wearing pouches and bags, which were filled to bursting, like clothes. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the crowd recognized the User's face, it created a ripple within the crowd.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahoe Mask?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The restless energy within the crowd was akin to when a celebrity exited an expensive sports car. \u00a0As the crowd became excited, Hyrkan's shoulders were pulled back in pride.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Yes, this is what it is all about.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a short amount of time, Hyrkan had used the Bone Wyvern's Riding Skill to fly from the Highwood Forest to the Heard Fortress ruin town. \u00a0Moreover, this was the first time the crowd had seen a User use a Bone Wyvern as a mode of transportation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was obvious, but Hyrkan had expected such a reaction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018As expected, a man is all about the car.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had worried about the Riding Skill, but the Bone Dragon flew pretty well in the air. \u00a0It was impossible to do any tricks in the air, but it was much better than the Wyvern Golem made using the Clay Play Skill. \u00a0It could fly much higher, and it was a much safer ride.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it was a great mode of transportation, but a high cost came with this convenience.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Bone Wyvern has returned to the earth.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying the System Announcement, the Bone Dragon collapsed into a white pile of dust. \u00a0The dust from the bone was so fine that a small breeze, which couldn't be felt by the Users, scattered it into the surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The strength that had kept Hyrkan's shoulder and neck tense also dissipated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah, my 200 gold...\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Riding Skill was used to travel a long distance, the Bone Dragon disappeared as soon as one arrived at the destination. \u00a0Basically, it meant the long distance travel using the Bone Dragon Skill was a one-off Skill. \u00a0It wasn't even a round trip. \u00a0It travelled only one way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thankfully, he could use the lowest flight-capable Dragon Type monster. \u00a0It was a level 90 normal Wyvern. \u00a0This was why he only burned 200 golds on this flight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he said it was merely 200 gold, but if he converted to real money, it was the price of an airplane ticket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why his back look strangely bleak as he head towards the Item Storage center.</span></p><br/><p>10.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the Item Storage center, a room was provided, so a User could always change one's Item Setting in privacy. \u00a0It was there as a considerate gesture for the Users. \u00a0It allowed one to put Items into the Slots, and when one yelled for the Slot On of the Items, one could see how one looked liked. \u00a0Of course, one would look silly if one kept yelling out Slot On deep within a forest just to check how one looked in an equipment. \u00a0This was why this room was provided.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was within such a room with his equipments off. \u00a0He was standing inside wearing only his underwear, and the his body looked bizarre.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was reminiscent of the Frankenstein. \u00a0His arms and legs looked like it was patched together, and tattoos covered his whole body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan grabbed the flesh of his left side like a handle. \u00a0When he pulled on his skin, the flesh around his stomach opened up like a door. \u00a0It revealed a six-sided space that was akin to the inside of a safe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'll put the health recovery Items and Buff Items inside my stomach.....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan stacked the consumables he had bought into his stomach. \u00a0He kept putting in Items \u00a0until there was no available space.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he moved on to his thighs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The left will hold the Skeleton Fragments, Bone Explosives, Bone Spear... \u00a0\u00a0The other side will hold the offerings for the Bone Dragon.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He opened his right thigh first then he opened the left. \u00a0He put Items into the available space. \u00a0Afterwards, he meticulously put in Items into his arms and even his palms. It was as if he was replacing his bones with Items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After finishing his work, he manipulated his wristwatch. \u00a0It took only 2 seconds for his bare body to be equipped with heavy armor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's work wasn't done yet. \u00a0There were Item storage pouches placed in various location of the Dark Spot set, and he started filling them with consumable Items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He also filled his bag and pockets.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan could breathe easily only after he had finished his work... \u00a0This task had taken him 20 minutes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he let out a sigh, a bitter smile hung around Hyrkan's lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I paved the road in front of me with money.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every User thoroughly prepared for a hunt and quest by purchasing consumable Items. \u00a0However, there was no other Users that was as thorough in his preparation in regards to consumable Items like Hyrkan. \u00a0Hyrkan's preparation was meticulous, and the consumable Items he used were overly expensive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Currently, I'm probably the most expensive being walking inside Warlord.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Just the cost of the Items on his body could be measured in the hundred thousands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn't end there. \u00a0None of Hyrkan's Items present in his slots were cheap Items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, He possessed Unique Items that most of Warlord didn't have like the Circlet of Purification and Anugas' Necklace. \u00a0On top of it all, a good number of his main Items were bound, and he wouldn't lose any of them if he had his wristwatch stolen. \u00a0On the other hand, this meant that if someone did manage to steal Hyrkan's wristwatch, the probability of the Circlet of Purification and the Anugas' Necklace dropping was high. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as Hyrkan had said. \u00a0It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that the most valuable character one could catch in Warlord was Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'm such a tempting target, yet the Big Smiles is leaving me alone. \u00a0It doesn't make any sense.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Big Smiles guild had left Hyrkan alone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From time he started hunting inside the Highwood Forest, he had been curious about their absence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, Hyrkan hadn't planned on hunting for 10 days within the Highwood Forest. \u00a0If he could do it, it would have been great. \u00a0However, he had thought the Big Smiles guild wouldn't allow him to hunt in an important region under their control. \u00a0He had been sure that the Big Smiles would \u00a0have mobilized their forces to interfere with Hyrkan's hunt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he had been bold and visible in the beginning. \u00a0He started earnestly hunting down the monsters in plain sight. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask displayed his full might as if he was advertising himself, and from the Big Smiles guild's perspective, they would have to make thorough preparations to hunt down the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0Naturally, this preparation would take time, and it would have given the Hahoe Mask the time to hunt a little bit longer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he allocated 3 days for his hunt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would hunt for 3 days within the Highwood Forest, and when the Big Smiles guild interferes within him, he would give up the hunt. \u00a0He would have crossed over into the Red Desert.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the opposite of his expectation occurred. \u00a0The Big Smiles guild didn't even sniff near Hyrkan. \u00a0They didn't show any indication that they will attempt to catch him. \u00a0As time passed, Hahoe Mask's exploits and activities increased. \u00a0The ridicule and criticism against the Big Smiles were getting louder. \u00a0However, they treated Hyrkan as if he didn't exist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This course of action worries me more.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If it came to it, he was ready to fight the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0However, when the Big Smiles guild stayed silent, it frightened him. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was also the reason why he had firmed his resolve.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018These guys aren't the kinds of bastards that would stay put doing nothing.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the calm before the storm was long, the destructive power of the storm was stronger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no need for him to overstay his welcome at the Highwood Forest. \u00a0There was no reason why he should stay until he triggered a trap laid out by the vindictive Users of the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Well, if I go into the Red Desert, I don't have to worry about facing the Big Smiles for a while.....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since he had tweaked the nose of the Big Smiles guild, he had to go to the Red Desert as soon as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Red Desert was north of the Highwood forest, and it was a region officially given up by the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0They didn't hunt, manage, and search inside the Red Desert. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t just the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0All of the Five Stars guild had given up searching the Red Desert.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a highly dangerous region. \u00a0It wasn't even known what types of monsters appeared inside this region. \u00a0There were no information on what characteristics these monsters possessed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only thing confirmed was the fact that it was more difficult than the Highwood Forest! \u00a0It was assumed to be a level 250 hunting ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the Red Desert was filled with more dangerous beings than the mediocre members of the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Hyrkan would have to meet a Warlord NPC known to be very unfriendly towards the \u00a0Users. \u00a0The Blacksmith Olf did whatever the hell it wanted, and he had no clues on its location. \u00a0He just knew the NPC was somewhere inside the Red Desert. \u00a0He had to find the NPC with just this information.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I could end this game, I really would just end it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a pipe dream, so Hyrkan's mind boggled at the thought. \u00a0He fixed the Hahoe Mask on his face.</span></p><br/><p>11.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf things continue this way, wouldn't we become a laughing stock?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Heh-bibin's words, Apollo didn't move his pouting lips. \u00a0Heh-bibin spoke to him again. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn all fairness, you are the master of this sub-guild now. \u00a0The only thing holding me back from moving on is the big picture for this guild. \u00a0The Big Smiles guild is basically your guild now. \u00a0Moreover, don't you want revenge on the Hahoe Mask?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Sinclair didn't budge. \u00a0How are we going to kill the Hahoe Mask?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo finally broke his silence, and Heh-bibin looked at Apollo with a hardened expression instead of answering the question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a brief silence, and Heh-bibin didn't show any signs of wanting to talk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want to catch the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0I want to kill that bastard.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if he couldn't take the silence, Apollo spoke with anger in his voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Heh-bibin took a peek at Apollo. \u00a0Several thoughts flitted through his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018As I thought, the answer was to poke Apollo.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When this thought went through his mind, Heh-bibin tried hard to push down the smile that was trying to break out on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are of like mind. \u00a0If the Big Smiles guild allows the Hahoe Mask to act with impunity, it'll damage us greatly. At the very least, you and I should stand together.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHowever, we don't have a plan ! If it isn't Sinclair, who'll be able to go toe-to-toe with the Hahoe Mask?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo reacted in a very temperamental manner. \u00a0If one considered Apollo's personality and his past relationship with the Hahoe Mask, it was a predictable reaction. \u00a0There was no reason why Apollo would be happy about this topic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEven if we don't have a User of the same caliber to confront him, there is no reason why we can't kill him if we go in large numbers. \u00a0If we decide to catch him, we'll be able to.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe couldn't catch him after sending 1,000 of our Users.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWasn't it, because the Stormhunters guild interfered with us? \u00a0If we think about it logically, even the Hahoe Mask can't fight a force of 1,000 Users.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI've heard those words before.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe have to hunt him in a way where we\u2019ll turn a profit. \u00a0Even if we send 100 or a 1,000 Users, we'll turn a profit. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask is basically the most expensive monster in Warlord.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf we send a thousand User, he'll avoid them. \u00a0Hahoe Mask isn't dumb. \u00a0This is how he handles such situations.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Heh-bibin shut his mouth again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMoreover, the bastard doesn't have a guild, party, team or even a family! \u00a0It is impossible to threaten him by kidnapping someone near him. \u00a0So how are we supposed to pin him down? \u00a0In recent rumors, it is said he travels by riding a Bone Wyvern. \u00a0He can fly now, so how can we catch him?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo had an idea. \u00a0When he had this idea, he had a dazed expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNow that I think about it, there is one User, who\u2019s close to the Hahoe Mask.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo's dazed expression turned into a bloody smile.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

However, there was a reason why Hyrkan was more sensitive to this job. \u00a0Hyrkan checked the content of the message he received during his previous battle.</p><br/><p>[Participation Bonus 5 thousand gold. \u00a0Success Bonus 20 thousand gold.]\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u2018A total of 25,000 gold.\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p>If he participated in this Raid, he would be given 5 thousand gold. \u00a0Moreover, twenty thousand gold would be given if the hunt was successful!</p><br/><p>Pelato was betting an enormous amount of gold on him.</p><br/><p>\u2018He is laying it on strong.\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p>In the beginning, the Participation Bonus was 2 thousand gold, and the Success Bonus was 10 thousand gold.</p><br/><p>The amount had doubled. However, it wasn't as if there wasn't a good reason why it had increased. \u00a0Yesterday, Hyrkan had uploaded the battle footage of him fighting the large Thorn Lizard. \u00a0The responses he got back was very favorable. \u00a0It had been sufficient enough to drive up Hyrkan's price.</p><br/><p>However, Hyrkan couldn't accept this situation at face value.</p><br/><p>\u2018If it was me, I wouldn't bet this much.\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p>The merit of having Hyrkan join the public enlistment wasn't small.\u00a0</p><br/><p>It would be easier to gather additional members through Hyrkan's reputation. \u00a0Moreover, the probability of succeeded the raid on the 1st try increased significantly.</p><br/><p>Even if one considered those factors, Pelato's bet was ill-advised. \u00a0Moreover, he probably hadn't given this offer to everyone. \u00a0He probably gave it to Hyrkan only. If someone other than Hyrkan found out about this, there would be infighting within the group.</p><br/><p>\u2018I'm sure there is something going on here.\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p>If Pelato had the capital to make such an offer, Pelato would have given it during the first meeting. \u00a0Why was he so desperate now? \u00a0It was most definitely strange to see him make such a reckless bet.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Normally, he wouldn't touch such work when there might be a secret plot behind it.</p><br/><p>The problem was Hyrkan was also in a bad spot.</p><br/><p>\u2018I have to catch it.\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p>Currently, the Corrupted Gray Cockatrice's infamy was rising. \u00a0The Raid teams that were capable of taking down this monster were finishing up their scheduled plans, and they would soon come up with new plans on what they would do.</p><br/><p>The Corrupted monsters were still worth a lot. \u00a0This was especially true for the highest level users with the Corrupted Items. \u00a0It was a chance to obtain additional Corrupted Set items.</p><br/><p>If a little bit more time passed, he was sure the 30 great guilds would move.</p><br/><p>Of course, he had to catch it before them. \u00a0If he wanted to personally take down the the Corrupted Gray Cockatrice, this was his only chance.</p><br/><p>\u2018I have no choice.\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p>He had no choice to grab the dirty hand of the user, who was full of secret plans.</p><br/><p>This was the reason why he was worried.</p><br/><p>9.\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cThe bastard's targeting priority is magic. \u00a0If it is hit with magic, it will target the magicians. \u00a0To draw the aggro from it, one has to deliver two consecutive effective blows to the bastard.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>There were 35 total users, which amounted to 6 parties.</p><br/><p>They had all gathered there to catch the Corrupted Gray Cockatrice, who was making a mess of the Red Lake. \u00a0Pelato stood in front of them as if he was delivering a speech, and he started explaining the plan for the Raid.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis monster also has Fear. \u00a0It will decrease everyone's Stats, and our movement will be slowed. So, please eat the candy. \u00a0If you are exposed to the Fear, retreat to the back. \u00a0Also, if you are exposed to the Fear and retreat to the back, you will receive a demerit. \u00a0As your demerit starts to stack, you will receive penalty when we are distributing the ingredient coins and gems.\"</p><br/><p>Pelato was very serious as he gave his speech.</p><br/><p>However, the content of his speech wasn't that special. \u00a0If one was a user over level 100 in Warlord, these were instructions one would already know even if it wasn't said out loud to them. \u00a0The participants expected there would be some special content to his speech, but the participants' expression became apathetic.</p><br/><p>It was the same for Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>\u2018He doesn't have any additional information. \u00a0This means he only has the standard tactics to use in the attack.\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cSince we don't know what's beyond phase 1, let's play it by the book.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Pelato spoke exactly what Hyrkan had been thinking. \u00a0However, it wasn't as if Hyrkan was the only one, who was having such thoughts. Several party members put on an expression as if to say this was all to be expected.</p><br/><p>However...</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore the magic attack, we have to shave off as much defense off of the monster. We'll focus on the Armor Break. There will be 3 users assigned to the role of Strikers, and the three users will alternate with each other to attack the monster. \u00a0The group will consist of Umyo Party's Diong, 1945 Party's Naple, \u00a0and Hahoe Mask Hyrkan. The three of them will make up the group.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>At that point, Hyrkan couldn't help, but change his expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018What?\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p>Hyrkan looked at Pelato through the eye holes of the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0Pelato also looked at Hyrkan, and when their eyes met, Pelato turned his gaze away. He was most definitely avoiding Hyrkan's gaze.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why am I assigned as a Striker?\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p>Once again, Hyrkan had doubts.</p><br/><p>It was true that he could fill in the role of a Striker well. The Armor Break skill he had shown when taking down the Bear Warrior and Helm Ogre won him a lot of admiration. \u00a0An average Striker wouldn't be able to put forth his name next to Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>However, Hyrkan had done the Armor Break, since he was soloing. When it comes down to it, Hyrkan wasn't a Striker. \u00a0Hyrkan didn't mind doing it, but this Raid team had 6 Strikers.</p><br/><p>So why was he insisting on putting Hyrkan into the Striker group?</p><br/><p>\u2018Is he trying to fuck me over?\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p>Of course, Hyrkan didn't like it.</p><br/><p>Before he had returned to the past, it had been the same. \u00a0The Striker position suited him the most. \u00a0Hyrkan knew this. \u00a0However, he also knew the dangers.</p><br/><p>One had to stick to the body of the large monster to continuously attack. \u00a0It was basically riding a sports car with no brakes.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Hyrkan had recently displayed his strong power as a Necromancer.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan's eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>However, he didn't react.</p><br/><p>\u2018All right.\u2019 \u00a0</p><br/><p>If this was Pelato's secret plan, it would be better to antagonize Pelato after he reveals his secret design. \u00a0If he bothered him right now, Pelato could just deny it with his words.</p><br/><p>\u2018I'll go along with it. \u00a0For now...\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p>This was why Hyrkan allowed himself to be manipulated.</p><br/><p>\u2018However, if you mess with me, it will cost you much more than your watch.\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p>10.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Ggiiiiiii!\u00a0</p><br/><p>It had been a while, since the Corrupted Gray Cockatrice had discovered a prey. \u00a0It expressed its \u00a0happiness.</p><br/><p>Three tankers equipped with enormous armors and shields were in place in front of the monster.</p><br/><p>Three hidden figures were on the other side watching this sight. \u00a0It was Hyrkan and the two other Strikers, who were tasked with the same mission.</p><br/><p>However, it wasn't the role of Tankers nor the Strikers to send out the first salvo.</p><br/><p>\u201cReady your magic!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Pelato, who was one of the tankers, yelled out. As if they were trying to encompass the surrounding, the magicians raised the magic they had finished casting. \u00a0Each of their hands held either fire, ice, lightning or wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cAttack!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>When Pelato's command finally came down, ten magic spells headed towards the Corrupted Gray Cockatrice, which was running towards the Tankers.</p><br/><p>Ten had been sent.</p><br/><p>Eight of the ten magic spells hit the Corrupted Gray Cockatrice's body.</p><br/><p>Keeeee!\u00a0</p><br/><p>The Corrupted Gray Cockatrice let out a shriek as it explicitly expressed its pain.</p><br/><p>However, the Corrupted Gray Cockatrice was fine considering the number of magic that been used on its body. \u00a0Parts of its body was blackened, and the gray feathers were burnt. \u00a0Blood dripped out of the deep wounds. \u00a0However, if one took into account of its big body, it didn't look like critical wounds. It only gave pain to the Corrupted Gray Cockatrice.</p><br/><p>It was wounded just enough to stoke its anger.</p><br/><p>The Corrupted Gray Cockatrice searched its surrounding with its eyes. \u00a0It looked for the magicians, who had sent the magic spells.</p><br/><p>Something came flying towards its beak.</p><br/><p>Kwahng!\u00a0</p><br/><p>A hammer spun towards it as it let out lightning.</p><br/><p>Keeeee, keeeee!\u00a0</p><br/><p>The Cockactrice immediately shook its head when it was hit by the hammer.</p><br/><p>After hitting the beak, the hammer returned to its master.</p><br/><p>\u201cOoh-rah-cha-cha!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>The hammer's owner was already close to the Cockatrice.</p><br/><p>The Cockatrice was still shaking its head as it tried to get rid of the Stun effect. \u00a0However, the Cockatrice was still trying to chase the magicians instead of the Tanker, who had swung his hammer.\u00a0</p><br/><p>However...</p><br/><p>Puh-uhk!\u00a0</p><br/><p>After regaining his hammer once again, he brought down the hammer on the Cockatrice's body!\u00a0</p><br/><p>Keeeet!\u00a0</p><br/><p>The Cockatrice's head turned quickly towards the Tanker. \u00a0The Tanker gritted his teeth as he immediately raised his shield.</p><br/><p>Kwah-jeek!\u00a0</p><br/><p>As soon as he raised his shield, the Cockatrice's sharp beak impacted on the shield. \u00a0If he had been slightly late, his body would have suffered the same fate as his shield.</p><br/><p>Its power was immense. \u00a0The shield had been pierced as the beak needed only couple centimeters more depth to break through the shield. \u00a0The sharp part of the beak was dug in so deep that one could see through the shield.</p><br/><p>\u2018I won't be able to hold on like this. \u00a0The buffs aren't enough.\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cThousand Geun Weight!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>The Tanker sensed he won't be able to resist the monster easily, so he used his Skill. \u00a0His weight increased as he became rooted in place.</p><br/><p>There was no retreat!\u00a0</p><br/><p>It seemed the beak attack on the Tanker's shield wasn't enough for the monster. \u00a0It started to stomp with its foot.</p><br/><p>Kwahng, kwahng!\u00a0</p><br/><p>The enormous monster didn't show any signs of holding back its strength. \u00a0While the Tanker was blocking all of the Cockatrice's attack, the Strikers moved.</p><br/><p>- The Hahoe Mask is moving.</p><br/><p>- Everyone get ready!\u00a0</p><br/><p>The first one to move was Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>When they saw Hyrkan move, the rest of the party members moved along with him. The Strikers on standby switched positions with the Tankers and Magicians.</p><br/><p>Finally, Hyrkan had closed the distance with the Cockatrice. \u00a0In a breath, he got on the Cockatrice's body using his swift movements.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan's eyes surveyed the wounds on the Cockatrice's spine. \u00a0He chose one of them as he stabbed his sword into the wound.</p><br/><p>Poo-oohk!\u00a0</p><br/><p>It was a level 100 Unique item. \u00a0Hyrkan boasted Strength stat that was higher than most swordsman, so his attack couldn't be weak.</p><br/><p>Keeeee!\u00a0</p><br/><p>The Cockatrice had been distracted by the Tanker, but the power of the blow made the Cockatrice take notice.</p><br/><p>At that moment...</p><br/><p>Puh-uhng!\u00a0</p><br/><p>An enormous fireball impacted on the Cockatrice's head, and it popped like a water balloon.</p><br/><p>The exploding ball of fire covered the entirety of the Cockatrice's face then it disappeared.</p><br/><p>Of course, the Cockatrice's gaze headed towards the magician, who had used the magic. \u00a0The monster's interest in Hyrkan disappeared, and Hyrkan was able to breathe.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hoo-ooh!\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p>The Tanker predicted the Cockatrice's move, so he got in place. Hyrkan grabbed his embedded sword, and he waited for the next opportunity.</p><br/><p>\u2018They are controlling the Aggro pretty well.\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p>The Aggro was being controlled much better than he thought it would be. \u00a0The Tankers and Magicians had good chemistry. \u00a0Also, Pelato's directions were easy to follow.</p><br/><p>Of course....\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u2018I don't know how far we can go on like this.\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p>Of course, the first one or two pass went well for any Raids. \u00a0Now they would have to repeat this process couple dozen times to couple hundred times.</p><br/><p>During this process, even one mistake would result in someone paying the price.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan bit his lips. \u00a0Of course, Hyrkan had no thoughts of bearing that price.</p><br/><p>At that moment...</p><br/><p>Kwahhng!\u00a0</p><br/><p>An enormous fireball took Hyrkan by surprise.</p><br/><p>12.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Flame Strike magic.</p><br/><p>It was a level 80 Rare rank magic. \u00a0It was the main magic used by Flame magicians, who wanted to deal serious damage.</p><br/><p>Basically, the magic boasted a strong striking power.</p><br/><p>The Striker, who was on the back of the monster attempting an Armor Break, was touched by this powerful magic. \u00a0It was the worst type of accident one could commit.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho sent that?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Pelato, who had witnessed it from nearby, let out a desperate shout.</p><br/><p>- I...I mixed up the signal.</p><br/><p>A reply was given immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet a hold of yourself!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Pelato spat out another word. However, the situation only allowed limited conversation. \u00a0</p><br/><p>- What should we do?\u00a0</p><br/><p>- Give us the next order, commander! \u00a0</p><br/><p>If an accident happened, the situation usually turned in a state of emergency.</p><br/><p>This was the case right now. \u00a0The Cockatrice was hit by an unexpected attack, and it was heading towards the Mage. \u00a0It was heading towards a direction where a Tanker couldn't be dispatched.</p><br/><p>Normally, when one used magic, a Tanker was placed between the mage and the monster. \u00a0The Tanker would immediately block the monster once it starts to chase the magician.</p><br/><p>Basically, a Tanker couldn't block the Cockatrice right now.</p><br/><p>There were only two answers to this situation.</p><br/><p>- Reset?\u00a0</p><br/><p>- Retreat?\u00a0</p><br/><p>In this situation, they had to either run away or reset the Raid.</p><br/><p>If they ran away, they all had to scatter. \u00a0It was basically an announcement to give up on the battle.</p><br/><p>Reset was basically returning to the initial condition of the Raid. \u00a0In a situation like this, the magicians would send their magic towards the monster like they did in the beginning. \u00a0There would be too many targets, so the Aggro would reset. \u00a0The only problem with the reset was the fact that one couldn't guarantee Hyrkan's life, who was hanging off of the monster's back.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan's item setting wasn't that high on magic defense, and his Stamina stat wasn't high either. \u00a0If magic spells rained down on him, he wouldn't survive the experience.</p><br/><p>\u2018Of course\u2026\u2026.\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p>However, Pelato had already made his decision. \u00a0He had already decided this course of action two days ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cRes\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>They would reset.</p><br/><p>The magicians would once again send their magic spells at once.</p><br/><p>That was the plan, but\u2026\u2026.\u00a0</p><br/><p>- I'll block it.</p><br/><p>The situation went sideways.</p><br/><p>Ten Skeleton Warriors suddenly appeared on the body of the running Cockatrice. The Skeleton Warriors that had appeared started to ruthlessly stab at the Cockatrice's body.</p><br/><p>Keeeee!\u00a0</p><br/><p>The Cockatrice let out a long cry, and it started to roll on the ground.</p><br/><p>The magicians, who were about to throw the magic spell in their hand, swallowed their spit. \u00a0 Pelato also swallowed the word he was about to yell out.</p><br/><p>- The situation has been straightened.</p><br/><p>Only one person spoke within the silence.</p><br/><p>- The bastard, who threw the magic by mistake, should stay out of this battle. \u00a0If you don't, I'll consider PKing you.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan spat out those words.</p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

The Immoral Prince lost each of his power as he lost each of his Relics. \u00a0In the end, the Immoral Prince lost the powerful magic that exceeded the powers of conventional magic. \u00a0He even lost the use of Red Blood Sword Qi, which had displayed the power to cut anything in this world. \u00a0In the end, the Darkness that had filled its eyes started to subside too.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the start of the Immoral Prince escaping its own \u00a0long nightmare. \u00a0At the same time, it meant the Prince Dean would also have to face off against the nightmare of its own creation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe don't have much time left! \u00a0Endure!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon't be afraid of a Game Over! \u00a0Since we are in this, we are seeing this to the end! \u00a0Don't be afraid for your life just because you can see the end!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the battle was a nightmare from the start to finish for the groups that faced off against the Immoral Prince.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan wasn't watching the battle. \u00a0He didn't look at the numerous Users experiencing the nightmare together.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was pretty far away from the fight. \u00a0It was a location where the trees had been cut or broken from the aftermath of the battle. \u00a0He was sitting on the floor with his head down, and he had his back propped up against one of the intact trees. \u00a0He had his eyes closed, and one couldn't even hear his breathing. \u00a0Hyrkan looked like a corpse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Not too far away from Hyrkan, there was someone, who was in the same state as Hyrkan. \u00a0She was about a dozen feet away from him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even the Storm Queen Shir looked like a corpse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, she wasn't a real corpse. \u00a0Both of them had reached their limit, and they weren't able to move. \u00a0They were in a trance, and they were forcefully hanging on to consciousness through sheer force of will. \u00a0If they really fell asleep, they'll be automatically logged out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, they had reached their limit, and they had no will to fight any more. \u00a0Moreover, the two were having a hard time having any new or productive thoughts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, if they cleared their mind, it would cause them to fall asleep. \u00a0So the two of them had no choice, but to think about the simplest thoughts that was within reach. \u00a0They were thinking about something that took the least amount of energy to think about.... They were repeatedly replaying their earlier memories. \u00a0They were recollecting the events that occurred not too long ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two of them were battling not to fall asleep. \u00a0They were thinking about what just happened as a whole. \u00a0It as something they'll never be ever to forget.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, they weren't the only ones that were thinking about this ensemble. \u00a0Two other figures were also thinking about the what had happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018These two lasted over 5 minutes against such a monster? \u00a0They were also able to solo this?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After defeating the Relic Guardian, Sohank immediately participated in the battle with the Immoral Prince. \u00a0When he approached the 3 minute mark of the battle, he thought about the battles conducted by Hyrkan and Shir. It was a superfluous thought that had nothing to do with the current battle. \u00a0This meant he was having a hard time concentrating, and on top of that, it meant Sohank's exploit against the Immoral Prince was about to come to an end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have no idea who the monster is now.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chev had bought 3 minutes and 44 seconds against the Immoral Prince before he needed a break from the Battle. He thought about the battle conducted by Hyrkan and Shir. He was blown away as he thought about the previous events.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, these two men were simultaneously feeling the same emotions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit. \u00a0this is a really fucked up situation.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I never expected to be in such a miserable state.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They thought about it. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They felt regret, then they became depressed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were justified in thinking that they would become heroes in this Raid. \u00a0They had been so sure about how they'll perform on this stage, but now they were found lacking. \u00a0It was a situation where they felt the worst kind of misery that they could have imagined for themselves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the two men weren't the ones that brought the end to the Immoral Prince.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPrince Dean!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maeung had appeared to put an end to the Immoral Prince's mutiny.</span></p><br/><p>14.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bulkas Ranger's Captain, Maeung</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had formed the Secret Society, and he had fought against Corrupted beings, who misused the power of Corruption. \u00a0In the end, the naked face of Prince Dean was revealed behind his mask. \u00a0Maeung, who had worked tirelessly with his life on the line, suddenly appeared in front of Prince Dean. \u00a0The Users were surprised by Maeung's appearance, but no one held misgivings about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe'll just observe the situation.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJust continue the live broadcast. \u00a0Don't put in any other audio. \u00a0Just make it so that their conversation come through. \u00a0Turn off the commentaries too.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sohank and Chev also looked on as spectators.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had a sour stomach when they realized they couldn't become the main character of the climax. \u00a0Still, they couldn't disrupt the event by speaking unnecessarily. \u00a0They couldn\u2019t bring attention onto themselves during the climax. \u00a0Several million people were watching this, and if they messed this up, the spectators would react more strongly than being upset in their stomach.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn the end, you decided to drag me down by the ankles, Maeung.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere was good cause for me to grab onto your ankles!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While being viewed by everyone, Prince Dean and Maeung spoke their true feelings about each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou were like this from beginning. \u00a0You never trusted any words spoke by me. \u00a0You always held everything about me in suspicion.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs I've said, I had good reasons to distrust you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were NPCs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the lives they led were mere set-up to the game. \u00a0Everyone was well aware of this fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, all the spectators couldn't help, but have their emotions shaken by the story behind these two NPCs. \u00a0Everyone focused their attention on them. \u00a0In the back of everyone's head, they knew these two were NPCs, but none of them trivialized the conversation occurring in front of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Yes. \u00a0It seems Maeung was suspicious of Prince Dean from an early age.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- It seems Prince Dean was a useless scum since he was young.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were people that even empathized with the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou even let it slip to my father that I'm not cut out for kingship.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI was sent to live my whole life in the Bulkas mountain range, because of it. \u00a0That was the cost exacted of me for saying those words. \u00a0I've spent a large portion of my life at the Bulkas mountain range, and I've regretted my actions for a long time. \u00a0However, I don't regret it anymore. \u00a0I was right. \u00a0You aren't cut out to be the king. \u00a0You will not succeed the throne of the Havanz kingdom.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the midst of the conversation, Prince Dean stomped his foot on the ground. \u00a0The ground shook. It was as if an enormous golem had stepped forward. \u00a0The ground let out a brief cry. \u00a0Everyone, who had been focused on the conversation, became startled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe throne does not need a succession! \u00a0I'll climb to the top of the throne using my strength!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Prince Dean yelled out, and the people, who were surprised, felt a chill go up their spine.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how terrifying Prince Dean's shout was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Maeung didn't back down from his voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you still dreaming, Prince Dean? \u00a0The only dream you will have from this point on is a nightmare. \u00a0Wake up. \u00a0Please wake up from this dream. \u00a0The Archmage Bokan gave you the name of Dean. \u00a0I want you to realize the meaning behind your name!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dean. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The name signified a sense of duty on had to perform alongside the martyrs. \u00a0It was to drive out the nightmares that had visited this world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Prince Dean possessed such a name, and Maeung's word delivered a critical blow to Prince Dean that was more potent than any weapon used against him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo not look down upon me!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Prince Dean's eyes were burning with flame, and it made one's blood freeze. \u00a0As everything drew to a close, Prince Dean's body started to burn.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roo-roo! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Prince Dean's skin started to melt. \u00a0Then the enormous power that flowed underneath his skin was revealed. \u00a0It was the power that had made Prince Dean into a transcendent being. \u00a0This power erupted into flame. His power was on a rampage. \u00a0Endless black flames exited from between Prince Dean's armor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, his armor started to melt too.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Finally, the last scene had begun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Prince Dean was disintegrating, and now time was his biggest enemy. \u00a0Even in such a situation, Prince Dean aimed his sword towards Maeung. \u00a0He planned on using his remaining time to kill Maeung.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Maeung didn't back down from Prince Dean's action. \u00a0Maeung also raised his sword, and he pointed his sword toward Prince Dean. \u00a0Their stances were like a mirror image of each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They held their swords up, and they eyed each other. Any further words would have no meaning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The battle between the two started. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng, kah-ahng, kahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The battle ended after the sound of steel clashing rang out thrice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddoohk, ddoohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The arm holding his sword was entirely melted, and Prince Dean's arm in its entirety fell to the floor. \u00a0Finally, Prince Dean's knee melted, and he was on his knees. \u00a0Black liquid was oozing out from the openings in his armor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how Prince Dean was vanishing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maeung looked at Prince Dean as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis isn't why I taught you the way of the sword. \u00a0How did you get onto the path of Corruption?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI won't ask for forgiveness from anyone. \u00a0If you are looking for me to regret my actions, don't expect it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The words were spat out by Prince Dean, but his voice was different now. \u00a0His voice was diminishing rapidly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed Prince Dean would only be able to speak a handful of words. \u00a0His voice continued to thin out. \u00a0One wouldn't have been able to hear his word if one wasn't nearby and listening really closely.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Maeung also didn't have much to say to Prince Dean.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPeople live behind only their names in death. \u00a0Dean. \u00a0Please leave behind something that befits your name.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Prince Dean didn't give an answer. \u00a0A feeling of desolation flowed out of him. \u00a0This feeling lasted for a long time. \u00a0It lasted for so long that the people started thinking. \u00a0The Immoral Prince was about to greet death without saying anything. \u00a0It felt like Prince Dean wasn't going to say anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">With this thought in mind, everyone started to relax when it happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEverything started from the Ruined Kingdom. \u00a0Everything will end there too.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After leaving behind his last words, Prince Dean caved in on himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Immoral Prince has met his death.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Corrupted Army is no more.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Another era had come to an end. \u00a0However, all the people present were still tense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immoral Prince was dead. \u00a0However, the ending to today's battle hadn't come to pass yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The one that'll put the period at the end of this battle wasn't Maeung. \u00a0The main characters of Warlord wasn't the NPCs. \u00a0It was the Users. \u00a0Maeung moved across the stage to find the User that'll bring this battle to a close.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maeung headed towards a User that was weakly leaning up against a tree. \u00a0He stood in front of Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had succeeded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had contributed the most in stopping the Immoral Prince's Corruption. \u00a0He deserved the right to bring this era to a close. \u00a0Everyone in Warlord, and viewers around the world acknowledged this fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou did well. \u00a0When I saw you for the first time, I thought this task was too much for you. \u00a0However, in the end, you were able to delay the fall of this world.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only thing left was Hyrkan's answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His answer would be a period at the end of this event. \u00a0Everyone focused on Hyrkan's mouth. \u00a0What would Hyrkan say in such a situation? \u00a0Would he say lines that would stoke the romanticism of this current situation? \u00a0Or will he leave behind a long-lasting message? \u00a0Or maybe he would speak in a playful manner. \u00a0Maybe his last words will make everyone smile a little bit at the end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While everyone was focused on him, Hyrkan opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? \u00a0It ended? \u00a0Did we catch them all? \u00a0Huh? \u00a0Maeung? \u00a0What the hell?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In many ways, his words would remain forever in the history of Warlord. \u00a0The period was put at the end of this episode.</span></p><br/><p>15.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a bright office. \u00a0In most offices, half the lights would be turned off to save cost of electricity. However, this office wasn't like that at all. \u00a0It was as if the occupant wanted to use 100% of his lights. \u00a0The inside of the office was brightly lit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The owner of the office was talking busily into the phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI asked for a Warlord exclusive V-Gear two weeks ago from the Peach Store. \u00a0So why haven't I heard anything even though I contacted them two weeks ago? \u00a0Report to me the name and position of the man, who turned me down. I'll negotiate directly with him.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The owner of the office was young. \u00a0At the very most, he was in his mid thirties. \u00a0He was a man with blonde hair, which had been shorn close to his scalp. He looked like a martial artist. The region above his eyes were protruding as if it had been rearranged by fighting over a long period of time. He was a memorable man. \u00a0If one was being nice then he was memorable. \u00a0If one was speaking bluntly, he looked menacing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This menacing man was named Tobi Gwynn.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was Tobo Soft's founder, and he had made Warlord. \u00a0With the big success of Warlord, he had experienced a meteoric rise when Tobo Soft set its IPO. \u00a0His name was now amongst the billionaires of the world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll say this again. Don't speak as if you are satisfied. I want you to be on the offensive! \u00a0I don't want the other game companies and contents companies to catch their breath! \u00a0I want you to make it so that anyone, who enjoys Warlord will go to the Peach Store.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tobi Gwynn was nicknamed the Hungry Man. \u00a0He had a cherished opinion that a man should always be hungry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he was very busy. \u00a0If he had nothing to do, he made up work to do. \u00a0That was his personality. \u00a0This was why all his business was done at the office. \u00a0He didn't even want to travel to different locations to meet others. \u00a0He was very stingy with his time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he could do everything he wanted inside his office. If needed, he could use the V-gear to speak to others in the virtual reality. \u00a0If that was too annoying to do, he could create an augmented reality environment in his office for meetings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What was worse was the snacks he had piled up on the corner of his desk. \u00a0It seemed his meal time was too precious to waste too. \u00a0If someone who didn't know him saw his office, one might think this was an office for a snack export business.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why most board members and major shareholders rarely had the opportunity to meet Tobi Gwynn. There was only one person he spoke face to face with on a regular basis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddok ddok! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he heard the knock, Tobi immediately ended the call even though the conversation hadn't ended.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEnter.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The door was opened instead of a reply. \u00a0A very tall, lanky and black-haired Asian man entered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Immoral Prince Raid was completed not too long ago.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tobo Soft's Steering Committee Team Leader Chen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This man held a post that was quite rare. \u00a0When most businesses expanded, they kept their planning team, and this team was divided into the strategic planning committee and the management committee. \u00a0It was very rare for a business to have a steering committee on top of those two. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This man held a rare position, and he was also the only one that could get a direct audience with Tobi. \u00a0In many ways, Chen was a unique man.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow long did it take?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt took them 49 minutes and 35 seconds.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAmazing. \u00a0Even in our fastest estimates, the report said it would take at least 70 minutes... \u00a0Let's see\u2026 \u00a0They finished it 30% faster than expected. \u00a0Normally, a 30% error or is it a mistake.... No, it can't be a mistake. \u00a0Maybe I should call the result to be bullshit. \u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of answering, Chen placed a thick report on Tobi's desk. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In this day and age, he was still using paper reports. \u00a0Tobo Soft was a cutting edge technology company, so it was very hard to come across a report such as this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI've organized the data relating to this Immoral Prince Raid.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tobi didn't look at the report.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe didn't do our job right. \u00a0The report probably spells that out, but that is all I need to know. \u00a0To sum it all up, we were incompetent. \u00a0Am I right? \u00a0Do you have a problem with my assessment?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of answering, Chen lightly bowed his head. \u00a0He was so tall that when he bowed his head, it was more striking. \u00a0It felt as if his apology was a bit more sincere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, when Chen raised his head again, his face was unapologetic. \u00a0There was no indication that Chen was troubled by anything that had happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead, he immediately placed a new report on Tobi's desk. \u00a0Tobi eyed the new report. \u00a0The report was much thinner than the one before. \u00a0If one counted it, it was only 15 pages. \u00a0Tobi turned his eyes towards Chen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is a proposal for a new project.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA new project?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. The methods we have been using up until now isn't working. \u00a0Our existing strategies will be discarded, and I believe we have to come up with new methods.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tobi nodded his head lightly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA new project. \u00a0I like that word. \u00a0Isn't that a word used by motivated people? \u00a0Isn't that right?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tobi immediately read the content of the report. \u00a0No, Tobi didn't read the report. \u00a0He just looked over it, and in a flash, it was stored inside his head. \u00a0After saving the 15 pages inside his head, he closed his eyes. \u00a0He was now earnestly reading the content of the report.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tobi opened his mouth when he read the content of the report.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe will lose 2 more months from our estimated time period.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTo be precise, it'll be 61 days. \u00a0I am aware of it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the answer was given, Chen immediately took the reports handed to him by Tobi, and he left the office.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Chen disappeared, Tobi started tapping his forehead with his hand. \u00a0The expression he had on his face as he tapped his forehead was ill-matched with the bright atmosphere of his office.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

Where is he?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Wasn't he here until a moment ago? \u00a0Why can't we see him?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSearch carefully! He was here a moment ago!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The three Users started to look around the the location where Hyrkan had gone missing. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Two of the Users was wearing armor, and one User was wearing a priest's robe. \u00a0This was a party made out of two Swordsman and a Priest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They weren't wearing particularly expensive items. \u00a0It was a mixture of Rare and Normal Rank Items. \u00a0There wasn't any uniformity in the Items they had on. \u00a0This was especially true for the armors. \u00a0The two users looked unsightly in their armors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was looking down at the Users from atop a tree branch, and he still had an unpleasant smile on his face. \u00a0As he was smiling, Hyrkan took a handful of Skeleton Fragments out of his pocket, and he threw it towards the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Too-too-toohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Fragments rained down like hail, and one of them hit a User's helm. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Toohng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It lightly hit his helm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A dull sound rang out inside his helm, and the User lifted his head up in confusion. \u00a0When he looked up, he saw a large object falling from the sky. \u00a0That was all he saw.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A white sword pierced through the helm to lodge itself in between the User's eyes. \u00a0Of course, he didn't see the sword strike.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh. \u00a0What the hell?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It sounded as if the User had suffered an accident instead of being attacked. The words that slipped out the User's mouth was something one would say when one suffered a mishap.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The person directly involved didn't react properly. However, his two companions had the proper reaction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's the Hahoe Mask!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying the shouts, one of the two remaining party members swung his sword towards Hyrkan. Hyrkan had just landed on the floor and his sword was still stuck between the User's eyes. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shweek! \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan easily avoided the horizontal sword strike. \u00a0The attack wasn't that fast, and it was lacking in terms of technique. Moreover, he hadn't used any Skills. \u00a0The attack was like child\u2019s play to Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sword, which had lost its target, immediately hit the other party member, who had been standing next to Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggahhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a joke of a sword, but the User, who had swung the sword, had a decent amount of Strength Stat. \u00a0The sword strike immediately put a dent in his comrade's armor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-ahk!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The blinded User finally reacted in a way befitting the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI...I'm sorry!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSorry? Why the hell did you attack me? \u00a0What's going on right now?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Hahoe Mask was above our heads!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally? Where is he right now?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe's next to you!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The blinded user became frightened, and he started to show vigilance against his surrounding. \u00a0Of course, he had the Blind status, so he couldn't see anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCure! Someone Cure me!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0All right!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan stared blankly at their antics as he stood several steps away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The scene of the rag tag group struggling didn't amuse Hyrkan. \u00a0It actually made him depressed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The three of them took advantage of Hyrkan's consideration. \u00a0They were afforded a brief respite, so the three of them got into formation. \u00a0Then they shouted towards Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyrkan! We challenge you!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan didn't answer their shouted words. \u00a0He didn't even get into his fighting stance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Warriors, who had already formed, moved instead of Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? Uh!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The situation had already come to an end. \u00a0The five Skeleton Warriors wore the Poison Mink fur armor, and the monsters were too powerful for the half-assed 3 man party to handle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan didn't even need to participate in the battle. \u00a0It wasn't worth it, and the situation resolved itself in a dull manner. \u00a0Hyrkan cut off the wrist watch from the User's corpses. He mumbled to himself in a brusque manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is the tenth group.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The view on his Waltz video had broke through the 70 million mark. The view count wasn't showing any signs of slowing down. \u00a0The ripple effect caused by the video was currently getting larger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A snowball was rolling down a snow-covered mountain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Waltz video was a big hit, and of course, it had been mentioned in the media. The media attention would once again focus the public's interest on the video. \u00a0It basically started a feedback loop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In this process, the Hahoe Mask's worth naturally rose, and when his worth rose, the number of groups hunting for his head increased.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, no one would give a reward for taking down Hyrkan. \u00a0Warlord didn't have such a system.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, logic didn't necessarily pass muster in this game. \u00a0Why were so many people trying to catch Hyrkan? \u00a0Currently, Hyrkan wasn't suspicious of the situation. He just considered it to be an unwelcoming situation. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There really are a lot of weird bastards that want to pick a fight with me.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the past, he would have smiled at the watches that automatically dropped into his lap. He would have cut off the wrists of customers, and he would have considered their watches to be a donation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thank \u00a0you very much!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would have thanked them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the current Hyrkan wasn't the past Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018They think I'm fair game? \u00a0Is that what's going on?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, Hyrkan couldn't make a big profit by taking watches away from mediocre users. It would be more beneficial if he could kill one more monster than wasting his time on these Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the fact that the mediocre Users were targeting Hyrkan was sure evidence that Hyrkan was being seen as an easy target.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it isn't as if there weren't any reasons for this to be true. \u00a0First, Hyrkan's guild affiliation wasn't formally known. \u00a0He was unaffiliated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fact that he was unaffiliated meant Users won't have to worry about a possible backlash.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if Hyrkan was amazing, he was soloing this game. \u00a0For Warlord Users, a high head count was the ultimate trump card. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There wasn't anything that could beat sheer number of Users!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a law akin to law of gravity to Warlord Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the Warlord User's minds, Hyrkan was someone that could be killed if the numerical advantage could be pressed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bigger problem for Hykran was the fact that there was another faction, who thought along the same line as the normal Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Guilds! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Other groups were looking down on Hyrkan more so than the Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I idle here, I'll get swept up into a dog fight, and I might be put down like a dog.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was in danger </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could power through here, and he could create a stronghold for himself. \u00a0On the other hand, if he wasted his time here, he wouldn\u2019t be able close the distance with the frontrunners. \u00a0He would be stuck without being able to improve on his standing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was well aware of the danger, so this was why Hyrkan wasn't in a good mood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Hyrkan had an ill-humored expression on his face, he took out a Gem. \u00a0He melted the Gem using Clay Play. \u00a0When the melted Gem reached the floor, it immediately transformed into a long-legged Lizard Golem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan rode on the back of the Lizard. \u00a0He spoke as he dug his heels into the side of Lizard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDrive Mode, destination Missandra's Castle.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After receiving its order, the Lizard Golem started to run quickly. \u00a0Hyrkan opened his Hologram Window, and he replayed a video.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- We are currently entering the second phase. \u00a0There hasn't been any casualties yet. \u00a0There is a 98% chance that our plan will succeed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the Stormhunter's Boss Raid video.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Warlord Users watched successful Raid videos, so they could review and make preparation. It was impossible to learn everything through actual experience.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to study hard.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he had to do more to become stronger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I progress in the Main Scenario Quest, I'll be able to gain a lot of Chronicle Unique Items.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one wanted to get strong in Warlord, one needed Items with powerful Options.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to lay the foundation, so I can get up to the level of the Ranked Users.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to lay down these foundations, so he could become truly powerful as he leveled up. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Just wait a little bit for me. \u00a0When I level \u00a0up into the Rankings, I\u2019ll tie those, who dared to touch me, including the guilds. \u00a0I\u2019ll cut all their hands and necks.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan knew better than anyone on how he could get over his current difficulties.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan headed towards the Cursed Domain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo had a corpulent body that made one sympathize with the armor he wore. \u00a0A User wearing a robe approached him. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Hahoe Mask is said to be moving towards the southeast..\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that so?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhile he is moving, he has taken down a significant number of users.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that so?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo's answer was very short. When he heard Apollo\u2019s answer, the User named Jiang carefully brought up a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo why do we have to pay so much attention to the Hahoe Mask?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiang had become an officer of the Apollo guild, so he could receive the crumbs off of Apollo's table. \u00a0In truth, he didn't care what Apollo did if he continued to receive the crumbs off of Apollo's table. The other officers didn't question Apollo's decisions. \u00a0They just did what he asked, then they did what they wanted behind his back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was hard to understand Apollo's decision. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t hold back his curiosity. \u00a0This was why Jiang had posed his question. \u00a0Moreover, Jiang was the first one to ask Apollo a question amongst the executive members of the Apollo guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo opened his narrow eyes when he heard Jiang\u2019s question. \u00a0If someone saw him right now, one would think he still had his eyes closed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiang added more details to his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTo be truthful, the Hahoe Mask did kill our guild members. \u00a0However, it wasn't an egregious enough offense to invest this much resource into the revenge? \u00a0This is especially true if we consider the amount of money we invested into the Red Lake incident\u2026. \u00a0It was a large sum of money, but what benefits did we gain?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoong.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo let out a loud snort at his words. \u00a0Accompanying the snort, Apollo spoke what was inside his mind. \u00a0This was the first time he had done so.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t care about bastards like the Hahoe Mask, who shine for a brief moment.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiang\u2019s eyes narrowed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo was a greedy and vindictive pig. \u00a0Still, his intelligence wasn\u2019t on the level of a pig.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was capable of using his head. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, he thought in shrewd ways when needed. \u00a0He had a lot of greed and obsessions. \u00a0It was akin to a starving pig with food in front of it. \u00a0The pig sometimes came up with ingenious ideas to get to the food.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed this was the moment where Apollo had come up with an ingenious idea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cListen to me closely, Jiang. \u00a0Currently, we have a hold over Heh-bibin.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiang nodded his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo had contracted out the hunting of the Hahoe Mask to Heh-bibin, and Heh-bibin had failed. \u00a0The funny part was that Hahoe Mask didn't know Heh-bibin and Big Smile had targeted him. \u00a0However, Apollo knew the truth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the weapons that was borrowed from Big Smiles was used in hunting the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask also didn\u2019t know about this. \u00a0Apollo was the only one, who knew about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was Heh-bibin's weak point.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMoreover, the Big Smile isn't in a good state right now. \u00a0Aren't they?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat's true.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of that, the Big Smiles guild wasn't on good standing amongst the 30 great guilds. \u00a0Recently, they got some breathing room, but it wasn't as if they had made an official truce with the Triple Wing. There were plenty of reasons to believe that the war would continue sooner or later.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Big Smiles had a stubborn problem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They lacked killer contents.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guilds that fought for the top spots amongst the 30 great guilds all had unique contents. \u00a0This was their strong point.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guilds like Red Bulls and Stormhunters showed overwhelming skills in Raids. \u00a0The Hydra Guild showed the uncanny ability of progressing in the Main Scenario Quest, and any Quests related to it. \u00a0In the case of the Sweepers guild, they had a unique content called the Monster Sweep. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the Big Smiles guild was a bit different. \u00a0They were a large guild, yet they weren't really good at anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To be blunt, if they weren't a guild made out of mostly Chinese Users, they wouldn't even be in the 30 great guilds. \u00a0The market called China had elevated them to their current status.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, they couldn't get out of this with their own efforts. \u00a0If they can't get out of their troubles using their own efforts, then they could be influenced by outside forces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPerhaps?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he heard the story, Jiang had a thought.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I'm not aiming for scraps like the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0I want an executive seat in the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0That is what I want.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo started to laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI've already finished my negotiations with Brooks. Brooks will look out for my back now.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo was aiming for an executive seat inside Big Smiles. \u00a0Moreover, he had won over one of Big Smile's executives. If Apollo fulfilled certain conditions, Brooks was willing to bring in Apollo into the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0From Brooks' perspective, there was no downside in having an amicable relationship with Apollo, who had a stout background.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was Brooks' accident had caused a war between Triple Wings and Big Smiles. \u00a0This in turn weakened Brooks, but on the other hand, it had elevated Heh-bibin's influence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In such a situation, what if one knew about Heh-bibin's weak point?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiang was impressed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018His head works really well in certain situations.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had thought Apollo only cared about greed and money. \u00a0He never expected him to come up with such a plan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, greed took hold inside Jiang. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It's a good thing I asked him about it. \u00a0This opportunity is a jackpot.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Apollo could become an executive of the Big Smiles guild, the Apollo guild would be absorbed into the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0The executive members of the Apollo guild would be treated pretty well inside the Big Smile guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one received preferential treatment from one of the 30 Great guilds, it was akin to making a transition from a civilian to noble status in the middle ages.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiang lowered his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs expected of our guild master, the scale of the plot you think about is on a different level. \u00a0I thought you had been trying to catch a mouse like the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0You planned on using the mouse as bait to capture a whale.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. A man like me should fish for a whale instead of a small fish. Isn't it?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are correct.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He immediately spat out a flattery.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo had a generous smile on his face as he listened to Jian's flattery.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

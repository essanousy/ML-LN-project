I would be playing the game by now.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, Ahn-jaehyun had planned on stuffing himself with stamina-increasing food the whole time he was running the great battle. He was going to need a strong body more so than any other time, yet he recently felt his physical fitness get worse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he had saved up his money. \u00a0Basically, he set aside a saving that was specifically for buying stamina-increasing food.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit. \u00a0I never expected to spend so much here.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Shezga castle defense was over and his calculations was done. \u00a0This was why he wasn't comfortable eating an expensive meal. \u00a0He had spent way more than expected. \u00a0Moreover, the bigger problem was the fact that he had used most of the consumable Items he had in storage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Warlord Users, especially the Rankers, had plenty of Storage space. \u00a0With the important hunts, battles and raids in one's immediate future, one didn\u2019t have the time to be scrambling all over the place to purchase the consumables.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, Ahn-jaehyun didn't just have one big mountain to climb. \u00a0He had two big mountains left. \u00a0Of course, Ahn-jaehyun was like an ant conserving food in the summer, so it could have a store in winter. \u00a0He had to tighten his belt once again. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In that context, the food he was eating right now was definite proof that displayed Ahn-jaehyun's elevated position. \u00a0His food and his position within Warlord had gone through a big change. \u00a0This was seen on Ahn-jaehyun's youtube page. \u00a0The number of subscribers, the number of people viewing his videos, and the purchase of his pay-per-view video was on an upward trajectory again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was especially true about the videos he released during the defense of the Shezga castle. \u00a0He had revealed the know-hows of the great battle for the first time. \u00a0His Eat the Tail video had already racked up close to 30 million views. \u00a0This thought relaxed his rigid expression. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Well, I won't be able to recover it immediately, but I'll slowly gain back what I invested this time around.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he thought about the recent corporate sponsorship proposal he received, the \u00a0pink sausage tasted like a Wagyu steak. \u00a0His food tasted better. Ahn-jaehyun's spoon and chopsticks started to move vigorously.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Huh?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before he knew it, Ahn-jaehyun had let go of his spoon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It's finally happened!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun had moved past the 80% mark of climbing a mountain, and the 90% mark was in sight right in front of him.</span></p><br/><p>2.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the Hahoe Mask's interview ended, all the 30 great guilds fought each other to be the first one to announce that they were going to participate in the great battle. \u00a0It was as if they had been waiting for this opportunity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe will only participate in the great battle in stages where the normal Users are suffering. \u00a0Aside from those instances, we will leave the rest to the Users. Please think of our actions as maintaining the order.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their excuse was that they were going to maintain order.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the normal Users were split on the decision.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one set aside whether the defense of the castles was successful or not, there were a portion of Users that were benefitting greatly from participating in the great battle. \u00a0They opposed the decision made by the 30 great guilds. \u00a0It was a fact. If the 30 great guilds participated, the pie had to be shared with more people. \u00a0Moreover, the Hahoe Mask had revealed how to clear the Corrupted army. \u00a0If the Underfoot guilds, and the Users massed in numbers, they were confident that they could succeed in defending the castles by themselves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, the Users below level 100, who hadn't participated in the great battle, rejoiced at the 30 great guild's participation. It was true that the high level Users caused a lot of disturbance in hunting grounds occupied by the low level Users. \u00a0The 30 great guilds were going to fix that problem, so there was no reason for them to disagree with the 30 great guild's announcement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The opinions were split, but the important part was that there was a portion of the Users that agreed with the involvement of the 30 great guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During all of this, the V&amp;V guild and the 8 guilds, who had announced their non-participation, was put in an awkward spot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were a lot of chatter online about them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- What about those guilds that put out a joint statement saying they won't participate in this event?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- If those guys have any honor or pride, they'll stay out of this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For these 9 guilds, the breakthrough happened when they decided to retake the castles instead of defending them. \u00a0The 9 guilds aggressively stepped forward to take back the fallen castles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Some Users saw it as a hollow gesture, but they weren't too upset by it. \u00a0The retaking of the castles was couple degrees harder than defending it. \u00a0This was confirmed when the retaking efforts failed multiple times in a row.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This resulted in the 30 great guilds not competing against each other as everyone contributed in different roles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Some participated in the retaking the castles and the rest defended the castles. \u00a0The Users had been pushed back endlessly, but the situation was quickly changing. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Corrupted army was starting to be pushed back. \u00a0The Corrupted army had to turn the tide of the battle, so a new card was played by them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It appeared at that moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[An incredible Boss Monster has appeared at the Havanz castle!]</span></p><br/><p>3.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Havanz castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the past, it had been called the Cursed castle, and it was at this location where the Corrupted army's hidden ace card made an appearance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Havanz castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The dreary atmosphere from the past was gone. It was a place where high level Users wearing elegant and expensive Items frequented before. \u00a0The castle was in an appalling state compared to the past. \u00a0The castle walls looked like ruins that had been destroyed several thousand years ago. Moreover, it was hard to find an intact buildings beyond the castle wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStart the magical bombardment!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On this wretched stage, a heartless assessment started once again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before the man's shout could come to an end, several hundred magicians used their pre-casted magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the very least, one had to be over level 130.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the very least, one had to have a Rank of Rare.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were the magicians that had invested all their Stats into Intelligence. \u00a0They were popularly known as the 'Extreme Mages'. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The use of their magic was harmonious. \u00a0The earth type magic was the first to be used. \u00a0Uniform earthen walls erupted from the ground. \u00a0It was over 20 meters tall. \u00a0However, these weren't just simple earthen walls. It was called the Shield Wall, and it was able to stop physical and magical attacks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Shield Walls gathered to form a triangle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The powerful magic spells were thrown into the triangle. \u00a0The enormous fireballs burned the forest, and the thunder strikes were falling like a shower. \u00a0Enormous ice spears were descending like lightning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo koo koo! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The powerful magic made the ground cry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hell. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the only expression that could describe the scene.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The one watching this sight was Sweeper guild's primary Raid team leader. \u00a0Spearman Ichni gulped.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Please work.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn't matter in regards to other aspects, but the Sweepers guild was known for being the best in fighting with magic amongst the 30 great guilds. \u00a0The large scale magic bombardment shown right now by the Sweepers guild was something they were proud of.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Ichni always smiled with confidence when he saw the powerful collaboration of magic. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he felt a mixture of fear, nervousness and anxiousness as he swallowed his spit. This was the first time for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'm not expecting it to die, but at the very least, I want it to take some damage. \u00a0Just a little bit. \u00a0If that doesn\u2019t happen, at least damage its armor! Please!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He even prayed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Ichni gulped once again as the prayer fell to the pit of his stomach.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A thundering noise rang out as one Shield Wall broke. \u00a0All the racket created by various magic leaked out of the hole. Smoke, fire, sparks... On top of all the noise, one could hear the sound of footsteps.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The owner of footsteps was a knight wearing armor. The armor he wore wasn't normal. It was a silver colored armor with a black pattern on it. \u00a0There was an eagle's head decorated on the right shoulder, and the left shoulder was decorated with the head of a lion. On his chest, there was the circular crest of the three snakes biting each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of it all, the black pattern was perpetually moving like a living fish across the silver amor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The knight didn't have a shield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead, he held a sword that that constantly rang out as if it was weeping.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In some ways, the sword looked shabby and worthless. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Large boss monsters were big enough to intimidate the Users on sight. \u00a0However, this knight was of a size where it was hard to locate him in the mayhem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Ichni caught sight of the knight, he desperately yelled out. It was the first time he yelled out like this, since he started playing Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRetreat!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Ichni's command, his subordinate next to him reflexively asked the question. \u00a0In truth, it was hard for him to comprehend why they had to retreat. \u00a0It had been less than 10 minutes, since they had started the battle with the knight. After several sporadic exchange, this was the first time they had used the magic bombardment in earnest, yet they were going to retreat?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Ichni was decisive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow can we fight something that can\u2019t be damage by physical, magical or holy attacks? \u00a0Everyone retreat!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, yes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The leader's orders were absolute. His subordinate didn't dispute Ichni's orders. \u00a0He instructed everyone to retreat. Since there were a lot of Users gathered here, the retreat didn't just occur from speaking just one or two words. \u00a0They wasted some time telling everyone of the retreat order.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In reality, it wasn't a lot of time. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It took them around 10 seconds, but...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Huhk!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ichni's subordinate was passing down the order when the knight that had been far away came into view.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn't feel as if the knight had approached him. \u00a0It was as if the knight had disappeared, and it just appeared right in front of his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the knight had his sword raised up high, and the sword was already descending when the Ichni's subordinate realized the knight was there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, Ichni raised his spear to block the sword strike. \u00a0His subordinate stumbled backward in fright.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJust ignore me! \u00a0Evacuate!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ichni encouraged his subordinate to run away. \u00a0His subordinate wordlessly got out of there quickly. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The knight was right in front of his eyes, so Ichni was finally able to get a good look at the knight in front of him. \u00a0While they were in close \u00a0proximity to each other, Ichni could see the milky white eyes flash from within its helmet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Isn't he the left hand of Prince Dean? \u00a0It's sir Argardo.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After a brief moment, he sized up the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggee-eek, ggee-eek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The shaft of Ichni's spear was starting to be cut incrementally as it blocked Argardo's sword. \u00a0It wasn't as if the sword was making a sawing motion. \u00a0This was occurring just from having the sword pressing firmly against the shaft. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCoating!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ichni reflexively used his Skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skill he used was called Coating. For a limited amount of time, the skill made it impossible for one's weapon and armor to be destroyed. \u00a0It was a Unique Skill, and it wasn't easy to acquire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since it wasn't easy to acquire, this meant the effectiveness of the skill was certain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Ichni had took his eyes off his opponent to use the skill. \u00a0At that moment, Argardo kicked Ichni in the stomach. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggwah-roong!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The impact caused a sound that was akin to a thunder clap. Ichni's body flew away like stone skipping across the surface of a lake. \u00a0He was sent roughly skipping across the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ffffuuuuuuuhhhhck!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His world was spinning at that moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the extremely chaotic situation, Ichni came to a stop, and he looked in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Where is he?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Argardo wasn't in his field of vision. Ichni had a small hunch. \u00a0He raised his head slightly to look up. \u00a0Ichni was finally able to see Argardo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Argardo's sword skewered Ichni's head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Ooh-ahk. He became a roadkill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Spearman Ichni couldn't even last a minute.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Isn't that the Sweeper guild's Raid Team? In truth, the result was to be expected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Sweepers guild mainly deal with clearing monsters. \u00a0Their Raid team can't even crack the Top 10 in terms of power. \u00a0Still, this was way too one-sided.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The White-eyed knight sir Argardo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was called the left hand of Prince Dean. \u00a0After the Sweepers guild acquired the rights to the Raid, they immediately broadcasted the raid live.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A significant number of people purchased the live ticket, and the ripple caused by what had happened on live broadcast was seen in the comments section.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir read the responses, and she turned her head. \u00a0Hatch was watching the same broadcast, and he spoke when he felt her gaze on him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you have a question for me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are your thoughts on what just happened?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you want my opinion on Argardo or the Sweepers guild?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBoth.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The answer came from a different source.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf the Queen and I fight him, that NPC will be beaten to a pulp within 10 minutes! \u00a0In the first place, the Sweepers guild was out of their minds if they thought they could deal with...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey! Filter your words! \u00a0Chose your words more carefully!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Storm Princess Hahui was about to say the Sweepers guild was trying eat something that was out of their reach. \u00a0However, Hatch cut her off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoes that mouth say anything it wants?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahui glared at Hatch. \u00a0However, Hatch justly ignored Hahui. \u00a0He spoke to Shir.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe checked up on it, and Skills won't work on it. \u00a0It isn't affected by physical attacks and magical attacks. \u00a0It might be the armor, but on the other hand, it could be some unknown skill granted to it by the Corrupted power. \u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The White-eyed knight sir Argardo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The information about this NPC was pretty widespread. \u00a0Amongst the NPC knights in Warlord, it was considered to be in the top 10. \u00a0Of course, when the Immoral Prince was revealed to be Prince Dean, the battle with Argardo was inevitable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a matter of when, where and how. \u00a0It was going to happen eventually.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now everyone was aware of this fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow is it compared to the Corrupted Count?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn an RPG game, the goblin that appears later in the game is much stronger then the dragon from the early portions of the game. \u00a0They aren't even comparable.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGive me a more detailed explanation.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe knight's close combat ability is on a whole different level compared to the monsters we've faced until now. \u00a0Do you mind if I speak a little bit more bluntly?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSpeak.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn my opinion, the knight is better than the Queen.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou want to die?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahui once again interrupted the conversation. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch let out a sigh. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had on an expression that said, 'What do I have to do to make this bitch shut up?'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat evidence do you have?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir glanced at Hahui. \u00a0Hahui clamped her mouth shut, and at the same time, she pouted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After seeing this, Hatch immediately opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhen facing this enemy, experience in PVP is much more important than Raid experience. \u00a0This is the Queen's weakness.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir nodded her head</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was true. \u00a0Shir was also strong at PVP. There weren't that many people, who she considered to be her peer. \u00a0In a one on one fight, the number of Users that could confidently beat her could be counted on the fingers of her hand. \u00a0This was the case even if she searched through the entire User base of Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this didn't mean she had a lot of experience of fighting one on one battles. In the first place, how many Users would try to PK her? \u00a0Even if one wanted to PK her, one would be cut down before one could even reach her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this wasn't a weakness that was only present in Shir.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe problem is this weakness is present in most of the Strikers representing the 30 great guilds.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The 30 great guild\u2019s primary raid teams were mainly made out of Strikers. \u00a0They were called the stars of Warlord, and it was almost impossible for the normal Users to even meet them. \u00a0In other words, these particular Users had never had any harrowing experiences.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a lack of PVP experience, yet the battle with Argardo required competence in PVP. Even if one put aside the disparity in number, the outcome of this battle was hard to predict. \u00a0The Sweepers guild had deployed \u00a0their massive bombardment of magic skills, yet it hadn\u2019t worked at all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf we can catch this bastard, the game will be set.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Argardo was the perfect trophy. \u00a0The guild that kills it would be called the best for a good amount of time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch nodded his head. \u00a0There was a very slim chance for success, but they couldn't avoid the battle with Argardo. \u00a0If one did avoid it, it would damage one's reputation more so than losing to Argardo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll go apply for the raid. We'll be in the back of the queue, but we won't have to worry about the order of queue.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Argardo was taken down, there would only be one thing left afterwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen we'll get ready for the Immoral Prince raid.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When one era comes to an end, one had to get ready for the new era.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

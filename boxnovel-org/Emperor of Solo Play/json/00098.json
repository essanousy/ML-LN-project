It was located southeast of Misandra's Castle, where there was a tall mountain called the Ricky mountain. \u00a0There was a long winding road past the Ricky mountain, and one had to cross the Inue Lake! One finally reached the boundary of the Cursed Domain after crossing all of those landmarks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one could pinpoint a location to this degree in Warlord, one was basically as knowledgeable as a navigator.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he was currently going around in circles. \u00a0He couldn't even get past the Ricky Mountain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I had no idea the Block Field was still up. \u00a0This is really unexpected.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Block Field. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No Users could get past this barrier, and it was in the way of Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Block Field was placed beyond the Ricky Mountain, and Hyrkan already knew the Block Field hadn't been dispelled yet. \u00a0It was something one could confirm through several internet searches.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, he never thought the Block Field would be a problem for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I've received the Quest, yet the Block Field is still present... \u00a0This is a pain.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had received the Main Scenario Quest. \u00a0In most cases, the Main Scenario Quest acted as a key in dissolving the Block Field. \u00a0This was why Hyrkan hadn't worried over the Block Field. \u00a0He had been worried about getting to the Cursed Domain faster than everyone else. \u00a0He wanted to get there first, and he wanted to eat all those delicious Titles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Some random bastards tried to block my path before and now such a trivial thing is blocking my path.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this fact didn't have all negative connotations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead, it could be seen as a positive news.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The fact that the Block Field is around means the Cursed Domain is still intact... \u00a0It means the Storm Hunters haven't reached this place yet or they are progressing in a different Quest route as me... \u00a0I like that.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The possibility of the Stormhunters guild receiving the same Quest to search for the Cursed Domain, and them being ahead of him was gone. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an element that was sufficiently positive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018All right.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan let go of his sour mood, and he organized his situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His next task was set. \u00a0He had to dispel the Block Field. \u00a0A Block Field couldn't be dispelled by force.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It's been awhile since the Misandra's Castle was released to the Users. \u00a0I'm sure the Quests are completed up to a certain point.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan turned his head. \u00a0First, he had to return to the Misandra Castle. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Huh?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if it had been waiting for Hyrkan to turn his head, a monster appeared behind Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-roo-roo\u2026\u2026! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-huhng! Koo-huhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a wolf human standing on its two feet. \u00a0It was a werewolf. \u00a0It was different from a normal werewolf. \u00a0It was holding very rusty knives in both hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a level 100 monster called Weapon Werewolf. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Amongst the level 100 mid-sized monsters, it was a monster of average difficulty. \u00a0It wasn't hard to kill, but it wasn't easy to kill either... \u00a0Basically, it was a middle of the road monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Four of them appeared. \u00a0At the very least, it was numerous enough where a single User wouldn\u2019t be able to easily deal with them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan didn't even unsheathe his Ivan's Sword when the pack appeared. \u00a0He didn't even snort at their appearance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead, he flicked his fingers twice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This caused the Skeleton Warriors that had been on standby to appear from behind the Weapon Werewolves. \u00a0They held golden colored swords that looked to be made by smelting gold.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kuhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if they were surprised by the appearance of the Skeletons, the Weapon Werewolves desperately turned their bodies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The battle started immediately.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Werewolves let out a roar as they charged first. The eyes of the Skeleton Warriors and Knight burned as they silently looked at the Werewolves. \u00a0They dodged the incoming attack, and their fighter's disposition was strong enough to cut the enemies with a single stroke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had a sour expression on his face as he opened his Hologram Window. Then he searched for more information.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018No 30 great guilds are present in Misandra's Domain. \u00a0There aren't even Underfoot guilds there. \u00a0This might be more annoying than I thought it would be. \u00a0Any ways, what should I have for dinner tonight?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was starting to fight battles in a way that was befitting a Necromancer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Misandra's Castle was revealed to the Warlord Users around 2 months ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the world of gaming, two month was almost like two years. \u00a0It wasn't a short amount of time, and a lot of Users had visited Misandra's Castle. \u00a0They wanted to dispel the Block Field present beyond the castle. \u00a0This was why they diligently found and cleared the Quests.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the Block Field would not be easily dispelled. \u00a0They kept finding likely clues, yet no one could find the actual key.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a situation like this, the Users made a simple judgement call.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh well. I'll just go hunt somewhere else.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, I'll only get a single Title if the Block Field is dispelled. \u00a0Wouldn't it be more profitable to level up at a different hunting ground?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Give up. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the obvious course of action.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Not many Users were willing to invest their time here when it hindered with one's level up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Misandra's Castle was located in an ambiguous location.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One could earn Quests between level 80 to 100 at Misandra's Castle. The level 80 Users diligently did their Quests, and they diligently leveled up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What happens when they reach level 90?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In Warlord, there was a single goal every users tried to fulfill at level 90. \u00a0It was to get to level 100 as soon as possible. \u00a0They wanted to go through the Advancement! \u00a0If one wanted to go through the Advancement as soon as possible, one had to find an effective hunting ground. Misandra's Castle was hardly an effective hunting ground, so there was no reason to stay there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the Users left for various parts after they completed Quests up to a certain point.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">New Users influxed into this location, but they repeated the actions of their predecessors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, not everyone left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoes anyone want to do a Quest with me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was different from the other Users. \u00a0He was part of the minority of people, who was staying behind at Misandra's Castle for his Quest progress.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was level 91, and his Class was Magician.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As a Magician, he couldn't operate out in the field by himself. This was why he was gathering party members at Misandra's Subjugation Association. \u00a0He was trying to progress in his Quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat kind of Quest is it?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is an Exploration Quest. It is a Quest to find the remains...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoes it give a lot of EXP? What's the Reward?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's an Exploration Quest, so it doesn't give much EXP nor a lot of rewards.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat for?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">in the end, his recruiting process always ended on a bad note.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the same right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What for?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After saying that phrase, the User turned around and left as if he never wanted to see Zeet again. The User's action was so cold that Zeet felt a little bit humiliated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet gritted his teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit! I should have chosen the Swordsman Class instead... \u00a0At the very least, I could carry out the quest whether I sink or swim!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet manipulated his watch as he spoke. \u00a0He checked the Quest again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Blackened Remains] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Quest Rank : Rare</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Quest Level Range : 90 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Quest Content : Recover the Blackened Remains. Deliver it to the fugitive 'Chados'.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Quest Reward : Chados' Staff. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blackened Remains Quest. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a Rare Rank Quest. It meant it wasn't an easily obtainable Quest. \u00a0However, it wasn't special enough where only Zeet was carrying it out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was actually the opposite. \u00a0If one was diligently leveling up from level 80 to 90 at Misandra's Castle, one would receive this Quest. \u00a0The Quest Route had already been made public.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was a Quest that was nicknamed the Diploma. \u00a0When Users received this Quest, a vast majority of them left Misandra's Castle to search for another hunting ground. \u00a0It was as if they had graduated from this location. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a reason why Zeet was holding onto this Quest, while he was stalled in leveling up. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'm sure this Quest is the key that will break open the Block Field.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Numerous Users went through the Quests available at Misandra's Castle, and they all reached the Blackened Remains Quest. \u00a0However, no one had solved the Quest yet.The Block Field remained closed. \u00a0There was ample reasons why one should be suspicious that this Quest was related to the Block Field.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, one could be suspicious, but it was hard to have conviction about such a conjecture. Zeet was so sure, because while he was progressing another Quest, he had found the identity of Chados.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Chados is a fugitive. \u00a0For some reason, he is a fugitive running away from some unfortunate circumstances.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chados was a fugitive that had run away from somewhere across the Block Field. \u00a0He had heard this story from a NPC caretaker named Dodo, who maintenanced the castle walls. \u00a0Moreover, this truth hadn't been spread anywhere online. \u00a0Zeet had never disclosed this information to anyone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was basically Zeet's trump card.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was very sure about his conjecture. \u00a0He just had to ramp up his efforts in gathering party member. \u00a0That was the answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was\u2026\u2026. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, look who it is? \u00a0Isn't it, Zeet?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet had a disadvantage that no one else had here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are still operating out of Misandra's Castle? Huh?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Three Users approached Zeet. \u00a0The three Users had identical guild emblems on their chests. \u00a0It was the Swing Guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI thought we squared everything last time!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Swing Guild. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a medium-sized guild with about 300 members. They weren't considered to be one of the 30 great guilds nor were they part of the Underfoot guilds. They were a guild formed for the purpose of mutual cooperation. \u00a0The members of the guild consisted of low level Users to pretty high level Users. \u00a0There were a diverse group of Users gathered in this guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, they were a guild in bad standing with Zeet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat did I say? \u00a0Did I say we'll smash you to pieces when we find you near the Field?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat a strange bastard. We were just wondering why you were still here. We were just curious!!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit. They should just be transparent with their threats, sons of bitches!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been a disagreement that happened quite frequently in games.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had met up by chance, and they had started a party hunt. \u00a0They bickered, since they weren't in sync with each other. \u00a0The bickering escalated. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Why are you so lacking?'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Like your mother?'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the conversation escalated, feelings were hurt and there was had been an argument.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet had gotten in a disagreement with a User, and there had been an accident afterwards during the party hunt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet was a bit late in his assist, so the User that was playing the role of a Tanker had experienced Game Over.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an accident born out of a mistake, but the aggrieved User felt like it was done on purpose.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Afterwards, all of Swing guild didn't see Zeet in a \u00a0positive light. \u00a0This was why these Users had spent a long time at Misandra's Castle, yet they operated far from each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Those damn bastards. \u00a0They aren't even a 30 great guild, yet... \u00a0Since I'm alone, they are ganging up on me like a pack of dogs.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason why Zeet wasn't able to aggressively further his agenda. \u00a0This was why he solicited every new Users he saw to join his party.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Yes. \u00a0It isn't that I'm dodging shit, because I'm afraid of it. \u00a0I'm avoiding it since it is dirty.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A man appeared in front of Zeet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Uh?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To escape the attention of the Swing Guild, he was about to head out. \u00a0At that moment, he came face to face with a User at the door.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had on a plain armor, and there was a plain sword equipped on his waist. \u00a0The impression the User gave off.....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He has a really gullible face.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The User really looked like someone that could be tricked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a flash, Zeet's eyes checked the other User's Item setting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Swordsman Class!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At a glance, this User obviously had a setting common to the Swordsman Class. Zeet reflexively asked the man a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you perhaps here to receive a Quest?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The User silently nodded his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen would you like to do a Quest with me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet spoke the next part with a low voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is a secret, but the Block Field might open if this Quest is completed.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wouldn't have made that comment about the Block Field to Normal Users, but the man in front of him looked as if he would fall for anything... \u00a0He felt this was a chance that would never come again, so he had thrown out the bait.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if Zeet's bait had taken hold, the User looked at Zeet with an interested expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf it isn't true, how much are you going to give me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the words and tone of his voice didn't indicate he was interested. \u00a0The other User continued to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf I complete the Quest and the Block Field is still up, how much compensation are you going to give me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was most definitely a pushover, but it seemed Zeet had met someone with a real tiger's mouth. </span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

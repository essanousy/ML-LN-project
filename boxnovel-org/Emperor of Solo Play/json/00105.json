I'm really tired.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was tiring.. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, Hyrkan should have already ended his playing time. \u00a0If he followed his original schedule, he should have been logged out 40 minutes ago. \u00a0He should have been asleep dreaming about eating steaks inside his dreamland.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, time was very valuable to Hyrkan. \u00a0If one wanted to be called an expert in Warlord, one had to dedicate one's life to Warlord. \u00a0However, the biggest obstacle wasn't the scary monsters inside the game. \u00a0It was being able to keep one's body healthy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the level 130 Black Lamia wasn't such a sweet fruit, Hyrkan wouldn't \u00a0have made any changes to his schedule.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I almost didn't catch it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the Black Lamia was worth investing his time to catch it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the Great Urugal mountain, the Users were still avoiding the region between the entrance and the halfway point of the mountain. In this ambiguous region, there was a very low chance of finding the Black Lamia. \u00a0Most users weren't even aware of the existence of the Black Lamia. \u00a0If he could get the footage of the hunt and make an Item out of the Ingredient coin, it would be worth a lot of money. \u00a0The incredibly luxurious Snake Leather Belt was made out of the ingredient coin dropped by the Black Lamia. \u00a0It was very popular amongst the female Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't regret catching it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was something that worried him. \u00a0It took him much longer than expected to catch it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018My condition is a mess these days.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Condition Disorder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A person's condition couldn't always be great. \u00a0There were good days and bad days.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan's condition wasn't showing any signs of recovering easily, and the issue was dragging at Hyrkan's ankle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This had been also true today.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could have caught it faster and with more style, but he hadn't been able to.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wouldn't be a problem with the monsters, but this would be a very big problem if he met the Users, who were gunning for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It'll be very dangerous if I meet one right now.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The probability of tricking another one with the Watchman Style was higher than his chance for victory right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan gritted his teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Patience.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan showed his patience. However, Hyrkan's patience couldn't calm down his twisting uneasiness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a thought appeared inside Hyrkan's mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to be patient. \u00a0I have to think about the Red Skeleton set. \u00a0Yes, I can wear it now.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Red Skeleton Set.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A smile barely formed around Hyrkan's lips when he thought about the Item set.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Uh?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he saw it for the first time, he almost doubted his own \u00a0eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What the hell?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had made a deal with the V&amp;V guild. \u00a0The Red Bulls had been the middle man. \u00a0As a price for handing over the Greenstone Imoogi helm, the V&amp;V guild promised to give a level 130 Unique Rank weapon named 'Gargoyle Knight's Sword.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Truthfully, he didn't like the deal. \u00a0Hyrkan was in more need of a defensive gear instead of a level 130 weapon. \u00a0Hyrkan currently had a Chronicle Rank item. Ivan's Sword wasn't inferior to any level 140 Unique Rank weapons. \u00a0It was that great in terms of Options and offensive capability. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan wasn't going to use a level 130 Unique weapon, so this Item was basically an expensive paperweight. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he wouldn't turn it down, but a paperweight was a paperweight. \u00a0It was a paperweight he could sell at a high price. \u00a0If need be, he could give it to his Skeleton Knight or Warrior. \u00a0He could get his bang for buck through that method.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, if he asked for a defensive gear instead of a weapon in such a situation, it could have upset the entire deal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Excessive greed could cause harm. \u00a0It was best to take what was given in such a situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Why did they give me a Red Skeleton set?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He checked the inventory list given by the Red Bulls. \u00a0It contained the weapon from the V&amp;V guild, and a defensive set.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, it wasn't a normal item. \u00a0It was the full Red Skeleton set.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Isn't this quite expensive?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Red Skeleton Set.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Red Skeleton Knight was a level 130 Boss monster. The ingredients and gems dropped by the boss was used to make the Rare Rank Items. \u00a0Currently, the set was one of the top 10 known level 130 Rare Rank defensive sets. \u00a0It was a very decent item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it was inferior to a Unique Rank item, but it still took a good amount of gold to be able to gather this entire set.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, there weren't that many in existence. \u00a0If one wanted to purchase it immediately, one had to pay a premium price.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Wait a minute. \u00a0Isn\u2019t this from the Stormhunters?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, the ones who were providing most of the Items related to the Red Skeleton was the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't as if the Stormhunters guild were the only ones supplying it, but there weren't that many guilds or teams that could catch a level 130 Boss Monster whenever they wanted. \u00a0The Red Skeleton Knight Raid was quite difficult. \u00a0The success rate was low unless it was done by an experienced Raid team.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It could be basically considered the Stormhunter guild\u2019s Item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Did they deliver it to me by mistake?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways, this was something that shouldn't have been sent to Hyrkan. \u00a0It was reasonable for Hyrkan to believe that the item had been delivered by mistake. \u00a0It wasn't as if there weren't any accidental deliveries in Warlord. \u00a0No matter how great the game system, is, humans were prone to mistake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that point, Hyrkan agonized over his decision.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Maybe I should just take it?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If this was mistakenly sent to him by mistake by the Stormhunters guild, he might take it for himself \u00a0immediately! \u00a0He wanted to see the Stormhunters bellyache over it. He would have purposefully kept the item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Isn't that a bit of a stretch?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the Item hadn't been sent by the Stormhunters. \u00a0It had been given by the Red Bulls. \u00a0Currently, the Red Bulls had been of help to Hyrkan. \u00a0If he carelessly took one of their Items, it would inevitably bring trouble with the Red Bulls.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan immediately contacted the Red Bulls guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On that day, Hyrkan experienced something for the first time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- It wasn't delivered to you by mistake. \u00a0It is a present from an admirer of the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0You don't have to return it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An angel was present in this damn game called Warlord!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don't know who it is, but give my thanks to that person. \u00a0Please deliver a message for me. \u00a0I'll treat the person to lunch if we ever get to meet in real life!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan smiled brightly when he remembered that incident.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I don't know, who it is, but I've been blessed. \u00a0For reals.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying the smile, Hyrkan checked the Option of the Red Skeleton set, which was stored in his 3rd slot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Red Skeleton Set] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*When 2 parts are equipped</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Class-specific stats +55 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*When 3 parts are equipped \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Class-specific stats +77 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The cool time of all skills decreased by 10%</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*When 4 parts are equipped</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- All stats +50 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The magic power consumption of all skills decreased by 10%</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*When 5 parts are equipped</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- All stats +100 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- When in battle, the Red Skeleton Knight's Aura is activated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had a satisfied smile on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The part he liked the most was the Red Skeleton Knight's Aura. When it was activated in battle, the damage percentage was decreased based on the wearer's HP. \u00a0When the HP decreased by more than half, it increased the All Stats by percentage proportionally to the HP lost from that point on. \u00a0This effect activated instead of damage reduction Option. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Slot on!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan immediately activated his Slot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It looked as if eight enormous spider legs were grasping Hyrkan. \u00a0Strands started to appear from Hyrkan's back, and it was wrapping around Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The strands were sticking to Hyrkan's body, and it was rapidly taking shape.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In 3 seconds, Hyrkan's Item Setting was changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan immediately checked out the design of his new defensive set. \u00a0He used a video program to check out his entire body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Uh?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was a bit surprised.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Its design is similar to the Skeleton Snake?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Red Skeleton set was similar in design as the set he wore when he was level 50. \u00a0It looked similar to the Skeleton Snake set.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Snake set had meant a lot to Hyrkan. \u00a0At the time, he was short on funds, so he had ignored the appearance of the Items. \u00a0He only looked at the Options as he wore whatever he could get. \u00a0He had been a fashion terrorist. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Snake set was the first set Item that had looked good.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, there were differences between the two sets. \u00a0It was similar in that the sets looked as if the User was wearing a Skeleton over black tights. \u00a0As befitting the name of Red Skeleton set, the color of the bones was red. \u00a0The red colored bones went very well with the black tights.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the part he fancied the most was the helm. There was a thick bone that was curved like the tail of a pig attached to the helm, and the face region of the Skeleton Helm it wasn't shaped like a normal skull. \u00a0It was shaped like the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a definite proof.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Wow! \u00a0This really is a customized set.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was proof that someone custom-ordered this design for Hyrkan!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He hadn't been feeling well for a while, but suddenly he felt much better. His condition was surging boundlessly towards the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'm feeling great now. \u00a0It feels like my luck is starting to come back to me!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan used this momentum to charge towards the Bulkas village.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bulkas Ranger Master Maeung.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In recent days, this particular NPC's fame was increasing at a much faster rate than the other NPCs in Warlord. \u00a0All the Users worth their salt was seen meeting Maeung quite frequently. Of course, the Users realized this NPC was incredibly important at this stage of the game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Numerous Users tried to increase their contacts with Maeung. \u00a0Any Quest info, Quest route and raids related to the Maeung was heating up the online community.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">With all that in mind, Hyrkan had come to meet with Maeung.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIsn't that the Hahoe Mask?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh? It's the real Hahoe Mask!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He hadn't concealed his identity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was wearing his new clothes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he had concealed his identity to meet with the Maeung, the Users would would have thought he was a pushover based on his bare face. \u00a0They would approach him to cause trouble. \u00a0Hyrkan knew this better than anyone, so he decided to reveal his identity. \u00a0It prevented the mediocre users from approaching him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, there was an additional reason why they stayed away from him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? \u00a0What the hell is that? \u00a0Is that a new set Item?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's the Red Skeleton set! \u00a0I'm sure of it! \u00a0It's the Red Skeleton Set! \u00a0However, I've never seen that design.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe helm looks like a Hahoe Mask. \u00a0It seems he custom made it to look like a Hahoe Mask.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe custom made the Red Skeleton Set. I heard the Hahoe Mask is the child of a magnate. \u00a0I guess the rumor is true.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe wasn't born with a golden spoon. \u00a0He was born with a diamond spoon. \u00a0I'm so envious.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was showing off his newly made Item in front of everyone! \u00a0This might be his true purpose in coming here like this. When one acquired an expensive Item, it was best to show it off to other Users instead of the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Hyrkan faced Maeung, Maeung immediately greeted Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI've been waiting for your arrival.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before Hyrkan could start up a conversation, Maeung reached for a map on top of his desk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then it ignored Hyrkan's attempt at a greeting, and it immediately gave Hyrkan a Quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe found this Dungeon map, which is related to the Cursed Domain. \u00a0This secret Dungeon is below the Cursed Castle. \u00a0I believe some kind of experiment had been conducted there. \u00a0You task is to bring me evidence from this Dungeon.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Quest 'Evidence' has started.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maeung didn't even consult Hyrkan. \u00a0It just gave the Quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It forcibly pushed the Quest onto Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is.... \u00a0The Crest of the Royal Family will appear.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This basically meant the second Main Scenario Quest, Immoral Prince episode, was going to start in earnest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nine Users were gathered in one location. \u00a0A variety of Items were being worn by these Users. If one was knowledgeable about Warlord, one would realize these Items required very high levels, and they were all very expensive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The nine Users equipped with these Items were in a conversation, and the atmosphere around them indicated something important was going down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The nine users looked like employees that was getting ready for a company's important project announcement. \u00a0They were busy and disordered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Where did the information come from?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Is the Quest information correct?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Check it again!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Give me that too!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What happened to the thing we spoke about before?'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The conversation was very chaotic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A User that looked to be the head of the group started to bring order to the conversation. \u00a0He set the right mood then he spat out his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAttention! Let's summarize it. Who had the closest relationship to the Corrupt Count? \u00a0Was it Prince Arthur or Prince Dean?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The atmosphere had settled, and an answer was given.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is public knowledge that Prince Arthur was the patron of the Corrupt Count. \u00a0However, if we analyze the numerous Quest content and Quest info regarding the Corrupt Count, it had become apparent that the Corrupt Count has more of a connection with Prince Dean.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI knew it. \u00a0The name was a trap. I suspected it. \u00a0Isn't Arthur too obvious?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The other eight Users nodded their heads at the leader's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoes the Red Bulls guild know about Prince Dean?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is a high probability that they don't know about him. \u00a0They basically found out about the Corrupted Count by luck last time.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat's true. \u00a0However, that's a problem.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The leader gritted his teeth when he thought about that time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe can't allow what happened with the Corrupted Count to happen again.

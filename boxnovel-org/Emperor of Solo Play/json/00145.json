\u00a0We've never had a private User insist on the ownership of a region.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 The Hahoe Mask fought and won in a fair manner. \u00a0So what's the problem? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 Didn't the Hahoe Mask ambush Sinclair after he fought Sohank? \u00a0It wasn't fair and square.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 Of course, it is. \u00a0He fought 30 Users. \u00a0It was a 30 vs 1 fight, so it is as fair and square as it could be.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 In truth, I can't believe the Big Smiles tried a 30 vs 1 fight. \u00a0I feel a bit bad about the Big Smiles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- So when is the Hahoe Mask going to upload his video?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even amongst the common Users, the presence of the Hahoe Mask dominated everything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The presence of the Hahoe Mask lingered. \u00a0The Red Bulls guild and 7 additional guilds of the 30 great guilds gave up on conquering the Urugal mountain range. \u00a0After they abandoned the task, the only challenger left was the Stormhunters guild. \u00a0However, it seemed they practically ran away from the Urugual mountain after suffering heavy damage. \u00a0Then there were the stories of the skilled Users that represented the Underfoot guilds. \u00a0They were receiving VIP treatments from the 30 great guilds. \u00a0These Users were transferring to the 30 great guilds. \u00a0Then there was the V&amp;V guild that was continuously rewriting the time records for the Boss Monsters. \u00a0However, all these news just brushed by the consciousness of the Users. \u00a0These news wasn't retained in their memories.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- If looked at it in a certain way, the Hahoe Mask might be the warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Isn't the strongest User in Warlord called the warlord?

</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These Hands guild members will earn political power and they will start gaining a following. \u00a0They would be able to crush anyone that didn't listen to them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the attacks aimed at the Big 3 was very thinly veiled. \u00a0The Hydra guild had already taken a body blow from the Big Smile guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn't guarantee it would end at this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I shouldn't have used the Stormhunters as bait when we were trying to catch the Immoral Prince. \u00a0Instead I should have deepened our relationship.... \u00a0No. \u00a0If we had allied ourselves with the Red Bulls or the Stormhunters, they would have just used us.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the Hydra guild didn't have many strong spears in their arsenal. \u00a0Sohank was really strong. \u00a0However, if Sohank was excluded, who else was there? \u00a0If one excluded Chev from the Red Bulls guild, they were overflowing with skilled Users. \u00a0Aside from the Storm Queen, the Stormhunters had the Storm Princess, Ballista Hatch, and other veteran heroes that had been tempered through numerous Raids. \u00a0This was why he had tried to form a closer relationship with them. \u00a0However, this plan became a mess when the Stormhunters guild suddenly attempted the Immortal Prince Raid. \u00a0It further deteriorated with the appearance of the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he was about to go mad as his thoughts reached this point, the First Head started to touch his face again. \u00a0He ordered his thoughts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Anyways, there's no benefit in regretting past events. \u00a0It isn't as if I can do anything to change it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hands that was touching his face stopped. \u00a0The First Head thought about the best path he could take going forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I might have to bet big in recruiting the Whistling Pit Bull. \u00a0The resources we would have to use would bleed us a lot, but we need a spear that will deter the other guilds from taking our preys. \u00a0Moreover.... \u00a0Wasn't there a User called Challenger Kiyote? \u00a0He's making quite a name for himself recently. \u00a0I have to use this opportunity to rope them in by giving them a VIP treatment.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Recruiting. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the best method that was available to the Hydra guild. \u00a0However, the First Head let out a sigh when he thought about the cost that would have to be expended in recruiting these Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I can't believe I miss my days working at Wall Street.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had hated making such calculations, so he had given up his job to play this game. \u00a0However, this game was forcing him to make similar decisions to his past job.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the First Head couldn't hold back his sudden laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018At the very least, I have to thank the stars that the Hahoe Mask isn't part of the Hands guild.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a funny way, this thought consoled the First Head's feeling. \u00a0It was the fact the the Hahoe Mask wasn't part of the Hands Guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Up until now, he had considered it quite likely that the Hahoe Mask was a member of the Hands guild. \u00a0Since the Hahoe Mask and the Hands guild weren't in it together, it was a big relief for the First Head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the Hahoe Mask had really been a member of the Hands guild, the Hydra guild\u2019s hostility towards the the Hands guild wouldn\u2019t have mattered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If we can rope in the Hahoe Mask, I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about any of this....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In other words, the Hahoe Mask was the biggest variable. \u00a0He was a variable that could mess up the Hands guild's plan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018\u2026\u2026just by looking at his recent actions, it is very unlikely that he'll enter one of the 30 great guilds.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the Hahoe Mask had announced a guild war towards the Big Smiles on the frozen land. \u00a0It wasn't just an announcement he gave to the 30 members that was present there. \u00a0It was a warning and a challenge to all of the 30 great guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe it was this fact? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The First Head had been full of worry, but at that moment, he was filled with genuine curiosity about the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018So what is the Hahoe Mask's ultimate goal? \u00a0If he simply wanted money and fame, there would have been easier ways to get that.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What did the Hahoe Mask want to achieve through Warlord?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The man doesn't make any sense to me.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even the smart First Head could come up with the answer to that question.</span></p><br/><p>2.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This castle once boasted a splendor that couldn't be described in words. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t a splendor given off by a regular castle. \u00a0At one time, this place was the capital. \u00a0It had been the most majestic castle of them all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this splendid stage was now in ruins. \u00a0The castle walls were in horrible ruins, and the buildings across the castle wall was in a miserable state. \u00a0If one looked past the buildings, one could see the traces of the inner castle walls still left over, but the buildings that was suppose to be protected by this inner wall was in a pathetic state. \u00a0Moreover, there were footprints of some unknowing beings filling up the grounds of the inner castle, and this detail accentuated the appalling state of this place. \u00a0It was the finishing touch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of it all, everything was coated in ice and there was a large layer of snow covering everything. This appalling sight gave off a feeling of extreme sadness, and there was an indescribable shabbiness that was pervasive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Two groups were using this stage as a battle ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One group consisted of Orcs with leathers that had turned pale. \u00a0Instead of weapons, these Orcs used their sharp frozen arms to attack. \u00a0The Orcs didn't possess heat, eyes, vitality or vigor of living beings. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The other group facing the Cursed Orc horde wasn't all that different from them. \u00a0They were wearing very stylish armors, and they held excellent blades that was well-used. \u00a0However, the most pervasive detail about the Skeleton Warriors was the sure proof of death they possessed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a battle between beings that couldn't die.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">None of them could let out any sound, so in a way, one would assume that the battle would have been silent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng, kah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the sounds of steels clashing was more powerful than any lame shout or roar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the sound they produced varied immensely.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-ahng, kwah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The swords swung by the Skeleton Warriors were breaking the frozen skin of the Orcs. The sound was cheerful and heavy at the same same time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggee-eee-eee-eee! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Cursed Orcs were frozen solid, and they were sturdier than most swords. \u00a0Their sharp arms were swung to damage the armors of the Skeleton Warriors. \u00a0The sound it made was goosebump inducing yet sharp.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These two groups were tirelessly carrying out the battle, and the sound that was being emitted was so rhythmic that it sounded like a music ensemble.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, these beings looked as if they would be able to carry out this diverse performance until the end of time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The broken body of the Orcs were surprisingly being healed by the blizzard. \u00a0Even a deep wound was mended when snow covered it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the same for the Skeleton Warriors, but it was the responsibility of another being to mend their wounds. \u00a0It was the responsibility of the owner. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Busy. \u00a0I'm so busy.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was the owner of the Skeleton Warriors, and he never retreated on the battlefield. \u00a0In a battle between the Undeads, he was doing something funny.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When a Cursed Orc's body received a critical blow, it tried to repair its crumbled body. \u00a0Hyrkan searched through the pile. \u00a0He was like a cat searching through a trash bin. \u00a0Instead of using his sword, he could be seen holding a bottle, and he was spraying holy water on the item he had found. \u00a0This wasn't a look of a veteran hero that fought in front of the fearless Skeleton Warriors should be showing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Cursed Orc's Curse is dispelled.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, at that moment, Hyrkan wasn't lamenting or smiling in self-deprecation. \u00a0He was actually struck by admiration.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I've been feeling this for awhile now, but... The Stormhunters must had shit blood when they first hunted here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Twenty days.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been 20 days since Hyrkan had entered the Frozen Kingdom's territory after passing the frozen land.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn't a short amount of time. \u00a0During this period, he faced monsters that were dead, but they were still moving in their frozen state. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, these monsters didn't possess only the simple abilities that came with a frozen monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The difficulty of this game is really fucked up.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The basic setup was that the monsters had been cursed by the Frost Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They couldn't die on their own, and even deep wounds would regenerate within a snowstorm. \u00a0This terrifying curse wouldn't disappear since the weather wouldn't change here. These monsters were cursed as they suffered an endlessly pathetic fate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, from the User's point of view, the frozen body significantly increased the monster's defense. \u00a0Moreover, they held properties of an Undead, which was even harder to kill. Even if one made a critical wound, the endless snowstorm would heal the wound in short order.... \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a commonly spoken phrase among Users. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'The Users weren't meant to catch these monsters. \u00a0Instead, these monsters made the Users hunt down the game planner that came up with this monster design.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this begs the question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What method allowed Hyrkan to use these ridiculous monsters as his hunting fodder as he leveled up? \u00a0Moreover, he hadn't done this for just one or two days. \u00a0He had spent 20 days fighting here, so how was he able to make these monsters his prey?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'm really curious. \u00a0How the hell did the Storhunters catch these guys without the holy water?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, it was all thanks to the Stormhunters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had learned from the Stormhunters on how to deal with the monsters cursed by the Frost Dragons. \u00a0The monsters had an emblem that was the source of their curse. \u00a0If one sprayed holy water on top of this emblem, the curse was dispelled. \u00a0The Stormhunters guild had found this out by clashing against these monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Your level has increased.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had heard this Announcement for his 198th and 199th level up. \u00a0It was all thanks to the Stormhunters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ok.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he heard the Announcement he had been anticipating, Hyrkan clenched his fist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Oppa's magic is replenished! \u00a0All of you get ready to die!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roo! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From between Hyrkan's clenched fists, flame erupted outwards. \u00a0When Hyrkan unclenched his fist, the flame shot up into the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The burst of flame opened its mouth wide, and it started to take shape.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Orcs have been cursed by the Fire Golem's Heat. \u00a0Their Defense will lessen.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwal hwal! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This giant made from flame possessed powerful fire that made the snow into steam in an instant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Fire Golem's presence was on a different level as it appeared. \u00a0The Fire Golem was letting out heat, and the it was making the frozen body of the Orcs melt steadily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, at the same time, Hyrkan's magical energy was also being consumed rapidly akin to the snow melting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I can't waste any more consumable Items from this point on. I have to pull out after taking them out all at once!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan decided to end the battle as soon as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddahk ddahk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His will was conveyed into his finger as he flicked it twice. \u00a0It basically ordered the Skeleton Warriors to become more aggressive in their attacks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddul-goo-ruhk, dul-goo-ruhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Warriors reacted to their owner's order. \u00a0They aggressively drove into the Cursed Orcs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To be precise, the melting of the ice would lower the defense, but it would also decrease the physical abilities of the Cursed Orcs. \u00a0The Skeleton Warriors were starting to overwhelm the Cursed Orcs. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It looked very funny, but Hyrkan once again started his important task. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Choo-roong choo-roong!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of carrying his weeping Crying Sword, he held a bottle of holy water. \u00a0He search for the Orc's Curse Emblem, and he splashed it with holy water.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One, two.... \u00a0Hyrkan kept up with his ridiculous task, and when he reached 50, the Orcs numbered in the single digits. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hyrkan continued on with this ridiculous form of battle, but it seemed he wouldn't be able to end all the Cursed Orcs once and for all. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An abrupt end came to his ridiculous looking work. \u00a0The bottle with the holy water was empty.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there were still seven Cursed Orcs left! \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The apparent state of his holy water should have left him flustered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he had a determined expression instead of being flustered. \u00a0He firmly closed his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I've reached that point.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had run out of the holy water. \u00a0It was a signal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I can't believe I've made it this far.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a signal that signified the final showdown. \u00a0He had to put everything he had done to this point behind him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if it had read Hyrkan's mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Suddenly, a powerful coldness swept across the ruins of the nameless castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zzuh-juh-juhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the coldness swept over him, frost grew on top of his armor like new buds.

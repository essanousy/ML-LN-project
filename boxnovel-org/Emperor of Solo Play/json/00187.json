(4)</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">11.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Good job.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan felt drained as he had to meet and greet with several thousand Users for the past couple hours. \u00a0Whistling spoke to him. \u00a0Hyrkan looked at Whistling as he shook his head from side to side. \u00a0Then he let out his complaint in a low voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why do Elves matter so much\u2026\u2026\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hyrkan knew why Whistling had moved against the Barbarian King. \u00a0Whistling didn\u2019t want the Elven tribes to become exterminated by the Barbarian King. \u00a0In turn, Whistling was the reason why Hyrkan had moved. \u00a0Basically, the Elven tribes had caused a shift inside Warlord. \u00a0This was the behind the scene story for this war.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m sorry.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling let out a bitter laugh, and he gave his apology.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m not doing this for nothing.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019ll take you out for a big night out later.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Whistling\u2019s answer, he no longer spoke. \u00a0Instead, Hyrkan turned his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bizma Plain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeletons, Golems, and Bone Dragon decorating the place was no longer present. \u00a0However, the Users hadn\u2019t left. \u00a0They were guarding their spot. \u00a0At times, the bored Users hunted the monsters nearby, and this was another diversion they could watch. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their continued presence was an evidence of longing they were feeling. \u00a0They had just experienced something uniquely fun inside the game of Warlord, and this was proof that the Users wanted to enjoy it for a little bit longer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This also meant the Users had fully enjoyed what Hyrkan had to offer. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, at this time tomorrow, this place would become a desperate battlefield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'This is a game.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The world had changed in just a single day, and it should have been a frightening sight. \u00a0However, this wasn\u2019t reality. \u00a0Since this was happening within a game, this wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Since it\u2019s a game\u2026\u2026'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan chewed over this truth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a game. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He chewed over the new feeling he was starting to dimly feel. \u00a0It was something he had never felt before. \u00a0Hyrkan fell into his thoughts as he tried to identify this vague feeling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"First, 6322 people have signed up to participate in the Raid.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling\u2019s words pulled Hyrkan back into reality.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The goal for the Hahoe Mask theme park was to gather allied forces, who will join him in this Raid. \u00a0However, Hyrkan hadn\u2019t said cheese for free. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t force these Users to participate, but he obtained signatures from the Users, who were going to participate in the Barbarian King Raid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The number was 6,322.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The ratio isn\u2019t too bad. \u00a0The important fact is that 2,551 Tankers signed up. \u00a0It is a pretty high number.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Tanker was the most important position in pulling off this plan, and the number of Tankers, who signed up, was higher than expected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"They are all over level 200, and they finished their 2nd Advancement. \u00a0This means it is a force big enough to rival three or four 30 great guilds. \u00a0Moreover, these are Users, who stayed behind in the Black Continent even with this event going on. \u00a0Their skills are above average.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They hadn\u2019t tested the quality of the Users, but these Users were all above average by default. \u00a0Even with the appearance of the Iron Lion Road, it was tough to operate within the Black Continent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The deciding factor was the fact that the Black Continent was filled with nightmare right now. \u00a0However, these Users refused to leave, and their will to fight was burning. \u00a0Aside from skills and extrinsic factors\u2026..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In terms of mental toughness, they were also above average.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If half the number shows up, I will have no complaint.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Hyrkan\u2019s words, Whistling didn\u2019t feel too good about the situation, but he nodded his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In terms of gathering people, it was beyond his expectation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As expected of the Hahoe Mask!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It almost made Whistling sigh in admiration. \u00a0If Whistling had used the Hahoe Mask\u2019s reputation to gather the Users, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to gather 6,000 Users. \u00a0He might not have been able to gather even 3,000 Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, there was no way everyone gathered here would participate in the battle. \u00a0They would be fortunate if half of them stepped forward. \u00a0That would still amount to 3,000 Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"They\u2019ll come. \u00a0You said so many cheeses for them.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After hearing his reply, Hyrkan started a simulation of the battle that\u2019ll occur tomorrow on the Bizma Plain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"They have to hold out for one hour.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Barbarian King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a monster amongst monsters, who had beaten back numerous challengers and attackers. \u00a0It was the most ruthless Boss Monster to appear in Warlord. \u00a0It boasted special characteristics, skills and difficulty level that made people curse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, for the past month, the Users hadn\u2019t been playing around. \u00a0They had attempted it 31 times. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t a small number. \u00a0Tens of thousand of Users had thrown their bodies towards the Barbarian King. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It happened slowly, but they compiled a clear method for the Barbarian King. \u00a0Then they threw their bodies into the Raid to see if the methods they devised actually worked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was like a blind man feeling the leg of an elephant to confirm that it was an elephant. \u00a0This task was akin to that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then there was Whistling\u2019s new comrades\u2026. \u00a0One of them was named the Questman, and he came up with a conjecture using all the information he gathered regarding the Main Scenario Quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had to be done during the 2nd Phase called the Storm Judgement mode. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What would happen if one could lure the Barbarian King into the path of the Storme Judgement?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be like the scene in a movie where a missile was lured into the path of an enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Storm Judgement was the Dragon\u2019s Judgement. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Would the Barbarian King be fine from being hit by it? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Even if it survived the strike, would an abnormal status go into effect?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This hypothesis was put into action, and it was tried 31 times in the Barbarian King Raid. \u00a0All of the Raids failed, but they acquired useful results. \u00a0This was how they found the method to clear the 2nd Phase. \u00a0When a thunder strike falls on top of one\u2019s head, it was suicide to charge towards the currently strongest monster in Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this was also the most important part in taking down the Barbarian King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sacrifice. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Numerous sacrifices were needed to be able to latch onto the Barbarian King, and more sacrifices were needed to ensure the success of the Armor Breaking. \u00a0The Judgement would inevitably fall, and in the end, Users had to put up with being sacrificed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From start to finish, the Barbarian King required sacrifices from the challenging Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you really planning on killing it on \u00a0your own?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan planned on killing such a foe by himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Just block the others from interfering with me.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a preposterous task. \u00a0One couldn\u2019t even say it was dumb, because it was absurd.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan insisted on choosing this path. \u00a0Hyrkan wasn\u2019t doing this, because he was trying to uphold the name of the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The Barbarian King\u2019s attack pattern, route, clear method and speed is all in my mind. \u00a0The only thing I can\u2019t predict are the disrupters.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two reasons why he was doing this. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First, there was the existence of disrupters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were countless number of people, who thought poorly of Hyrkan. \u00a0They wouldn\u2019t just sit back, while eating popcorn.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the six thousand Users weren\u2019t all hiding behind trees as they attempted to hide their identities. \u00a0No, his enemies didn\u2019t even need to hide. \u00a0The disrupters just had to come to the Bizma plain in the morning, and they could just join the fight. \u00a0Who would turn them away?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a problem with a festival. \u00a0You can\u2019t stop people from joining.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Moreover, I\u2019m more comfortable fighting by myself.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two steps to clearing the Barbarian King Raid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When one wanted to kill the Barbarian King in its 2nd Phase, one had to bait its special ability called Storm Judgement. \u00a0This attack targeted a single User within its range. \u00a0This was why the targeted individual had to approached the Barbarian King within 3 seconds. \u00a0This was also the reason why everyone said this method was impossible to pull off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan thought differently. \u00a0What would happen if there was only one User within range of the Storm Judgement? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The act of finding the targeted User would be irrelevant. \u00a0It would be clear, who was the target.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Hyrkan chose to solo this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah. \u00a0It\u2019ll be more convenient for me, but I\u2019m not saying it\u2019ll easy.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Hyrkan\u2019s words, everyone swallowed their words, and they just agreed with him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This game is hard.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It isn't just hard. \u00a0It is damn hard.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As they expressed their annoyance, Hyrkan once again looked at the Bizma Plain. \u00a0He\u2019ll be dancing with the Barbarian King tomorrow. \u00a0It\u2019ll be a fierce dance as thunder descended towards him. \u00a0He\u2019ll be dancing around the Barbarian King until the Announcement notified him that he was the target of the Storm Judgement. \u00a0He\u2019ll clash, retreat and clash again with joy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Still, it\u2019ll be pretty easy to name the video.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You\u2019ve already chosen a title?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course. \u00a0If I don\u2019t receive income from my videos, I can\u2019t play this game. \u00a0The title will be Ballroom.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBallroom?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Welcome to the Ballroom.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why would you name it\u2026.?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He\u2019ll do a dance that can only be done by the Hahoe Mask on this stage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019ll really liven it up with a dance.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">12.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Currently, there are around five thousand Users gathered at the Bizma Plain.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The Hahoe Mask team is getting ready for the Raid. \u00a0The 30 great guilds haven\u2019t shown up yet.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m here to join this historical event, which won\u2019t be broadcasted through the live channels.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bizma Plain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Numerous Users of all types could be seen on the vast field.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The most busy Users were the ones trying to record \u00a0every step of this process. \u00a0They wanted to document it, so they can sell the Barbarian King Raid footage. \u00a0Hahoe Mask had given up claiming sole rights in regards to using the Raid footage for profit. \u00a0He would allow anyone to record and use footage of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this was a small present he was giving to those, who chose to fight with him. \u00a0The people, who fought with him, could record the entire process. \u00a0Moreover, they could do whatever they wanted with the footage. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, greedy Users had also gathered here like a swarm of mosquitoes. \u00a0When one smiled in thanks in front of such generosity, another let out a devious smile. \u00a0These Users only wanted to make money, and they weren\u2019t going to help out in the raid. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These Users continuously moved around the Bizma Plain, and one could always hear the sound of their interviews in the air. \u00a0It really sounded like the low buzzing of mosquitoes. \u00a0The Interview Program allowed one to dampen the sound, so outsiders couldn\u2019t hear the User\u2019s voice. \u00a0One could just hear a buzz.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, the Users, who came here for the Hahoe Mask, was making preparations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'll explain the plan. \u00a0The plan will unfold like this. \u00a0A large scale magical bombardment will be used to decrease the number of monsters around the Barbarian King. \u00a0Afterwards, the monsters will naturally be pulled by the aggro, and the Tankers will block them.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We\u2019ll form the first battle line, and we\u2019ll open a path in one location.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"After establishing the first battle line, The Striker teams will come from eight directions to open up more paths. \u00a0The Priests, Magicians and Tankers will enter through these paths. \u00a0Then we have to block monsters from turning back to help the Barbarian King. \u00a0Our role is to provide a stage where the Hahoe Mask can focus on battling the Barbarian King.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These Users had enjoyed the festive atmosphere yesterday, but the tactic made them feel faint. \u00a0They had to hear it again. \u00a0They weren\u2019t just listening to the tactic. \u00a0They opened their holographic window, and they started drawing out the battle simulation. \u00a0\u00a0The prediction was drawn using dots.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So they want the monsters between the Tankers? \u00a0This is going to cause a lot of Tankers to die.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We have no choice. \u00a0We need to form a wall on both sides, so the Hahoe Mask can go one on one with the Barbarian King.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I took a rough estimate, and I think there are around 2,000 Tankers here. \u00a0I think about half will be be sent back to the Heard Fortress.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If only half dies, we\u2019ll be fortunate. \u00a0If the Hahoe Mask fails, we\u2019ll probably have to run away with a do-or-die attitude.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The prediction didn't look too rosy. \u00a0Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be great. \u00a0In the first place, the Barbarian King Raid was designed in such a way where sacrifices were baked into the design. \u00a0This Raid would need more sacrifices compared to any other Boss Monster Raids. \u00a0\u00a0Warlord\u2019s System had settled on this setting. \u00a0There were Users gathered here, who had experience all of this multiple time. \u00a0There were also Users, who had participated in all 31 Barbarian King Raids.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah. \u00a0I think I\u2019m going to die today.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why worried words emanated from the Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Shit. \u00a0I don\u2019t know why I voluntarily undergo hardship like this.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Words of complaint was also heard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I should quit this game. \u00a0Eh-whew.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone let out a sigh, but this was to be expected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, they were thorough in their preparations even as they spoke those words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let us all connect to the Voice Talk. \u00a0Ah ah. \u00a0Voice Talk test. \u00a0Ah ah. \u00a0Voice Talk test. \u00a0I want members of my team to raise their hands!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Our team members should say fighting! \u00a0After getting in position, please go over your roles once again.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is a battle where 5,000 people will participate. \u00a0It is very important that everyone hold their position. \u00a0Please don\u2019t stray outside of your designated position!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were experts. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don\u2019t try to spare your body too much!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If we lose the Black Continent, we\u2019ll lose our only hunting ground. \u00a0Just close your eyes and take the bullet this one time.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It takes about the same amount of time to walk back to the Heard Fortress compared to starting again at the town after death. \u00a0It is only death. \u00a0It isn\u2019t as if we haven\u2019t experienced it before.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were Users, who had reached Level 200 and the 2nd Advancement. \u00a0They were qualified to be able to step onto the Black Continent. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t an achievement and result that could be reached by just playing the game of Warlord for a long time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One had to be diligent, and one had to be better than others at the game. \u00a0Moreover, one had to have love for this game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since this was only a game, family members and friends berated them for playing this game too much. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When will you come to your senses?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How long will you play this game?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Does oppa like this game better than me?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The game of Warlord had become part of their lives, so these Users had heard similar questions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One had to accept these pitfalls to achieve these results.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Casual gamers?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were definitely not that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"All right. \u00a0Let\u2019s ready the Magicians.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The order of attack will be fire, thunder, wind then ice. \u00a0Please remember that.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The Barbarian King is approaching us! \u00a0Fire Sea team! \u00a0Get ready!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In reality, they were called game couch-potatoes. \u00a0However, in Warlord, they were proud game experts. \u00a0They were combat veterans of hundreds of battles. \u00a0They were experts at turning the tide of the game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were the types of people gathered here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They made their resolves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They would go out in a blaze of glory in this battle. \u00a0They wanted a memory that they would remember at the end of their gamer lives.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Holy crap. \u00a0They are like a swarm of ants charging forward.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, haven\u2019t we gathered enough Users to resemble a swarm of ants right now? \u00a0I think this is the first time I\u2019ve seen over 5,000 Users gathered in one place.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how the highlight that would long remain in the history of Warlord started.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">13.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It started with the rain of fire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the Fire Storm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Goo-roo-roo!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wow. \u00a0Look at those clouds.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The red tinged clouds started to gather atop the heads of the Barbarian King and its subordinates.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monsters, who were quick on the uptake, quickly looked up at the clouds. \u00a0The monsters expressed their wariness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo-roohk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the clouds started to spit out rain of fire. \u00a0The range of the rain was massive. \u00a0\u00a0It was hard to calculate the area by using a soccer field as a reference. \u00a0It felt as if the storm was coming down on a region big enough to be called a small city.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the rain used the vegetations in the Bizma Plain as fuel, and the fire started to spread more fiercely.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if the rain had caused a flooding. \u00a0It created a sea of fire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Roll the fireballs\uff01\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- We are rolling the fireballs!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Large fireballs rolled across the sea of fire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-kwah-kwah!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fireballs were letting out a rough sound as it rolled onward like a runaway train. \u00a0The fireballs grew in size as they rolled atop the sea of fire. \u00a0They grew into enormous sizes, and the small monsters were basically bowling pins in front of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kuh-hyung, kuh-hyung!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the monsters refused to be defeated like helpless bowling pins.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monsters, who had suffered the attack, went on the offensive. \u00a0They started to select their target through aggro. \u00a0When the selection ended, they started to move to destroy their targets. \u00a0The ones that were the quickest were the four-legged monsters. \u00a0The monsters that looked like wolves, lions and other animals separated from the horde of monsters. \u00a0They led the charge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"They are coming.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are the Buffs complete?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ok. \u00a0It\u2019s all done! \u00a0Team 29 complete!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Team 33 is complete!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The eyes of the running monsters rolled around as they let out horrible cries. \u00a0When the monsters were about to reach them, the Tankers moved. \u00a0They held a shield in the left hand, and the right hand held the weapon. \u00a0The Tankers slowly marched towards the

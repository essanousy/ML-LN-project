is to have the heavens on my side.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This idiom was like an immutable truth to Heh-bibin, and he felt the meaning of the words in his bones.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'I never expected this to work out so well.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Big Smiles guild members attacked and killed Whistling, who had been hunting inside the Highwood Forest. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was done openly, so no one could deny it had happened. \u00a0They were very thorough in eliminating the Pitbull.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one looked at it form a gains and losses perspective, one would have a hard time saying the Big Smiles guild had gained anything from this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The immediate concern for the guild was to come up with a method to deal with the Hydra guild. \u00a0It would be great if it ended in a war of words, but if the problem worsened, they might have to prepare for a war. \u00a0The act of killing Pitbull had angered the Hydra guild. \u00a0Nothing profitable would come from facing a red-faced opponent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, a significant number of Big Smiles guild members were supportive of the Users, who had cost the bottomline of Big Smiles guild. \u00a0They had cheered at learning the decision, action and the execution that had went into killing Pitbull.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the ones that participated in the hunt of Pitbull didn\u2019t hide their actions. \u00a0They were \u00a0unapologetic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Whistling hunted in a Big Smiles guild territory without our permission. \u00a0He is basically a thief. \u00a0I just chased out a thief from my house.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We\u2019d rather have people curse at Big Smiles guild rather than the guild being the butt of everyone\u2019s joke.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We willingly accept any punishment from the guild. \u00a0However, we don\u2019t think we did anything wrong.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There had been 11 of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Eleven members had participated in the Pitbull hunt, and they had achieved hero status for their actions amongst the normal Big Smiles guild members.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Still, I never expected the discontent amongst the members to be this high.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, the discontent within the guild had reached a boiling point.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Sinclair\u2019s exploits, the Big Smiles guild\u2019s standing kept increasing. \u00a0When they started out at the Black Continent, the Five Stars threatened the name of Top Three. \u00a0The Big Smiles guild was one of the pillars of this organization.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the time, Big Smiles\u2019 live channel increased in viewership, and they had reached new highs in terms of profits from the sponsors. \u00a0It was the proof of their success.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, after Hahoe Mask\u2019s Anugas Raid, Big Smiles guild\u2019s standing started to drop. \u00a0Now their standings wasn\u2019t so different from what it was before they joined the Five Stars guild. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This damaging result accelerated when the Highwood Forest, which was the main hunting ground of the Big Smiles guild, was allowed to become the playground of the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There had been side effects to the Hahoe Mask\u2019s actions. \u00a0It was getting harder to control their hunting ground. \u00a0Other Users were starting to follow after the Hahoe Mask\u2019s actions. \u00a0The Big Smiles guild started becoming an entity no one feared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'The only thing left is to see what the Hydra guild chooses to do.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The discontent was simmering to a boiling point.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Depending on what the Hydra guild chose to do, this could be an explosive situation. \u00a0It\u2019ll come to a head at some point.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the situation becomes explosive, the ones in charge of the guild would suffer heavy damages. \u00a0In recent days, Heh-bibin didn\u2019t have a voice in how the guild was being run. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this situation wouldn\u2019t cause Heh-bibin any headaches.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'This is the best.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he was forgetting about the irresistible force called the Hahoe Mask\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">6.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Normally, a 10 man party was formed for a Wood Devil hunt. \u00a0There was an odd quirk to these parties. \u00a0Over half of the 10 man party was either a Striker or a Swordsman.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the lowest, there were five Swordsman in the 10 man party. \u00a0At most, one could see seven Swordsman in a party.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two big reasons why this was the case.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was impossible for Tankers to block the Wood Devil.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Wood Devil\u2019s attack pattern was simple. \u00a0\u00a0It swung its arm like a whip or it brought down it arm like a hammer. \u00a0The attack pattern was simple, yet the power behind the attacks was terrifying. \u00a0Even if the highest level Tanker with decent equipments and buffs tried to block the attack, one wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand a direct hit from the Wood Devil.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Tankers wouldn\u2019t be able to use their usual methods to block the attacks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So what could one do against the Wood Devil?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One had to defeat the Wood Devil at its own game. \u00a0The only thing a Tanker could do was to lure and dodge attacks in front of the Wood Devil.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Chen is down\uff01\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Shit! \u00a0I\u2019ll pull the Aggro.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then I\u2019ll save Chen.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accidents always happened, so the party had to have a contingency plan. The Tanker was needed as a pinch-hitter. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the Tanker\u2019s only role. \u00a0This was why there were so many Swordsman or Strikers compared to the other classes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Stop attacking! \u00a0Stop the attack Cicadas!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The other reason for having so many Strikers was the method in which damage was given to the Wood Devil.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Wood Devil had a high magical defence. \u00a0If one wanted to lower the magical defense, Armor Breaking was needed. \u00a0\u00a0The Wood Devil did not wear any defensive gear. \u00a0It also didn\u2019t have any skin or bark, which could act as an armor. \u00a0The Wood Devil\u2019s enormous body was just a mixture of rocks, dirt and trees. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why the Strikers were needed to dislodge these rocks, and this was akin to Armor Breaking work. \u00a0Since one needed a lot of work to pull off this Armor Break, one needed more Users working on the project. \u00a0This was why Strikers were more desired than the Magicians or Tankers. \u00a0These Strikers were nicknamed as the Cicadas.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The singing of the Cicadas came to an end. \u00a0They couldn\u2019t attack until the Aggro landed on the Tanker.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koohng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Cicadas started to move once again when the Wood Devil was lured by the new Tanker. \u00a0The Wood Devil was bring down both its arm in an attempt to crush the Tanker with one blow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"All right. \u00a0The pinch-hitter was successful.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Start it up again, Cicadas!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Strikers once again latched onto the Wood Devil\u2019s body, and they started excavating the stones.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During all of this, the Priests healed anyone at death\u2019s door with Healing Skill. \u00a0At the same time, the Users with their Buffs expired came to get a full tank of gas again. \u00a0The Priests worked to restore the Buffs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everything was somewhat going to plan when an unexpected variable butted in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do you mind if I ask you a question?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The question came out of nowhere towards the Priest, who was calculating his Buff Skill Cooldown. \u00a0The Priest turned his head. \u00a0There wasn\u2019t a single ounce of suspicion inside the Priest\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What question? \u00a0Speak.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Priest thought the question had been asked by a comrade. \u00a0It would be strange if it was someone other than his comrade especially in this situation. \u00a0Anyone in his shoes would have made the same assumption. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah. \u00a0It isn\u2019t a difficult question.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Priest turned his head, he became frightened at what he saw.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Huhk\uff01'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was so surprised that sound refused to come out of this throat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The User, who had asked him a question, wore a Hahoe Mask. \u00a0It was the scariest mask in Warlord, and the User in armor spoke in a friendly manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"My friend was PKed here by fucking assholes. \u00a0I\u2019m here for revenge, and I\u2019m looking for the culprits.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ha...ha...Hahoe\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Priest was so shocked that words weren\u2019t coming out of his mouth. \u00a0Hyrkan continued to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m sorry for interfering with your hunt, but I\u2019m in a hurry. \u00a0Anyways, let me show you what my friend looks like. \u00a0He\u2019s the one who was PKed.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he spoke, Hyrkan took out a sheet of paper, and he raised it in front of the Priest\u2019s nose. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t a drawing of a person. \u00a0It was a picture of a famous fighting dog called a Pitbull Terrier. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He\u2019s not the type to be pushed around. \u00a0However, in a bout of bad luck, he was beaten and killed. \u00a0He couldn't do anything, since his opponents roamed in a party that numbered \u00a0around ten Users. \u00a0This is why I\u2019m trying to hunt them down with my group.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan turned to look backwards. \u00a0There were 30 Skeleton Warriors a good distance away. \u00a0They looked like they were ready to rush their enemies. \u00a0Hyrkan turned back to look at the Priest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Anyways, I\u2019m looking for the bastards, who attacked my friend. \u00a0I don\u2019t know their identities nor do I know what they look like. \u00a0My friend is prideful, so he won\u2019t tell me what I want to know. \u00a0Ah!!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan acted as if he had an epiphany. \u00a0He lightly poked at the Priest\u2019s left chest with his finger. \u00a0The Priest backed up in fright. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan spoke to the Priest as he laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"For your information, those bastards had the same emblem as the one on your chest. \u00a0They had that ridiculous smiley face on them. \u00a0So do you think will be able to tell me their identities? \u00a0You look like someone, who might know the answer.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It\u2019s the Hahoe Mask!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the name Hahoe Mask swept through the battlefield. \u00a0The name was spoken not by the Priest in front of Hyrkan. \u00a0It was the other Priest. \u00a0When his name was spoken, everyone turned their gazes towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hahoe Mask?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Crazy\u2026\u2026!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ones, who had the luxury of being able to turn their attention away from the battle, focused on the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What? What\u2019s going on?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did you say it was the Hahoe Mask? \u00a0We are being attacked by him right now?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Users, who couldn\u2019t afford to look away, asked questions as they felt a bout of anxiety.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, they weren\u2019t the only ones, who reacted to the name of the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Hahoe Mask? Hahoe Mask made an appearance there? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Support! Send support!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Where?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Level Up support team was helping this party, so they were receiving a live update. \u00a0When the Level Up support team received the information, they were taken aback.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He kept looking at the frozen Priest as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I just wanted to question you in a quiet manner. \u00a0I\u2019m sorry for intruding on your hunt. \u00a0I\u2019m really sorry.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, there wasn\u2019t an ounce of contrition behind his words. \u00a0Hyrkan\u2019s words sounded playful, but his lips didn\u2019t even twitch upwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I guess you are too busy with the hunt to talk. \u00a0I\u2019ll return after you finish your hunt.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even now the guild members didn't dare to surround Hyrkan. \u00a0They didn\u2019t even attempt it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan turned his head to look at the battlefield. \u00a0The Wood Devil was causing a big ruckus, but the Big Smiles guild members just stared at him. \u00a0When he turned to look at them again, they flinched in surprise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan held the piece of paper in his hand, and he showed them the drawing of a Pitbull Terrier.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is my friend. \u00a0If you know, who PKed my friend, you should tell me\u2026.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-oohng, kooh-oohng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ooh-ahk. \u00a0Shit!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a Tanker fell. \u00a0The User was nailed to the ground by the Wood Devil\u2019s fist. \u00a0The User let out a scream for help.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, his guild mates ignored his cry for help as they kept staring at Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan spoke to them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You can give those bastards a message. \u00a0I\u2019ll put all of you guys into the slaughter house.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a declaration of war.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Four Golems appeared. \u00a0They were of Earth, Fire, Ice and Steel. \u00a0They were imposing, and they were sent towards the 10 Big Smiles guild members.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if he wasn\u2019t satisfied with this, the Skeleton Warriors appeared from between the enormous legs of the Golems. \u00a0They attacked the Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the Users fought back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Mega Flare!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Magician attacked the Golem with a powerful magical spell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Shield Crush\uff01\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Gwah-ahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Tankers used their Shields to send the Skeleton Warriors flying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng, kah-ahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Strikers fought a fierce battle with the Skeleton Warriors. \u00a0Weapons clashed, and damage started to appear on armors on both sides.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Buff! \u00a0Buff!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wait a minute!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Priest\u2019s desperately tried to douse the fire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a bedlam. \u00a0Outside of this pandemonium, a private battle was occurring.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A man \u00a0was wearing a tattered armor with the Big Smiles guild logo. \u00a0He had lost his helmet, and his face was revealed. \u00a0His face was marked with wounds from a sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The User looked to be in rough shape as he lay spread eagle on the floor. \u00a0A pillar-like leg was pressing down on the User\u2019s chest, so he was unable to get up. \u00a0He was completely subdued.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Cheap bastard. \u00a0You threw sand in a one on one battle!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The User\u2019s mouth was the only thing he was able to flap.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"When did I say I won\u2019t spray sand? \u00a0I said I won\u2019t use any Skills. \u00a0Anyways, aren\u2019t you going to force a logout??\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the User\u2019s words, Hyrkan replied in a composed manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You son of a bitch. \u00a0We wouldn\u2019t have killed Pitbull if we weren\u2019t prepared to face you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan smiled instead of getting mad.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So why didn\u2019t you guys attack me? \u00a0Huh? \u00a0Were you guys scared of me? \u00a0Did you guys attack Pitbull because he was less scary?\" </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You provoked us first!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If someone heard you, one would think our relationship soured only recently.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan spoke as he stabbed at the User\u2019s chest with his sword. \u00a0The sword slipped in deep between the already crumbling armor. \u00a0The User didn\u2019t scream, since he felt no pain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Weren\u2019t we on bad terms even before we crossed the Urugal mountain range? \u00a0Now that I think about it, you guys tried fuck me over in the Anugas Raid. \u00a0Did you participate in that?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019ll get my revenge soon. \u00a0We\u2019ll do to you what we did to Pitbull.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At those words, Hyrkan pull out the sword, and he stabbed down again. \u00a0The repeated stab made the User\u2019s HP drop to zero. \u00a0After finishing his work, he turned to look at his Golems, Skeleton Warriors and the Big Smiles guild members.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan gave an order. \u00a0The Golems and the Skeleton Warriors, who were relentlessly attacking, stopped. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What\u2019s going on?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A clap needed two palms to strike each other. \u00a0When the Skeleton Warriors and Golems stopped their attack, the Big Smiles guild members also stopped their attack. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When this sudden peace arrived, Hyrkan walked as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m sorry for interrupting your hunt. \u00a0A User, who was in your hunting party, was killed by me. \u00a0It was a personal matter. \u00a0The rest of you can continue your hunt. \u00a0Please enjoy yourselves, and I wish you luck on gaining good drops.\" </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he spoke, Hyrkan spoke with the most contemptible and nasty smile full of ridicule on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had started his work to catch the big giant.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

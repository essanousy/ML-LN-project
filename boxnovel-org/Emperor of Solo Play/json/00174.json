The Tankers have to on alert.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a flash, the mood within the footage changed. \u00a0The screen started to shake as if it was really being filmed by a handheld camera.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Shit! \u00a0It appeared again!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Prepare for battle! \u00a0Prepare for battle!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Don't get dragged in! \u00a0The Tankers have to be especially vigilant!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Within the shaking footage, desperate voices could be heard. \u00a0After a while, the footage stabilized, and the User spoke directly to the viewers watching the video.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I'll end it here. \u00a0This is Big Smiles guild's Sinclair.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The video ended.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan, who had been caught up by the video, was finally able to freely move his gaze. \u00a0Hyrkan moved his gaze as he lifted his head to look in front of him. Hyrkan saw the same monster from the video right in front of his eyes. \u00a0The Sand Snake's corpse had been dismantled, and it was in the process of slowly melting away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddul-goo-ruhk, ddul-goo-ruhk\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two Skeleton Knights on Skeleton Steeds around the Sand Snake. They looked forbidding as they moved slowly. \u00a0It looked as if they were on guard. \u00a0Both of the Skeleton Knights were showing a bold front, yet Hyrkan didn't feel good looking at them. \u00a0His foul mood was inevitable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Skeleton Knight was taken down in a single...\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he arrived at the Red Desert, it was as if the Sand Snake had been waiting for Hyrkan. \u00a0He immediately came across the most famous monster inside the Red Desert.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan decided to answer the Sand Snake's welcome. \u00a0He gave it Skeleton Fragments as gifts for coming into its house.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The battle itself wasn't too bad. \u00a0The Sand Snake's exoskeleton was hard as it looked. \u00a0On the other hand, the monster didn't have any Special Abilities. \u00a0The Skeleton Warriors were trained well enough to fight in a melee with the Sand Snake. \u00a0Then there were the Skeleton Knights strengthened using the Legendary Rank Ancient Power. \u00a0With the help of the Skeleton Knights on their Skeleton Steeds, the Sand Snake wasn't a difficult opponent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the [Corrosive Ghost] Skill effect worked very well on this monster. \u00a0Hyrkan had a Transcendent Rank Ancient Power leftover inside his storage, so he had used it on the [Skeleton Science] Skill. \u00a0The [Corrosive Ghost] Skill had become much stronger, and it quickly weakened the exoskeleton of the Sand Snake. \u00a0Thanks to the recently purchased [Cursed Doll] Skill, it was easy to inflict the Curse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The early portion of the battle was so easy that it made Hyrkan surprised.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Of course, there is nothing easy inside this game.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a flash, the Sand Snake suddenly grabbed onto the Skeleton Knight. \u00a0After biting the Skeleton Knight, who was wailing away at the Sand Snake, the ground sunk inwards. \u00a0The Skeleton Knight was killed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instantaneous Death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Results that usually never happened to his Skeleton underlings occurred.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Afterwards, he entered into another battle with a Sand Snake. \u00a0In the process, two Skeleton Warriors suffered the same fate as the Skeleton Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I get what they were trying to do. \u00a0Still, the Skeleton Knight atop the Skeleton Steed is immense. \u00a0How does it make any sense that it could be dragged underground like that?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After assessing the battle again, Hyrkan clicked his tongue in dismay.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn't an insignificant loss that could be glossed over.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan couldn't summon the Skeleton Knights indefinitely. \u00a0The Skeleton Knight suffering an instantaneous death was a very big loss for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I think the Golems might be the only ones that can tank the Sand Snake.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he had to change his tactics from the norm. \u00a0He couldn't use the Skeleton Knights as hybrid Tankers and Strikers. \u00a0For tanking, he would have to send out a big Golem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018My magical consumption would be too large.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, that was the problem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan didn't use the Golems as his main troops not, because they were weak. \u00a0The Golems were strong. \u00a0However, the cost of summoning was too large to use them against normal monsters. \u00a0Basically, if one took out a Golem in a fight where one Skeleton Knight would suffice, one was killing a chicken with a butcher\u2019s knife meant for a cow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, everything Hyrkan did here was costing money. \u00a0It wasn't as if there was an infinite number of consumables he could use. \u00a0If his consumption was too fast, it would restrict the number of hours he could operate here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan looked up at the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I can't fly around....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The best option would be to fly on the Bone Wyvern without getting into any battles as he looked for his destination. \u00a0However, Warlord didn't permit such an easy method.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Riding Skill could be used only if one had a destination in mind. \u00a0The destination had to be a colonized region like the Heard Fortress ruin town.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it was ok to mount it. \u00a0However, it was impossible to control it. \u00a0In the case of the Bone Wyvern, it just stood on the ground during non-combat situations. \u00a0It only moved when the battle started. \u00a0Moreover, it was suicide to ride a Bone Wyvern into a battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he had to walk around this place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he would have to continue to walk. \u00a0He would have to leave behind his footprints on this hell-like Red Desert.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan, who had been looking up at the sky, lowered his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Yes. \u00a0Let's see who wins.\u2019</span></p><br/><p>2.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Your level has increased.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Skill Proficiency for the Iron Golem Skill has risen to Rank D.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Skill Proficiency for the Bone Dragon Skill has risen to Rank D.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Level Up Announcement was heard, but the Announcement didn't register in Hyrkan's ears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Battle Completed!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan ignored the Red Scorpion he had just caught. \u00a0He turned his head, then he started to run.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He just ran.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFucking hell!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Hyrkan ran, harsh cuss words flowed out his mouth. \u00a0A forest was seen far into the distance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I've finally found it!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a forest filled with trees that rivaled ones seen in the Highwood Forest. \u00a0This forest was beyond being silent. \u00a0It felt dreary. \u00a0It welcomed the visitors with an atmosphere that was quite different from the Red Desert.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I hadn\u2019t found this today, it would have driven me nuts.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had spent 10 days within the Red Desert, and he spent to extra days in locating this place. \u00a0This was his first success on this trip.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hardship endured by Hyrkan for the past 12 days was beyond imagination. \u00a0The environment tested the Users in a different way. \u00a0It didn't allow for breaks, and one had to be always vigilant. \u00a0The time spent inside the Red Desert felt longer. \u00a0A 10 minute span spent inside the Red Desert felt twice as long as any other region.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he had found his target destination only when the Consumable Items stored in his body was almost all gone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he hadn't found the location today, he had no choice, but to head back. \u00a0Of course, Hyrkan's eyes were about to flip over at his current situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018All right. \u00a0I don't care what comes out. \u00a0Even if it is a Zombie, I'll kiss it!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan approached the forest with a happy heart, and Hyrkan was able to have his long awaited encounter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo not approach this place dead human. \u00a0I'll forgive your trespass only once. \u00a0If you return to this place again, even your corpse won't survive the encounter.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an Elf with red colored skin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You've gained the title 'The First to Encounter the Red Elf Tribe'.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Quest \u2018Elf's Artifact\u2019 has started.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Fucking hell!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's headlong charge, which even Anugas wasn't able to stop, came to a full stop at this moment.</span></p><br/><p>3.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A sword was lodged within the Voodoo Lizardman's neck like an axe embedded in wood. \u00a0The Voodoo Lizardman's body shook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the only ally of the Voodoo Lizardman couldn't give any help.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ve cleared the Zombies!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou just have to kill that one now.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two other Users. \u00a0A man and a woman cleared the Zombies. \u00a0Surprisingly, all 10 Zombies had been summoned. \u00a0The last Zombie was killed, and none of the Zombies were able to repair itself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The User kept his sword lodged inside the Voodoo Lizardman, but when he heard their words, he retrieved his sword. \u00a0He stopped prolonging the fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-hwaht! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blood sprayed out from the Voodoo Lizardman's neck. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Goo-roo! \u00a0Goo-roo!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sound of its dying breaths could be heard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the User retrieved his sword, he kicked the ankle of the Voodoo Lizardman with his foot. \u00a0It fell in an instant. \u00a0Before the fallen Voodoo Lizardman could let out a cry through its opened mouth, the tip of the sword fell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poohk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This strike allowed the ragged Voodoo Lizardman to meet its death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the short death cry ended, the three Users all heard the same Announcement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You've killed the 100th Voodoo Lizardman.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You've fulfilled the requirement for the Quest 'Barley Tribe's Request'.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two Users raised both their hands into the air when they heard the Announcement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe've finally caught 100 of them!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI really thought this Quest was ridiculous, but we\u2019ve finally finished it! \u00a0Ooh-ha-ha!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two Users looked very happy. \u00a0Whistling, who had killed the Voodoo Lizardman, let out a happy smile. \u00a0His face was harsh, so even his smile looked very scary. He looked at the two with the smile on his face. \u00a0It wouldn't have been rude to flinch backwards, since his smile was terrifying. \u00a0However, the two had seen his smile before, so they were unsurprised.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShall we go immediately?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe should go immediately!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two Users were like dogs running over to Whistling to beg for a walk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling spoke to the two.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's rest a little bit.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen we\u2019ll butcher our kills.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou dismantle the Zombies. \u00a0I\u2019ll dismantle the Lizardman.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey. \u00a0Why do I have to be stuck with such an unpleasant task?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid you forget I\u2019m a Crusader?

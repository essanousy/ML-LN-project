(4)</p><br/><p>13.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan ran full tilt as he ran away towards the northern region of the Highwood Forest. \u00a0At times, he saw Users passing by him at high speed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018By the look of their Setting, they went all out for speed. \u00a0It seems they are dead set on catching me.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These Users had put all their Stat Points into Strength. \u00a0They had Item Settings geared towards speed, and they had received all kinds of Speed Buffs. \u00a0They even had consumable Items that could boost their speed. \u00a0Moreover, they were experienced in running quickly through difficult terrains.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018How many\u2026.. \u00a0If I combine the number of Strikers and the rear support team, will they number between 100 to 200? \u00a0Will it be around 150 of them?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They would be blocking Hyrkan\u2019s path shortly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he saw what they were about to do, Hyrkan smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is the best outcome I could have hoped for.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was being put into a desperately dangerous situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were on the Hahoe Mask\u2019s tail, and eventually the body would be caught.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they caught up to the body of the Hahoe Mask, it was obvious what the Big Smiles guild planned to do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan wasn\u2019t flustered. \u00a0Of course, this was going as planned, and he wanted this to play out like this. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All work was like this. \u00a0If one wanted good result, one had to go through a step by step process.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This venture was no different.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Giant Killing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as the word implied. \u00a0He would be taking down one of the 30 great guilds, which was akin to taking down a giant. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t do it with only with viciousness and balls.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First, he had to fight within his weight class. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he had carried out this ridiculous revenge plot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was suicide for a Flyweight boxer to fight a Heavyweight boxer on the Heavyweight boxer\u2019s term.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The next problem was something he had learned in the past after fighting a war with the 30 great guilds. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The act of slaying the giant was much easier than dealing with the aftermath.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he had killed all eleven Users, the Pitbull revenge play would have come to an end. \u00a0He would have to drop his vendetta. \u00a0Hyrkan wouldn\u2019t have been able to use revenge as a cover in attacking the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0If he attacked after completing his revenge, \u00a0he would basically be openly announcing his hostility towards the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0On the flip side, this implication also held true for the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0Since the revenge play had come to an end, they would have to try to hide their conduct. \u00a0They would have to catch the Hahoe Mask in secret. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I forgave them.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had forgiven them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had brought the issue to a clean end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahoe Mask had appeared in front of the Users, who had hunted down Pitbull, and he made it clear that he had forgiven them. \u00a0He also apologized to them, and he gave them a sincere blessing. \u00a0He wished them luck in getting good drops.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So what would happen if the Big Smiles guild moved immediately to kill the Hahoe Mask?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Who will be blamed for starting the war?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From that moment on, it would no longer be a revenge play.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018People always root for the underdog.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The giant would be attacking a small private individual. \u00a0They would attack him in an one-sided and indiscriminate manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018From now on, no matter what I do to fuck them over they won\u2019t be able to complain. \u00a0They\u2019ll just have to take it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If this small individual suffered in such a manner, it didn\u2019t matter what he did. \u00a0He could use whatever methods or tricks in his arsenal. \u00a0His actions would be forgiven by the public. \u00a0Moreover, people will actually cheer him on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From now on, no one would point a finger in admonishment when they witness what he had planned. \u00a0They\u2019ll give him a standing ovation.</span></p><br/><p>14.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is\u2026.. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask didn\u2019t harm the bait team.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask hunting plan had been approved in the meeting of the executive officers. \u00a0The next topic was to decide, who would be in command of the operation, and Apollo was given the baton.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is\u2026.. \u00a0The bait team is in a state of confusion right now, so I\u2019ll have to listen to them a little bit more. \u00a0However, from what I gather, it seems the Hahoe Mask had forgiven them. \u00a0No, he didn\u2019t forgive the bait team, but he forgave the Users, who hunted down Pitbull.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No one had complained when Apollo was handed the command.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo thought this was a great opportunity for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he killed the Hahoe Mask, Apollo\u2019s power within the Big Smiles would increase significantly. \u00a0This will allow Apollo to fix his weakness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo had basically bought his way into power. \u00a0He was also placed in the sub-guild master chair, because he was perceived to be easier to control by Brooks. \u00a0Moreover, unlike Heh-bibin, he didn\u2019t have the ability, awareness or the patience to build up his own power base. \u00a0He would never be a threat to Brooks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, none of the Big Smiles guild members had unconditionally accepted his promotion. \u00a0In such a situation, he had the chance to bring about the killing of the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0All the guild members wanted the Hahoe Mask taken down, and he would have the support of the normal guild members if he succeeded. \u00a0This task represented a symbolism he could use to gain power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, there was a catch. \u00a0The catch was that he had to put his voice behind Heh-bibin. \u00a0Furthermore, in return, Heh-bibin promised to support Apollo from now on. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If such a deal wasn\u2019t in place, he wouldn\u2019t have risked stabbing Brooks in the back. \u00a0Brooks was the one, who had placed him within the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo what?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fact that the Hahoe Mask hadn\u2019t bothered with the bait team didn\u2019t change anything for Apollo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you trying to say? What\u2019s going on with the Hahoe Mask hunt?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t care about the status of the bait team. \u00a0The only thing important was the fact that Apollo had the chance to kill the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0He had the chance to break the Hahoe Mask\u2019s wrists.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are in pursuit. \u00a0We are also intermittently engaging him in battle.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is the current situation?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to corner him. \u00a0Our hunting team is faster than him.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had made a lot of preparations. \u00a0The Highwood forest was a difficult stage, so the elites of the guild were all gathered there. \u00a0It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that any Big Smiles guild member with a modicum of skill was gathered there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen catch him for me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Apollo\u2019s words, there wasn\u2019t much more to say. \u00a0The one giving the report didn\u2019t give any advices to Apollo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t as if Apollo was the only one, who wanted to kill the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0There wasn\u2019t a single guild member within the Big Smiles guild, who looked favorably at the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0Moreover, the bait team was bait. \u00a0When a fish bites the bait, one doesn\u2019t worry if the bait was fine or damaged. \u00a0No fisherman would worry about whether a bait was intact when one had to reel in the fish.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAnyways, he is about to reach the border between the Red Desert and the Highwood Forest.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRed Desert?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, we\u2019ll be able to surround him there.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone\u2019s favorite prey was heading north.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Red Desert was acknowledged to be dangerous by the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0It was a place where they forbid their guild members from hunting, yet they were heading there.</span></p><br/><p>15.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask was surrounded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There are quite a lot of them.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one stood atop the large trees filling up the Highwood forest, one could catch sight of the Red Desert. \u00a0One could see about thirty Strikers surrounding the Hahoe Mask to the north.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018They made pretty extensive preparations.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The encircling net was tight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At any point in time, the encircling net could let fly their swords towards Hyrkan. \u00a0They were prepared to sacrifice their lives for the Hahoe Mask Hunt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, they were waiting for something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Hahoe Mask\u2019s Skeletons hasn\u2019t made their appearance yet.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018We have to eliminate whatever the Hahoe Mask brings to bear before we can eliminate him.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This might turn into a prolonged battle.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two ways to hunt the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The first method was to kill the Hahoe Mask before he could bring out all his cards. \u00a0The other method was to force the Hahoe Mask to bring out all his cards then kill him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The former method seemed easy, but the Hahoe Mask had a frightening amount of skill in battle even if he didn\u2019t have his Skeletons and Golems. \u00a0In the Argardo Raid, Immoral Prince Raid and the Anugas raid, he showed such proficiency that all Strikers praised the Hahoe Mask\u2019s peerless skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why the second option was preferable. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was to force the Hahoe Mask to bring out all his cards!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t easy, but it wasn\u2019t impossible. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask could not summon an unlimited number of Skeletons and Golems. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They have over 50 Strikers, and twice the number of magicians and priests\u2026. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were close to 150 Users gathered here, and these weren\u2019t the normal Users of Big Smiles guild. \u00a0These were the best of the best of the Big Smiles guild, so the task of eliminating the Hahoe Mask\u2019s familiars shouldn\u2019t be too difficult for them. \u00a0These Users thought of Big Smiles as being the best, so they considered themselves to be the best.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why they were forcing this confrontation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, even in this harsh atmosphere, Hyrkan was able to speak up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy are you guys attacking me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan used this lull to ask a question. \u00a0The voice asking the question was very loud.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, all the Users were focused on Hyrkan\u2019s every movement, so they were all able to hear his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were taken aback by the question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They would have preferred if the Hahoe Mask was overbearing. \u00a0They would have had an easier time accepting swear words from the Hahoe Mask than what they were getting right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead, he had ask them a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why were they attacking him?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No one could answer that question. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan once again asked them a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDidn\u2019t I forgive the Users, who hunted down Pitbull?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan didn\u2019t even bother to unsheathe his weapon as he spoke. \u00a0He had his arms crossed as if he was lecturing them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve expressed my intentions not too long ago. \u00a0I will no longer pursue my revenge. \u00a0I haven\u2019t attacked the remaining eight Users. \u00a0Moreover, I didn\u2019t mess with the Big Smiles guild members hunting within the Highwood Forest.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was obvious, but the Hahoe Mask hunt team hadn\u2019t known about this fact. \u00a0They had just chased after Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After receiving a report from the bait team, there was no way Apollo would have informed the Hahoe Mask hunt team of these facts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo why is the Big Smiles guild keep trying to attack me? \u00a0Are you guys trying to punish me as a guild?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The continuous questions created a disordered atmosphere amongst the Big Smiles guild members.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What the hell is he talking about?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He forgave them? That actually happened?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, someone had to step forward to rile up the troops. \u00a0The User, who was leading the Hahoe Mask hunt team, had the level, experience and the ability to realize this fact. \u00a0He quickly stepped forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is as you said, Hahoe Mask. \u00a0This is a punishment. \u00a0\u00a0As you probably know, the relationship between the Big Smiles guild and you is bad enough where we don\u2019t need to explain ourselves in eliminating each other.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were the words spoken previously by Hyrkan towards the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Hyrkan nodded his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo it is a punishment. \u00a0Therefore, I can use whatever methods and tricks to survive this assault?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou can try. \u00a0We aren't weak. \u00a0We\u2019ll be able to catch a prey like you, who is right in front of our eyes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After speaking those words, the leader of the hunt team used the Voice Talk to give orders to the Strikers surrounding the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- You guys attack the Hahoe Mask first, then he\u2019ll start using the his cards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- When I give the signal, the 1st team will move. \u00a0The 2nd team will be ready to counteract any changes. \u00a0The 3rd team will act as support. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- If you are in trouble, I want you guys to retreat to the backline, so you can receive healing from the Priests.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The Magicians should look out for the signal to start the magical bombardment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no reason why they should give Hyrkan more time. \u00a0If he wouldn\u2019t pull out his cards, they would have to force it out of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now everyone was tense as they waited for a signal. \u00a0The leader of the hunt team was mulling over when to give out the signal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan still didn\u2019t show any signs of fighting. \u00a0He continued to speak with his arms folded. \u00a0It was as if he wanted to buy some time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre any of you subscribed to my youtube page? \u00a0Raise your hands.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, no one raised their hands. \u00a0No one was flustered by his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018My intuition say they\u2019ll be attacking soon. \u00a0Their timing is impeccable.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Hyrkan looked at them, he forcefully stopped himself from smiling. \u00a0He maintained a neutral expression as he continued to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere\u2019s a video over there explaining the special characteristics of the my Skills. \u00a0The description of the Skill I\u2019m about to use will be uploaded there soon.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The countdown has started\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, Hyrkan started to count inside. \u00a0He started to countdown from the initial number he chose.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s a Skill that was reinforced by the Ancient Power I recently gained. \u00a0It was a Legendary Rank Ancient power, and I used it to reinforce the Bone Explosive Skill. \u00a0I don\u2019t think you guys have a high level Necromancer within your guild, so you probably don\u2019t know about the effects of reinforcing this Skill. \u00a0Do you guys at least know about the Bone Explosive Skill?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan unfurled his arms. \u00a0Then he took out a small bomb from a pouch attached to his waist. \u00a0The Bone Explosive looked like a skull, and there was a thumb-length wick attached to it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Bone Explosive skill causes this to explode. \u00a0Once I reinforced this Skill, it gained the time bomb option. \u00a0At most, I can set the bomb to explode after 6 hours.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan unfurled his hand. \u00a0He straightened all five fingers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFive, four, three\u2026...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He folded his fingers as he spoke. \u00a0He started with his thumb, and he kept moving onto the next finger. \u00a0He finally arrived at the pinky finger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When it folded, the number zero was spoken by Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-kwahng, kwahng, kwah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It started from beneath the feet of the Strikers surrounding Hyrkan. \u00a0It occurred from all direction, and it was several dozen\u2026. \u00a0No, over 200 area started to explode in succession.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s an attack!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bombs went off like dominoes falling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In other words, it was quite the sight. \u00a0It was as if fireworks were being detonated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The spectators could only look on and focus on the spectacular, powerful and unique attack. \u00a0Most of those not involved in the explosion looked at the sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ok.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During all of this, Hyrkan ran towards the north.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Maintain the perimeter! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Big Smiles guilds became distracted, Hyrkan immediately broke through the perimeter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He faced the User that was blocking the path in front of him. \u00a0The User had been busy looking at the explosions, and when he became aware of the Hahoe Mask, it was too late. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask was within weapon range.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Attack!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the User reacted reflexively. \u00a0However, this was insufficient to beat an opponent like the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The User needed his comrades to help him, but they wouldn\u2019t reach him in time. \u00a0It took the Hahoe Mask less than three seconds to dispatch the User.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The User swung his sword like lightning. \u00a0He brought it down from up high.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shweek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan looked as if he was attempting a wrestling tackle, and the User\u2019s sword was brought down on Hyrkan\u2019s back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng!

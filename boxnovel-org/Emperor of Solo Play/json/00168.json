(1)</p><br/><p>1.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The news of the the Hydra guild acquiring the Fighters guild was spread in an instant. \u00a0It also created a big ripple in Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Why did the Hydra guild suddenly merge with the Fighters guild?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 They made the acquisition, because they needed the forces of the Fighters guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Why does the Hydra guild suddenly need the Fighters guild's forces? \u00a0What are they trying to do?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the midst of the unrest, people started to figure out the reasons behind the merge. \u00a0They deduced the reason why the Hydra guild had purchased the Fighters guild even at the expense of overpaying for the acquisition.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- They are basically signalling their intent on entering the Black Continent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 The original Hydra guild had enough firepower to enter the Black Continent. \u00a0So why make this move?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 Monsters aren't the only foes one has to face within the Black Continent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a short amount of time, a majority of the people came to a consensus in regards to the reasoning behind the merge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The Black Continent is already occupied by the Five Stars guild and the Stormhunters guild. \u00a0They are basically saying that they won't back down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 Will this be a start to a guild war? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 Didn\u2019t they already fight with the Big Smiles guild in the Frozen Lands? \u00a0They've already fought once, so there is no reason why they won't fight again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 However, the Big Smiles is part of the Five Stars now. \u00a0Will the Hydra guild really try to start something with the Big Smiles? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 This is why they acquired the Fighters guild! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 Still, would the acquisition of the Fighters guild be enough? \u00a0In my opinion, it would have been better to create an alliance with another guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 The Hydra guild has a decent relationship with the Red Bulls. \u00a0If they allied with each other on top of acquiring the Fighters guild... \u00a0It might be possible. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Guild war.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn't simply a fight between Users affiliated with a guild. \u00a0It was a life-and-death fight where the guild's profit was put on the line as prize. \u00a0Of course, when the Hydra guild enters the Black Continent, many predicted that it would signal the start of a guild war. \u00a0It would be a battle between 30 great guilds that'll determine each guild's fate. \u00a0Since the fate of a guild was on the line, it was predicted that it would be a battle amongst the most skilled Users, who represented the guilds. \u00a0It would be like the fight between Sohank and Sinclair at the Frozen lands. \u00a0The real pros would be fighting for their fame.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">People expected it, and at the same time, they were looking forward to seeing it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, unlike the expectations held by the public, no full scale battles occurred.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When people realized that there wouldn't be any real clashes, everyone became disappointed. \u00a0Ahn-jaehyun was one of the people, who was disappointed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There's no special news today either.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun busily tapped at his Tablet PC, and he had on a sullen expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018In the end, did they decide to work with each other? \u00a0From what I saw, the Hydra guild and the Five Stars overlapped in their area of operation... \u00a0Did they come to some kind of agreement?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Hydra guild acquired the Fighters guild, Ahn-jaehyun had thought his opportunity had finally come.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From Ahn-jaehyun's perspective, it hadn't been great to share the Black Continent with the Five Stars and the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, if the field got messy, the story would change. \u00a0As the competition amongst the 30 great guilds intensified, he would be able to operate more freely in the Black Continent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018These bastards might attack me to screw me over... \u00a0\u00a0Something smells off.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the 30 great guilds worked with each other, it wouldn't have a positive effect on the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask wasn't some friendly and handsome oppa next door. \u00a0If the 30 great guilds had the chance to eliminate the Hahoe Mask, they would gladly get rid of him immediately.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Still, it is great to see a great volume of Items being released.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One of the positives of the 30 great guilds operating in the Black Continent was the fact the Black Continent was stabilizing as each faction kept each other in check. \u00a0This had the effect of more Unique Items and Skill Books being put on the market.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Warlord had an Item Crafting system, and if one was lucky, one could produce a Unique Rank Item, while trying to make a normal Rank Item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, the Black Continent had a lot of locations, where one could acquire Skill Books. \u00a0There was the Dungeons called Ruins, and the Dungeon Rewards frequently gave No Name Skill Books as reward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Level 190 No Name Skill Books were being put on the market intermittently. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun tapped his Tablet PC to go into Warlord's auction house. \u00a0There were 3 level 190 No Name Skill Book up for sale. \u00a0The price was 1 million gold. \u00a0All three of them were priced the same at 1 million gold.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Crazy bastards.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the sellers weren\u2019t serious about selling it for gold. \u00a0If they were really going to sell it for 1 million gold, one would be better off allowing the option of trading it for an Item of similar price instead of gold.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sellers had put it up with a YOLO mentality. \u00a0If it did sell, it would be a huge windfall for the seller. \u00a0Even if it was a very slim possibility, there was a a bit of hope behind their actions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If it was a 100 thousand gold then maybe....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Warlord had a fair number of wealthy individuals, who had too much money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018100,000 gold.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun clicked his tongue when he realized what he had just thought about.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'm so far down this road. \u00a0I'm actually thinking about buying a Skill book for 100 thousand gold...\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun shook his head from side to side, and his gaze naturally landed on the V-Gear lying on top of the mattress. \u00a0It was the most expensive V-Gear model a civilian could buy. \u00a0He felt a weight press down on his chest.</span></p><br/><p>2.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two mountains surrounded by a red forest. \u00a0From afar, it looked as if the mountains were burning at its base. \u00a0These mountains were so tall that it was hard to even look up at the peak of the mountains.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Red Forest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was one of the top 5 most difficult hunting ground found on the Black Continent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One had to be level 240 to have access to the hunting ground!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Stormhunters guild had found this place first, but they had given up any rights to it. \u00a0It was still too difficult to claim this location as a hunting ground. \u00a0It was a hellish location for the Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a fearsome monster that had made this place into hell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-uh-uh-uhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was 3 meters tall, and it had human arms and legs like a werewolf. \u00a0However, it possessed incredible offense, defense and combat ability that couldn't be compared to a humanoid monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Werebear was first found by the Storm Princess Hahui, and the monster was famous for knocking her down with a single strike.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To be precise, Hahui thought the Werebear was cute, so she approached it to give it a hug. \u00a0As she attempted the hug, she hadn't been able to dodge the Werebear's attack, and she was sent flying through the air. \u00a0Hatch had recorded this scene, and he had uploaded it to his personal youtube page.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In just five days, the video received 30 million views. \u00a0It was a very popular video.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, the Werebear was letting out a rough cry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-uh-uh-uhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To be precise, it let out a scream.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Two Skeleton Knights easily turned away the arms swung by the Werebear, and the small Mini Ogre Skeleton Warriors continuously stabbed at the Werebear's legs. \u00a0When the Werebear tried to catch the Mini Ogre Skeleton Warriors, the Skeleton Knights immediately brought down their swords to make wounds on its thick hide.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In such a situation, the cry let out by the Werebear could be interpreted as a scream.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0It is so noisy..\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan expressed his annoyance at hearing such a noise. \u00a0The other Users would be startled by the sight in front of him, but it was something he saw everyday. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Hyrkan was busy pressing the Golden Conch to his ear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- To the east\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Golden Conch let out a low voice. \u00a0The voice came out at really low volume. \u00a0If one wasn't paying full attention to it, one wouldn\u2019t be able to make out the words. \u00a0This was the reason why Hyrkan had become annoyed at the Werebear's cry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this wasn't the real source of his annoyance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to go east again?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the 20th day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been 20 days, since Hyrkan had received the Quest from the Heard Fortress Ruin town.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had relied on the low voice of the Golden Conch for directions. \u00a0It kept sending him towards the east, and he was once again sent towards the same direction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018How far does it want me to go? \u00a0Is it a bug?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he hadn't traveled a short distance in the past 20 days. \u00a0He had traveled a large distance. \u00a0Despite this fact, he had nothing to show for it. \u00a0He hadn\u2019t been able to find any more traces regarding the Archmage Bokan, and he hadn\u2019t found any Ruins either.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This Bokan bastard is worse than Abrahim. \u00a0What kind of a Quest has no end like this?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, it was the worst part about this Quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018After the Heard Fortress Ruin, I haven't been able to earn any more Ancient Powers.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fastest way to gain the Ancient Power was to find the Ruins. \u00a0The other way was the Quest Rewards. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, if one wanted to earn a Transcendent Rank Ancient Power, one needed Quests that took at least 10 days to complete them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was also the reason why he had thought he would at the very least find two Ruins during this Quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had thought the appearance of Ruins was a given. \u00a0In the Ruined Kingdom episode, the Ruins acted as the stepping stones to progress in one\u2019s Quest. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the Quest to find the Archmage Bokan, so shouldn't this Quest have more extraordinary stepping stones?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, for the past 20 days, Hyrkan had been busily fighting monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If the Quest Reward wasn't a Skill Book, I would have given up on this much earlier.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan shook his head from side to side as he once again looked at the battlefield. \u00a0The Skeleton Knights and Skeleton Warriors made up a group of seven, and they were facing a Werebear. \u00a0The monster was riddled with wounds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it wasn't as if the Werebear was the only one to take wounds. \u00a0The Skeleton Knights and Skeleton Warriors had taken significant damage at the Werebear's counterattacks. \u00a0In fact, three Skeleton Warriors had already reverted themselves to Skeleton Fragments. \u00a0The Werebear had been fighting 10 foes, and it had taken down three.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I can understand why the Storm Princess was sent flying by this monster.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Werebears were really strong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From Hyrkan's perspective, it was one of the strongest mid-sized normal monster he had encountered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the Werebears were absent from his memories.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTsk!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan clicked his tongue. \u00a0At that moment, the Werebear suddenly looked at Hyrkan. \u00a0When it met Hyrkan's eyes, the light within its eyes changed. \u00a0It used to have a black gleam in its eyes, but now it had turned red.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan wasn't taken aback. \u00a0This was the first time he had seen the monster do this, and when the monster stared at him with those eyes, Hyrkan knew something was up. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was already running at that point.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Werebear threw its body towards Hyrkan. \u00a0The Skeleton Knights raised their shields in front of them to block it, but the Werebear was much stronger than before. \u00a0The Skeleton Knights were thrown to the ground by the Body Slam. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-uh-uhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Wearbear let out a roar, and it got onto all four feet for the first time. \u00a0It started running after Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Knights rolled across the ground before they immediately righted themselves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Knights looked at the Werebear's rear with a blue light in their eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dduhl-goo-ruhk, dduhl-goo-ruhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Mini Ogre Skeleton Warriors were geniuses at tracking down foes, so they quickly followed right behind the Werebear. \u00a0In a single breath, a single Mini Ogre Skeleton Warrior climbed atop the Werebear, and it started to stab down at the Werebear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan, who had been running, suddenly changed direction, and he started to run in a circuitous route. \u00a0After a brief moment, he came to a stop. \u00a0When Hyrkan stopped running, the Werebear rushed towards Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-uhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Werebear was about to pounce on him when Hyrkan lowered his body. \u00a0the Werebear flew over Hyrkan as if it was jumping over an obstacle. \u00a0After landing on the floor, the Werebear quickly turned its body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chul-kuhk, chul-kuhk, chul-kuhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a flash, the Skeleton Knights and Skeleton Warriors surrounded the Werebear. \u00a0They maintained the perimeter as they charged towards the monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had run away using the Whirlpool escape plan. \u00a0He had run away in the shape of a whirlpool, and in the end, the bait would become surrounded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan looked at the sight in a calm manner, and he once again put the Golden Conch to his ear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- To the north....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Uh?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a new word appeared for the first time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan turned his head towards the north.</span></p><br/><p>3.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan raised his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a large mountain, and everything about it was grand. \u00a0Within this mountain, there was a cave that had a slightly different grandeur than a naturally made cave. \u00a0On the exterior walls, there were realistic large knights carved into it, and it looked as if they would come to life at any moment. \u00a0However, the sight that stole Hyrkan's gaze wasn't the knight sculptures.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018No way.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a 10 meter tall cave entrance located between the large knight sculptures. \u00a0On top of the cave entrance, the image of a crown was carved into it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Can it be?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, there were gems embedded into the crown. \u00a0The gems were massive. \u00a0Each of the gems decorating the crown was easily bigger than a man's fist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan looked at the cave entrance, and he put his treasured Golden Conch to his ear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Go in\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan followed the Golden Conch's words, and he entered the cave. \u00a0Darkness greeted him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no way anyone would smile happily when looking at this darkness. \u00a0It was as if all the ills of the world was gathered within this darkness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, a smile formed on Hyrkan's lips as he looked at the darkness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Thank you, my teacher's teacher.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan finally found his first stepping stone on the 20th day.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

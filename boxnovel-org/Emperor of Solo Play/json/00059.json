After successfully hunting the Bear Warrior alone, Hyrkan enjoyed the reward fully. He had completed the main scenario quest, obtained a total of four titles, increased two of his skill ranks, and leveled up. </p><br/><p>Lastly\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYep, this is it.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the puddle left by the melted corpse of the Bear Warrior, Hyrkan could see three fist-sized jewels.</p><br/><p>Picking up the jewels, Hyrkan trembled.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is what you call a lucky drop!\u2019</p><br/><p>The pent up feeling from the Sword Monkeys finally exploded as a smiled formed naturally. He had begun to shoulder dance, which he had not done recently. Along with it, he converted everything from the Bear Warrior into crafting coins. Although it was a tedious task, the smile never left Hyrkan\u2019s face as he toiled. It was one of the happiest face Hyrkan had since starting Warlord.</p><br/><p>The amount of coins he got was enough to fill the pouch he brought to the size of an adult male\u2019s head. </p><br/><p>\u2018Today\u2019s just getting better and better!\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t think he would get three crafting jewels.</p><br/><p>Three crafting jewels meant much more than getting one more crafting jewel from two.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I sell these as a set, I can get much more\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Currently, there was no Bear Warrior set anywhere in Warlord. With three crafting jewels, it was enough to craft 3 rare rank items, which was enough to produce a set effect.</p><br/><p>\u2018Just selling these would net about 10,000 gold at the minimum.\u2019 </p><br/><p>If he could sell these to an item collector, he could buy an entire cow, much less some meat.</p><br/><p>\u2018Looks like I\u2019ll be oiling up my stomach\u2026 with cow oil that is.\u2019</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t it. The video he took was phenomenal. A necromancer hunting a boss monster by himself was impressive even in Hyrkan\u2019s eyes. He predicted 5 or even 10 million views. </p><br/><p>The worth of 10 million views was enormous. Sponsorships would come like candy and the amount he would get from that would be completely different from before. What he was getting in won would turn into yen. In other words, he would get 10 times more than before! </p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 wow.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a brief pause, Hyrkan kissed his biceps.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well done, Hyrkan. You\u2019re the best.\u2019</p><br/><p>Self-praise.</p><br/><p>Although he looked like a crazyman, Hyrkan was satisfied with everything he had done to the point he felt no remorse in his embarrassing action. In fact, he wasn\u2019t just satisfied. From one to ten, everything had played out like he wanted. Moreover, this was a first in Warlord history, and first in Hyrkan\u2019s successes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yep, An Jaehyun! This! This is it! Your choice wasn\u2019t wrong!\u2019</p><br/><p>Solo raid success!</p><br/><p>Although there was room for improvement, Hyrkan could also feel the infinite potential for improvement from this raid.</p><br/><p>He now had assurance exceeding confidence.</p><br/><p>\u2018Just keep going this way.\u2019</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t wrong!</p><br/><p>These words that echoed in Hyrkan\u2019s mind was the biggest reward from this raid. </p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bulkas Ranger Village.</p><br/><p>Located at halfway up the Bulkas Mountain, the Bulkas Mountain Village was the only place where players could rest, buy consumable items, and receive quests. Of course, those that visited the Bulkas Mountain Range naturally stopped by at least once at this place.</p><br/><p>Moreover, as people found out that the Bulkas Mountain Range was ideal for levels 60~80, more have been coming by the day. </p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by what? I\u2019m saying what I\u2019m feeling.\u201d</p><br/><p>At such a place, someone was spending his entire time just looking for one person. It was natural that he wouldn\u2019t be in the greatest mood. </p><br/><p>At the moment, he didn\u2019t even want to hide how he was feeling. </p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if the executives hear you? Shut it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike they\u2019d come here. They\u2019re too busy fucking around together. Tell them to come!\u201d</p><br/><p>Two Apollo Guild players were currently waiting by the Bulkas Ranger Village entrance, looking for the player that killed three members of the Apollo Guild.</p><br/><p>They must have spent at least 7 hours by now. It could be considered short, depending on how one looked at it. It was common for players to spend six or so hours to get from hunting grounds to castles. This was also why some players amassed items that raised their movement speeds. </p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t a short time considering they had paid tens of millions of won to buy the gaming machine and were paying monthly fees to continue playing. 7 hours looking for a person could never feel longer. Not to mention, they weren\u2019t doing this of their own volition. </p><br/><p>It would be fortunate if foul language was the only thing coming out of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean, come on. The one that got PKed is the retard. Why do we have to do this for those retards?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, lower your voice!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree of them couldn\u2019t even take care of one person. How does that even make sense? They were the ones who followed him too! They want us to take revenge for them? Isn\u2019t it better to just cut them from the guild?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWatch what you\u2019re saying. Otherwise\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? I can leave the guild, who cares? There are thousands of guilds in Warlord.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he said those words, the player could feel even more rage boiling up from inside him. </p><br/><p>Leave the guild? Sure. He could do it. It\u2019s not like a guild could prevent him from leaving, and he surely wasn\u2019t breaking any laws by doing so. </p><br/><p>It\u2019s just that\u2026 he was afraid of what would happen as a result. </p><br/><p>Playing as a runaway wasn\u2019t something he considered fun. No one did. </p><br/><p>\u2018This dirty world\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Above all, such a thing was sure to happen in the Apollo Guild. The guild master was someone who did anything he could do punish those that ignored him. With how much he was overflowing with money, there wasn\u2019t much he couldn\u2019t do in Warlord. After all, he could hire a Ranker given enough money. </p><br/><p>Of course, he could still leave if he wanted. He just had to die 6 or so times. But rather than going through such things, it was better to just swallow his pride and enjoy an easier time in his current guild.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, fuck this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment. </p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Stop trying to stop me from\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I was just thinking, what if we just catch a random guy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Apollo Guild members thought up a solution to their problem. </p><br/><p>\u201cThink about it. We don\u2019t even know the face of the guy we\u2019re looking for. Then why don\u2019t we just find someone who looks like a pushover? We can just say it was him, and I\u2019m sure the executives will fall for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if they don\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just say we mistook him. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re in the wrong here. They didn\u2019t even give us a picture!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that, the other guild member fell over in a swoop. They were both furious, although only one of them was voicing it out loud.</p><br/><p>And in their line of sight\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe looks like a pushover. Even if not, it doesn\u2019t look like he has any backers we need to worry about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe does look like a pushover.\u201d</p><br/><p>A suitable target appeared.</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>Hatch turned around.</p><br/><p>\u2018What now?\u2019</p><br/><p>There was a ruckus nearby. One player was surrounded by several others. Hatch made apathetic expression.</p><br/><p>\u2018In Warlord, there are no days without wind.\u2019 </p><br/><p>Hatch would have usually ignored a situation like this. He was already overflowing with tasks. Even now, he was coming back from a quest to obtain one of his titles. The Top 30 Guilds employed a method where their quest team did most of the work and the main members came by receive credit. Even this was a tedious task, and Hatch didn\u2019t want to involve himself in any more bothersome things.</p><br/><p>\u2018Eh?\u2019</p><br/><p>However, the players in question were players Hatch knew.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aren\u2019t they from that Apollo Guild?\u2019</p><br/><p>And.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait, weren\u2019t they looking for Hahoe Mask?\u2019</p><br/><p>They were looking for the same person he was looking for. Otherwise, Hatch would not have cared.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u2019 </p><br/><p>Hatch walked towards the crowded area, and when he did, he could hear what they were talking about.</p><br/><p>\u201cI already told you, I don\u2019t know who you guys are!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to weasel out of it! Pay for your actions!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat actions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoing against the Apollo Guild!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you, this is the first time I\u2019m hearing that name! I just came here for the first time!\u201d </p><br/><p>Hatch turned his head. A typical traveler\u2019s outfit. To be exact, it was the Subjugation Association\u2019s default set. On top of this, the player in question had the word \u2018pushover\u2019 written all over him. Surrounding him were 6 members of the Apollo Guild. </p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s Hahoe Mask Hyrkan?\u2019</p><br/><p>Since he had never seen Hahoe Mask Hyrkan\u2019s real face, there was no way of confirming whether he was looking at the real Hahoe Mask.</p><br/><p>As such, Hatch gave it a little thought.</p><br/><p>\u2018As long as Hahoe Mask Hyrkan isn\u2019t an idiot, he wouldn\u2019t come over announcing that he\u2019s the Hahoe Mask after taking care of members of the Apollo Guild.\u2019</p><br/><p>The symbol of Hyrkan was his hahoe mask. He appeared in all his videos wearing it. In other words, he could easily hide his identity by taking it off. It was clear that Hyrkan wasn\u2019t such an idiot that wouldn\u2019t make use of that fact.</p><br/><p>That is, it was impossible for Hatch to decide whether this was the real Hyrkan by looking at his face. After all, he had never seen him before. On the other hand, the Apollo Guild was much more likely to have seen his face. They were taken out by him after all. In any case, they would have more information about Hyrkan\u2019s looks than Hatch himself did.</p><br/><p>Hatch quickly came to a decision.</p><br/><p>\u2018If he\u2019s the real one, great. Even if he\u2019s not, I\u2019m helping a guy getting bullied, so I\u2019ll be justified.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t hurt to try.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hatch came forward.</p><br/><p>At that moment, everyone\u2019s attention turned to Hatch. The Apollo Guild\u2019s members frowned, and it was clear that they were thinking, \u2018who the hell is this?\u2019 On the other hand, the player surrounded by them had a completely different expression than them. His stiff expression seemed to be saying, \u2018this fucker is\u2026!\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course, Hatch didn\u2019t catch the meaning behind their expressions. He wasn\u2019t the type to study people\u2019s faces, and he surely wasn\u2019t in a situation to be doing so.</p><br/><p>Hatch only spoke his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop causing a ruckus. I have a business with him, so let him go.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Hatch\u2019s words, one of the Apollo Guild members snorted as if he had just heard the most absurd thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd who are you?\u201d </p><br/><p>Hatch sneered.</p><br/><p>\u2018So this is why the Top 30 Guild members sometimes go about hiding their identity. This is fun in a way.\u2019</p><br/><p>This was the first time he had been treated this way since he started Warlord. Rather than finding it unpleasant, he found it amusing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Hatch began to fiddle with his watch. Not just the Top 30 Guilds, but most other famous guilds had their own guild uniforms. The Stormhunter Guild naturally had uniforms as well. Although the item options weren\u2019t that good, they were the best defensive items against players. </p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah!\u2019</p><br/><p>Hatch realized that he hadn\u2019t put his uniform in his item slot.</p><br/><p>His expression immediately turned to a frown. </p><br/><p>\u2018What a stupid mistake!\u2019</p><br/><p>Quickly taking his hand off his watch, he raised it up and lowered the hood covering his head. Although he didn\u2019t have his uniform on, his face was still well known. He was hoping the other side would notice him and back off.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately for Hatch, none of the Apollo Guild\u2019s players noticed him. Although they momentarily studied him, thinking he looked familiar, they weren\u2019t able to remember who he was. In the end, the reaction he got wasn\u2019t what he was hoping for.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Are you trying to pick a fight with our guild? Do you want to quit this game too?\u201d </p><br/><p>At his words, Hatch didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. </p><br/><p>Then\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Hatch!\u201d</p><br/><p>A sharp voice rang out. </p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going by yourself? Stick with the team! Do you wanna die?\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone shouted and everyone turned to look at them. Other players who were just watching the situation also turned to look towards the direction of the voice. Then, they all made the same expression.</p><br/><p>\u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Stormhunter Guild!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Stormhunter Guild. One of the representative guilds in all of Warlord. Their presence was akin to stars on the sky for most Warlord players. Now looking directly at them, they could only gasp for air.</p><br/><p>One person.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong with my luck today?\u2019</p><br/><p>The person in the middle of all this, Hyrkan. He was the only one who made an unpleasant rather than surprised expression.</p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

(3)</p><br/><p>5.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Main Scenario Quest was the most important main content in Warlord. \u00a0This was why there was a clear demarcation on when it starts and ends. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why the updates regarding the Main Scenario quest had been put on the System-wide Announcement. \u00a0It updated the Users of the start and end to the Main Scenario Quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had notified everyone of the start and end of the Corrupt Count episode.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then it notified everyone of the start and end to the Immoral Prince episode.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the 5th such Announcement had been sent out, and it shook the foundation of Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, any news regarding Warlord shook the online world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The third Main Scenario Quest has just started! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Finally, it begins! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Is the 2nd Advancement going to be released?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Something seems a bit off this time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This Main Scenario Quest was different from the ones before. \u00a0The game had been clear in spreading the name of the User that had opened up this new era.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- So who the hell is Hyrkan? \u00a0Which 30 great guild is he in?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His name was Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 You dolt! \u00a0That's the Hahoe Mask's character name!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 Uh? \u00a0The Hahoe Mask was named Hyrkan?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 The Hahoe Mask's name isn't the Hahoe Mask? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 Wasn't it Huh-Maeung? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The User called the Hahoe Mask was known more by the nickname he had created than his actual character name.</span></p><br/><p>6.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a small tunnel that a person could barely pass through. \u00a0He had left behind Nero as he headed towards the decisive battle. \u00a0As he was passing through the tunnel, Hyrkan became flustered for a moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018My god.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had become the main character that heralded the start of the Ruined Kingdom episode. \u00a0Of course, it was something he had always wanted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this should have occurred at the peak of the Urugal mountain. \u00a0It shouldn't have happened right now. \u00a0It should have happened when he caught the fire breathing Slime Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018\u2026\u2026the Frozen Kingdom and the Urugal mountain range. \u00a0The key was placed in two locations?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t as if he didn't understand the concept behind it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Originally, Warlord's Main Scenario Quest had many roads that led to a single destination. \u00a0The event that triggered the Ruined Kingdom episode in the Urugal mountain range may have just been one of several methods one could have used. \u00a0The probability that there were multiple trigger points rather than one was high.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It just meant that the Stormhunters hadn't been able to find the clue located in the Frozen Kingdom. \u00a0In the meanwhile, someone else had succeeded in climbing the Urugal mountain range.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit. \u00a0Did I perhaps change the content of the Main Scenario quest? \u00a0It seems a lot of Quest independent of the Ruined Kingdom episode was released too.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This hadn't been a ploy hatched by someone else. \u00a0Hyrkan's own hands had changed the events, and he couldn't blame anyone for what happened from now on. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is driving me nuts.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Ruined Kingdom was Hyrkan's last chance. \u00a0After the Ruined Kingdom episode, the Dragon's Army episode would start. \u00a0He didn't have much knowledge about what would happen there. \u00a0When the Dragon's Army episode was starting to get interesting, a grudge formed between the Hahoe Mask guild and the Stormhunters guild . \u00a0No, it wasn't a grudge between the guilds. \u00a0Only Hyrkan had been excised and thrown away. \u00a0Then he was crushed without mercy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan shut his mouth tight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'm guessing the larger framework won\u2019t change\u2026\u2026.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For the first time, he checked the exact content of the Quest given to him by Nero.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Quest Window formed inside the dark space.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Kingdom's Revenge] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Quest Rank : Epic</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Quest level Range : Over 195</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Quest Content : To save the the beings suffering under the Frost Dragon's curse, defeat the Frost Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Quest Reward : Ancient Power \u2018Frost\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan's mishap came to a pause. \u00a0He stopped walking. \u00a0Until now, this was the most forceful stop he had taken.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan stood there for over one minute. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFrost?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he stood still, a short word came out of Hyrkan's mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Eventually, he repeated the short word.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFrost!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since he started Warlord, Hyrkan uttered the strongest exclamation he had ever spoken.</span></p><br/><p>7.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ancient Power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the core content that permeated the Ruined Kingdom episode. \u00a0It was judged to be the greatest content in the Ruined Kingdom episode. \u00a0It was the crux of the Skill Enhancement System.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Through the Ruined Kingdom episode, the Users would be able to find relics of the Ruined Kingdom, which was crumbling away... \u00a0One could find traces of castles, dungeons and the hidden mysteries. \u00a0One would be able to gain the Ancient Power through various quests.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, there were different ranks to the Ancient Power one could obtain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was the Transcendent Rank that would allow one to strengthen the rank of a Skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was the Legend Rank, which added a special ability to the Skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then there was the Mythos Rank where a Class ability was added.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Amongst these three, the Transcendent Rank was the least difficult to obtain. \u00a0It was something the light Users would be able to gain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Legend Rank would need a good amount of work to obtain for the light Users, but if one was dedicated, it could be earned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the Mytho Rank was impossible to get through will and determination. \u00a0Basically, it wasn't a content for the light Users. \u00a0This was a content for those that consumed the game too fast... \u00a0From the game's perspective, it was for the Users that disgusted the game developers. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a basically a content that said, 'Let's see if you bastards can beat this!'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem wasn't that it was simply difficult. \u00a0It was complex. \u00a0One had to discover various Quests, and one had to complete it all. \u00a0One had to travel to various location in this vast world of Warlord, and one had to gather Ingredients that could only be obtained by the User. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, no one had attempted it yet, so Hyrkan would be a pioneer. \u00a0As expected of someone, who had opened up this new era, he would be achieving these accomplishments first! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason why he was doing all of this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan didn't have to worry about coexisting with anyone else in the Ruined Kingdom Episode. \u00a0He didn't even keep the idea of coexistence inside his mind. \u00a0This was the reason why he had insisted on a monopoly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he went through the standard procedure, he would have to give up leveling up for two to three months to earn the Mythos Rank power. \u00a0He would have to focus solely on the quests. \u00a0However, the Ruined Kingdom episode of the Main Scenario Quest gave the Mythos Rank Ancient Power through the Quest Reward. \u00a0Of course, there was a caveat that it was only a reward if he was able to get the Quest Reward before all the other Users in Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Hyrkan knew of 5 types of Mythos Rank Ancient Power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Frost, Flame, Thunder, Darkness and Radiance. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Hyrkan developed a profound interest for the game, this was the extent of information that had been made available to him. \u00a0At the time, there were only two hundred Users that possessed all 5 Mythos Ranked Ancient Power. \u00a0It wasn't a lot of people. \u00a0It was one year after the Ruined Kingdom and the Skill Enhancement system had been released, yet only two hundred Users had gained the power in a population of millions. \u00a0Moreover, only two hundred people had it amongst the people, who had dedicated their lives to this game. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hyrkan hadn't been one of them. \u00a0He couldn't even dream about obtaining it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan had the chance to obtain one of this Ancient Power right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is weird. \u00a0The Ancient Power reward for climbing to the top of the Urugal mountain was a Legendary Rank.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was his chance to to obtain the Ancient Power of Frost.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a surprising opportunity, but on the other hand, he felt a very deep apprehension towards it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018So why would the Mythos Rank suddenly show up here....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, his apprehension didn't last long.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Frost\u2026\u2026.\u2019 \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026wow.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had thought about obtaining the Mytho Rank Ancient Power. \u00a0However, he never would have expected to obtain it this way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Hyrkan wasn't afraid of the change. \u00a0This wasn't the time to be afraid of the change.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to seize it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan estimated how much time had passed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had expended more time than expected, because of Nero. \u00a0However, he didn't need to take a break by logging out. \u00a0On the contrary, this was the perfect time to do this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018No matter what.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, it was like the time he had faced the Immoral Prince and Argardo.... \u00a0No, he found a purpose that exceeded the one he had from before. \u00a0He had found a purpose that was worth putting everything on the line on this battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to catch it no matter what..\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan started running after he exited the secret tunnel leading to Nero.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-ha-ha-ha!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He headed towards the Frozen Throne where the Frost Knight ruled from!</span></p><br/><p>8.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if the throne had been carved out of an enormous ice. \u00a0There was a knight wearing a massive armor that was made out of semi-transparent ice. \u00a0It filled up the massive throne. \u00a0Each decoration on its armor looked to have be sculpted by hand, and it was an extraordinary sight. \u00a0It held the pattern of dragon scales, and it looked as if it was about to come alive. \u00a0The helmet was reminiscent of a Dragon's horn, and one could see a pale and frozen face beneath the helmet. \u00a0It was an ogre with frightening looking teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Frost Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was in charge of maintaining the Frost Dragon's curse. \u00a0Its enemy had arrived right in front of it, yet it didn't even bother getting up from the throne.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis place had been judged by the being that is great yet harsh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It sounded ancient and grave.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow are you dirty this place.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It started to move slowly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis place had committed disrespect\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It spoke slowly as it clearly enunciated each word.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt will repay the transgression through eternal servitude.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if it had said all it had to say, the Frost Knight slowly got up from its seat. \u00a0The process of it standing up wasn't easy, simple, or brief.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zzuh-juh-juhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Frost Knight's body had become one with the frozen throne. \u00a0As it stood up, one could hear the sound of ice shattering. \u00a0One could even see cracks form on the throne. \u00a0How long had it sat there frozen to the throne? \u00a0It made one wonder if the Frost Knight had never gotten up even once after taking seat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The bastard talks too much.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan faced the Frost Knight. \u00a0At that moment he had to defeat it, so the small details didn't register in his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the first place, Hyrkan didn't hold the Frost Knight in any reverence. \u00a0He had entered the newly liberated region ruled by the Frost Knight with a do or die attitude.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want those laughable cursed beings to wake up.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan said those determined words inside his head. \u00a0He was more coldly focused than any other battle he had conducted before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was at a point where he desperately needed to change. \u00a0However, he couldn't half-ass it through fear. \u00a0It would only be to his detriment if he worried over it. \u00a0Thanks to the Stormhunters guild he had learned that shaking from fear would only harm himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan\u2019s gaze looked around his surrounding, and at the same time, he bit down on the Ifrit\u2019s Essence inside his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Ifrit's power is seeping into your entire body.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the snow from the blizzard that had touched Hyrkan's body fell to the floor as water droplets.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, Hyrkan opened both his arms wide as he scattered what he had been holding in his hands. \u00a0The Skeleton Fragments let out a dull sound as they hit the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ooh ooh ooh\u2026\u2026. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Cursed Monsters were summoned by the Frost Knight. \u00a0They let out a low and anguished sound as they got into formation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddul-goo-ruhk, ddul-goo-ruhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Warriors summoned by Hyrkan took form, and they opened their mouths wide as they let out a silent scream towards their enemies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddahk ddahk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The declaration of war was done through Hyrkan's hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Warriors wearing a variety of armors started charging towards the enemies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roo! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During all of this, the Skeleton Magicians had already formed hefty fireballs, and they threw it towards the enemies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fireballs were sent flying towards the group of Cursed Monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zzuh-juhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, an Ice Wall rose up from the ground to block the fireballs. \u00a0Fire impacted on ice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-gwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying a loud sound, the fire and ice fell as it scattered across the ground. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rain of Fire. \u00a0Hail of Ice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Warriors and the Cursed Monsters fought within this shower.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was 30 against a hundred. \u00a0If one was basing it just on numbers, the Skeleton Warriors were at a disadvantage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shweek, shweek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the Skeleton Warriors swiftly evaded the attacks of the Cursed Monsters. \u00a0The advantage from the fact that there were a 100 of Cursed Monsters became nullified.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Warriors had fought the Cursed Monsters for 20 days under Hyrkan's command. \u00a0There was no way the Skeleton Warriors would lose against the Cursed Monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had trained them for this purpose.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I invested 20 days for this day.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He hadn\u2019t been been lax in his actions. \u00a0He hadn\u2019t just been hunting to level up. \u00a0He had trained the Skeleton Warriors up to a point where they could easily defeat the Cursed Monsters. \u00a0In his training, he purposefully made it so that his Skeleton Warriors would have to fight a Cursed Monster in a one-on-one matchup. \u00a0He later increased it to a 3 vs one fight. \u00a0He purposefully allowed the Skeleton Warriors fight at a numerical disadvantage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the solution to the first problem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I blocked the slaves it had cursed..\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he wanted to catch the Frost Knight, there were four obstacles he would have to overcome. \u00a0This was the solution to the first problem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018So the only thing left is.... \u00a0I have to overcome the Frost Fog, Wall of Agony and the Frost Dragon\u2019s Curse.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since he gave a solution to one of the problems, he had to come up with three more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had the three solutions, and he was about to put those answers into motion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPooh-haha!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt joy from just imagining it. \u00a0It was absurd, but he spontaneously let out a laugh. \u00a0He didn\u2019t have to enjoy it through his imagination any more. \u00a0He could \u00a0enjoy it in reality.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat shall we do?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Half way up the Urugal mountain range.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thirty Users were within a cave that had been placed midway up the mountain. \u00a0Their expressions were stiff as they waited for something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you think we should do? \u00a0We have to catch it!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou should it still for a moment.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? What did you just say to me, you traitorous bastard?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow long are you... Whatever. \u00a0Yes. \u00a0I'm the traitor, so I'll keep my mouth shut. \u00a0Of course. \u00a0I'm the traitor, and I did something very wrong. \u00a0How dare I open my mouth? \u00a0I'll keep my impertinent mouth shut.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were the elite members of the Stormhunters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had attempted to fight the owner of the Urugal mountain's peak, and they had failed. \u00a0After experiencing failure, some in the guild mustered up their courage, and they had come up here for another attempt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, at that moment, their leader Shir wasn't giving them an answer as to whether they would be attempting the Raid again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you trying to pick a fight with me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOop oop! Oop oop!

This was mainly done when a Block Field appeared. \u00a0The investigation of the Block Field was more important than the monster hunt. If one was lucky, one could gain hints to the Main Scenario Quest. \u00a0Moreover, one could earn titles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guild also went into hunting grounds where the population of monsters had grown too much. They eliminated the monster, and at times, they effectively controlled the population of monsters for the users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were decisive. \u00a0The guild brought several hundred to a thousand high level Magicians to a hunt. \u00a0With the help of various potions, they poured out their strongest magic at the same time. It was quite a sight, and this could be only seen within Warlord. It could be compared to fireworks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, it was hard to gain anything through such a hunting method. \u00a0It wasn't easy to level up, and the efficiency of the hunt decreased. \u00a0Once they killed all the monsters, they had to wait for the regeneration of the next batch of monsters. \u00a0\u00a0Moreover, it wasn't only the Magicians, who went to these events. \u00a0Numerous Priests and Swordsman users followed to assist the Magicians.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even with all of these disadvantages, the Sweepers guild promoted this concept. \u00a0The reason was the revenue from broadcasting these events. \u00a0They were one of the top 5 in terms of bringing in profit with their footage in the 30 great guilds. \u00a0Their contents were that mesmerizing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the Sweepers Guild puts out an announcement before they commenced their monster cleaning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Blue Mist Forest was found north-east of the Eagle mountain, and we are planning on sweeping it. \u00a0We will give a fixed compensation to the users, who are in the midst of a hunt. \u00a0Thank you for always cheering and helping the Sweepers guild.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the announcement came out, it would have been wise to escape this stage. \u00a0If one died by getting swept up in the magical bombardment, one wouldn\u2019t even be able to collect one\u2019s insurance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, not everyone could choose the wise course of action.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's expression crumpled when he saw the announcement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I thought I would suck on some honey, since not many users were coming towards this place. \u00a0I never expect it to turn sour like this.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Hyrkan was hunting inside the Blue Mist Forest, a decent amount of users had come to the Blue Mist Forest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, amongst all of them, there weren't anyone, who used the Blue Mist Forest as their main hunting ground. \u00a0The difficulty of the hunting ground was too high. The online community had already judged the Blue Mist Forest to be an inefficient hunting ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn't welcoming news to the users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the opposite for the Sweepers Guild. \u00a0This was a boon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now that the Block Field was released, secrets were surely there. \u00a0Since regular users stayed away from coming here, the Sweepers Guild would get very low amount of complaints as they started their cleaning. \u00a0The biggest obstacle in proceeding with a monster cleaning by the Sweepers was the existing users. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the sweep wasn\u2019t going to be easy. \u00a0The Sweepers Guild was one of the 30 great guilds, yet the Blue Mist Forest was infested with level 110+ monsters. \u00a0It would be impossible to clear out the place in one go.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was one thing that was definite. \u00a0Now that the Sweepers guild was on the move the countdown had started for Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was time to turn his resolution into action.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I must have lost my mind.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan questioned himself as he ran through the fog.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kooh-uhhhh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A Smogrian suddenly appeared in front of Hyrkan. \u00a0Its arms were like sharp blades, and they were swung towards Hyrkan. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan wasn't surprised by its appearance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hweeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead, he easily dodge its arms, and he ran past as he stabbed the Smogrian on its side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-kahk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While he was doing so, Hyrkan quickly swung his sword to separate its upper and lower body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A crumbling sound was heard instead of a slicing sound as the Smogrian was sliced in half.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kooh-uh, kooh-uh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was cut in half, but its arms and legs were still moving. \u00a0It immediately opened its mouth, and it let out a horrible shriek towards Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He looked at the scene from the corner of his eyes, and Hyrkan clicked his tongue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I must have lost my mind.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan once again \u00a0questioned himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His gaze had moved past the Smogrian he had cut in half, and it headed towards the far back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The thick fog was limiting his vision, so he couldn't confirm it with his sight. \u00a0However, the shimmer of numerous Smogrians flickered in front of Hyrkan's eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I must have lost my mind.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the third time he questioned himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He made a resolution to cut through the Blue Mist Forest, so he had immediately turned his resolution into action. \u00a0At first, it wasn't that hard. \u00a0Smogrians weren't slow, but they weren't fast enough to catch Hyrkan. He had incredible Strength Stat, and he had the Leg Strength Modification(C). \u00a0His ability to run was amazing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he could easily deal with those, who blocked his path. \u00a0He just had to destroy anything that appeared in front of his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was a limit to any course of action! \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had repeatedly ran away, and now he had a significant tail behind his back. If one's tail become sufficiently long enough, it will catch up to you. \u00a0The number of Smogrians following after him had turned into the Rubicon river. \u00a0He couldn't turn back now. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I expected it, but\u2026\u2026.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he had expected something like this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the number of Smogrians converging on him as he headed towards the center was mind boggling. \u00a0It was much more than he expected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018How can there be so many of them?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was so bad that it felt as if he was being swarmed by bugs. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would have understood if there were a lot of user making the Blue Mist Forest as their preferred hunting ground. \u00a0This would increase the number of monster being regenerated. \u00a0However, that wasn't the case at all right now. \u00a0No, even if he took those factors into consideration, there were too many monsters here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It meant there was something special going on with the current situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was it a bug?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What's the cause?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There must be a special reason why the population of monsters here had increased in an explosive manner. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From Hyrkan's perspective, he wished for the latter. \u00a0If it was a bug, this would be endless, and he would eventually get a Game Over.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the change Hyrkan had been hoping for arrived after he had been running for 20 minutes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Huh?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After a certain point, Hyrkan knew something had changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018They aren't following me?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had chased after him as if Hyrkan had killed their parents. \u00a0However, the presence of Smogrians disappeared after a certain point in time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Smogrians had shown up everytime he took a step, but they were all gone now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan turned to look behind him. \u00a0When Hyrkan stopped, he knew the monsters should have caught up to him, but there were none of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Maybe?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hweek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had his suspicions, so he threw a Skeleton Fragment into the distance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After traveling a long distance, the Skeleton Fragment turned into a Skeleton Warrior.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After taking form as a Skeleton Warrior, it slowly walked towards Hyrkan, since there was no battle present. \u00a0It just idled as it stared at Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan flicked his finger twice. the Skeleton Warrior did nothing, but it got into its fighting stance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Would you look at this?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It meant there weren't any monsters nearby. \u00a0Hyrkan tilted his head in puzzlement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What? Then why would it suddenly\u2026\u2026.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, suspicion bloomed within him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's suspicion was answered when he turned his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan caught sight of a black object.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had finally arrived at the location he wanted. \u00a0Hyrkan smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Yes. \u00a0This is it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After regulating his breathing, he immediately checked his consumable items and his own status. \u00a0He had brought a large amount of supply, so he still had a lot of consumable items left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the consumable items he had right now were the ones he received from Pelato. \u00a0These were basically free item, so it tasted really good. \u00a0It felt as if the the items were more effective than it really was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't know what would happen, so he put a Resistance Effect Candy in his mouth as a precaution. \u00a0Afterwards, he shouted out in an overbearing manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's quickly end this! Come at me!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The response to Hyrkan's shout was immediate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You've acquired the Title, 'Person who Encounter the Corrupted Comrade'.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's expression slightly changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Uh?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an announcement for acquiring a Title. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was good news. \u00a0He never expected to suddenly gain a title here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan felt an instinctive threat at the word Corrupted Comrade.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Corrupted Comrade?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had heard those words before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018M...maybe?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The black object revealed itself in front of Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was close to 2 meters tall. \u00a0Its shape was clearly humanoid. \u00a0It wore armor on its lower body, but its upper body was bare. \u00a0His muscular body was sooty, and it looked as if it didn't have any pupils. \u00a0Its eyes were hollow. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, its appearance didn't catch Hyrkan's eyes. \u00a0It held a rusty and plain longsword in its right hand. \u00a0Hyrkan caught sight of a gold ring on its finger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan twitched a finger. \u00a0It was the finger with the Society's Ring equipped on it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFuck.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan let out a sigh, and he started cussing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Corrupted Comrade. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a member of the Secret Society. \u00a0It probably had chased after the Corrupted Power, and it must have gotten caught. \u00a0After numerous torture sessions and experimentation, it had been turned into a monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Truthfully, he didn't mind such backstories. \u00a0The important part was that a member of the Secret Society was his enemy, and the ability it possessed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018A bomb rolled in instead of a pumpkin.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had complete immunity against physical attacks. \u00a0This was ability of the Corrupted Comrade.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pooh-haht! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan swung his golden sword called 'The Sword made out of Golden Mantis' Sickle'. \u00a0It bit into Corrupted Comrade's body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The wound healed each moment as Hyrkan's sword made a cut.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was like cutting water with a sword. \u00a0This wasn\u2019t just about having great regeneration ability.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan clicked his tongue, when his sword couldn't make any wounds. \u00a0He slid past the Corrupted Comrade, and he created some space. \u00a0He had his back turned as he tried to widen his distance from the Corrupted Comrade.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ooh-uhhhhhh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he turned his body, Hyrkan felt the presence of the Corrupted Comrade. \u00a0It had already closed the distance. \u00a0It swung its sword as it let out a frightening sound.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was swung from top to bottom. \u00a0It couldn't even be called a sword swing. \u00a0It brought down the sword without any form.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was really fast.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was having a hard time dodging. \u00a0He had to hold his sword horizontally to block the strike!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The rough clang of steel rang out, and Hyrkan's feet was pressed into the ground. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had a unique sword that was so well known for its attack and durability that it was nicknamed as 'The Gangster'. \u00a0If he had a lame level 100 Rare rank Sword, it would have been shattered into pieces by this blow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how fast and strong the attack of the Corrupted Comrade was. \u00a0Hyrkan was barely able to fight it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Skeleton Warriors won't work.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In other words, he couldn't use the Skeleton Warriors to buy time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If it was the Skeleton Knight or the Golem, they would be able to buy him some time. \u00a0However, buying time was the only thing they could do. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he fought a monster to just buy time, he would just regret it at the end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Hyrkan needed some other answer to this problem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Choooong! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was face to face with the Corrupted Comrade. \u00a0Hyrkan slid its sword away. \u00a0This created enough time for him to back away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahjeeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Corrupted Comrade's sword embedded itself on the ground Hyrkan had been standing on. \u00a0During all of this, Hyrkan threw a Skeleton Fragment into the distance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Fragment turned into a Skeleton Magician.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the answer. \u00a0If it was invulnerable to physical attack, he had to get rid of it with magic!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this wasn't a full solution. \u00a0However, this was a critical part in coming up with an answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan took a deep breath.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the effort and practice he had done in secret flashed through his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he returned to the past, Hyrkan had made a promise to himself. \u00a0He'll do everything by himself, and he would reap the benefits all by himself!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hykran had a lot of homework he needed to finish before he could achieve that goal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One was finding out a way to defeat a monster, who couldn't be harmed through physical means.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was only one solution. \u00a0He had no choice, but to develop a magical attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His best option was to learn attack magic like a proper magician. However, unless he wanted to put all his effort into magic, his efforts would be useless.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if he bought Skill Books with money, his limitations would be evident unless he was able to rank the magic up to a High Rank Magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only magical attack he could use was the Bone Explosives. \u00a0Then there was the Skeleton Magicians. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Bone Explosives were powerful, but expensive. \u00a0There was also a limit to how many he could use. \u00a0It was suitable as an aid for damage dealing, but it was impossible to use it as one's main attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So there was only one option left, and it was the Skeleton Magicians. \u00a0Unexpectedly, the attack of the Skeleton Magicians were quite high . \u00a0As the Skeleton Magician's rank increases, the power of the magic increased. \u00a0If it received the buff from the Skeleton Knight and the Skeleton Science, the damage would increase further. \u00a0If he could gain a Skill related to Skeleton Magicians, than their magic could become very powerful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the problem was in how to use them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unlike the Skeleton warriors, he couldn't train the Skeleton Magicians to act as he wanted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the Skeleton Magicians had to recognize his attack pattern first. \u00a0Then they would be able to move in sync with Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was what he had worked on in practice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He learned how to dance with a monster, while the Skeleton Magician was watching! \u00a0The fruition of his practice could be seen right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puh-uhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The magic thrown by the Skeleton Magician stuck to the back of the Corrupted Comrade. \u00a0It started to burn, and the body melted. \u00a0However, the flame disappeared after a little while. Still, the efficacy of the attack was apparent. \u00a0It had instant recovered after Hyrkan's sword strike, but this wound wasn't closing easily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-uhhhhh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Corrupted Comrade immediately glared at the Skeleton Magician.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pook! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan stabbed his sword into its body to get the attention of the Corrupted Comrade.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pook! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he stabbed one more time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It hadn't received any damage, but it focused its attention back towards Hyrkan once again. \u00a0It swung its sword towards Hyrkan. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shweeeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan barely avoided the sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hooohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan couldn't avoid the second high to low strike.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He blocked with his sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan gritted his teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'll move 5 steps to switch location.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was barely able to untangle himself from the face to face deadlock, then he moved 5 steps. \u00a0He didn't simply move backwards. \u00a0He switched position. \u00a0The Corrupted Comarde moved with Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two of them stood there as they clashed swords once again </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puh-uhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Magician's magic hit a bull's eye on the Corrupted Comrade's back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Hyrkan hadn't moved, the Magic spell would have landed between Hyrkan and the Corrupted Comrade.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan didn't have any time to rest. \u00a0He was busy trying to draw the aggro of the Corrupted Comrade after they ended their standoff.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'If I die from being hit by my Skeleton Magician's magic, I would have to quit Warlord from the embarrassment I would feel.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If other users had the chance to see what was going on.... If the audience was the skilled users of Warlord, they would have been shocked instead of being impressed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan looked like a shooting game expert, where one was dodging missiles flying in from all directions. \u00a0He was on the level of an expert, who could turn the tables by guiding missiles towards the enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to repeat this action continuously, and the timing was difficult that it made one feel faint.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This couldn't be achieved only by practising.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan wasn\u2019t good at anything in real life. \u00a0Even though, he was an insignificant being, he was very talented at Warlord. \u00a0His potential couldn't be compare to anyone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018All right. \u00a0I got the feel of it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that point, Hyrkan summoned an additional Skeleton Magician.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Let's double the pace.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the moment when one of the most popular video of Hyrkan was born. \u00a0The video was called 'The Waltz'.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

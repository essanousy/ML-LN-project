This was a difficult stage where a User had to be at least a certain level to play here. Moreover, the Evil Eyes appeared intermittently. If one wanted to block the Evil Eye's Curse, one had to finish the Quest to get 'Sarabo's Charm'. \u00a0Even Users well over level 140 were ruthlessly sent back to reality if one didn't have 'Sarabo's Charm'.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, this location didn't drop really good Items, and the EXP wasn't that great considering the difficulty of the Voodoo Chimera hunt. \u00a0The method to clearing the Voodoo Chimera was still under research.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From that perspective, this was really a cursed place for high level Users, who sought efficiency in their hunts. \u00a0They should have had no reason or interest in stepping onto this stage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there were an unusual amount of high level users hanging around the Cursed Domain. \u00a0These Users were all over level 140.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat's the status of the Quests?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere's definitely a variety of Quests here compared to other locations. \u00a0There are more Search Quests and Commission Quests compared to the simple Hunt Quests.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the Noopy Family arrived at the Cursed Castle, a branch office of the Subjugation Association was established inside the Cursed Castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, the Cursed Castle received a respectable name called Heuban's Castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The NPC related to the Subjugation Association revealed new NPCs that started to fill up the Heuban's Castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason why the Users were coming here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">New NPCs had appeared. \u00a0New Quests meant opportunity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Cursed Domain was the land of opportunity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was what the Cursed Castle had turned into.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan arrived at the Heuban's Castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho is that?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Sword Class User over there.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou mean the Swordsman wearing the Rusted Steel set? \u00a0Who cares? Isn't the Rusted Steel set a level 90 defensive set? \u00a0Maybe he came here to sightsee. \u00a0Don't pay attention to him.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He came in secret.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He hadn't worn his custom Red Skeleton set given to him by his unknown benefactor. \u00a0He wore the defensive gear that had been previously equipped by his Skeleton. \u00a0He had appeared with his identity hidden.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was simple reason why he had hidden his identity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I'm following the map correctly, the Secret Entrance should be over there.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason why he had hidden his identity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maeung had given Hyrkan a map that showed where the secret Dungeon was located beneath the Cursed Castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was described as being a secret region of the castle, but it was basically a Dungeon. \u00a0This was an obvious thing to say, but it wouldn't be great if this information was leaked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the Users that were operating out of the Cursed Castle right now were like demons, who knew the ins and out of Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Users were here on the off chance that an unexpected opportunity might pop up. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Hyrkan operated in this region as the Hahoe Mask, he would be like a mother duck with its ducklings following after it. \u00a0He'll have a large tail of Users following after him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways, Hyrkan's effort had been a success. \u00a0None of the Users within the Cursed Castle paid any attention to him. \u00a0This expedited his progress in getting to his destination.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Uh?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, something had suddenly attracted Hyrkan's attention.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a statue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a statue of several Users in a heroic pose. \u00a0They were the four heroes, who had killed the first Evil Eye. They had also reached the Cursed Castle first. \u00a0The Subjugation Association had created a statue of the Noopy Family.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the Noopy family had more or less stolen the Sarabo's Sword from under him. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Options on that Item was killer.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Options for the Sarabo's Sword had been immediately posted online. Hyrkan gritted his teeth when he thought about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As a level 140 Unique Rank Item, the Sarabo's Sword had great Options. \u00a0At the same time, the Item was tradeable, and it was high in scarcity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he had sold it for a high price, he would have been able to make some eye-popping amount of money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If it hadn't been for that son of a bitch...\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Sinclair hadn't interfered, the Item would have been in the possession of Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he thought about the situation, it made his inside burn even if he was inside the game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan shook his head from side to side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I get a little bit stronger, I'll keep hunting him down until this game closes it service.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He made a resolution as he shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Please let there be something amazing in this Dungeon.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He prayed earnestly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan\u2019s thoughts were very busy in many aspects.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ceiling of the pitch black tunnel fell. \u00a0When the bricks forming the ceiling hit the ground, the rugged sound rang out. As if he was trying to quell the rugged sound from ringing out, a person fell through the ceiling! \u00a0He let out a minimum amount of sound as he landed, and he immediately manipulated the watch on his wrist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSlot on.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He yelled out a short phrase.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The armor made out of red bones appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The owner of the Red Skeleton set was Hyrkan. \u00a0After he finished the Item Switching, he held his breath as he listened to his surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There's nothing nearby.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, he didn't hear anything out of the ordinary.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Afterwards, Hyrkan let out a complaint.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Why isn't there any Announcements? Usually there should be an Announcement regarding a User entering the Dungeon. \u00a0Where's the announcement for the Titles?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan turned on the light app on his wrist watch after he complained couple more times.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Paht! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The light source was small, but the powerful light illuminated the surrounding. \u00a0It allowed Hyrkan to be able to estimate the size of the tunnel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The tunnel was quite large. \u00a0From the floor to the ceiling, there was a distance of about 3 meters. \u00a0The width was slightly less than 5 meters. \u00a0Most family cars could drive through this tunnel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'm pretty sure I'm at the right place....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was relieved when he saw the size of the tunnel. A tunnel of this size wouldn\u2019t be used as an escape tunnel. \u00a0This meant this tunnel was built for a different purpose.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan stealthily took out a single Skeleton Fragment. \u00a0He summoned the Skeleton Knight. \u00a0As soon as he summoned it, Hyrkan placed the light app on top of the Skeleton Knight's head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Knight had become a walking light bulb. \u00a0Hyrkan decided to reward his Skeleton Knight. \u00a0He activated the Madness Helm then he summoned the Bone Armor. \u00a0He also placed Curses on the sword being held by the Skeleton Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How long had he been walking?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018All right.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The material making up the tunnel had changed, then a straight road suddenly appeared. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan could sense something had changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You've entered the Dungeon 'Catacombs'.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You've earned the title \u2018Visitor of the Catacombs\u2019.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You've earned the title \u2018Awakened from Slumber\u2019.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Announcements he heard immediately confirmed his suspicions. \u00a0A smile formed on Hyrkan's lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Yes. This is it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time as the Announcements, a noise intruded into the quiet space.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddul-goo-ruhk, ddul-goo-ruhk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan heard a very familiar sound.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The smile on Hyrkan's lips shited in an odd way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What the hell?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Eventually, a skeletal version of a Voodoo Chimera appeared in front of the Skeleton Knight. \u00a0It was none other than the Chimera Skeleton. The smile around Hyrkan's lips turned into a sneer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Would you look at this?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was rusty, but the Chimera Skeleton was fully equipped. \u00a0The Chimera Skeleton had a presence couldn't be ignored.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, there were two of them. \u00a0It felt as if the tunnel was packed, and it inevitably increased the pressure given off by the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he had been a normal User, he would have been nervous in this situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the monsters were laughable to Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Who do you think I am? \u00a0How dare a Skeleton show themselves in front of me!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan didn't summon any additional additional Skeleton Warriors or Magicians. \u00a0He didn't even summon his Golem. He spoke in a low voice as he stood behind the Skeleton Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you get killed by such opponents, get ready to dodge my fists every day in training when I summon you the next time.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if the Skeleton Knight understood what had been said by Hyrkan. \u00a0The Skeleton Knight opened its mouth wider than usual, and it unhesitatingly charged towards its enemies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's Skeleton Knight skill was Rank C. It was a case where the Rank was rising much faster than Hyrkan's level. \u00a0It was evidence that the Skeleton Knight had performed more brilliantly than he had expected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, every one of his summoned Skeletons were influenced by the Rank A Skeleton Science skill. \u00a0It increased all stats of the Skeleton by 30%. \u00a0On top of that, the Skeleton Knight was using the Madness Helm skill. \u00a0The Rank A Madness Helm had the effect of increasing all stats by 30%.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn't end there. \u00a0There was something else that could also be used by the Skeleton Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the Rank A Bone Armor. \u00a0A layer of sturdy Bone Armor protected the Skeleton Knight's entire body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the Bone Armor was inferior to Rare Rank defensive sets.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the Rank A Armament skill allowed Hyrkan to equip the Skeleton Knight with the Clear Spider set and the Gargoyle Knight's sword. The Bone Armor was like a coating laminated over steel. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the finishing stroke, Hyrkan had trained his Skeletons everyday whenever he had some spare time. This allowed the Skeleton Warriors to be able to dodge Hyrkan's attack, who boasted a higher Strength stat than a Swordsman class. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were the reasons why Hyrkan's pride wouldn't let his Skeleton Knight lose to a similarly equipped Skeleton monsters. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. That's right! Drill him!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Knight was defending Hyrkan's pride. \u00a0The Skeleton Knight cornered the two Chimera Skeletons, who were blocking the tunnel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hweeeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the small space, the Skeleton Knight easily dodged the halberds swung by the Chimera Skeletons. \u00a0The Skeleton Knight immediately swung its petrified sword towards the Chimera Skeleton's armor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The one-sided attack continued, and the Chimera Skeleton's armor was turned into junk. \u00a0The only thing left was to trash the Chimera Skeleton's body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From the back, Hyrkan touched his Bone Explosives and Skeleton Fragments.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sight in front of Hyrkan was satisfying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018My hard labor was worth it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt akin to your kid getting into a named university. \u00a0He truly felt that way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, he gained confidence. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'm better than Rich Lich.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was confident in that statement now. Hyrkan had built himself up to a point where he had jumped over his role model, Rich Lich.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only thing he was lacking was funds. \u00a0If he had the funds, Hyrkan could do everything that had been shown to him by Rich Lich.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Yes. \u00a0All I need is money.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, money was the source of his biggest problem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I had money, nothing would be impossible in the first place.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was like a parent with a child, who was about to enter into college. \u00a0He felt a feeling akin to a parent worrying about the school tuition.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was growing at an incredibly fast pace. He didn't have to worry about the front-runners anymore. Several Users suspected the secret to the ridiculous fighting abilities of the Skeleton Warriors. \u00a0They were attempting to grow a Necromancer like the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0However, Hyrkan didn't feel threatened by them. \u00a0He wouldn't have to worry about any of them unless someone gets hit by a truck and that someone is sent back into the past.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was the fact that Hyrkan would truly be competing against talented individuals, who had dedicated their lives to Warlord. \u00a0He would have to compete again those who achieved a lot in this game through their effort and talent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the market for the Items he would use will change now. \u00a0If Hyrkan wanted to get the best quality Items befitting his level, his funds would be inadequate to the task.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if he did have the funds, he would run into those, who would halt a deal, because of who he was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When his train of thought reached that point, Hyrkan's expression cooled off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His Skeleton Knight's performance had heated up his heart, but now it had cooled off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His cooled heart directed Hyrkan's hand to move. \u00a0Hyrkan took out several Skeleton Fragments, and he threw it over the Chimera Skeletons. The Skeleton Warriors formed behind the Chimera Skeletons. \u00a0They opened their mouth wide as they waited for his command.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan flicked his finger twice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if the Skeleton Warriors were trying to console their master, they leapt into action.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

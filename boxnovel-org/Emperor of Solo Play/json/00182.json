How do you know if I lied or not! \u00a0I really saw it a hundred times!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were making a big fuss.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan was satisfied by their reaction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had wanted to elicit the reaction he was seeing from the two of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan turned to look at Whistling as the two continued their antic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan looked at Whistling as if to say, \u2018This is the reaction you should be having instead of snorting!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Whistling read Hyrkan\u2019s countenance and message, he shook his head from side to side before he looked away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What an amazing guy.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling turned his gaze away, and he forced down his exclamation. \u00a0He shoved it down his throat. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He held it in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I never expected him to really win against the Big Smiles guild\u2026.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask and the Big Smiles guild had collided. \u00a0The public decided to copy the Hahoe Mask\u2019s title for his video, and the incident was now called the Giant Killing. \u00a0A week had passed since the incident. \u00a0However, the people of Warlord was still having a trouble digesting the reality of the incident. \u00a0This was how shocking this incident was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahoe Mask always took on impossible challenges, and he brought the impossible into reality. \u00a0This was why people were fanatical about him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this incident was on a whole different dimension compared to anything the Hahoe Mask had pulled off before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A tectonic shift had occurred.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying the tectonic shift in a land where the 30 great guilds existed, a 31st power had appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, in the past, the Hahoe Mask and the 30 great guilds\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their relationship could only be described as an ill-fated relationship. \u00a0However, Hyrkan had been able to declare a war against the Big Smiles guild, and he had won. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had achieved victory when he had crossed the Terube castle wall to gain the rights to explore the Northland. \u00a0He was also the first one to find the Frozen Kingdom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, all his previous victories were the result of a spontaneous battles. \u00a0At the time, the Northland Exploration team of the Big Smiles weren\u2019t part of the main force. \u00a0Killer Sinclair was part of the main force, but he had been ambushed by the Hahoe Mask after fighting a fierce battle with the Second Head Sohank. \u00a0So this event hadn\u2019t been taken seriously.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What about the most recent event? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask had gone after the heart of the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0The Big Smiles guild had gathered most of their elite Users, and they had even set up their own stage. \u00a0They had used a bait to lure the Hahoe Mask, and they had had put their best foot forward in this attempt. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, they hadn\u2019t been able to catch the Hahoe Mask, and they had suffered a loss to more than half their forces in trying to catch a single User.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, there was a portion of the population that had rejected this narrative.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask had run away, so wouldn\u2019t the winner be the Big Smiles guild? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the answer to that question was quite simple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one wanted to know the result of the war, one just have to look at the status of the winner and the loser. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The winner would receive acclamation, and the loser had no words to say in excuse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask\u2019s acclamation came in the form of views. \u00a0The Giant Killing video had already recorded 300 million views. \u00a0On the other hand, the Big Smiles guild refused to respond or give an official statement regarding the issue. \u00a0They kept their mouths shut.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was ridiculous for a third party to discuss as to who was the winner and the loser.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask had done something incredible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How was this possible? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even after watching the video released by Hyrkan, people were having a hard time believing it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, when they started accepting as truth, the next logical question was posed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7so why did this occur?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Users slowly started to pose the question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why did the Hahoe Mask and the Big Smiles guild go to war?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The aftereffect created by the war with Hyrkan was now being felt by the Big Smiles guild and the other 30 great guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">None of the 30 great guilds were able to give an official statement regarding the event. \u00a0In such an unheard of situation, the mighty 30 great guilds were dismayed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling didn\u2019t think the feeling of dismay would work in Hyrkan\u2019s favor. \u00a0The 30 great guilds would now look at Hyrkan as a competitor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t just a loose nail one had to worry about stepping on. \u00a0He would be viewed as a morningstar that could bludgeon them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They would try to keep him in check instead of cooperating with him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, at the same time, the 30 great guilds couldn\u2019t rashly attack the Hahoe Mask either.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was now a peer of the 30 great guilds, and they would have to treat him accordingly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What is he pursuing?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan didn\u2019t have to travel this road. \u00a0This road was very far from guaranteeing wealth and fame.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling knew this better than anyone. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask had been untroubled when they had parted before. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask had already set his course. \u00a0It meant everything up to now had been planned by him, and he had been pursuing this result. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So why did Hyrkan choose to walk on this particular path?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling pushed down the mounting questions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the previous exchange, he had snorted towards Hyrkan as he pushed downed his exclamation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was his friend.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he could ask questions about Hyrkan\u2019s motivations, but it wasn\u2019t the time to do so. \u00a0This was a conversation that should happen over a beer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For now, he just had to keep his mouth shut, and help his friend in any way he could. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, this was also the reason why this meeting was scheduled. \u00a0He was here to help Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAnyways, I heard you earned the Quest Reward for Elven Kingdom Relic Quest.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhen we received the Seed of the Record Tree from the Den of the Rebels, we immediately exchanged it for the reward. \u00a0We brought it back with us.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, their Quest didn\u2019t match up with Hyrkan\u2019s Quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan would have to go to the Red Desert again to meet the Red Elf tribe. \u00a0If he wanted to do so, he needed the Artifact. \u00a0It was an Artifact from the Barley Kingdom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, Yojori and Joba had received the Artifact of the Barley Kingdom as a reward for their Quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why this meeting had been set up. \u00a0They wanted to help Hyrkan progress in his Quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo you are saying you will travel with me\u2026. \u00a0Will that be ok?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that point, Hyrkan gave up on asking the reason behind their actions. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unless Hydra guild was dumb, they would have already figured out why Whistling was killed in the Highwood Forest by the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They probably knew Whistling had met with the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Hyrkan was in the Hydra guild\u2019s shoes, he would have given the order barring any contact with the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would have asked them to leave the guild if this order wasn\u2019t followed. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Whistling, Yojori and Joba had \u00a0similar personalities. \u00a0They could easily choose to leave the guild, yet Hyrkan didn\u2019t want them to suffer so much.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we won\u2019t be able to travel with you. \u00a0We are under orders from our guild.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as he guessed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be sorry.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan nodded his head as if this was the preferable course of action. \u00a0Since he had gained a hint for his Quest, he had gained a lot in this venture. \u00a0If needed, he could follow the line of Quests being progressed by the Whistling Family.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This would naturally allow him to received the Artifact of the Barley Kingdom as a reward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs for the Quest information\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had planned on purchasing the Quest Information from them. \u00a0He wanted this to be a clean transaction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is why we had a discussion amongst ourselves. \u00a0This Item is unbound. \u00a0We\u2019ll just give this to you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Huh?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan stopped speaking, and before Hyrkan could react in surprise, Joba brought out an Item from a pouch on his waist. \u00a0It was a lump of gold. \u00a0He took out a Gold Bar that was as big as his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan became surprised at the appearance of the Gold Bar, and he became much more surprised when he heard this Item would be given to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is the Artifact. \u00a0If you activate the Item Info Window, it will identify itself as the Artifact of the Barley Kingdom.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo, wait a moment. \u00a0You are just giving this to me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan rephrased his words as he continued to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you sure you can just give this to me? \u00a0What about your next Quest? \u00a0I\u2019m pretty sure you guys need this Item.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a Quest Reward. This was needed to progress into the next Quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they wanted to meet the Red Elf tribe, they would need this Item, yet they were just going to give it to him? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAnyways, we don\u2019t have the strength needed to go meet the Red Elf tribe.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe can go do another Quest. \u00a0There are many more Elves out there.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After looking at the two, Hyrkan turned to look at Whistling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling spoke to Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you for avenging me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling\u2019s words were short. \u00a0Hyrkan struggled with his thoughts for a moment before he grabbed the Gold Bar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0If someone messes with you guys again, tell me about it. \u00a0As I\u2019ve said before, I\u2019m really good at what I do.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn\u2019t a trade. \u00a0They had helped him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan accepted it.</span></p><br/><p>3.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the incident, the Big Smiles guild didn\u2019t talk about the incident. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even the normal guild members of the Big Smiles guild didn't know the details of what had occurred. \u00a0However, stories started to spread through word of mouth. \u00a0Moreover, the word of their defeated started to spread too.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid we really lose?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis makes no sense. \u00a0There were over 50 Users with an average of level 220, and we even used a bait yet we lost\u2026..\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMoreover, this happened at the Highwood Forest. \u00a0That region is ours! \u00a0I can understand being defeated in the Red Desert, but how could we not kill the Hahoe Mask inside the Highwood Forest?

There had to be a basic sense of completeness for one to enjoy these kinds of games, and there were several games that were able to compete with Warlord by fulfilling this prerequisite. \u00a0Moreover, there were some aspects of these games that were superior to Warlord. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These games weren't able to increase their base population as quickly as Warlord, but they were successful in getting a large following. \u00a0However, none of these games could reach a point where ridiculous money was being exchanged within. \u00a0There weren't any games where people went crazy over it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, there will be none that would be able to capture the heart of the people in the future. \u00a0Before Ahn-jaehyun came back to the past, Warlord had been considered a special game. \u00a0It reigned over all games as the special one. \u00a0There was an indescribable quality that existed within Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he thought about the past, he couldn't help, but sneer at himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The craziness right now is to my advantage. \u00a0\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before he returned to the past, this specialness of Warlord had been a pain for him. \u00a0However, it was the opposite now. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Warlord was special, and the Hahoe Mask was special within Warlord. \u00a0Ahn-jaehyun was doing unimaginable feats now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he would achieve greater feats in the future.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun lay dowy down on his mattress, and he immediately put on his V-Gear.</span></p><br/><p>2.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It took over 20 days for Hyrkan to finish his Quest. \u00a0When he returned to the Heard Fortress ruin town, it had developed a decent amount. \u00a0It was hard to call it a town now. \u00a0It was starting to resemble a castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It looks similar to the Cursed Castle.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The transformation of the Heard Fortress ruin town was something he had seen before at the Cursed Castle. \u00a0It was like the Cursed Castle regaining its name of Hiban castle, and the dignity that came with the process. \u00a0Of course, there were several differences one could point out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shouldn\u2019t they be making a statue of me here?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the most important difference in Hyrkan's mind was the absence of a statue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Cursed Statue transformed into the Hiban castle, the game erected a statue for the Noopi Family. \u00a0The Heard Fortress ruin town was able to be established when Hyrkan had defeated Anugas. \u00a0However, the game was showing no signs of erecting a statue for the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he wouldn't get any monetary gain from the formation of a statue. \u00a0However, if they insisted on building one, he wouldn't turn down the opportunity. \u00a0There was no reason why he would hate the idea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTsk.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He actually welcomed such gestures. \u00a0He really liked the idea of leaving behind a permanent presence in this game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since he liked the idea, he felt a sense of disappointment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018They should have made me a park. \u00a0How great would it have been if they erected a statue of me fighting Anugas? \u00a0It would have looked cool and awesome.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Users, who were focused on Hyrkan's presence in the town, would have fainted if they found out about his inner thoughts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahoe Mask! \u00a0Isn't that the Hahoe Mask.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course, it is the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0No one would pretend to be the Hahoe Mask in the Black Continent. \u00a0It would be the end for those, who were caught.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI heard five Users spying on him had their wrists cut off. \u00a0I heard the hands were fed to the Skeletons.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow gruesome.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that the famous Watchman style? \u00a0It is scary.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask was the symbol of fear on the stage of Warlord. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask didn't stand for hope and dream. Hahoe mask was known for taking out monsters and Users, who annoyed him. \u00a0Even if it was a normal User, he was know to be ruthless if you mess with him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The terrifying Hahoe Mask was mumbling about why the Warlord System wasn't building him a statue. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Who would have imagined such a thing?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah, I want a statue of myself.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan left behind the nervous crowd as he headed towards the Subjugation Association.</span></p><br/><p>3.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the Subjugation Association within the Heard Fortress ruin town, there was a stairway leading connecting the 3rd floor to the 4th floor. \u00a0This was a stairway rarely used by Users and NPC, yet someone was using this stairway as a chair. \u00a0He had a book open in his hands, and another book was placed next to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The identity of the User was Hyrkan, and the book was a Skill Book.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Skill Book has revealed itself.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Will you like to learn the Piercing Pocket Skill?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had spent a significant capital in buy this level 190 No Name Skill Book, and the Skill turned out to be the Piercing Pocket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Oh!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was satisfied with the result.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In many ways, this Skill suited Hyrkan the most.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You've learned the Piercing Pocket Skill.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Piercing Pocket] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Proficiency N/A</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Skill Description : You will be able to make space in your body. \u00a0The only storage space once cannot open is at the head and chest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as the Skill description said. \u00a0The Piercing Pocket Skill's effect allowed him to use his body as a pocket or a bag. \u00a0He'll be able to carry much more Items than before, and he didn't have to worry about losing them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Oh right. \u00a0I'm a Lich now.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was only able to learn this Skill, because he was a Lich.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His body was set up as that of a Lich. When he learned the Life Vessel skill, he had basically become an Undead. \u00a0He was immune to Abnormal Status like bleeding. \u00a0On the other hand, Healing type Skills couldn't be used on him. Moreover, the attacks that work against Undead monsters were effective against him too. \u00a0He was treated like an Undead monster in the game. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His naked body was also different from the normal Users. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Like the normal Users, he always had his armor on, so no one knew about it. \u00a0However, Hyrkan's Skin color was patchy since he had used the Skin Sewing Skill. \u00a0A hairy hide was sewn onto his left arm, and his right arm was covered with scale-like skin he took from a reptile. \u00a0He couldn't display his Steel Bones, but his bones were also different from the normal Users. \u00a0Then there were the black tattoos placed all over his body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had such an abnormal body, yet it was about to become something akin to a drawer. \u00a0Users would think him crazy for doing this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even for people who pierced and tattooed their entire body would think he was abnormal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan was satisfied with this fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I peel back the skin over my stomach to reveal a slot full of magic recovery candy... \u00a0Wouldn't I be like Doraemon? \u00a0It'll be awesome. \u00a0Wait a sec. \u00a0Will my belly button be used as a handle? \u00a0What should I do about the handle?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All these Skills made his outer appearance look unsightly, but they were the proof of his strength.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The passive effects that arose from the Skin Sewing and the Black Tattoos allowed him to be as strong as the Swordsman Class. \u00a0Moreover, Skills like Steel Bones allowed him to have strong defense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since he would never hunt with a Priest, these Skills were a boon to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Well, I should now....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan immediately took the second Skill Book into his hands. \u00a0This was the Skill Book he received as a reward for the Archmage Bokan Quest. \u00a0He didn't know the level of the Skill Book, and he also didn't know what Skill it would give.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was time for him to find out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Depending on what came out of the Skill Book, he would have to resolve his next dilemma.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to decide if I should use the Legendary Rank Ancient Power to reinforce this new Skill.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After passing the Ancient King's test, he had opened up the body of the fallen Guardian Knights. \u00a0Their bodies were like vaults, and he had found two boxes within. \u00a0One was a black box, and the other was a red box. \u00a0The black box had a black scroll for the Transcendent Rank Ancient Power. The red box held a red scroll for the Legendary Rank Ancient Power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His dilemma started there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Transcendent Rank Ancient Power increased the performance of a Skill. \u00a0He didn't really have to worry about where to use this one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the Legendary Rank Ancient Power changed the nature of a Skill. \u00a0For example, if one used the Transcendent Rank Ancient Power on the Skeleton Fragment Skill, the Skeleton Warrior's stats and the number of Skeletons able to be summoned would be increased. \u00a0On the other hand, if one used the Legendary Rank Ancient Power, a monster's bone could be used to summon non-bipedal Skeleton Warriors. \u00a0Therefore, one could use a wolf's bone instead of a werewolf's bone to summon the Skeleton Warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he was struggling over the decision.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Legendary Rank Ancient Power was incredibly hard to acquire. \u00a0One had to put in 10 times the effort of acquiring a Transcendent Rank Ancient Power to gain the Legendary Rank Ancient Power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the use of the Skill Enhancement didn't always end as a net positive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To put it simply, it was good to reinforce a skill that was used as often as the Skeleton Fragment Skill. \u00a0However, the result of the reinforcement could bring out surprising results. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would be able to use Skeleton Wolf, Skeleton Bear, and Skeleton Snake as underlings. \u00a0It would amazing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was no other benefit to be gained from it. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why was a Skeleton Warrior so strong?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, the biggest reason why was the Armament Skill. \u00a0Hyrkan was able to equip the Skeleton Warriors with Items that normal Users couldn't even dream about owning. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the Skeleton Wolf, Skeleton Bear, and Skeleton Snake couldn't benefit from effects of the Armament Skill. \u00a0In conclusion, they wouldn\u2019t be able to use weapons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't as if the Skeleton Wolf or the Skeleton Snake could swing a sword by carrying it in its mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead, it would be more useful to use it on the Bone Explosives. \u00a0If one used the Legendary Rank Ancient Power on the Bone Explosive Skill, one gained the Timer function. \u00a0He had much more use for a timed bomb than a regular bomb.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I planned on using it on the Skeleton Knights\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the Skeleton Knight Skill was on top of his list. \u00a0If one used the Legendary Rank Ancient power to reinforce the Skeleton Knight Skill, the Skeleton Knights would learn the Riding Skill. \u00a0Moreover, they would gain Skeleton Steeds. \u00a0They would be able to fight on a mount like the Death Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why his heart was leaning towards reinforcing the Skeleton Knight Skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he didn't have to make the decision right now. \u00a0It wouldn't be too late to decide after seeing what appears from this Skill Book.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shall I open it?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan placed his palm on top of the Skill Book.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Skill Book has revealed itself.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Would you like to learn the Bone Dragon summon skill?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Huh?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Something ridiculous made its appearance.</span></p><br/><p>4.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- It has been a while.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch answered in an indifferent manner when he heard the tired voice of a man.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt has been a while, but I'm not thrilled by this meeting. \u00a0My back still hurts from the time when you stabbed it. \u00a0You asked for our help, yet you used us as bait.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- We all acted in the name of our own interests.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you realize how I was treated after being revealed as the traitor? \u00a0If you knew what I went through, you wouldn't be saying those words.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Do you want my apology?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm not speaking to you, because I want to.

It seem the Main Scenario Quest will come to an end soon. \u00a0I should sell my Tobot Soft stocks.\u2019</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

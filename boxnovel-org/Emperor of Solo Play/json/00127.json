The castle regained its light through the actions of four heroes. \u00a0Afterwards, those equipped with fancy Items filled up the castle. \u00a0A flower had bloomed, and it was named Havanz castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the elegant castle was now stained alongside the White-eyed Knight. \u00a0The Havanz castle's appearance turned more horrifying in appearance than the time it was called the Cursed Castle. A worse sense of despair filled the castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To fight against this despair, stars instead of fancy flowers started to gather.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Users that numbered easily over a thousand was positioned at a location where they could see the Havanz castle. \u00a0This wasn't a village. \u00a0There was no barricades formed here. If one insisted on making a comparison, this was like a massive camping ground or something similar to one. \u00a0In the normal logic of Warlord, this was a dangerous thing to be doing. \u00a0They were basically defenseless against the attacks of monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, none of the Users here were worried. \u00a0The monsters that appeared near Havanz castle was like pocket change or an ice cream dessert that cleansed their palate. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, beings that would freak out even these Users had just appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's been awhile.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A star amongst stars had appeared. \u00a0In fact, there was more than one. \u00a0Two stars had appeared. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m talking to you. Isn't it normal for a person to at least nod their head? Why do you have to behave so coldly towards me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat business do you have with me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was Shir and Chev.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Users of great skill and renown had appeared in front of the Havanz castle for the Argardo Raid. \u00a0However, they paled in comparison to these two. These Users were no longer qualified to play a leading role or a supporting role. They had been turned into spectators in front of these two. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Users focused their attention on the meeting happening between these two.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These two were stars amongst stars. \u00a0Shir and Chev wasn't bother by all the gazes focused on them as they revealed their true colors. Shir was treating Chev in a very cold manner. \u00a0There was no need to act as if they were on good terms. \u00a0Moreover, there was a good reason why they weren't on good terms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm not here for anything too important. \u00a0I checked your number, and you guys are going after us. \u00a0So I decided to greet you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir's expression crumpled at Chev's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason why their already bad relationship had worsened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are here to provoke me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo way.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyone could see that the Argardo Raid was like an exclamation point to the great battle. \u00a0This was why everyone competed with each other to participate in the Argardo Raid. \u00a0The order had been determined through lottery. The Stormhunters were going right after the Red Bulls.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it soured Shir's mood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If it was any other guild than the Red Bulls....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Stormhunters guild was pretty far down the queue. \u00a0Including the Red Bulls, there were a total of four guilds from the 30 great guilds in front of her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, only the Red Bulls was a thorn in her eyes. If other guilds succeed in the Argardo Raid, it would be considered a miracle. \u00a0However, this could be an easy win for the Red Bulls. \u00a0This was how highly she thought of the Red Bulls.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of it all, Chev had come to check up on the situation himself even though their turn wasn\u2019t up yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn\u2019t an attempt by the Red Bulls to use a hot topic to sell more live tickets. \u00a0His actions was meant to say he was going to attempt this as if everything was on the line.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir was here for similar reasons as Chev.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chev had come close to provoking Shir on purpose for similar reasons too.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They weren't competitors that were fighting head to head against each other. \u00a0The two of them had their arrows aimed at the same target. There was no way a cordial atmosphere could blossom in this situation. Instead, sparks were flying between them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone gossiped as they saw this sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess one of those two guilds will succeed.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon't you think Red Bulls have the higher probability to kill it?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's the opposite. \u00a0If the Red Bulls reveal most of their strategy in the Raid, Storm Hunter's success rate would rise significantly.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is a matter of if one will eat first or eat off the floor.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was someone, who was viewing these two Users, with very sharp eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018In the end, the Hahoe Mask made it possible for those two to take flight. \u00a0He did something very troublesome.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair was with the V&amp;V guild. \u00a0He was here as a the member of the Raid party. \u00a0They were going to attempt the Argardo raid in several hours. \u00a0He let out a bitter when he saw the Storm Queen and the Matador appear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was someone observing Sinclair with sharp eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What is that bastard here?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This User was wearing a blandly designed steel armor. His helmet covered his whole face, and he wore a cape. He looked like a typical Swordsman Class type User that one could see everywhere in Warlord. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Hyrkan discovered Sinclair, his heart sank. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is going sideways again. Why the hell is that bastard here with the V&amp;V logo on his chest?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan wasn't here to participate in the Argardo Raid by himself. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Argardo dropped incredible Items. The Argardo Armor set was a level 180 Chronicle Unique Rank Item. The Crying Sword was a level 180 Chronicle Epic Item. The two Items could be used until mid level 200s. The weapon was a very good one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it would be difficult for Hyrkan to gain this weapon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit. It won't be easy to join as the third wheel.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Argardo Raid couldn't be soloed. If he only had to fight Argardo, Hyrkan would have attempted the Raid already. Of course, his chances wouldn\u2019t be great.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem with the Argardo Raid was the fact that this wasn\u2019t a simple Boss Raid. \u00a0This was a Raid happening in the framework of the great battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First, one had to defeat the Corrupted army defending the Havanz castle. \u00a0Then one had to climb the castle wall. \u00a0One had to win the siege of the Havanz castle to be able to acquire a ticket to fight Argardo. \u00a0However, this was impossible for Hyrkan to do by himself. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Hyrkan had planned on making a deal. He had planned on joining a decent Underfoot guild that was an ace card short of winning this Raid. \u00a0From their perspective, there was no reason why they would refuse the deal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the very least, it wouldn\u2019t prevent others especially the 30 great guilds from killing Argardo. \u00a0The deal would be much better than sucking their thumbs as others killed Argardo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Sinclair had appeared as the member of V&amp;V guild. \u00a0Sinclair was a User that already tried to kill Hyrkan. There had been no discernable reason behind it. \u00a0He thoughtlessly attempted a PK on Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I talk about the Watchman style once again in front of him, I bet he'll try to find my house and beat me up.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Hyrkan was in Sinclair's shoes, his eyes would roll back in anger once he spotted him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit. \u00a0It seems I'll have to change my plan.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan once again swallowed the bitter words. \u00a0At that moment, Sinclair turned his head slightly to look at Hyrkan. \u00a0Sinclair had felt Hyrkan looking at him. At that moment, Hyrkan was freaking out, but \u00a0he didn\u2019t show any outward signs. \u00a0If he looked away or turned his gaze away, it would make Sinclair suspicious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair tilted his head in confusion when he saw Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Who is that? \u00a0Is he looking at me? \u00a0Am I tripping?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That was the extent of this thoughts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0They are moving.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat were they talking about?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir and Chev had finished their conversation. \u00a0They turned their backs, and they walked away from each other. \u00a0The gazes that had been on the two split as they went in different directions. \u00a0When they disappeared from the stage, the Users were filled with \u00a0curiosity. \u00a0They started talking to each other privately.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In such a restless atmosphere, Sinclair and Hyrkan was nowhere to be seen.</span></p><br/><p>6.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGive up! Give up on it!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When that shout was heard, the Argardo Raid\u2019s message board became noisy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- They admitted defeat! \u00a0They couldn't even get over the castle wall!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Mediocre Users were gathered to increase the headcount. \u00a0This was to be expected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I got a 1.05 times return. \u00a0Thank you for the meal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 I flagged you for illegal betting before I leave.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Users gathered to make the Kill the Knight Team to run the Argardo Raid. However, this team had just gave up on the Raid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Kill the Knight was a team created by 1,200 Users. This team couldn't even climb the castle wall that had been crushed by the Raid Teams before them. \u00a0Of course, the Cement Worms were working on repairing the fallen castle wall, so it was only somewhat patched up. \u00a0The Kill the Knight team wanted to take advantage of this fact, yet their battle was conducted in a very sloppy manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The critical blow came when the castle wall fell. \u00a0The Users rushed in to enter the castle when the entrance became congested. \u00a0This congestion allowed the enemies to use AOE attacks to cause Game Over to a lot of Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why retaking the castles were scary. \u00a0It was as it was revealed in the Hahoe Mask\u2019s know-how video. \u00a0The attack on the congestion assured a certain victory in the defense of the castles. \u00a0However, the congestion was now morphed into an obstacle for the Users. \u00a0This method of attack assured certain victory, and it wasn\u2019t easy to come up with a method to counter it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, no one had expected the Kill the Knight team to succeed. \u00a0One needed incredible amount of magical firepower to clear away the monsters like the Sweepers guild, or one needed a peerless heavyweight that could make split-second decisions within a battle. \u00a0It was meaningless to have only a high number of Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Too bad about the V&amp;V guild. \u00a0They were able to reach the battle with Argardo, but they had to retreat eventually.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Since we are talking about the V&amp;V guild, there was a User that was incredibly skilled User that was killing the monsters. \u00a0Why didn\u2019t that User step up to fight Argardo?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 I'm also curious. \u00a0He fought better than the Users that actually fought Argard. \u00a0However, he was missing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Warlord fans were excited about the 3 teams that would be attempting the Raid after the Kill the Knight team.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Anyways, this 3 consecutive battles will settle it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- That's true. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was set up in such a way that three guilds in the 30 great guilds were attempting the Argardo Raid one after another. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- So the order is Big Smiles, Red Bulls and Stormhunter?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In terms of conducting Raids, these two guilds were opined to being the best in Warlord. \u00a0This fact was why everyone had high expectations. \u00a0They were overflowing with anticipation. It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that if these two guilds failed, no one could think of any other guilds that would be able to succeed in the Raid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, there was also the guild that became the butt of the joke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Even if Big Smiles will be the card that will be discarded, Red Bulls and the Stormhunter will end this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 Why is the Big Smiles the card that is being thrown away? \u00a0They are the strongest guild in China. If we compare the Big Smiles to the other two guilds, there is no reason why Big Smiles should be put on a lower standing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 Strongest in China = Weakest in the world. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 They only know how to move in big numbers. \u00a0What else are they good at?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 They move in swarms, and they get beat a lot. \u00a0They are very good at that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 I\u2019ll give you a 1 thumbs up. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Big Smiles were put in the a conversation alongside the other two guilds, and they were being roasted mercilessly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The result of these opinions appeared in the amount of live tickets that was sold. \u00a0The Big Smile\u2019s Argardo Raid only sold 290,000 live tickets. \u00a0Even if one took into account of having only one day to sell the ticket, Big Smiles had the largest pool of fans from China. \u00a0From Big Smiles\u2019 perspective, this hurt their pride.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit. They want me to stay as rear support doing the useless tasks. They are completely treating me like trash. \u00a0How dare they!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't really care about this Raid, but he was put in rear support even though he was an officer. \u00a0If he wanted to describe the situation with a Korean expression, he had joined in this Raid as a side dish. \u00a0It was a big hit to Apollo's pride.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chiroro was once again put next to Apollo to appease him. \u00a0His pride was hurt in a big way too, and it was twisting everything he felt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018You are trash.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo wasn't qualified to participate in a Raid of this level. He wasn't short on Items and levels, but his personal skills were very lacking. If this Raid had a cap on how many people could participate in it, Apollo's name wouldn't even have made it onto the reserve list. This was the opposite situation where there were no constraints on how many Users the guild could bring. \u00a0This was the reason why Apollo was able to participate in the Argardo Raid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, that wasn't the only reason.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If you hadn't paid off Brooks, no one would choose a trash like you.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Brooks was an officer of the Big Smiles, and he had helped Apollo get in on the Raid. \u00a0In simple terms, Brooks had been bribed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I wonder how much he is getting?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was obvious, but everything Apollo did was possible, because he had given Brooks a lot of money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From Chiroro\u2019s perspective, he didn\u2019t like the current situation at all. \u00a0He didn\u2019t like attending Apollo. \u00a0On top of it all, he had no expectation regarding the Argardo Raid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Our guild is hanging by a thread. \u00a0Why are we doing this Raid? \u00a0It isn\u2019t as if we brought our main force.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Big Smiles was attempting the Argardo Raid since it was a hot topic right now. \u00a0It seemed they were just thinking about selling some live tickets. Of course, there was a reason behind this. \u00a0Big Smiles guild had been one of the nine guilds that announced their nonparticipation. \u00a0They probably wouldn\u2019t have done this if they hadn\u2019t announced their nonparticipation. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a fact. \u00a0They had no chance of winning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The details of the plan hasn\u2019t come out yet, but Chiroro could tell what would happen. \u00a0They\u2019ll get past the castle wall, and they\u2019ll get to see Argardo\u2019s face. \u00a0After tangling with Argardo, they\u2019ll leave after the requisite time was filled. \u00a0Since they\u2019ve sold the live tickets, they would have to maintain the battle for an hour. \u00a0That was how long a normal Raid took.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When his thoughts reached that point, Chiroro\u2019s face unconsciously twisted to reveal his true feelings. \u00a0He was about to lose control over his expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It happened at that moment...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAren't you Chiroro-nim?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Someone was calling out Chiroro\u2019s name as he was approaching him. Chiroro's expression immediately changed when he saw the him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSinclair-nim?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The identity of this Users was Sinclair, who had participated the Argardo raid as a member of the V&amp;V guild. \u00a0He had finished participating in the Argardo Raid, yet he was back once again after only a short amount of time had passed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he wasn't here to meet Chiroro. \u00a0He wanted to check on the progress of the Stormhunters and Red Bulls. Still, it was a bit awkward for him to stand there by himself, since the V&amp;V guild had already left. Sinclair decided to greet Chiroro, who was close to being an officer in the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI was about to pass by after I assess the situation, and I caught sight of Chiroro-nim. \u00a0I came here to greet you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm not at a level where I should be greeted by you. I'm honored.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two of them weren't that close. \u00a0Sinclair had helped out the Big Smiles guild several times, and Chiroro had been present during such an event.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, Apollo didn't have any connections to Sinclair. \u00a0From Apollo's perspective, he suddenly felt listless.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo was impatient as he opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho is this?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chiroro's expression crumpled slightly at the question. However, Apollo was an officer, so he couldn't just brush him off. Chiroro introduced Sinclar to Apollo. \u00a0After introductions, the two Users shook hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, two Users located not too far away were also shaking hand. \u00a0They were standing in a \u00a0very secluded location where no one could see them.</span></p><br/><p>7.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A Raid was like a game of Go.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An opponent always moved in a pattern. One had to analyze this pattern, and one had to come up with a way to deal with this pattern. One had to try to read the opponent's move, and the opponent would react accordingly. Raid was only a several degree different from Go.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't easy to come up with a plan for a Raid assault. With regards to coming up with a plan, there was a strategist that was known to be very good working for the Red Bulls, and he had come up with a plan for the Argardo raid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the plan that was made by the strategist Nunum was scrapped.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre we really going to do this?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an order from Chev.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He suddenly requested a sudden change in the plan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it possible?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI can do it, but do you really want to do this?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reason behind this move was too surprising. This was why Nunum was asking the question again. However, Chev answered the question with a smile. \u00a0However, the smile didn't explain anything, so he still had a silly expression on his face. Finally, Chev explained his decision. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn any case, our chance for victory isn't that high. If that is the case, I would rather make this more fun. We have to take our viewers into account. \u00a0At the very least, our viewers won't be disappointed if we use this method.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At those words, Nunum put on an awkward smile as he thought about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018They won't be a disappointed. \u00a0It'll be a jackpot no matter the result.\u2019</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

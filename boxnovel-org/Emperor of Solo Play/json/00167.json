(3)</p><br/><p>8.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Heard Fortress Ruin town grew by the day. \u00a0A castle wall grew taller each day as if it was a bamboo tree in growth. \u00a0Of course, houses made out of logs and brick were erected beyond the castle walls.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They sprung up everywhere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Amongst all of them, the most eye-catching building was the one built out of bricks. \u00a0The construction of the building was almost completed. \u00a0It was the Heard Fortress Ruin branch of the Subjugation Association. \u00a0It was 5 stories high, and \u00a0it was also the largest building in terms of width.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, it had the most Users within the building.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMove it! \u00a0Let me get some Quests!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs there anyone willing to hunt with me? \u00a0I'm looking for a Striker!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey! \u00a0Over here! \u00a0Look here! \u00a0Over here!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the only way station in the Black Continent, so of course, it had a lot of people. \u00a0Moreover, when people gathered, a marketplace always popped up. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Users here had all gone through their 2nd Advancement. \u00a0Their Levels and Items would have brought admiring gazes to themselves if it was anywhere else, but here. \u00a0It didn't work like that over here. \u00a0There were too many monsters here with high levels and great items to be boastful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, a real monster had appeared inside the town.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It's the Hahoe Mask.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Hahoe Mask really came.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Since he came here, I'm guessing he is here for a Quest. \u00a0I heard he crossed the Urugal mountain range again.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If he suffered a Game Over, he would have been summoned here. \u00a0There's no other reason why he would have crossed the Urugal mountain range.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It was the same with the Immoral Prince episode, and the the Frozen Kingdom episode. \u00a0We have to follow after the Hahoe Mask.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fact that he had arrived at the Heard Fortress Ruin town wasn't just spread to the Users. \u00a0It was spread so far that people, who didn't play Warlord, was aware of this fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the fact that the Hahoe Mask sought out the branch of the Subjugation Association meant that the he had business here. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask wasn't just a skilled User. \u00a0He was like a magnet that pulled along the flow of Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Subjugation Association was where one could receive a Quest. \u00a0His appearance at this location meant that the Hahoe Mask was on a Quest. \u00a0Of course, there was no way it was a normal Quest. \u00a0When the Hahoe Mask entered the branch office of the Subjugation Association, he didn't stay on the first floor where the normal Quests were processed. \u00a0A guard guided the Hahoe Mask upstairs, and the rumor of this incident started to spread. \u00a0The expressions on the Users near the Subjugation Association changed.</span></p><br/><p>9.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">NPC Diung was a young man with a face full of scars. \u00a0The NPC was young yet he had scars. \u00a0These two elements usually didn't go hand in hand with each other. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The NPC took out a pouch made out of rags. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is the Item I found recently.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">NPC Diung handed over the pouch to the User wearing the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan immediately opened the pouch, and he took out the item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018As expected, it is a Conch.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The pouch held a Conch, which gave off a yellow gleam. \u00a0It was metallic, and it was similar in size to the Wooden Conch he had found in the Ruins. \u00a0Its shape was also similar. \u00a0Therefore, it was easy to figure out how to operate the Golden Conch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan immediately pressed the Golden Conch to his ears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of the relaxing sounds of waves, a voice could be heard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- My name is Bokan. \u00a0I'm at a tomb. \u00a0It is the grave of some unknown person, and I was able to witness the Power of Corruption here. \u00a0This is why I'm leaving behind a record.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The voice sounded dry. \u00a0It was hard to determine the age of the speaker by listening to its voice, and there were static included with the message. \u00a0If he didn't concentrate, he wouldn't be able to differentiate between the voice and the background static.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, the message was short.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan waited to hear more of story, but there was no followup message.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This game is really too much.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, that was all the information he would get.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had introduced itself as Bokan. \u00a0It had revealed where it was at by saying it was at a grave. \u00a0Then it spoke about the result of its action by mentioning its sighting of the Power of Corruption.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to find the location using just this information?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan would have to find the trace of Bokan using this clue. \u00a0When he arrived at a predetermined destination, the Golden Conch would give him a new clue. \u00a0This was the most common way the Users progressed in a Quest within the Ruined Kingdom Episode.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018So stingy. \u00a0Couldn't they have been a little bit more free in giving out information?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan harbored a brief feeling of discontent, but he didn't let it progress any further. \u00a0Nothing would change if he dwelled on his frustration. \u00a0Hyrkan was well aware of this fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo where did you find it?\" </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways, the starting point would always be where the Item was found. \u00a0He just had to find the next path from there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI found it at the Balos ruins.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Balos ruins was the location discovered by the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018In the end, I have to head east?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed Hyrkan's fate was closely intertwined with the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018A tomb.....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan knew that the word, 'tomb', appeared a lot in the Ruined Kingdom. \u00a0There were a lot of locations that started or ended with tomb. \u00a0As the word indicated, the Ruined Kingdom had been a nation. \u00a0During the kingdom's era of prosperity, kings and other important figures were buried in tombs, and these tombs were usually filled with Items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Wouldn\u2019t a tomb be called a ruin if it was big enough?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018East.... \u00a0It would be a jackpot if I find the King's Tomb.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, if the King's Tomb was found, it would be a jackpot for him. \u00a0At the very least, he would be able to gain two scrolls of Legendary Rank Ancient Power. \u00a0If he was lucky, he would be able obtain an amazing Item. \u00a0Even if it was a lesser tomb, there should be multiple Items within it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, these tombs were difficult. \u00a0If one found the tomb of a famous king, one would have to fight a monster that was as strong as the Boss Monster guarding the peak of the Urugal mountain range. \u00a0An exciting clash against the guardians of the tombs would be waiting for the Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Let's look at this in a positive light.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan systematically listed the important facts. \u00a0East would be preferable than going to the north or the south. \u00a0Hyrkan and the Stormhunters guild could fight until their faces were red if they wanted to, but an excuse would be needed to start the feud. \u00a0However, the Five Stars guild didn't need any pretext. \u00a0They would try to kill Hyrkan on sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWas there any other clues left behind.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNone. This item was by itself in the middle of a room.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0Good job.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was about to leave. \u00a0Since he had nothing to gain here, why should he stay any longer?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0Also...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was about to walk away when NPC Diung stopped him. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn the near future, the Hiban kingdom will dispatch an order of knights here. I believe you deserve to know this, Hyrkan-nim. \u00a0It'll happen in secret, so please don't tell anyone else about this.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan tilted his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The word, 'order of knights', wasn't a bad thing in itself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem arose in Hyrkan's memories regarding the order of knights and the Ruined Kingdom. \u00a0He knew what came out when these two elements were mixed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhich order of knights....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI cannot tell you any more than that. \u00a0However, the Hiban kingdom decided this fallen kingdom needed a closer examination. \u00a0They will be here on orders.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you for informing me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen I'll pray for your success. \u00a0Please find the whereabouts of our Archmage.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After nodding his head, Hyrkan exited the room. \u00a0However, Hyrkan's thoughts weren't filled with information regarding the Archmage Bokan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Are the Steel Lion Knights heading this way? \u00a0Was the Barbarian King event already triggered?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Black Continent.... \u00a0Before Hyrkan returned to the past, the Ruined Kingdom was called the Lost World, and several troops of knights had appeared there. \u00a0Of course, they appeared for Quests and events. \u00a0They would never appear randomly to take down a monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the appearance of the Steel Lion Knights and the Barbarian King event was an integral part of the Ruined Kingdom episode.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was akin to the great battle. The Steel Lion Knights would start to operate within the Black Continent with great success, and they would eventually awaken the Barbarian King. \u00a0From that point on, the Users would have to fight against the Barbarian King. \u00a0The Barbarian King had a special characteristic of being able use all monsters as vassals. \u00a0Its power was selected to be akin to the Power of Corruption.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If things ended there, it wouldn't be a problem. \u00a0The problem was the regions surrounding the Barbarian King. \u00a0In the regions near the Boss monster, the Regeneration time and number changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, the Barbarian King made all monsters its subordinates. \u00a0To satisfy this setting, the nearby hunting grounds became empty as they gathered beneath the Barbarian King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, the Users, who frequently hunted in the Black Continent, would be forced to take down the Barbarian King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the time, Tobot Soft took a lot of heat as swear words automatically came out of the Users. However, the developers hid behind the excuse that they didn't have the ability to arbitrarily change the game. \u00a0The AI made the decision on how the events developed in Warlord, and they no longer interfered with the system on the development side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018No way. \u00a0The Barbarian King is suppose to come out at the latter stages of the Ruined Kingdom episode.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Barbarian King was taken down, the Users find out why the Ruined Kingdom collapsed. \u00a0Then there was the power left behind by the Ruined Kingdom. \u00a0It was made, so the Users could avenge the Ruined Kingdom by fighting the beings that caused their collapse. \u00a0This was when the beings that drove the Kingdom to ruins was revealed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the starting point of the Dragon's Army episode.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There is no way that\u2019ll occur.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Ruined Kingdom episode had just started, so there was no way the signs regarding the Dragon's Army would show up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan let out a bitter laugh as he lightly shook his head from side to side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There is no way the high and mighty AI could made such a mistake.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After descending the stairway, Hyrkan left the Subjugation Association.</span></p><br/><p>10.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A person didn't change. \u00a0It didn't matter if a User was level 1, level 100 or level 200. \u00a0In the end, Users were humans. \u00a0In the end, the bad apple will continue to be a bad apple, and the cheaters will always cheat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the schemers will continue to scheme.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When one continue to scheme, there would always be a day of reckoning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's do this!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Five Users were about to pay the price for playing games.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI purposefully moved in a circuitous route, and I passed by this location not too long ago. \u00a0Look here. \u00a0I clearly left behind this scratch when I walked past this tree.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He looked at the Users, who would be forced to pay a price.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo you are trying to say you guys were coincidentally taking the same route as me. \u00a0Stop lying.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The User's name was Hyrkan, and his nickname was the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">We was the most famous User in Warlord, and one must never make an enemy out of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is your affiliation? \u00a0V&amp;V? \u00a0Big Smiles?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These five Users had been tailing after the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It happened quite often. \u00a0When a User received an important Quest from the Subjugation Association, one basically had the spoon half way up to one's mouth. \u00a0The one raising the spoon was the target, and if the owner of the Quest could be eliminated, the Quest Reward could be taken by someone else.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then there were the Users, who interfered with the progress of an opponent's Quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the User suffering these kinds of schemes had the right to lash out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask would be in the right even if he killed the five Users tailing him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRun!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The five Users made the wise choice. \u00a0If their opponent wasn't Hyrkan, this plan would have worked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chul-kuhk, chul-kuhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this was the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0He controlled over 60 Skeletons, and a loose retreat wasn't a wise choice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before the five Users had been aware of it, the Skeleton Warriors had already created a perimeter around them. \u00a0They blocked the Users from escaping.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The five Users had planned on simultaneously running in different directions. \u00a0The five Users once again looked at Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan met their gazes as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe five of you can fight against each other, and I'll let the last surviving User live.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At his words, two of the five Users sneered at him. \u00a0The other three members flipped their middle fingers towards Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan smiled as he flicked his finger.</span></p><br/><p>11.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Hydra guild merged with the Fighters guild!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hydra guild: \u00a0\"The Fighters guild is the strongest in terms of battle capability amongst the Underfoot guilds. \u00a0We need them. \u00a0They will supplement the part where the Hydra guild is weakest.\u201d] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Fighters guild: \u00a0\u201cWe agreed to it the moment we received an offer from the Hyrdra guild. \u00a0Our merge will create the best synergistic effect.\u201d] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[This is the first instance where an Underfoot guild merged with one of the 30 great guilds. \u00a0Is this the start of a new reorganization of the power structure?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Many articles were being written with titles saying the Hydra guild had merged with the Fighters guild. \u00a0The news was being spread fast.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While the news was spreading, Eric Gomes had turned off his smartphone and every other forms of communication he possessed. \u00a0He was listening to music.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a habit he developed long ago when he worked on Wall Street. \u00a0If he succeeded, he would hit the jackpot. \u00a0If he failed, he would go bankrupt. \u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had made irrevocable decisions that could have led to either outcome, and when he made the decision, Eric Gomes cut himself off from the outside world. \u00a0He realized that he could do nothing once he had the irrevocable decision.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It meant that the decision he had made recently was a decision in the same vein.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He always had thought about acquiring the Fighters guild. \u00a0In truth, there wasn't much downside to the merge. \u00a0The Fighters guild possessed Users with high combat ability. \u00a0They would be able to fill Hyrdra's biggest need in one fell swoop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the problem always came down to money. \u00a0The Hyrdra guild wasn't the only ones, who had coveted the Fighters guild. \u00a0In such a situation, there was no reason why the Fighters guild would lower their market value.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, the acquisition had been an unreasonable bet. \u00a0The Hydra guild had paid a heavy price.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Life is a funny thing. \u00a0I can't believe I made a decision like this, because of the Hungry man.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The impetus behind such a bold bet was the Hungry man, Toby Gwynn.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had suddenly contacted Eric Gomes, and he divulged information that hadn't been released to the public.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he heard the information, Eric Gomes understood the reasoning behind the actions taken by the Tobot Soft.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018As always, success comes to those, who are prepared. \u00a0The great success is reaped by those that are lucky.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, Eric Gomes realized that he had no choice, but to stand with Toby Gwynn. \u00a0The gains wanted by Toby Gwynn was in a similar direction to the gains wanted by Eric Gomes. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he heard Toby Gwynn's story, he immediately purchased the Fighters guild. \u00a0He needed to take the initiative.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to see the big picture especially in times like this.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a lesson he had learned while working at Wall Street for 10 years. \u00a0The further you were away from where money was being traded, the opportunity to make money also disappeared. \u00a0The funny part was the fact even if one distanced oneself from the market where money flowed back and forth, this didn't mean the opportunity to lose money went away too.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018So the problem becomes the Hahoe Mask again?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">According to the information given to him by Toby Gwynn, the biggest problem right now was the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A person working outside the standard structure would eventually wreck the structure.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He told me such precious information, because he expects me to block people like the Hahoe Mask and the Stormhunters guild from rocking the boat too much.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Toby Gwynn had given the Hyrdra guild information, because it would be profitable for the Hydra guild to keep the Hahoe Mask in check.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a really hard task.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Eric Gomes thought of it in simple terms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I look at the most recent events... \u00a0There is a good possibility that the Hahoe Mask doesn't have a backer. \u00a0Even if he had one, it isn't a big organization.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the past, he had thought the Hahoe Mask was backed by an organization that rivaled the 30 great guilds in power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Eric Gomes recently started to have doubts about this assumption. \u00a0If the Hahoe Mask had backers, the forces behind him should have started their operation already unless they were stupid. \u00a0Moreover, if they refused to reveal their identity up to now, they probably would refuse to \u00a0reveal their identity in the future.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, Hahoe Mask was by himself. \u00a0He was a Solo Player. \u00a0He played this game by himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Eric Gomes calibrated his thoughts based on this assumption.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Warlord isn't a game one can solo. \u00a0Up until now, the Hahoe Mask reaped the rewards by taking over tables that had already been set.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the Immoral Prince episode, it seemed as if the Hahoe Mask did everything by himself, but he had walked a road paved by countless number of dead Users. \u00a0He only planted a flag on top of the peak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Would the Hahoe Mask been able to stop the great battle by himself?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even in the Argardo raid, could he have done it without the help from the Red Bulls guild?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the recent Raid, he would have failed without the help of the Stormhunters guild. \u00a0The Five Stars would have shut him down if he hadn\u2019t had help. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the key point.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018We tried to use the Hahoe Mask, and the Hahoe Mask used us instead. \u00a0I have to give up on the idea of using the Hahoe Mask. If I do so, only the disrupters would be left around the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0In the end, the Hahoe Mask will come against a wall.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask wouldn't be able to do this alone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If the Hahoe Mask is able to monopolize the content by himself...\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he could do it without the help of others...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Then his destiny was already set in stone by god.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that point, a destiny like that couldn't be dodged.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

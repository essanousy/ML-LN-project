I'm asking if anyone here would pay instead of the ladies here.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet couldn't believe what was unfolding in front of his eyes. \u00a0He looked on with an absent-minded expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018My god.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This had happened in an instant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The process of defeating Viol happened in an instant. \u00a0Moreover, the events that happened afterwards also unfolded in an instant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The other party didn't have a good mix of members. \u00a0There was a Magician, Priest and Swordsman. The party wasn't made up in a way where they could gang up on a single opponent. \u00a0In truth, the party had only one Swordsman.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Swordsman User wasn't able to put up a proper fight. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the two swords clashed, the Swordsman User's sword bounced off. \u00a0At the same time, he had lost his balance. \u00a0This was the result of being overwhelmed by the opponent\u2019s Strength Stat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, when the Swordsman User was stabbed in the eyes, he was afflicted by the Blind effect. \u00a0Afterwards, the Swordsman User had become a meat shield. \u00a0Instead of buying time for his Magician, he was used as a shield. \u00a0The Magician let out the words, \"Uh uh? Uh uh!\", before he was subdued. \u00a0The Magician's arms and legs were cut. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Magician and Swordsman was subdued, a Priest didn't really have any other choice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how the previous conversation had started.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I never thought I would personally witness such a thing.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was common to see a single person fight multiple opponents in Warlord. \u00a0This was a game. \u00a0If one's Spec was overwhelmingly high, a single person could fight against several dozen people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the current situation wasn't the result of differences in Spec. The opponents had been crushed by strength, but something felt different. It felt as if something much stronger had crushed them. \u00a0It wasn't correct to say it was solely the difference in strength. \u00a0Was it a difference in temperament? This was a feeling one would get when one saw a tiger tear apart a rabbit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In that context, this was a hard sight to swallow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Zeet had seen videos that was similar to what he was seeing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It isn't as if he is the Hahoe Mask....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahoe Mask. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His battle style was similar to the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the sand toss was one of Hahoe Mask's go-to move. In recent days, the Hahoe Mask didn't use the sand toss any more. However, his early fans were a very passionate about the Hahoe Mask's sand toss. Many people became his fan, because of that move.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Zeet was watching with a slack-jawed expression, the situation was resolved.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Swing guild members settled each of their account, and they left. \u00a0Finally, Zeet approached his partner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMaybe I should have asked each of them for 200 gold...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A chill ran up Zeet's back when he heard his partner talk to himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What will happen if the Block Field doesn't open after the Quest is completed? \u00a0Do I really have to give him money?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying the anxiety, he was truly worried about what would happen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it really ok to act like this? I'm sure they'll come back for revenge.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet had fallen out with the Swing guild, and he was still paying the price for it. \u00a0Swing guild wasn't that great of a guild, but it was powerful enough to suppress a single User. \u00a0They had committed the first transgression, yet they weren\u2019t virtuous enough to admit that they were wrong in the first place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon't worry about it. At their level, they won't even be able to get a queue ticket to face me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His partner had dismissive expression on his face regarding Zeet's worries.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet replied with a question, but his partner didn't elaborate on his answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAnyways, let's move quickly. \u00a0I don't want to unnecessarily get caught up in an annoying business. \u00a0It seems the other side picked up on what we are doing.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet finally came to his senses.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0We have to move quickly.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His partner's words were correct. The Swing guild members, who were spared their lives, weren't dummies. \u00a0They'll go request help from the other guild members. \u00a0There were a considerable amount of Swing guild members around this region. \u00a0Zeet personally knew over 10 members.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was especially true since Viol had been taken down. \u00a0They would surely try to get their revenge. \u00a0Viol was someone that was pretty high up in terms of level in the Swing guild. \u00a0This happened in any organization, but the way they treat someone depended on how much the member could contribute towards their organization.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was reason enough to hurry up their pace.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you perhaps a fan of that person?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During all of this, Zeet asked a question he was very curious about.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahoe Mask.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. \u00a0I'm just saying you have a similar fighting style as the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0Ah. Of course, the Hahoe Mask is a Necromancer, and you are a Swordsman.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet's partner just smirked at his answer. \u00a0Of course, Zeet's partner didn't answer the question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's hurry up.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That was his partner's answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When one plays Warlord, sometimes it feels like one is putting pieces of a puzzle together.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how Zeet felt right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They diligently searched the hunting ground where the Sick Werewolves appeared. \u00a0In the process, they found a clue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if black rain had fallen from the sky, there were black ink-like marks on the trees, rocks and ground. Moreover, anything that touched the black liquid wasn't doing well. In the case of the tree, the trees were shriveled up only where the black water was touching. \u00a0The rocks and earth was corroded when in contact with the black liquid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The black liquid was clearly the source of the problem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo this is why the Sick Werewolves appeared.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, there was a high probability that the reason why the Sick Werewolves were appearing instead of the normal Werewolves was the effect of the black liquid. \u00a0In other words, it was highly likely that this place was the location they were looking for.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's just follow it. We can do the clean up later.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was like following the breadcrumbs left by Hansel and Gretel. \u00a0Zeet and his partner followed the black marks. \u00a0After traveling for awhile, they found a small hidden cave hidden between the foliages.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, there was a Black Skeleton within the cave. \u00a0It was praying with its hands clasped like a high priest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the Blackened Remains.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is why no one was able to find it. \u00a0Who would have thought it would be here? \u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Zeet found it, he spoke in a despondent manner, then he immediately lowered his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Fucking hell.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn't help, but curse inside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I worked like a dog for over two month to be able to see this shabby Skeleton...\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It looked like a worthless Skeleton. \u00a0In truth, what person likes a skeleton? \u00a0Skeletons were always an ominous symbol. \u00a0Yet he had spent two month to find this Skeleton.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was apt to describe it as him working like a dog. \u00a0From other people's perspective, he had basically wasted two month. \u00a0From Zeet's perspective, it felt as if he had dug a hole for two months. \u00a0It wasn't funny.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, at that moment, he felt an emotion that he had only felt when he began playing Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Still, this is a first.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No one had been able to accomplish this. \u00a0Countless number of people had given up on this Quest, and he was the first one to complete it. \u00a0He wouldn't characterize it as coming in 1st place, but it was a monumental moment for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet's partner shrugged his shoulders when he heard Zeet speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe can exchange pleasantries later. However, there's something I'd like you to keep in mind.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKeep in mind?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf we break open this Quest and the Block Field isn't gone, then you'll have to a choice to make like those Swing guild members.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet smirked at those words. \u00a0He laughed as he replied.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou really are a strange bastard.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His partner shrugged his shoulder. \u00a0Zeet didn't take his words to be a threat. \u00a0He thought his partner was playing with his words. \u00a0Of course, his partner might be warning him in truth, but Zeet didn't care in the end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0If it doesn\u2019t come down, I'll give you the money. \u00a0I'll give you a thousand gold.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he spoke, Zeet carefully picked up the Skeleton. \u00a0When Zeet's hands touched the Skeleton, everything except the skull disintegrated into dust.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? What the hell?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt must have eroded.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cD...does this mean we failed the Quest?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSince the skull is the only thing left, it means we should take it. \u00a0We just have to escort it to where it wanted to go.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet came to his sense when he heard the word 'escort'.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was time to part ways. \u00a0Zeet felt a sense of loss.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet hadn't made any comrades up until now. \u00a0It was true that a part of the reason why no one wanted to play with him was the fact that Zeet wasn't exceptionally skilled. \u00a0However, the biggest obstacle had been the fact that Zeet was annoyed by the other Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What kind of game would it be if one only focused on leveling up and hunting? One had to enjoy the game itself for it to be a game for him. \u00a0He wasn't interested in hunting like a mad man to become the best. \u00a0That was a minor part of the game for him. \u00a0It was pointless.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This line of thought discouraged the need to find a comrade.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, for the first time he had found a User, who he wanted to play the game with. Regrettably, it wouldn\u2019t be possible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018At a glance, he is an expert, who had hid his level. \u00a0There is no way he would want to play the game with me.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had caught on awhile ago. \u00a0He realized that his partner wasn't a small fry like him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0Let's end this.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet put on a smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I want to play the game with a guy like this.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the future, Zeet would come to be known as the Quest Man. \u00a0This was the moment that started it all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It happened the moment Hyrkan reached the peak of Ricky Mountain. \u00a0An Announcement was heard inside his ears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You gained the Title 'Person who Conquered the Peak of the Ricky Mountain'.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was finally at the peak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This meant the Block Field had been removed. \u00a0Hyrkan raised his head to look at the lake that was located on the other side of the mountain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I invested 3 days on this.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to dispel the Block Field. \u00a0Without any plans, he had used up 3 days to open the door.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan let out a sigh of relief instead of being frustrated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'm fortunate that there was guy like Zeet here.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he hadn\u2019t been here, he wouldn't have been able to finish the Quest in 3 days. \u00a0This was why he didn't say his time had been wasted. \u00a0He was actually thankful. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'm really thankful for that guy.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Users like Zeet didn't exist, how much time would Hyrkan have had to spend in dispelling the Block Field by himself? One week? \u00a0Maybe Hyrkan would have had to retire here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Guys like him make Warlord go around.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet and Users like him were the small components located all over Warlord. They were willing to to the small detailed tasks, so the Warlord Users could advance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The world was like a clock. \u00a0There were large and expensive parts, but one won't be able to make the clock work with just those components. \u00a0The small parts played a role that was as important as the large parts. \u00a0The Rankers of the 30 great guilds determined the flow of Warlord, but in the end, Warlord was made up of regular Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this wasn't an important story for Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan didn't go too deep into his reverie. \u00a0He wasn't in a situation where he would allow himself to fall into a reverie.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan harbored a suspicion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This doesn't match with the info I know.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cursed Domain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan knew that this place was of low importance in the Immoral Prince section of the Main Quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Cursed Domain is where the the Immoral Prince carried out his experiments. \u00a0This was the location where power of Corruption was exposed to the monsters through his experiments. \u00a0It was also the location where the clue about the Immoral Prince could be found.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was all the facts Hyrkan knew about the Cursed Domain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he looked at the current situation, Hyrkan knew this wasn't a stage he could easily finish. \u00a0This might take awhile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018A barrier.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the scenario is as Zeet surmised, the barrier had been made by those who had run away from the Cursed Domain. \u00a0On top of that, the Blackened Remains acquired by Zeet was the remain of the Magician that had been maintaining the barrier with his magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't a simple Block Field set in place by the System. \u00a0There were a lot of cases where a Block Field was set by a Scenario. \u00a0The Battlefield he had fought at the Terube castle wall was a prime example.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, if one crossed a Block Field linked to a Scenario, there was a pretty important Event Stage on the other side. \u00a0For example, the Frozen Kingdom was across the Terube castle wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The heart of the problem was the fact that Hyrkan didn't have any information about that important stage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'm sure of it. \u00a0Someone pocketed the Cursed Domain, and the information was never released.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This meant the Users from the time before Hyrkan returned to the past had cleared the Cursed Domain, and they had never disclosed this fact to the public.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This place is where level 140 monsters show up....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One would have to be at least level 140 to hunt at a hunting ground of this quality. \u00a0The Event probably required a higher level than 140, yet he had never heard about it. \u00a0There weren't many organizations that could cleanly swallow the whole event.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It could only be pulled off by the 30 great guilds and the Underfoot guilds. \u00a0This meant there was a high chance the Cursed Domain held something very delicious. \u00a0It was something worth hiding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan organized his current situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I don't have any information.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had no idea what the Cursed Domain held.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Moreover, my level is only in the 120s.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t entirely impossible for him to go to a level 140 hunting ground, but it wasn't an easy stage for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I don't care if a dog or a cow shows up. \u00a0However, I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be an ordinary dog or cow.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When such a stage opened, a dog or a cow would appear. \u00a0However, the dog might be a trained attack dog instead of a normal dog. \u00a0A bull could come out instead of a normal cow, and he would be the matador with no experience in facing these bulls.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were the mountains Hyrkan would have to climb in the future.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan put on his Hahoe Mask and he smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This will be fun.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rumors in Warlord traveled faster than the wind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid you hear about it? The Block Field across Misandra's Castle was dispelled.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOver there?

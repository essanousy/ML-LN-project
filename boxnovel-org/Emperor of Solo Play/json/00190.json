They unhesitatingly invested money into creating this criteria, which would drive the interest of the masses. \u00a0In other words, if this criteria was lost, Warlord loses its worth. \u00a0Moreover, we aren\u2019t at a point in our AI technology \u00a0where an AI can manage Warlord indefinitely.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At this point, Hatch no longer cared how Hyrkan reacted. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The world made by Warlord is about to come to an end. \u00a0This is the last Main Scenario Quest. \u00a0The only thing left after killing the Barbarian King is to acquire the artifact of the War King to fight the Dragon. \u00a0After the battle with the Dragon, this game will become a normal game.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So what?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For the first time, Hyrkan reacted. \u00a0Hatch couldn\u2019t help, but laugh at his reaction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Once Warlord becomes a normal game, you won\u2019t be able to accrue the same amount of fame and wealth. \u00a0You won\u2019t be able to earn several hundred thousand dollars just from posting a single hunting video. \u00a0No company in this world would pay you exorbitant amount of money to sponsor you. \u00a0Of course, you'll be able to make money. \u00a0However, it wouldn\u2019t be at the current level. \u00a0In other words, if you monkey around with the current situation, you\u2019ll be able to earn more fame and money over a longer period of time. \u00a0If you can play this game for one more year, you\u2019ll even be able to own a building worth several millions of dollars. \u00a0This is why I\u2019m going to ask you these questions. \u00a0Will you be able to kill this game knowing this? \u00a0Are you willing to give up everything in the process?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At his words, Hyrkan thought over the words that had been spoken.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is my last proposal.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was her last proposal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You can either finish this game with me, or you can go to war with me.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could share the glory of ending Warlord with her or he could extend the life-cycle of Warlord by fighting against her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to choose one of those options.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After she put forth her short proposal, Hatch stepped forward to block off Shir. \u00a0Shir\u2019s proposal was abrupt, and Hatch had to interpret and explain her words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thanks to his efforts, Hyrkan was able to understand everything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He now knew what was going on around him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He now understood what was going on in this world called Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he had an idea on what he should do from now on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Were you perhaps a programmer?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Hyrkan\u2019s question, Hatch nodded his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, it was my past occupation.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did you participate in creating Warlord?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I wasn\u2019t directly involved. \u00a0If Warlord was a person, I pretty much made the pinky toe.\" </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Before I give you guys an answer, I\u2019ll say couple things.\" </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch nodded his head in agreement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"First, I\u2019ll complete this game. \u00a0I\u2019ll do it even if you guys interfere with me. \u00a0Even if all of the 30 great guilds interfere with me, I\u2019m going to end this game.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if Hatch understood Hyrkan\u2019s position, he nodded his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Moreover, I\u2019m not afraid of starting a war with the Stormhunters. \u00a0I\u2019m not saying this as a bluff. \u00a0I\u2019m telling the truth. \u00a0I don\u2019t care if I win or lose. \u00a0If the Stormhunters guild starts a war with me, I won\u2019t avoid it. \u00a0In other words, even if I do pick one of the two options, I\u2019m not making it out of fear of the Stormhunters.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ha ha\u2026\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch let out a short laugh. \u00a0At his laugh, Hyrkan laughed. There were many emotions mixed in with that laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Lastly, I will never wear that in this game.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch stopped his laughter in surprise. \u00a0Hyrkan was pointing at his chest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the emblem of the Stormhunters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hatch was curious to hear his answer, so he asked Hyrkan a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why do you keep refusing to join our guild? \u00a0\u00a0In truth, it isn\u2019t as if we are treating you badly. \u00a0If how I was treated was used as a baseline, you were\u2026.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Hatch\u2019s objection, Hyrkan put his index finger over his lips to shush him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch closed his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When silence descended, Hyrkan opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019ll turn down the proposal. \u00a0However, I\u2019m willing to make a deal.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">2.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The gap ended, and history once again moved along.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Barbarian King Nesha was sealed.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Really?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Users crowding the Bizma Plain, and all the Users connected to the game heard the Announcement. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The news was immediately spread outside. \u00a0It was the version of the story with a gap in it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All the people ranging from having little to do with Warlord to the ones where the game took center in their lives became aware of the news.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-My god.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-Wow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-The Hahoe Mask really\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had done it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He made the impossible possible, and he turned despair into hope. \u00a0He turned a nightmare into a dream of good omen. \u00a0Hyrkan turned himself into a legend.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">3.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hyrkan!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling ran towards Hyrkan. \u00a0He looked as if he wanted to squeeze Hyrkan to death with a hug.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan was firm with his words when he saw Whistling running towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you attempt to hug or kiss me, I\u2019m going to kill you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Duhp-suhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling ignored Hyrkan\u2019s words, and he hugged Hyrkan. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan let out a yell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hey!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Thank you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After saying those words, Whistling hugged him harder. \u00a0If this was happening in real life instead of the game, Whistling\u2019s tears would have made Hyrkan\u2019s shoulder wet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how much gratitude Whistling felt towards Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan pried Whistling off of him. \u00a0Hyrkan\u2019s Strength stat was much higher, so he was able to easily escape from Whistling\u2019s hug.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"All right. \u00a0Let\u2019s get ready to end this. \u00a0Of course, since I caught it by myself, all the loot is mine.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even at that moment, Hyrkan was making calculations. \u00a0Whistling couldn\u2019t help, but laugh at this. \u00a0Whistling knew this was Hyrkan\u2019s attempt at cheering him \u00a0up. \u00a0This had started out as a festival, and he wanted it to remain a festival. \u00a0This was why Whistling didn\u2019t say any more unnecessary words. \u00a0He didn\u2019t say thank you, sorry or great work to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"All right. \u00a0You take everything. \u00a0You should eat it all!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He agreed enthusiastically with Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, he was being cordial, but many thoughts crowded Hyrkan\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'I never expected First One to be a program\u2026.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had made a deal with the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Stormhunters guild carried out their part of the deal by telling Hyrkan how he could reach the end of this game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One of the requirement was for Hyrkan to jump past the level of First One Sulwoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch gave an explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"First One Sulwoo is a program. \u00a0In the first place, it is impossible for a person to play the game like the First One. \u00a0\u00a0The First One\u2019s role is to manage Warlord, and it is a M.I. that plans out the content. \u00a0It measure the level difference between Users and the First One. \u00a0It is a measuring stick of how far the game had progressed. \u00a0\u00a0Depending on how much distance the front-runners close with the First One, it controls the speed of progress in the game.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was baffled when he heard the explanation. \u00a0However, it did explain why not much content was being made by First One Sulwoo compared to its fame and profile. \u00a0The K media company created the videos, and this was why most of its hunting video was in diary format. \u00a0This was also the reason why there was no footage of First One Sulwoo conducting a raid..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That really screws with the User in the number 2 Rank. \u00a0I would have sued Tobot Soft if I was second in the Level Ranking.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, he felt sorry for the Users, who sacrificed their lives, to catch First One\u2019s level.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat can we do about it? \u00a0In the first place, Warlord was a game made to test the AI. \u00a0They didn\u2019t plan for all of this, and they deserve to be sued. \u00a0Anyways, let\u2019s get back to the main topic. If you pass the First One, you\u2019ll be taking away the pencil and eraser used by the M.I. It would no longer be able to solve problems in managing Warlord. \u00a0Of course, this forces the M.I. to wrap everything up. \u00a0It basically puts forth the final boss into this world.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to catch up to the First One.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was how he reached the epilogue. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Hyrkan planned on doing just that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he wanted to do this, he had to kill the Barbarian King. \u00a0Moreover, he needed the Chronicle Unique Item dropped by the Barbarian King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'I\u2019ll catch up to it immediately.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan didn\u2019t plan on wilting down the home stretch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would burn bright until the end. \u00a0He\u2019ll be a torch and a symbol that will decorate the end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of that, he planned on becoming the true emperor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Emperor of Solo Play. \u00a0That sounds awesome.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo matter how I look at, this we are taking a loss on this deal.\" </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had left the Bizma Plain, and they were heading towards the Heard Fortress Ruin. \u00a0After struggling with his thoughts, Hatch finally opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Queen. \u00a0This really is a preposterous deal. \u00a0Why did we purchase the Red Bulls? \u00a0Why did we ally with the Hydra guild? \u00a0Didn\u2019t we do it, so we could put the name of the Stormhunters in the end credits?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At his words, Shir didn\u2019t say anything. \u00a0Instead of an answer, one corner of her mouth kept twitching.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yet you are going to allow the Hahoe Mask to catch the Dragon by himself? \u00a0Moreover, we are going to give him our full support? \u00a0\u00a0Why are we acting in this retarded manner? \u00a0We did all the hard work, yet we are giving everything to the Hahoe Mask on a silver platter! \u00a0It isn\u2019t as if the Hahoe Mask is fighting as a member of the Stormhunters guild!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch shook his head from side to side. \u00a0He realized his words were having no effect on Shir, so he immediately changed the target of his anger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"How can the Hahoe Mask be so confident? \u00a0He doesn\u2019t even know what the final boss is, yet he wants to face it alone? \u00a0Does he realize how kind of opponent a Dragon is? \u00a0That bastard is weird. \u00a0I\u2019m pretty sure he has around half a dozen screws loose inside his head.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If the Hahoe Mask fails, it\u2019ll be our turn. \u00a0I don\u2019t see the downside.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chev, who had been silently listening to Hatch\u2019s rant, gave his opinion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch couldn\u2019t help, but laugh at his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, is that so? \u00a0Is that why you just gave Argardo to the Hahoe Mask?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That\u2019s\u2026\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is the Hahoe Mask\u2019s strategy. \u00a0He tells others to catch it if he fails. \u00a0However, that guy never fails. \u00a0It was the same in the Anugas Raid. \u00a0If the Hahoe Mask failed in the Anugas Raid, we would have been next. \u00a0However, the Hahoe Mask killed Anugas.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chev let out a bitter laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Shir\u2019s twitching mouth opened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If the Hahoe Mask fails, the Dragon is ours.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That\u2019s.....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"On the other hand, if the Hahoe Mask succeeds, he is mine.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch was about to mutter something, but he gave up on it. \u00a0He knew better than anyone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Shit.

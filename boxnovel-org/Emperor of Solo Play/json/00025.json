The moment he dodged the attack, he lifted his head up and faced the Forest Bear eye to eye. He was completely unintimidated, as he seemed ready to strike a blow with his sword at any time.</p><br/><p>The Forest Bear also didn\u2019t take his eyes off of Hyrkan. He expressed fury at Hyrkan and Hyrkan only. He didn\u2019t have any room or reason to look away from someone clearly showing hostility towards him.</p><br/><p>UWOOOOH!</p><br/><p>The forest shook along with the Forest Bear\u2019s sonorous roar.</p><br/><p>And within this sound\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright, now! Get in here! I drew the aggro perfectly!\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan gave his command. Responding to his command, a Skeleton Warrior jumped up into the air. Throwing its body to stab the Forest Bear\u2019s back, the Skeleton Warrior seemed entirely dignified.</p><br/><p>Stab!</p><br/><p>The Skeleton Warrior\u2019s knife pierced the bear\u2019s flesh and dug deeply into its back. The instant the knife pierced into the Forest Bear, the Skeleton Warrior let go of the knife and quickly moved to distance itself from the bear.</p><br/><p>UWOOH!</p><br/><p>The Forest Bear let out a pain-filled cry as it turned around. It seemed to want to kill whoever stabbed the knife into its back.</p><br/><p>Uwoh?</p><br/><p>But what entered his sight was not the Skeleton Warrior that stabbed him and ran. Another one was running towards him in a straight line in an obvious manner.</p><br/><p>Uwoh!</p><br/><p>Without a shred of hesitation, the Forest Bear blew off the charging Skeleton Warrior\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Thwack!</p><br/><p>With a skull-crushing sound, the Skeleton Warrior\u2019s head flew off far into the distance.</p><br/><p>Watching this happen, Hyrkan shouted almost instinctively.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou idiots! Work together! If you see your friend going in and attacking, you should expect the turn-around and go in a breath later or look for another opening! Don\u2019t go in so obviously, that\u2019s like passing the ball to the goalkeeper!\u2019</p><br/><p>At this time, the one remaining Skeleton Warrior charged at the Forest Bear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHEY!\u201d</p><br/><p>Snap!</p><br/><p>Startled, Hyrkan snapped his finger once. The Skeleton Warrior that had been following an obvious path like the one before held up its shield and changed into Defense Mode.</p><br/><p>Krrr\u2026</p><br/><p>Watching the sudden change in movement, the Forest Bear hesitated. The Forest Bear slowly turned to face Hyrkan, while Hyrkan drew his knife and distanced himself. Watching Hyrkan back off, the Forest Bear entered its Alert Mode.</p><br/><p>A momentary respite.</p><br/><p>Using this opportunity, the headless Skeleton Warrior headed into the forest to find its missing head.</p><br/><p>Click Click!</p><br/><p>Like a child, the Skeleton Warrior walked with its arms out, and watching this scene from the corner of his eyes, Hyrkan grit his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ehew.\u2019</p><br/><p>The fact that Skeleton Warriors shared their Combat AIs was an undeniable benefit as Hyrkan didn\u2019t need to teach them from zero. As a result, his Skeleton Warriors all had superb evasion. Backing off right after an attack and flying in like an arrow on an opening were both the result of Hyrkan\u2019s education.</p><br/><p>The problem was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018These brainless idiots\u2026 well, they\u2019re not supposed to have a brain but\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t cooperate at all.</p><br/><p>When one acted, another had to act in response, and another had to act anticipating that response. That was \u2018teamwork\u2019, but it just didn\u2019t work. They didn\u2019t act like interlocking gears, but rather separate, independent ones.</p><br/><p>As a result, accidents like the one just now happened in battle.</p><br/><p>\u2018This huge magic power loss\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course, a normal necromancer would have been able to endure. In the first place, with enough magic power, the skeletons could recover from most damages.</p><br/><p>The problem was Hyrkan. As an all-strength necromancer, he didn\u2019t have such freedom with his magic power. Damage to his Skeleton Warriors wasn\u2019t something he could ignore.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan glanced to the side. The Skeleton Warrior had come back with its head, and it was now fitting it back onto its neck. Rather than irritation or anger, the sight caused Hyrkan to sigh.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah, it was my bad for expecting so much from you.\u2019</p><br/><p>In the end, there was only one answer.</p><br/><p>\u2018It was my bad for trying to eat a free lunch. Yep.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan had no choice but to teach them again from the start.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I thought I could sit back like all other necromancers, while the summons did the work\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course, to teach them, Hyrkan needed to direct the fight from the front line.</p><br/><p>\u2018I guess it\u2019s my destiny to fight on the front line with my life on the line.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan held up his longsword and charged towards the Forest Bear.</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun currently held his tablet PC. In it, 3 videos were being shown. Their content was the same, but they were from a different point of view.</p><br/><p>Warlord\u2019s camera function captured the world from multiple points of view. It was as if several cameras were filming the same scene from different angles. As the video wasn\u2019t just from the player\u2019s point of view, real movie-like scenes could be made.</p><br/><p>At the same time, this feature acted as an excellent analysis tool for players.</p><br/><p>Analysis was at the core of Warlord. Although Warlord monsters were outstanding, they wouldn\u2019t escape the limits of their settings. No, they couldn\u2019t. If they did, it would no longer be a game. As such, all monsters showed some signs before executing a certain move, they had a definite pattern to their battles.</p><br/><p>Of course, what An Jaehyun was analyzing now weren\u2019t monsters.</p><br/><p>\u2018They\u2019re getting better as the fight goes on\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>3 Skeleton Warriors, An Jaehyun was currently analyzing their battle.</p><br/><p>\u2018But it\u2019s still not enough.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Skeleton Warriors\u2019 individual battle ability was actually above his expectation. He was amazed from the bottom of his heart. He even questioned, how did something like this go unnoticed until now?</p><br/><p>On the other hand, they were far from perfect. Although they had potential, they still had tons to learn. It was An Jaehyun\u2019s role to create a learning curriculum for them. As he had never done such a thing before, An Jaehyun could only let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I took my classes just as serious, I would\u2019ve been able to go to college.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although he was saying this, in truth, An Jaehyun was happy to worry over such matters.</p><br/><p>Once they learned and gained experience, they would one day show excellent battle ability.</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t all.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, no need for me to draw the aggro too long. Once I hit level 40, I can get my Golem to do it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Necromancers weren\u2019t just limited to Skeleton Warriors. There were Skeleton Magicians, Golems, and later he could even summon Death Knights. There were even rumors of necromancers being able to summon Bone Dragons.</p><br/><p>At the very least, Hyrkan was certain that his battle videos would fundamentally change once he could summon Golems. As Golems had high HP and defense, Skeleton Warriors would have much wider movements with the Golem keeping the aggro.</p><br/><p>The potential was there.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can take it all alone.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although troublesome, Hyrkan definitely saw the potential. The potential to solo a raid!</p><br/><p>Of course, there were still problems to solve.</p><br/><p>The biggest of these now was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIf only I had more money\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Money.</p><br/><p>Aside from having money to spare, he had to solve his debts first. He would soon hit the one month mark since his borrowed date, and he didn\u2019t have any money left on him. He had to really focus on making money. Before he could aggressively invest money into the game, he had to first pay his debts off.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see.\u2019</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun headed to his YouTube page. His introduction video had reached well over 40,000 views, and his other videos were also steadily gaining views. Furthermore, he had reached 10,000 subscriber count.</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun smiled.</p><br/><p>\u2018Just looking at it makes my stomach full.\u2019</p><br/><p>Everything was going smoothly.</p><br/><p>But it wasn\u2019t enough. He had to make content that would make these 10,000 subscribers happy to pay for his character, Hyrkan. He had to prove he was worthy of receiving their donations, that his character, Hyrkan, had the possibility of becoming a future hero and Ranker.</p><br/><p>He had already shown the potential.</p><br/><p>What was left\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Starting now, I\u2019ll focus my videos on level-up speed than battles.\u2019</p><br/><p>Was result.</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>Warlord was full of news. Rather, people spent huge effort and numerous attempts to make the news. Although most turned to dust, some become worthy of headlines.</p><br/><p>Hahoe Mask Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>He was currently on the edge of making the news. The scene of a certain man watching his video was proof.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>A blonde man clad in scarlet armor let out a heartfelt praise. Nearby, a red-haired woman discovered the man and approached him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you watching to give such praise?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWatch it for yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the man\u2019s retort, the woman pouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know you can\u2019t watch other\u2019s videos for security reasons?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>After making a face as if he had forgotten, the man told her the video\u2019s identity.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahoe Mask Hyrkan. I\u2019m watching his battle video right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the man\u2019s words, the woman made a curious expression. This was the third time, the third time that she had heard the name Hahoe Mask Hyrkan from this man.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing that pretty often these days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, it\u2019s a video of him fighting a Mud Troll. It went up two hours ago, titled \u2018Level 20 Achieved.\u2019 You can look it up at\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman clicked her tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know why other Rankers are so interested in this player. What\u2019s there to him besides his concept? Hahoe mask and wacky leather fashion. Isn\u2019t it kind of disgusting? If someone around me were to wear that, I\u2019d never talk to him again.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man only made a wry smile. He couldn\u2019t think of a way to respond to her statement.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s good at fighting. It\u2019s a style you can\u2019t see anywhere else.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, the man touched the screen and rewound the video to the part he wanted. Then, he clicked the play button.</p><br/><p>A hahoe mask wearing man in a hideous fashion was narrowly dodging the attacks of a Mud Troll. As he drew its aggro, lizard-skulled Skeleton Warriors attacked the Mud Troll one by one. Right flank, left flank. They showed perfectly executed attacks like the gears of a well-oiled machine.</p><br/><p>In truth, it was nothing spectacular. Any coordinated team of players would be able to do so.</p><br/><p>Only\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018How did he raise his Skeleton Warriors for them to have such Combat AI? Were Skeleton Warriors\u2019 Combat AIs always this excellent? No, other necromancers weren\u2019t like this. Didn\u2019t most of them defend first before attacking?\u2019</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t players, but rather, Skeleton Warriors. He couldn\u2019t help but be surprised at such a feat. Fighting well alone and fighting well together were entirely different stories.</p><br/><p>Of course, the blonde man knew that Warlord\u2019s monsters and NPCs had superb AIs. If only in battles, they were much better than humans.</p><br/><p>\u2018Plus, looking at his level, he hasn\u2019t even played for long! How did he accomplish so much in such short time?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hahoe Mask Hyrkan had not played for long, and according to his research, it had only been a month since he started Warlord. Even so, he had managed to create Skeleton Warriors of this degree.</p><br/><p>Then\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018This is only the beginning. If these Skeleton Warriors\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Given the time, the Skeleton Warriors\u2019 AI would improve further.</p><br/><p>\u2018If these Skeleton Warriors could move as well as Hyrkan himself\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>One day, these Skeleton Warriors might fight as well as their master.</p><br/><p>What would happen then?</p><br/><p>\u2018How terrifying.\u2019</p><br/><p>The blonde haired man felt a shiver down his back.</p><br/><p>The woman nearby shouted at the blonde haired man.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop watching! Soon, it\u2019s time to hunt. We\u2019re going live in 5 minutes. Get up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>The blonde haired man got up, and the woman smacked the man\u2019s armored back.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop caring about that small fry. You are Matador Chev, Warlord\u2019s 9th Ranker and the leader of the Red Bulls. What you should be looking at is the peak, not the bottom.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this, the man smiled lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for the compliment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re thankful, finish it within one try today. We sold 200,000 live tickets. People have paid 2 million dollars to watch your victory ceremony. Don\u2019t disappoint them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man nodded and fiddled his watch. He turned off the hologram window and materialized an item slot.</p><br/><p>Then, a helmet appeared behind his neck, devouring his head. In the middle of the helmet with two frightening horns, the head of an enraged scarlet bull was engraved.</p><br/><p>Watching the man\u2019s appearance, the red-haired woman shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cRed Bulls, prepare for battle!\u201d</p><br/><p>Red Bulls.</p><br/><p>Even amongst the Top 30 Guilds, they were Raid Specialists that placed in the top 5 for raids.</p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

Content, his visage froze as it set in a heavy expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Does Warlord really hate me? \u00a0Why does it keep giving me such Quests?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Quest Content looked easy at a glance. \u00a0He just have to find and return an artifact. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, if one was a User of Warlord, one knew how bottomless such a Quest could be. \u00a0He clicked his tongue in dismay. \u00a0Any Quests related to the Elves made him feel irritated from the start. \u00a0If one wanted a relationship with the Elves, then one had to find the tribes. \u00a0It wasn't an easy task.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, it just said find the Elven Artifact. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn't specify which Elven Artifact. \u00a0There were no other clues.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I would rather kill Anugas....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, he thought it would be easier to face a monster like Anugas. \u00a0He would rather face a monster where he didn't know the method to kill it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this was also a special characteristic of the Main Scenario Quest. \u00a0It was the same starting from the first Main Scenario Quest. \u00a0In the Corrupted Cout Episode, it hadn't been just about killing strong monsters. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The stages provided by Warlord had a variety of contents, and one had to finish Quests all across the board. \u00a0It required the Users to go through a lot of these contents to progress in the game. \u00a0This was to be expected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, up until now, the Main Scenario Quest was powered through by brute force. \u00a0This was true of Hyrkan, Stormhunters guild, Red Bulls guild and more. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an unnatural and a not so clever method. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These Users didn't take the time to enjoy the game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From that perspective, he finally arrived at that point. \u00a0A wall had appeared and it couldn't be jumped over by power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Hyrkan gave up on attempting this Quest early on, and he had contacted Whistling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I didn't want to get him involved if possible...\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't have a favorable view on his current situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTsk.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First, it made it seem like he contacted Whistling only when Hyrkan needed him. \u00a0He didn't like the optic of it. \u00a0How rotten was it to look for a friend only when one needed something?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, this was a privilege of being friends. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if one ignored such feelings, Whistling was now a member of the Hydra guild. \u00a0It wouldn\u2019t \u00a0look good to others if Whistling met up with Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No one would welcome the meeting of Whistling and Hyrkan at the best of times. \u00a0This meeting would be viewed very unfavorably if it became known.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No one would see it as a meeting between friends.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's current location was the the evidence of his reticence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHere you are.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was pleased when a face that resembled a hunting dog appeared from between the overgrown trees.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh. \u00a0You are here?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan looked like the awkward friend one meets in an uncomfortable location.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, Whistling didn't look out of sorts at all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour accomplishments up until now has been tremendous.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s adequate.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were in a hunting ground. \u00a0It was a very remote hunting ground where one would rarely come across a User. \u00a0There were no monsters or Users here. \u00a0It was a very nice place to meet someone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Whistling wasn't the only User, who had arrived at this place of meeting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-wahhhh.... \u00a0\u00a0It really is the Hahoe Mask.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH...Hahoe Mask. \u00a0I am a fan.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two additional Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two Users had expressions filled with surprise. \u00a0Hyrkan looked hard at the two.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Yojori and Joba.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling had given him a heads up. \u00a0Whistling told Hyrkan that he had to move around with two others. \u00a0If Hyrkan hadn\u2019t like the idea of meeting the two, the meeting would have been called off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling also added that these two skilled Users were trustworthy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan trusted Pitbull\u2019s words, so he invited the other two Users too. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Yojori\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan somewhat knew of the User named Yojori.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She looked kinda like a slightly pudgy cat, and Yojori hadn\u2019t become famous until the Ruined Kingdom episode. \u00a0In the Ruined Kingdom episode, her fame skyrocketed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the Hydra guild progressed in the Ruined Kingdom episode, Yojori worked under a Quest taskforce, and the guild had made a program centered around her. \u00a0Her program was a hit, so she was quite famous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, if one analyzed her a little deeper, Yojori was different from most Users. \u00a0Moreover, her uniqueness was well received by the public.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018She was a bit of a nut case.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one was nice about it, she lived in the 4th dimension. \u00a0If one gave a rough description, she was a weirdo. \u00a0If one wanted to disparage her, she was crazy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A User like Yojori couldn\u2019t be understood by others. \u00a0In truth, her program was popular, but she herself was only moderately popular. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan hadn\u2019t been interested in her, so his memories were a bit fuzzy. \u00a0However, he did remember the scene where she ranked every single NPC by their appearance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I don't know this guy.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, Hyrkan had no recollection of Joba.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan just had to sift through Joba\u2019s background information. \u00a0Hyrkan could sufficiently guess at what made this User a bit unique.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He is a level 210 Magic Swordsman type\u2026 \u00a0He\u2019s a bit twisted.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were a lot of Magicians, who had finished their 2nd Advancement. \u00a0However, there were only a handful of Magic Swordsman type in existence, and level 210 was fairly high.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of it all, Magic Swordsman types focused on Raids in Warlord. \u00a0\u00a0They were developed with the thought of helping out the guild in mind. \u00a0Magic Swordsman were the best at managing aggros of monsters. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Joba was part of the Quest Exploration team instead of a Raid team. \u00a0At the very least, he couldn\u2019t be seen as a normal User.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These factors weren\u2019t enough to soften Hyrkan\u2019s expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan wasn\u2019t looking at the two with a friendly expression, and even though he was wearing a Hahoe Mask, his emotion was transmitted to the two.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yojori and Joba flinched in surprise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Why is he being liking this? Is there some kind of a problem?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Did I wrong the Hahoe Mask in the past? \u00a0Did he somehow found out about my weird comments beneath his youtube videos? \u00a0I\u2019m pretty sure I didn\u2019t cuss at him.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every User in Warlord knew about the Hahoe Mask, but Yojori and Joba were self-proclaimed Hahoe Mask fans. \u00a0They were very well informed about his tendencies, so they knew he was very temperamental. \u00a0He was ruthless against anyone, who got on his nerves. \u00a0Moreover, he had no compunction about using cheap and dirty methods from time to time. \u00a0They knew he was the real deal. \u00a0He was a veteran expert.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the two would be nervous standing in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After staring at the two, Hyrkan turned his gaze towards Whistling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre they original members of the Hydra guild?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe can\u2019t say we are one of the original members, but we\u2019ve been in the Hydra guild long enough that we could be seen as original members.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWill you guys be ok?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don't mind receiving help from the Hydra guild, but wouldn't it be a problem for you guys? \u00a0It isn't as if you guys received permission from the guild to come here.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan only needed Whistling's help. \u00a0However, there was a troublesome barrier between the two called the Hydra guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From Hyrkan\u2019s perspective, he didn\u2019t want the Hydra guild to get hold of information regarding the Main Scenario Quest. \u00a0Of course, we wouldn\u2019t mind a give and take relationship. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he needed something worthwhile to break through his reluctance. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the contrary, Whistling was in a tough situation. \u00a0If he helped the Hahoe Masked without informing the Hydra guild, Whistling and the two other Users here would be taking on a huge risk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Whistling gave a clear answer regarding this perceived problem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don't need the guild's permission. \u00a0If they have a problem with me, I can just leave. \u00a0Anyways, I've never received help from the Hydra guild. \u00a0It is the same for these two. \u00a0\u00a0We just need to give the Hydra guild information about the Quests we are on, and nothing else.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling was very clear with his answer. \u00a0It was easily given, because Whistling viewed Warlord as only a game, and nothing more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is why the consent of these two is more important than getting permission from the guild. \u00a0I share a common destiny with these two. \u00a0Maybe it is more apt to say that we all share the same Quests. \u00a0Moreover, I\u2019ve received a lot of help from them.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. \u00a0We received much more help from you than we gave.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf it wasn't for Whistling oppa, we wouldn't have been able to get this far in the Elven Quests!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They spoke at the same time in an embarrassed fashion, but the two glared at each other when their words overlapped.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While the two were glaring at each other, Whistling finished speaking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is why if those two didn\u2019t agree to it, I couldn\u2019t have helped you on your Quest.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Help.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was barely able to suppress his bitter laugh at the choice of word.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He is still the romantic.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He\u2019ll help.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a phrase that was easy on the ears, but Hyrkan had heard those word only a few times in Warlord. \u00a0It had always been a give and take. \u00a0It had always been a deal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In Hyrkan\u2019s vocabulary, help meant that he would have to pay back this gesture down the line. He had expected Whistling to demand an arrangement with him. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe final reason is the fact that your Quest and our Quest may be intertwined in some way. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is also why I cannot make this decision by myself. \u00a0My Quest is our Quest.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that point, Hyrkan was about to indulge himself in his sentimental feelings. \u00a0He pulled himself back from that hole of emotion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was thankful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was thankful for the offer of help, and he appreciated the offer of leaving the Hydra guild to help him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unfortunately, Hyrkan couldn\u2019t view Warlord as just a game like Whistling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0Let\u2019s draw a clear line here. \u00a0I need to be able to get into the town of the Red Elves. \u00a0Let us cooperate until that point.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan decided to make this into a deal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For a brief moment, a bitter smile crossed Whistling mouth before it was erased.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess I'll give the formal introduction. \u00a0Yojori and Joba. \u00a0I think it'll be enough to describe them as a Crusader and a Magic Swordsman. \u00a0Joba has the highest level at 210. \u00a0I'm at level 207, and Yojori is level 206. \u00a0\u00a0This is the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0He is famous, so do I need to speak any further?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At those words, the two Users opened their mouths as if they had been waiting for it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course not.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is an honor to be meeting you. \u00a0I know this might be out of bounds on a first meeting, but do you think I could get a selfie with you?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh! \u00a0Please I would like one too. \u00a0Of course, I decline being in the same picture as him.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI also don\u2019t want to be in the same frame as her.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou should ignore him.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo, he should ignore you. \u00a0Damn Crusader! \u00a0Hahoe Mask-nim is an exalted Lich! \u00a0You are the polar opposite of him, you perverted bitch!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid I say to the contrary? \u00a0Isn\u2019t he a bit too noisy?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mumble mumble.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan took his eyes off the two to look at Whistling. \u00a0Whistling\u2019s eyebrows and shoulders shrugged.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no way his future would be quiet.</span></p><br/><p>5.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe storyline for the Red Elves was present before anyone came to the Black Continent.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Hyrkan and Whistling's Family decided to ally with each other, they conducted a briefing where they exchanged information regarding the Quests.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI first came across it on a level 160 Quest called the Heir of the Barley Kingdom. \u00a0It happened a long time ago in the Barley Kingdom.... \u00a0If we put it in terms of the current outlook on the world, it is another ruined kingdom. \u00a0Anyways, this was an Elven Kingdom, and all the Elves on this continent were once citizens of this Kingdom.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll expand on my explanation a little bit. \u00a0When I finished the Heir of the Barley Kingdom episode, I immediately gained maximum Intimacy Level with the Yoomoo tribe. \u00a0As a benefit, I was able entered the protected Record Trees. \u00a0The Record Trees are amazing. \u00a0Once something was recorded within the tree, it eventually creates a seed. \u00a0This seed could be planted elsewhere, and whatever that was recorded before would come out as leaves in the new tree. \u00a0It was like a living library. \u00a0When I saw it, I was moved.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Black Dwarves will create the spears and shield that will be able to harm them. \u00a0The Red Fae will hide these weapons. \u00a0In the distant future, the humans equipped with these spears and shields will be able to pierce through the Curse. \u00a0Their hearts will be pierced by the spear!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? You memorized it?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm smarter than you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou probably read it off of a picture you took before. You are being pretentious.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a flash, the briefing strayed from the main topic, so it was up to Whistling to tie the end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn summary, the Red Elf tribe had been tasked to store these weapons. \u00a0They held this role before the Ruined Kingdom was ruined. \u00a0This is where your Quest comes in. \u00a0You received the Elven Artifact Quest, and it is talking about the Artifacts left behind by the Barley Kingdom.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan felt faint as he heard the briefing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I did this by myself, I wouldn't have known about this hint.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an Artifact of the Barley Kingdom? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan didn't know about this storyline.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is troublesome. \u00a0That means I have to find the Quest that deals with the Barley Kingdom\u2019s Artifacts, then progress through it\u2026..\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was fortunate to have been able to find a hint like this. \u00a0If he hadn\u2019t, it would have been like pressing the reset button during a game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFortunately, we are progressing in the Quest to find the Barley Kingdom\u2019s Artifacts. \u00a0Moreover, we found a clue.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan became startled at Whistling's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He never expected for his dilemma to be resolved like this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe have to go north.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After speaking, Whistling turned to look at Yojori. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She took out an Item, and this Item was a Conch made out of gem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The light in Hyrkan's eyes changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Gem Conch has already made its appearance?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Conches were crucial Items needed for one to be guided through the Ruined Kingdom Episode.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the worth of a Conch differed depending on what it was made out of. \u00a0The most common one was the Wooden Conch. \u00a0If one was progressing through Quests, it was common to see a User carrying around two to three Wooden Conches. \u00a0In the extreme end, some Users carried around a dozen Wooden Conches. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then there were the Golden Conches, which were a tier above. \u00a0The last type was the Gem Conches. \u00a0There was no tier above the Gem conches.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is driving me nuts.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan once again felt a weird sense of dissonance. \u00a0He knew the game was progressing at a rapid pace, but the speed differed too much from his knowledge. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t just the speed that had changed. \u00a0The distance one had to travel had shortened too.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hyrkan didn\u2019t question this truth for long. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The all mighty AI will do its job.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fact that he had those questions didn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll find the answers to it. \u00a0Hyrkan was far from being a curious man.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The most important thing for him was to eat the preys that were right in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe problem is the fact that we can\u2019t go north. \u00a0First, it isn\u2019t Hydra guild\u2019s territory. \u00a0Moreover, everyone has pretty much given up exploring north past the Highwood Forest.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan nodded his head at Whistling\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t know about the other things, but I can guarantee a comfortable passage through the Red Desert. \u00a0You\u2019ll ride a bus that normally you won\u2019t be able to ride even with money.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He finally established the give and take relationship at that moment.</span></p><br/><p>6.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Heh-bibin was watching a video.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puh-uhng, puh-uhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Inside the video, the rare Boss Monster Black Tree was being lit up by explosions like a \u00a0Christmas Tree. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the Hahoe Mask\u2019s debut pay-per-view video called Christmas Tree\u2019s Nightmare. \u00a0It sold over 2 million videos, and it was considered to be one of the classic masterpieces by the fans of Warlord. \u00a0An year's time was forever in terms of online time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Heh-bibin also remembered several things about this footage\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was hard to call it a good memory, yet several harsh events were etched into his memory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I\u2019m sure of it. \u00a0Pitbull is the one that shows up briefly within the footage.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While this footage was being filmed, the Big Smiles guild had been gearing up for a war with the Fighters guild. \u00a0They tried to hunt down Pitbull to provoke a war, and Apollo had been in charge of that mission. \u00a0Moreover, Heh-bibin was one of the figures that had sponsored the mission.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018After this video, we tried to hunt down Pitbull\u2026 \u00a0We failed. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During the hunt, a problem occurred. \u00a0There was a disrupter called the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0No one expected him to show up. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I think back on it, it is hard to see it as an random act of violence.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the time, he had thought the Hahoe Mask was trying to kick Big Smiles, while they were down. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask, Apollo and Big Smiles didn\u2019t have a good relationship. \u00a0If one took their relationship in context, it wouldn\u2019t be strange to see it as a random act of violence perpetrated towards the other party.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, now he saw that the Hahoe Mask had no reason to save Pitbull\u2019s life. \u00a0Of course, this was assuming there was no connection between Pitbull and the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When his thoughts arrived at that point, Heh-bibin earnestly did his research. \u00a0He wanted to see if Pitbull and the Hahoe Mask had travelled together before. \u00a0Unexpectedly, he found a lot of information in regards to their closeness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Hahoe Mask has no ties with the Hydra guild. \u00a0These two guys\u2019 relationship started during the Fighters guild\u2019s days, where Whistling Pitbull was a token guild member. \u00a0Moreover, the Hahoe Mask had no relationship to the Fighters guild either. \u00a0If they did, they would have already risen to being one of the 30 great guilds.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Heh-bibin went through various scenarios to come up with this conclusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were personal acquaintances. \u00a0The personal relationship was between the Hahoe Mask and the Pitbull.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I poke Pitbull, the Hahoe Mask will come out.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, if the Big Smiles guild attacked Pitbull, he'll monitor to see how the Hahoe Mask responded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7that sounds too one-dimensional.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Heh-bibin wasn\u2019t aiming for that reaction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I poke Pitbull, the first to respond would be the Hydra guild.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hydra guild would mobilize before the Hahoe Mask, because Pitbull was now a member of the Hydra guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is great. \u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was what he was aiming for.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Heh-bibin was a sub-guild master of the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0It was a pretty high position. \u00a0It was a higher position than the rank of officer in the previous iteration of the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0However, the actual power he had was much lower than before. \u00a0He didn\u2019t even have the right to speak in regards to the state of affairs of the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, the Big Smiles guild was held by the hands of Sinclair and Brooks. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sub-guild master Apollo was their sycophant. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Big Smiles guild was geared towards appeasing Sinclair. \u00a0Sinclair held more power than the Guild Master Brooks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was so bad that Apollo contacted Sinclair first rather than the Guild Master Brooks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Heh-bibin hadn\u2019t been given the position of sub-guild master, because they favored him. \u00a0In the reorganization of the Big Smiles guild, Brooks and Heh-bibin had been against each other. \u00a0When Heh-bibin lost the power struggle, he was given a high position, so the guild wouldn\u2019t implode. \u00a0If Brooks had just excised him out of the guild, Heh-bibin would have nothing to lose. \u00a0He would have come at them as if it was a matter of life or death. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, now the three members had established their power base, and they were slowly eating away at Heh-bibin\u2019s power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now the opinions of the Five Stars were more important than the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0Decisions had to be agreed by the five guilds, and Heh-bibin was just an insignificant part of one of the guilds. \u00a0He could do nothing. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I never expected such a good excuse to show up. \u00a0This is the best.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he started making preparations. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Heh-bibin was going to reverse his fortune.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he wanted to turn the tide, he needed to shake up the game board.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The current game board didn\u2019t allow him to anything. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to create an imbalance, and he\u2019ll able to flip the fractured parts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I just have to use Apollo. \u00a0\u00a0We just have to kill Pitbull. \u00a0I don\u2019t care if it is the Hydra guild or the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0They\u2019ll fight us.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hydra guild and the Hahoe Mask was sufficient enough of an adversary. \u00a0Of course, in the process, the Big Smiles guild would suffer big damages. \u00a0However, that didn\u2019t matter to Heh-bibin. \u00a0In the end, the responsibility will fall on the people above him, who held all the power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only thing he was certain was the fact that his situation couldn\u2019t get any worse from doing this. \u00a0Heh-bibin was already at rock bottom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I\u2019ll make you all pay for ignoring me.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After finishing this thought, Heh-bibin contacted Apollo.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

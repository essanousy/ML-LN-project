He had basically delivered a threat. \u00a0When Zeet received the warning, he immediately apologized instead of getting mad.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018His temperament is entirely different from his appearance.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, it was a reaction that didn't match Zeet's personality. \u00a0It wasn't as if Zeet's personality was dirty or ill-tempered. Still, he was more rowdy than he was quiet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His personality had been the reason why he had gotten into a conflict with the Swing Guild. \u00a0If Zeet had kept quiet when he had minor or emotional disagreements, he wouldn't have heard words like 'You better watch out next time you go for a hunt, you son of a bitch!'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Zeet had killed his temper for now, and he was deferring to his new partner. \u00a0The reason was simple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018\u2026\u2026his skills are killer.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His current partner was incredibly skilled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Truthfully, Zeet was having a hard time believing his current situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he was a normal User, he wouldn't have even offered up a 'I'm sorry'. \u00a0He would have just turned his head away, but he needed to show sincere concern for this particular partner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, Zeet had thought his partner was in the category of the unskilled Users. \u00a0The skilled Users weren\u2019t usually interested in what he had to offer. This User seemed to operating on his own, so Zeet thought the User was like a roaming duckweed. \u00a0He thought this User was like him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How could Zeet have guessed that this User was so skilled?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is one more coming. \u00a0I'll block it. \u00a0When it turns it back to you, you should immediately use your magic.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnderstood.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet was able to move around much faster as he searched for the Blackened Remains. \u00a0It was thanks to his skilled partner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBe sure of yourself when you throw it. Your timing will be way off if you hesitate like that.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI know. \u00a0I'm sorry. \u00a0It was a mistake.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, a skilled partner would require others to be at their best, but it was something Zeet was willing to put up with.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf the Quest is completed and the Block Field isn't dispelled, your life...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? What did you just say?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, this is just me talking to myself. \u00a0I'm just talking to myself.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWasn't your words too clear for it to be you talking to yourself?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo are you saying you want to hold a grudge against me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, no. \u00a0Ah! \u00a0It's the werewolf! \u00a0I'll start my Casting!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sometimes his more skilled partner would joke around. \u00a0His words were frightening, but Zeet was sure they were jokes. \u00a0At the very least, Zeet decided to think of it like that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He's probably joking. If he wasn't joking....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet briefly shuddered as he saw his partner run at the Weapon Werewolf to block it. \u00a0This was how excellent his partner's skills was. \u00a0He was so skilled that Zeet had never seen his partner use his Skills even once.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn't using his Skills, yet he was sufficiently skilled enough to fight off a Weapon Werewolf. \u00a0This mean his partner was an incredible expert. If one was over level 150 equipped with Unique Items, one could crush a Weapon Werewolf through one's Spec.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways, Zeet had the experience of partnering up with other parties and guilds. He had partnered up with a variety of parties and Users. \u00a0He could immediately tell his current partner's skill was extraordinary.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is really my last opportunity.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the opportunity to work with such a skilled partner was hard to come by. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why on the third day of Blackened Remains Exploration Quest, Zeet revealed the information he had been hiding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShall I tell you about the Blackened Remain Quest?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou've been keeping your mouth shut until now. \u00a0So why are you telling me right now?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt just means the information I have is worth a lot. \u00a0It isn't something I would tell someone at a first meeting.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0Tell me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This meant Zeet was ready to trust his partner this time, and he was showing his conviction in his desire to finish the Black Remains Quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you search for the Black Remains Quest, you'll hit on a lot of search results. \u00a0It is basically the terminus Quest one can receive at Misandra's Castle. \u00a0Still, why was no one able to solve it? \u00a0What was the reason? \u00a0The biggest reason was quite simple. \u00a0It took time to break this Quest. \u00a0Users wanted to level up and go do their Advancement. \u00a0It was more wise and profitable to focus on leveling up than the Quest.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had arrived at the Misandra's Castle when it was first released. He hadn't come here with some goal in mind. In the first place, he didn't have friends, partners, or a guild to play this game with. \u00a0He followed his feelings as he roamed \u00a0towards various locations like a floating duckweed. \u00a0He bounced around doing adventures, and he had arrived at Misandra's Castle by coincidence. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he hadn't stayed at the Misandra's Castle with some specific goal in mind. \u00a0His level coincided with Misandra's Castle, and it was a decent place to work out of. \u00a0That was the sole reason why he stayed there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fun part for Zeet was the fact that he was able to acquire a variety of information as Users and groups passed through Misandra's Castle. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This method was quite inefficient if one wanted to Level Up or Spec Up at this location. \u00a0However, it was a very effective way to acquire information.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Zeet was able to gather as much information that could be used in Scenario Quests around Misandra's Castle. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let's return to the topic at hand. \u00a0Beyond the Misandra's Castle, I think there might be an Event Location there.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet's partner appropriately showed interest in Zeet's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat's the basis for this?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you look at the NPCs at Misandra's castle, several of them have the Titles of Fugitive or Refugee.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs I progressed through the Quests related to the Subjugation Association, I increased my Intimacy Level with the NPCs. \u00a0That was when I started hearing a particular expression being repeated. The most typical expression was 'Beyond there...' \u00a0Basically, they were trying to express something ominous was present beyond the mountain, where the Block Field was present.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMaybe, the monsters gave them the ominous feeling.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThese are NPCs within the Subjugation Association, where the purpose of the Association was to subjugate the monsters. \u00a0If there were monsters, they would usually talk about how they would catch the monsters. \u00a0They typically don't worry about how to avoid the monsters, because of the ominous feeling they felt.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are quite knowledgeable about this game.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLook here, man. \u00a0I spent 8 hours a day since Warlord was opened.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYet you are only at that level?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis game is very unfair. \u00a0In truth, my situation is quite normal. \u00a0Warlord is overflowing with Scenario Quests even if we discounted the Main Scenario Quest. \u00a0Each NPC in a castle all has at least one Scenario Quest. I don't want to jump from one hunting ground to another. \u00a0Isn't it stranger to hop to another location like grasshoppers just because one wants a little bit more EXP? \u00a0What kind of game is that? \u00a0Even miners working in mines don't operate like that.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cContinue with your story.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. I'll return to the main point. I've spoken to all the NPCs inside Misandra's Castle, and from their conversations, I've determined this might not be a Block Field. \u00a0There is a high probability that this is a barrier instead of a Block Field. There is something across it, and the barrier is to block this thing from coming to Misandra's Castle.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo what's the connection between the barrier and the Blackened Remains?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Blackened Remains that is mentioned in the Blackened Remains Quest might be a symbolism. \u00a0Well, that part isn't that important. The important fact is that a lot of Users had tried to clear this. There was no downside in doing it. However, a lot of Users got frustrated trying to clear this quest, and no one was able to finish it. \u00a0Do you know why?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt was more profitable to go for the Advancement.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet had a mysterious smile on his face when he heard his partner's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThink hard on it. Quite a lot of resolute users have tried this search. \u00a0Let me simplify it for you. \u00a0Weren\u2019t the Users trying to hunting, and conduct the search at the same time? \u00a0This was what had happened. \u00a0Naturally, the searches near level 90 monsters happened more frequently than other location. In other words\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNot many people searched the low level hunting grounds.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0That was their blind spot. There are hunting grounds around here where low level monsters appear. \u00a0However, no one would concentrate on those hunting grounds. \u00a0What crazy low level Users would come to a place that's considered to be the last stop on a Quest?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet's eyes shone as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the background information on why Zeet had been obsessed with this Quest, and it was also the reason why he was so sure he could clear the Blackened Remains Quest. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, he had never told anyone about this truth. \u00a0In truth, if he told someone else about this, other would have cleared the Quest instead of him. Moreover, if someone posted this online, the person would probably get praised online.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, that would be the end of that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet wanted to be the main character in this story.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he hadn't met a partner, who actually wanted to help him. \u00a0This was why he never spoke what was inside his heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Truthfully, Zeet wanted to be a protagonist for this particular Quest. \u00a0As he had told his partner, he had played this game for a long time. \u00a0He wanted to leave an achievement that was all his own. He would feel a little bit of return for the amount of money and time he had invested in this game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During all that time, there were only a handful of people, who even wanted to listen to his offer. \u00a0Amongst all of them, this was the first time he had a partner, who would follow his instructions for 3 days. \u00a0It didn't matter how much he complained.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTherefore, if we move to the locations where there are low level monsters, we might find it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCorrect!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Zeet was thankful. It was good fortune that he had met a good partner. \u00a0Although, he didn't look to have a good personality.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBe happy. \u00a0This is the first time I've revealed this information to anyone else.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His partner smiled for the first time at Zeet's words. \u00a0It made him feel a sense of deja vu as if he had seen that smile from some video before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a hunting ground where a monster slightly above level 60 appeared. \u00a0The Sick Werewolf appeared here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This hunting ground was located a bit farther away from Misandra's Castle, so it wasn't that popular. The biggest problem was the fact that one would have to get past a hunting ground filled with level 80 monsters to reach this place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the adjacent hunting grounds all had monsters that exceeded level 80. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was basically a hunting ground with mines located everyone. \u00a0It wasn't a place where one could hunt comfortably. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If it wasn't for that reason, it was actually a nice hunting ground where there were no competitors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Swing Guild had members of diverse levels. \u00a0To help the low level guild members, it wasn't strange for them to come hunt at locations where the Sick Werewolves appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you doing here, Zeet?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Zeet hadn't shown up with a new partner, there wouldn't have been any problems.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm just passing by. \u00a0I'm passing through here.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet saw six guild members. \u00a0It was a party with 2 women and four men. \u00a0Within the game, he felt a chill run up his spine when he saw the group.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His first thoughts was 'Why were these Users here in the first place?' \u00a0Moreover, he never expected it to be the Swing guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other side, the Swing guild considered this to be a pretty good opportunity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Users, who had spent a decent amount of time at Misandra's Castle, all knew Zeet had put in a lot of effort in trying to progress in the Blackened Remains Quest. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Swing Guild members were all thinking along the same line. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Is the Blackened Remains here?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Zeet was taken aback. \u00a0In truth, he had been afraid of this happening. \u00a0This was why he hadn't come here even if he suspected this was the location.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit. I had to run into the Swing Guild, of all the people.....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the Swing Guild realized what was going on, they wouldn't let Zeet go easily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are just passing through? Who gave you permission to be able to pass through here? This place is within our guild's jurisdiction.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he heard those words, Zeet immediately knew what the Swing guild members were thinking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018These bastards have a rough idea of what going on. \u00a0It was inevitable. \u00a0Those bastards were always interested in every one of my moves.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They wouldn\u2019t easily believe his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy are you barking out nonsense? No guild can block someone from passing through a field. \u00a0Even the 30 great guilds don\u2019t act that way!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don't care if normal Users pass through here. \u00a0However, you have an account to settle with our guild.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat account?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOne of our guild member suffered Game Over because of you. \u00a0Of course, you have to settle that account.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two reasons why the Swing Guild had done nothing to Zeet. \u00a0They had watched him, while they grinded their teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First, they weren't allowed to PK within the castle grounds. PK was possible, but they would be cussed out by everyone for carrying it out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was possible to do it outside in the fields, but Zeet always moved with a new party. \u00a0He wasn\u2019t officially affiliated with any groups. \u00a0If they attacked Zeet, they would basically be attacking the party he was in. \u00a0This was why the Swing Guild held back from carrying out their revenge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre \u00a0you trying to kill me? \u00a0Is that what you are trying to do?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo way.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the truth. \u00a0They had no plans on killing Zeet. \u00a0It might make them feel better to just kill him, but not every answer to a problem was to kill the other User.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe aren't a PK guild.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Swing guild wasn't a 'bad manners guild', and they were absolutely not a PK guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe just want your sincere apology, and a promise of a compensation. \u00a0That is all we want.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI didn't even kill him that time! \u00a0He got killed by a monster!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the one suffering this indignity, Zeet thought their actions were ridiculous. \u00a0Of course, he hadn't behaved well at the time, but he never had any ill intent. It had been an accident. \u00a0That should be all there was to it. \u00a0They shouldn\u2019t take revenge on him, because of an accident. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Zeet raised his voice, the Swing guild members immediately hardened their expressions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat's going on?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho's that person? \u00a0Why are you guys fighting?\" </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two women in the party reacted in an odd way. \u00a0They reacted as if they didn't know what was going on. \u00a0Also, one could tell they were getting annoyed by the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, the four men had mobilized to help the two ladies level up. \u00a0This was a low level hunting ground for this two women! \u00a0It was a romantic gesture inside the game. \u00a0From the view of a third party, these Users were desperately trying to get a date even if it was within a virtual reality. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways, these four Users were trying to be looked favorably by these two women, so they couldn't avoid this confrontation. \u00a0Moreover, this was a four vs two fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Should we fight them?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Zeet is a scrub. \u00a0However, the remaining User... \u00a0At a glance, he doesn't look like much.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If we fight, we'll most definitely win. It isn't as if they have a priest. \u00a0Isn't it just a 2 man party?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The result of the fight was clear. \u00a0At the very least, it looked obvious to Zeet and the Swing Guild Members.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet gritted his teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow much do you want?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the worst case scenario for Zeet. \u00a0If he suffered a Game Over and the Swing guild used the clues gather from his movements, they might clear the Blackened Remains Quest. \u00a0His number one priority was to survive this encounter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOne thousand gold should be enough.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCrazy bastards.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An immediate answer was given at that moment. \u00a0It hadn't come out from Zeet's mouth. \u00a0It was Zeet's partner, who had spoken.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Huh?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet tilted his head in confusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Swing guild members also tilted their head in confusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone looked at Zeet's partner. He didn't look like someone, who would spit out those words, 'Crazy bastards.' </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was quite the opposite. \u00a0He looked like a pushover, who would \u00a0tremble in fear if one yelled, 'Hey!', in a mean way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone was dazed as they stood still for a brief moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeet's partner raised his voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt isn't as if you guys discovered Misandra's castle, yet you are claiming ownership of a hunting ground? \u00a0Crazy bastards. I was going to tolerate it, and let it pass, but this is bullshit. If you continue to insist on this bullshit, you guys are sick.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMe? Will you know me if I inform you? \u00a0Do you want my character name, real name, home address, birthplace, and birthday? \u00a0Will you be able to know who I am?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026are you trying to pick a fight with me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPick a fight with you? \u00a0Shall we go repeat what was said a moment ago? \u00a0Shall we go poll, who people think started this quarrel? \u00a0Do you want to bet 10 thousand gold on it?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The members of the Swing guild closed their mouth tight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't as if what Zeet's partner had said was wrong. If one put aside their grudge, the Swing Guild was basically using their superior number to bully Users. This was the truth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only reason why they got away with it was the fact that strength was the law here. \u00a0If this happened in real life, people would have already reported them to the police.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In other words, Swing guild still held the power here. \u00a0There was no reason why they should close their mouth and tamp down their anger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Son of a bitch.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ellie and Yoz is watching us right now. \u00a0This is a bit embarrassing...\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Viol, who possessed the highest level, moved. \u00a0He had already reached level 102.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are a third party, yet you are inserting yourself into a matter between Zeet and our guild.... How interesting.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, Viol was a User that shouldn't be present here. \u00a0He was here to celebrate his Advancement. \u00a0He was here to help the low level Users, while he impressed others with the Skills he had earned from his Advancement. \u00a0He had come here to show off. \u00a0If he was being a little bit more truthful, he had come here, since he had a strong interest in the female User named Ellie.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you are trying to pick a fight, you should be more clear about it.

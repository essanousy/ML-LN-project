It was clearly evident that this place was where the Catacomb's Stage Boss was located at. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan didn't show any hesitation as he jumped into the stage. He didn't have any worries. \u00a0He had \u00a0plenty of consumable Items. \u00a0Moreover, his body was itching at the thought of getting out of this boring Catacombs. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, he reached a massive graveyard. The graveyard was large enough to be reminiscent of a small domed stadium. It was a cemetery filled with skeletons of Chimeras. \u00a0It was also filled with the ownerless armors and weapons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a Dungeon befitting the name of Catacombs. \u00a0It was mass graveyard for the Chimeras.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Who dares to wake me from my rest!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was an ogre here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, it wasn't an ordinary ogre. It was a skeleton made out of ogre bones, and it had a clear and distinct emblem... It was the trigon emblem. \u00a0The ogre had a big emblem belonging to Prince Dean engraved on the chest armor it was wearing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[What are the Guards doing?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Its voice was very menacing, and it let out a roar. \u00a0The ogre skeleton's right hand held a fearsome and large iron mace. \u00a0Its left held a weird looking lantern. \u00a0It was a gem hanging on a chain, and it was giving out a purple light.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even at this point, Hyrkan's intuition still hadn't thought this would be a jackpot. \u00a0Hyrkan was trying hard to come up with a method that\u2019ll allow him to dispose the Catacomb's Boss Monster and the Guards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It happened at that moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You disgraceful bastards! Get up! Get up and get rid of this being, who interferes with my rest!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Gem Lantern held by the Catacomb Guardian let out a powerful purple light. Something akin to ghosts started to exit out of the purple light, and it was being absorbed into skeletons scattered in the surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan had a hunch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Maybe?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This Boss Monster's special ability was quite clear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a type that can summon Skeleton underlings. \u00a0Basically, this type of monsters were labeled Lich style monster. They were pretty rare to come across, but they weren't an anomaly. \u00a0They weren't that special.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This would be true if the opponent hadn't been Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Finally, I've finally achieved a great Matchup.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was Warlord's best Necromancer, and he was a new breed of Necromancer.... \u00a0He was the Hahoe Mask Hyrkan, who had founded the Hahoe Mask style.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is a really big Match up.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If these confluence of factors weren't present, this battle wouldn't have been given any special meaning by Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I can get 10 million at the very least.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since he was the Hahoe Mask, this Boss Raid was special. \u00a0It'll be memorable one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a battle between the Lich Style Boss Monster and the Hahoe Mask Necromancer. \u00a0If one was fan of the Hahoe Mask and a fan who enjoyed watching Warlord, this was a matchup impossible to ignore.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You bastard. \u00a0You will pay the price of waking me from my rest!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan let out a roar, then he let shouted towards the Catacomb Guardian.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You'll make me pay the price? \u00a0How dare you! \u00a0I am the Hahoe Mask, yet you want to make me pay?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan spoke his line as he acted out the scene.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This battle would be worth a lot. \u00a0This was why he had to act cool and act the part!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he regretted saying it the moment the words left his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Those lines didn't sound too great. It's embarrassing.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, an NG was always possible in acting. With the Catacomb Guardian letting out its angry words in front of him, Hyrkan earnestly thought about his new lines.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Yes. This is it.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He finally came up with a new line. \u00a0Hyrkan made a pose, and he once again yelled out his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA price\u2026\u2026 You will feel it in your bones as to who I am.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The line he gave was still very corny.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was a smile on Hyrkan's lips as if he liked the line he gave.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Feel it in your bones! That'll be a famous line.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If a screenwriter could look into Hyrkan's heart, he would have a dumbfounded expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was oblivious to this fact. \u00a0He was drunk on his own words. \u00a0Of course, he did what he had to do even if we was drunk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Kill the one, who interferes with my rest!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had already prepared itself for battle. \u00a0Ten Chimera Skeleton was staring at him. \u00a0In a flash, Hyrkan held a gem in his hand. \u00a0He closed his fist as if he was trying to squeeze the gem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Drip drip! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bright light came out of the gem as it dripped to the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo koo koo! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The gem was absorbed into the floor, and the ground started to shake. \u00a0Dirt shot up, and a golem that was as big as the Catacomb Guardian appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Golem looked like an ogre. \u00a0On top of that fact, the ogre possessed two heads.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the Twin Head Ogre.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a level 110 Boss Monster, and amongst the Users, it was known to be the most difficult Ogre to deal with. \u00a0It was considered to be one of the strongest Ogres in this this game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was obvious, but the ingredient gem of this monster was incredibly expensive. \u00a0The price of a gem differed by 500 gold depending on its scarcity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018My one month food money was blown in one shot.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had saved this one for emergency. \u00a0He really didn't want to use this one. \u00a0He prayed that he'll never encounter a situation where he would have to use it. \u00a0He kept it close to his bosom as if it was a golden ingot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018All right. Let's just do this.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, at that moment, Hyrkan erased all thoughts about money from his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He painted a picture in his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he summoned the Twin Head Ogre, he immediately scattered 10 Skeleton Fragments on the floor. He summoned 10 Skeleton with a picture in mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Catacomb Guardian had also summoned 10 Chimera Skeletons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">With each ogre as the commanders, the Undead units faced each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was like the scene where actors were getting ready for a full scale battle. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Hyrkan flicked his finger twice to give the cue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the sequel hit after the Waltz video. \u00a0It was the start of the 'Battle of the Bones.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The first clash was a landslide victory for Hyrkan. \u00a0The Skeleton Warriors received the Skeleton Knight's buff and the Skeleton Science's effect. \u00a0Moreover, the Skeleton Warriors were fully equipped, so they were like nightmares for the Chimera Skeletons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the Catacomb Guardian merely stood in the back as it directed the battle. \u00a0On the other hand, the Twin Head Ogre golem used both of its hands to swing its enormous club. \u00a0It ruthlessly pummeled the Chimera Skeletons. \u00a0The Chimera Skeleton's heads flew into the distance like a baseball.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[How laughable!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the first charge ended, the Catacomb Guardian swung his Gem Lantern once again. \u00a0Another twenty Chimera Skeletons appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan once again matched their numbers. \u00a0He summoned additional Skeleton underlings. \u00a0There were three Skeleton Magicians mixed in with the group.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They wore luxurious robes, which was embroidered with numerous symbols. \u00a0They held an expensive staff with a gem embedded on the top. \u00a0The addition of the Skeleton Magicians allowed Hyrkan to win in a bigger landslide.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Three Skeleton Magician threw massive fireballs, and it ruthlessly crushed the Chimera Skeletons, who were lined up for battle. \u00a0Their battle line was broken, and the Skeleton Warriors waded in as they went berserk. If this game was an AOS game instead of a RPG, a firework would have exploded atop the Skeleton Knight with the word pentakill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Stupid bastards!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Catacomb Guardian swung its Gem Lantern once again. \u00a0Its third unit was summoned. \u00a0It summoned 30 Chimera Skeletons this time. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now the Catacomb Guardian held the numerical advantage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I'll do this myself!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Catacomb Guardian had been hanging back until now, but the Catacomb Guardian moved forward as it easily shook its enormous mace. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he saw this, Hyrkan raised the Ivan's Sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The third clash would be different from the other two. It was the beginning where the ogres would clash.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Catacomb Guardian and the Ogre Golem unhesitatingly swung their fearsome weapons at each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The mace swung by the Catacomb Guardian crushed a head of the Ogre Golem with a single swing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The weapon swung by the Ogre Golem impacted on the side of the Catacomb Guardian's armor. \u00a0It made an ugly dent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng, kahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeletons started to fight when the clash between the ogres started. Their weapons were impacting on each other's armors, so the surrounding was filled with the sound of steel impacting on steel. \u00a0The sound itself increased the confusion one felt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan was moving covertly and swiftly through this racket. \u00a0He approached the rear of the Catacomb Guardian. Within the melee, Hyrkan accurately found the right path. \u00a0He moved through the melee almost like he was threading a needle. He was able to reach the rear of the Catacomb Guardian too easily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[How laughable!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Ogre Golem was exchanging blows with the Catacomb Guardian, and neither combatants were retreating. \u00a0However, the Catacomb Guardian must have felt Hyrkan's approach, and its voice stabbed into Hyrkan's ears like a knife.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Catacomb Gem Lantern is letting out a bleak Energy.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Catacomb Gem Lantern's curse has seized you.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Announcement was heard immediately.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an automatic curse that activated based on proximity of the User. \u00a0Moreover, it wasn't a curse targeted at a specific user. \u00a0The Catacomb Guardian activated its special ability, which was an AOE.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018How laughable.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan wasn't surprised or taken aback. \u00a0Instead, he put on a bloody smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he put on the bloody smile, he chewed on one of the three candies in his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[\u2018White Imoogi's Eye Candy\u2019 has blocked the curses effect.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had put a consumable Item in his mouth, and it would help him block any debuff skills like the curse. This was the most basic strategy used by a Striker.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hyrkan knew about the basics. \u00a0The Catacomb Guardian's curse didn't take hold on Hyrkan. \u00a0Hyrkan used his quick movements to attach himself on the back of the Catacomb Guardian.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thanks to Twin Head Ogre Golem's strike denting the armor, Hyrkan was able to climb it easily. \u00a0As the unofficial V Gear climbing world record holder, this was like traveling in a subway. \u00a0There were numerous places to grip.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After grabbing a hand hold, Hyrkan immediately stabbed the Ivan's Sword into one of the dents.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The armor was unexpectedly sturdy. \u00a0He needed to break through this armor for his Curses to take hold. \u00a0It was an annoying development.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan immediately stabbed the Ivan's Sword to the same location he had stabbed before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chee-jeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, he didn't stab it. He had scratched out an X on the surface of the Catacomb Guardian's armor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Catacomb Guardian was afflicted with the Demon Curse.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Catacomb Guardian was afflicted with Slow Curse.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Catacomb Guardian was afflicted with Corrosive Ghost.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Catacomb Guardian was afflicted with Darkness.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Catacomb Guardian was afflicted with Lethargy.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Curses swirled around the Catacomb Guardian's entire body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Voodoo Pictograph is great. It's a great skill.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't have to wound his opponent's body. \u00a0He just had to draw a predetermined shape, and it would grant Curses to the opponent. \u00a0It was thanks to the effect of a Skill called 'Voodoo Pictograph'.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a Skill he earned as a Quest Reward, and it was a Rare Rank Skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I don't believe it!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After being Cursed, the Catacomb Guardian's body rapidly weakened. Its decline was inevitable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's Demon Curse and Slow Curse was Rank A. \u00a0The Corrosive Ghost was Rank B, and Lethargy was Rank C.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, his Curse Science skill had reached Rank C, so the effect and duration of the Curses increased by 12 percent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lastly, Hyrkan held the Ivan's Sword, which ignored the opponent's defense by 15%.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The third strike finally opened a hole on the Catacomb Guardian's armor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[How dare you!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Catacomb Guardian raged. \u00a0It roughly shook its body as it tried to dislodge Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan wasn't some trash, who would be thrown off with such a weak shake. Moreover, its opponent wasn't Hyrkan. \u00a0It was the Twin Head Ogre Golem. \u00a0One of the golem's head had been crushed, but it still had one head left. \u00a0The loss of one head had revealed the Twin Head Ogre's increasingly tyrannical nature. \u00a0It pushed hard against the Catacomb Guardian.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng, kah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It swung the club with both hands. \u00a0It pounded away at the Catacomb Guardian's body like a drum. \u00a0This actually caused more turbulence for Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggah-ahng, ggah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the midst of the turbulence, Hyrkan enlarged the hole. His vision was shaking so much that it wouldn't have surprised anyone if Hyrkan fell sick from the motion sickness. However, Hyrkan was like a master craftsman. \u00a0His hand movements were precise. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He finally made a hole of his liking. \u00a0It was big enough to put in as many Bone Explosives as Hyrkan wanted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is a battle tactic I saved for a day like this.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan put the Bone Explosives into the hole.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Kwah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Tablet PC was connected to bluetooth speakers, and the sound rang out in all direction. At the center of the sound of the explosion, Che-sulyun was watching raptly. \u00a0She had a strange expression on her face as if she was a action movie fan watching Die Hard's explosion scene.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Bone Explosives can be used that way?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a scene where the Hahoe Mask had put a hole in the Catacomb Guardian's armor. \u00a0The hole was filled with Bone Explosives, and they were detonated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In all of Warlord, the Hahoe Mask was the only one capable of showing this scene. \u00a0Che-sulyun couldn't pull her eyes away from the scene.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, a single blow couldn't kill the Catacomb Guardian. \u00a0Its armor was ruined from the Bone Explosives, but the Catacomb Guardian continued to hang on to its life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When its HP was suddenly reduced, the Catacomb Guardian went into its next phase.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I will not let you leave alive! Wake up! Everyone get up! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Catacomb Guardian went into the new Phase, it summoned 50 Chimera Skeletons. \u00a0Moreover, it started letting out a purple energy, which shaved away HP went it touched the enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are watching that scene again, master?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is the best part.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI know it's a great scene, but how many times do you have to watch it??\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is called a great scene, because it stays cool even after you watch it again and again. \u00a0Moreover, the real stuff starts after the explosion.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Matador Chev. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn't tear his eyes away from the battle footage between the Hahoe Mask and the Catacomb Guardian. \u00a0He was one of countless people, who couldn't tear their eyes away from the footage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If we immediately sell Raid Live tickets with the Hahoe Mask as the main draw, we could probably sell million tickets depending on the match up. \u00a0In a year, it wouldn't be farfetched for the Hahoe Mask will allow us to sell 10 million tickets.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, someone who considered himself to be the cream of the crop was also watching the same vid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you looking at, Mr. Sinclair?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's nothing\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, he had on a V&amp;V emblem on his chest. When the V&amp;V guild officer asked him a question, he gave a vague answer. The V&amp;V guild officer didn't want to get on Sinclair's nerves, so he didn't repeat his question. \u00a0He carefully passed on the information.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe'll start the raid in 30 minutes. We look forward to working with you again.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, understood. \u00a0Also, you don't have to come look for me every time. \u00a0You can just send me a message. \u00a0Currently, I'm a normal member of the V&amp;V guild.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa ha. I'm just treating you like a future guild officer.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After exchanging a slight nod with the him, the V&amp;V guild officer left. \u00a0When he saw the back of the V&amp;V guild officer, Sinclair turned his head to focus on the footage once again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While he watched the footage, he admitted something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018That damn Hahoe Mask. \u00a0I'll admit it. He is a remarkable bastard.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He admitted the Hahoe Mask wasn't a normal guy. \u00a0Furthermore, he admitted the Hahoe Mask wasn't a normal User.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He has the ability to command others. \u00a0Now he has that special quality that makes people pay attention to him.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He accepted it, but he also became worried and guarded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Maybe this guy might be a bigger threat than the 30 great guilds. If it is as expected, he possesses a massive amount of funds. \u00a0The only thing he is lacking is level. If he reaches the level of the Rankers, less than 10 people in the entire Warlord could face him 1on1.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, there was a fourth person watching the video.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-ha-ha! It's a jackpot! \u00a0Jackpot! I knew my intuition wasn\u2019t dead yet. Look at the view counts rise! Kyahh! I need to treat myself to some luxury on a day like this. I'll eat until my stomach bursts!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He put canned tuna and tofu into the Kimchi Jjigae. He brought out the tender white rice, and toasted seaweed that was glistening with oil. He sat in front of a 50 inch monitor, which didn't suit the one room. \u00a0As he enjoyed the feast, he watched a video. \u00a0The main character of the footage was Ahn-jaehyun.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

Why is it so low?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he thought the Bone Dragon Skill was supposed to be a 3rd Advancement Skill. \u00a0It was supposed to be a level 300 Skill, yet it had a level 230 requirement. \u00a0It meant it was a 2nd Advancement Skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Was it always at this level?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were a good number of Skills that Warlord Users bypassed without realizing it. \u00a0This was especially true with the unpopular Classes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a level 230 Bone Dragon Skill in existence, yet it wasn't strange that no one knew about the Skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Necromancer Class had gotten popular thanks to Hyrkan. \u00a0Now 2 out of 10 Users picked the Necromancer Class. \u00a0It was seen as a promising Class, but this hadn't been true in the past. \u00a0In the past, 1 out of 10 Users picked the Necromancer Class. \u00a0Moreover, the Class was mostly chosen out of mistake or curiosity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Well, since I received it, I should be thankful.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hyrkan didn't have to worry too deeply about the minute details of the Skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The most important part was that an amazing Skill had made its appearance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan immediately looked at the subsection. \u00a0Unlike the other Skills, the Bone Dragon Skill's subsection was more substantive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, several characteristics listed caught his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Bone Dragon's Level is equal to the Monster's Level.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One had to use Dragon type monster bones to summon the Bone Dragon, and when it was summoned, it would have identical Stats to the monster. \u00a0Moreover, the Special Ability of the original monster couldn't be used. \u00a0As expected, there would be a penalty for having a low Rank, but the Stats would go up as the Skill increased in Rank.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I use the Boss Monster as Ingredient, the cost will be immense.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, if a Dragon type Boss Monster would be used as ingredient, the penalized basic Stats would still be immense. \u00a0The best class of monster to summon was the Boss Monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Blaze Slime Dragon... \u00a0It doesn't have any bones.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Bone Dragon couldn\u2019t use the Special Skills of the sacrificed monster, but it possessed its own Special Skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The most eye-catching feature was the Riding Skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'll finally be able to travel on a decent ride.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, the Riding Function was available on the Golem. \u00a0Hyrkan had the Clay Play Skill ranked up to Rank A, so he could fly into the sky by using monsters like Wyverns as sacrifice. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018That isn't flight. \u00a0It is just moving along the ground.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was the altitude! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Wyvern Golem couldn't fly high into the sky. \u00a0At the same time, the process in getting it to fly and changing direction was unilaterally against the rider. \u00a0It would allow one to move at the speed of a car on a highway at an altitude of 100 meters. \u00a0However, if a problem occurs during the flight like being attacked by someone, one would free fall towards the ground. \u00a0Since the Golem's body was made out of stone, its ability to recover its balance and altitude was the worst.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one wanted to use it, one could use it. \u00a0However, it was more dangerous to use it in the hunting grounds than one would think. \u00a0There would be some monster attacks, but the biggest danger were the Users. \u00a0When most Users saw a flying Golem flying at low altitude, they would attack first and ask questions later. \u00a0From Hyrkan's perspective, he would go nuts if he kept being attacked in such a manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be better to use a four-legged beast as ingredient. \u00a0It was a more efficient and safer mode of travel. \u00a0In truth, there wasn't much difference in using a Wyvern Golem and a Wolf Golem. \u00a0The difference in arrival time wasn't that large.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There is no way this one has that stupid altitude restriction, right?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, there was a chance that Bone Dragon's Riding Skill was similar in nature as the Golem's Riding Skill. \u00a0Maybe, the Warlord System itself put a restriction on all flight by Users. \u00a0This was a likely scenario.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Acid Breath... \u00a0It'll be able to use it at Rank B.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Aside from the Riding Skill, the Bone Dragon had several skills it could use as its Rank increased. \u00a0At Rank C, the Stats penalty was lifted. \u00a0At Rank B, it gained the Acid Breath. \u00a0At Rank A, it could use the Dragon's Fear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There might also be two other additional skills.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two Special Skill for the Skeleton Knight like the Chivalry and Commander was gained through Skill Books. \u00a0There was a good chance that he'll be able to increase the Bone Dragon\u2019s Skills through the same method.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There is still a lot of places where I have to spend money on.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan clicked his tongue in dismay when he thought about the money he had to invest to get the Chivalry and Commander skill. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the worry for money was cleanly blown out of the water when he saw the fourth line in the subsection.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Wait a moment. \u00a0What the hell is this?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u00a0Bone ingredients equal to a whole Dragon is needed to be able to summon the Bone Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What the hell?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The most expensive Skill in Warlord had made its appearance.</span></p><br/><p>6.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggoo-oh-oh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Bone Wyvern, which was only made out of bones, let out a cry. \u00a0The forest was full of tall and thick trees, which was reminiscent of buildings. \u00a0The Bone Wyvern started dropping towards the forest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shweeee! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was like an arrow descending towards the ground after reaching its peak. \u00a0Moreover, it was solely made out of bones, so the Bone Wyvern was angular. \u00a0It led with its beak as it dived in a terrifying manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-hwaht! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The leaves of the large trees were covering the ground like a roof, and the Bone Wyvern broke through as if it was breaking under the surface of the water. \u00a0The target of the Wyvern's beak was the monster named Wood Devil. \u00a0It was fighting a fierce battle with the Death Knight, Skeleton Knights, and the Skeleton Warriors. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monster was 7 meters tall, and it was massive. \u00a0It had the legs of a goat, and the body and head of an Orc. \u00a0Moreover, it was made out of a mixture of dirt, rock and trees. \u00a0The Wood Devil was a powerful monster. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was only a mid-sized monster, but its difficulty rivaled the large monsters. \u00a0Moreover, it also gave similar EXP as the large monsters. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Bone Wyvern unhesitatingly drilled its beak towards the Wood Devil. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puh-uhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Both the penetrator and the penetrated suffered a brutal cost from the collision.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Wood Devil's head blew up like a watermelon. \u00a0The Bone Wyvern's beak pierced through the head to lodge itself on top of the Wood Devil's shoulder. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Wyvern was stuck, and it was in rough shape.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was akin to throwing a boiled egg at a rock. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It became increasingly more bizarre when the two, who had suffered massive damages, displayed signs of life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Wood Devil didn't have anything that could be called a head, yet it plucked out the Bone Wyvern stuck on its body with its left hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It used its incredible grip strength to break the Bone Wyvern in half, and it threw the Bone Wyvern to the floor as if it was throwing away trash.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-hwaht! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Bone Wyvern had already been in rough shape, but now one couldn't even tell what it originally looked like. \u00a0Amongst the wrecked body, the bones were showing signs of activity. \u00a0The Bone Wyvern was trying hard to keep its body together, while it struggled in vain. \u00a0It attempted to fix each bone one at a time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if it wanted to avenge its comrade, the Death Knight's Skeleton Steed rammed its head into the Wood Devil's body. \u00a0The Death Knight swung down towards the headless Wood Devil as if it was splitting wood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, really? \u00a0What the hell!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was someone stuck to the back of the Wood Devil and this being was busily stuffing Bone Explosives into the monster's body. \u00a0Hyrkan shouted in an annoyed voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Do you realize how much I paid for that!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Highwood Forest was located on the northern parts of the Black Continent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a forest located on the outskirts of the Red Desert, and it was considered to be the most effective hunting ground to level up for Users over level 230. The difficulty in hunting the Wood Devil was high, but the EXP gained was high too.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan was visiting the Highwood Forest, because of a quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit. \u00a0The Bone Explosives, and the offerings for the Bone Dragon.... \u00a0This is driving me nuts.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he found the trace left behind by the Archmage Bokan in the Ancient King's Tomb, he immediately received the quest called \u2018Ancient King\u2019s Artifact\u2019. He had to meet the Blacksmith Olf to progress in the Quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he had no idea where the Blacksmith Olf was located at. \u00a0This particular NPC never stayed in a single location. \u00a0He had questioned everyone at the Subjugation Association, and he was able to locate a hint that said the Blacksmith Olf had crossed over to the Black Continent. \u00a0He was told that the Blacksmith Olf was currently journeying towards the Red Desert.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Naturally, the Red Desert became Hyrkan's destination, and the Highwood Forest was on the path towards the Red Desert. \u00a0Of course, he would hunt earnestly as he traveled there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hunt was very good. \u00a0The Wood Devils were as advertised. \u00a0They guaranteed he would gain a really good amount of EXP. \u00a0Moreover, the Ingredients dropped by the Wood Devils could be used in producing Unique Rank Items. \u00a0The monster had good EXP, and it was a money maker. \u00a0His profit steadily rose as he caught this monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, his profit was smashed into pieces as the Bone Dragon broke apart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bone Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a good Skill. \u00a0The Bone Dragon allowed one to summon Wyverns and other miscellaneous Dragons. \u00a0All these Dragon type monsters had excellent offensive capabilities.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, problem arose from the fact that the summoned Bone Dragon was too reckless, and its Skill Rank was too low. \u00a0Moreover, the level gap between the monster he sacrificed, and the monster he fought was too large.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'm only catching a Wood Devil, so I can't use the Bone Ingredients of a level 200 Boss Monster...\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For his first summon, he had used a level 170 monster called Gray Wyvern to summon the Bone Wyvern. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't a low level monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Gray Wyvern was still considered to be hard monster to kill in Warlord. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan was currently hunting the Wood Devils, which were at level 240.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a 70 level gap. \u00a0Moreover, since the Skill's Rank was F, his Bone Wyvern had received a Stat reduction penalty.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It all culminated to bring about the moment from a moment ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Bone Wyvern had worked hard in its own way, and at times, it was quite effective. \u00a0However, the Bone Wyvern had paid a price for its action.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This part of the equation was easy to accept, and it was understandable. \u00a0He had used a level 170 monster as Ingredient, so it would have been strange if it was capable of taking down a level 240 monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was the price.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Still, it cost me 1,000 gold to summon a Bone Wyvern. \u00a0This is too much.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the cost of summoning a Bone Wyvern.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the case of the Gray Wyvern, it dropped 8 Ingredients where one could make decent Items. \u00a0If one added up the Bone Ingredients used in this venture, it was around 1,000 gold.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Actually, it wasn\u2019t that expensive. \u00a0\u00a0If one divided the 8 pieces, the Bone Ingredient needed to produce an Item came out to be around 120 gold. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a pretty low price for an Ingredient that was used to make an Item used by many level 170 Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was a different story for Hyrkan. \u00a0He had to buy a large quantity of the Ingredient, and it could only be used once.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018So one summon was worth a supply of 100 Bone Explosives...\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was worth 100 Bone Explosives.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the Bone Dragon wasn't too compatible with the Death Knight's Undying skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t as if the Skill didn't work on the Bone Dragon. \u00a0The sticking point was the special characteristic of the Undying Skill. \u00a0The Undying Skill only worked if the Skeleton was near the Death Knight. \u00a0However, the Bone Dragon regularly moved away from the effective range of the Undying skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the case right now. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Wood Devil had extracted the Bone Wyvern, and it had thrown it outside of the range of the Death Knight's Undying Skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Bone Wyvern has returned to earth.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the Bone Wyvern failed to regenerate and recover. \u00a0It returned to being dirt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFuck this shit\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, his one thousand gold had turned into dirt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The part that made his insides hurt more was the fact that he would have to repeat doing this. \u00a0He had to invest a ridiculous amount of gold in order to increase the Bone Dragon Skill's Rank.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I never expected to lose money in this fashion.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, it strengthened his resolve.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to quickly take these bastards down, so I can make up for my loss.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It flamed Hyrkan\u2019s desire to hunt down the Wood Devils.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was reminiscent of the time he started this game for the first time.</span></p><br/><p>7.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">V&amp;V, Big Smiles, Blossom, Sweepers and Moonlight guilds were the 5 guilds within the Five Stars guild. \u00a0They had used their overwhelming number to extend a great deal of influence towards north and south of the Black Continent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their expansion was unlike the Stormhunters, who were simply using regions as hunting ground before they moved on. \u00a0The Five Stars were now occupying and controlling the good hunting grounds they ran across. \u00a0In recent days, the high level Users had gone past level 230, and the Highwood Forest was a very attractive hunting ground for Users, who were getting close to the higher level Users. \u00a0It was a hunting ground worthy of controlling as one of the main hunting grounds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Highwood Forest was under the control of the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it was practically impossible to govern a high level hunting ground with brute force. \u00a0If the guild wanted to catch level 230 and above monsters, the guild's highest level Users had to be mobilized. \u00a0Their main forces had to be brought forth. \u00a0This was why the weak guild members couldn't be permanently stationed there to observe and control this region. \u00a0The monitoring and management of the hunting ground was out of the question. \u00a0The lower level Users were more likely be sent back through a special delivery called Game Over to the Heard Fortress ruin town by a passing Wood Devil. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, this wasn't a location that was suitable for being managed. \u00a0This wasn't a stage meant for the low level Users. \u00a0The Users, who were able to frequent this place, had skills and a certain degree of fame. \u00a0It was hard to talk or come to an arrangement with these Users. \u00a0The guild would have to use a very big stick to be able to deliver a big punishment to those, who intruded in the forest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- How long are we going to let the Hahoe Mask operate in the Highwood Forest?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was a User where none of the normal conventions worked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was a high level User, and words didn't work on him. \u00a0Moreover, he wouldn't consider cutting any deals, and the big stick approach also didn't work on him. \u00a0He didn't have a guild that could be pressured, and no forms of pressure seems to work on him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe've already decided internally not to mess with the Hahoe Mask... \u00a0Didn\u2019t you agree about that part, Mr. Heh-bibin?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Still, there should be a limit to our patience. \u00a0The Highwood Forest is our main hunting ground under our management!\u2018 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahoe Mask. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He ignored all authority as he hunted in the Highwood forest. \u00a0Moreover, he wasn't just hunting there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Moreover, the Hahoe Mask is flaunting the fact that he is hunting at the Highwood Forest!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He is hunting out in the open! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if he was advertising himself! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The video he uploaded, in regards to the Highwood Forest, just went past 10 million views. \u00a0It just took a single day!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To make things worse, the Hahoe Mask had uploaded a video of himself hunting inside the Highwood Forest. \u00a0He had uploaded it the next day with minimal editing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask was a youtube star that could gain millions of views just from uploading a simple video of Skeletons dancing inside the game. \u00a0We was the mega star of Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was such a figure, so there was no way his Wood Devil hunting video would have a low view count. \u00a0It was popular enough to breeze past 10 million views in a single day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, as the Hahoe Mask's success continued, the Big Smiles guild looked more and more inept. \u00a0They had touted the Highwood Forest as being under the strict control of the Big Smiles, so of course, they came out looking ridiculous from this situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- You have to look at the comments below the Hahoe Mask's recent Highwood Forest hunting video. \u00a0About half of the comments are ridiculing the Big Smiles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As a sub-guild master of the Big Smiles, this was the reason why he was angry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, Heh-bibin didn't want to pay attention to the Hahoe Mask anymore.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Didn't he always take a loss every time he messed with the Hahoe Mask?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he hadn't disagreed when the guild made an internal policy not to interfere with the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the current situation was a whole different matter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- We are one of the 30 great guilds. \u00a0We are China's greatest guild. \u00a0If we allow the Hahoe Mask to treat us like this, we'll suffer incalculable damage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't care if a crazy dog barked out in the yard. \u00a0He didn't care if the crazy dog was ignored. \u00a0However, if the crazy dog entered the house to make a mess, it was a completely different story.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Heh-bibin's words weren't wrong. \u00a0When Sinclair heard his words, he agreed with Heh-bibin's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI understand. \u00a0However, the risk is too high. \u00a0If we want to catch the Hahoe Mask right now, we would have to shift a significant portion of our troops present here on the Black Continent.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't as if they couldn't catch the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask was amazing, but in the end, he was alone. \u00a0If they wanted to, they would be able to kill him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Sinclair. \u00a0You... </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo you want me to go out and fight the Hahoe Mask? \u00a0Is that what you are trying to say to me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end that was the sticking point. \u00a0It was the price one needed to pay to kill the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0A frightening cost had to be paid to catch a terrifying genius of Solo Play. \u00a0Even if one was willing to pay the price, it would be a problem. \u00a0If one paid the price, someone had to sign the receipt. \u00a0If the receipt printed out a loss, the one that signed the receipt would have to be responsible for that loss.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPolicy is policy. \u00a0I won't mess with the Hahoe Mask.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I can't believe those words came out of your mouth, Killer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Five Stars agreed to it, and the Hyrdra guild also agreed

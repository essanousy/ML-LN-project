Because Warlord\u2019s land was huge and because its hunting grounds were usually mountains or other wide spaces, it was slightly harder to run into other players. Even so, one could expect to run into others at least three, four times even in the most unpopular hunting grounds.</p><br/><p>When players met each other in the field, most felt joy before wariness. After tense, exhausting situations caused by continuous battles, players felt a sense of kinship when they met. Depending on the situation, some even chose to join parties and work together.</p><br/><p>\u201cE-Excuse me!\u201d</p><br/><p>In a hunting ground known to be unpopular, Hyrkan now ran into a group of players.</p><br/><p>To be exact, he was the one that was approached.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyrkan had recently killed a Lizardman and was currently waiting for it to melt down. Hearing the voice, Hyrkan turned to greet a female player, who he was sure he had never met before. The female player was quite a beauty. The long, straight black hair beauty was the type to easily make men turn their eyes. Hyrkan glanced at her from top to bottom.</p><br/><p>She wore a shiny, silver armor on top of a dress. Along with her straight black hair and well-designed longsword, it was easy to tell she set her items for design rather than defense. Her fashion was designed to attract other players\u2019 attentions rather than monsters\u2019.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan moved his gaze behind her.</p><br/><p>Behind the beautiful swordswoman was a short and cute priestess, and a tall, short-haired magician with foxlike eyes. He could tell that these two also focused their items on fashion. On top of this, it seemed that they went through quite a lot of trouble, as the dirtiness of their clothes caught Hyrkan\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>Finishing his observation, Hyrkan came to a conclusion.</p><br/><p>\u2018The hell is this?\u2019</p><br/><p>As Hyrkan slowly moved his sight back\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you been hunting here alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>The female player carefully threw a question.</p><br/><p>In any case, three beauties had approached Hyrkan with interest. It was a rare occurrence. No, the current situation went past the level of rare as such a thing had never happened to him in real life. Of course, there was a time when a girl was interested in him. Except, it wasn\u2019t the good kind of interest.</p><br/><p>\u2018I am suddenly remembering Choi Sulyeon that bitch.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was the first time a girl had been interested in him, and that interest had screwed over his life. Because of this, to Hyrkan, the interest of a beauty was\u2026 something he\u2019d rather decline.</p><br/><p>And so\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018What does she want?\u2019</p><br/><p>Doubt was the first thing on his mind.</p><br/><p>First of all, something like the girl blushing and asking for his number was impossible. If she were interested in him as a man, that would be even more dangerous. It wasn\u2019t just because of his appearance. Although he wasn\u2019t handsome, his appearance had nothing to do with it. After all, he was currently wearing his hahoe mask. The problem was his fashion. If she were interested even after seeing his grotesque, avant-garde fashion, it would be best if he never got involved with her.</p><br/><p>As such, Hyrkan didn\u2019t answer. He only stared at the woman through his hahoe mask. Their eyes met, and when it did, the woman\u2019s mouth bloomed into a flowery smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI watched you kill that Lizardman. It was amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyrkan still did not answer, as the woman continued her praise.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven a Ranker would be jealous of your skills. I almost fell for you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyrkan spoke for the first time with a question that couldn\u2019t be more indifferent.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, my name is Ilya.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the question, the woman first introduced herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><br/><p>At her response, Hyrkan cut his answer short. It was a form of intimidation. He would talk less and less if she dragged on. Of course, it wasn\u2019t possible to talk any less than he currently did. Thus, if Ilya kept talking, Hyrkan would ignore her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry to ask you on our first meeting\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, she cut straight to her point.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut please help us complete our quest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Ilya finished her sentence, the short priestess behind her opened her mouth as if to put in a chorus. Also, they showed puppy eyes and sorrowful expression that would easily make men do their bidding.</p><br/><p>As a man, Hyrkan\u2019s heart also throbbed. However, it wasn\u2019t the throb of interest against the opposite sex.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are these bitches for real? They\u2019re just asking me if they can leech off me.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was something one would run into at least one time in online games. The kind that asked for free rides just because they were pretty girls. To Hyrkan, the whole thing was simply absurd. If one wanted to play with girls in the VR world, it was much better to play dating sims or other adult content.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is this what the saying, \u2018all good things come to an end,\u2019 means? What is this bullshit trying to get on my nerves?\u2019</p><br/><p>In any case, Hyrkan didn\u2019t have an inkling of mind to listen to their request. On top of it being an absurd request, he wasn\u2019t in a good mood.</p><br/><p>Starting from when he ran into that Ranker-class player at Bangtz Castle to being unable to upload his current hunting videos to YouTube, he was annoyed by many things. When he finally got around to hunting some monsters on a good day, the current situation threw a bucket of cold water on him.</p><br/><p>Thus, Hyrkan replied from the bottom of his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyrkan had no interest in romance, and he was certainly not a gentleman.</p><br/><p>At Hyrkan\u2019s response, Ilya joined her hands as if to pray and lightly bowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, just help us out for this quest. We will reward you for sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyrkan simply turned away. He could tell she was the kind in which words didn\u2019t work. In a case like this, it was best just to ignore. He had never heard of someone like this changing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ilya grabbed onto Hyrkan\u2019s shoulder. At that moment, Hyrkan stopped his feet and turned around. Watching Hyrkan with a face full of misery\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cJust 10\u2026 I beg you. We\u2019ll compensate you for sure. Please help us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ilya once again beseeched him.</p><br/><p>If it was possible to cry in-game, bead-like tear drops must have fallen on her cheeks.</p><br/><p>Staring at her silently for just a moment, Hyrkan opened his tightly shut mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I just have to help you kill ten?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Ilya finally made a full smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll kill exactly ten.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>Hyrkan vowed to himself.</p><br/><p>That in this lifetime, he would never trust anyone ever again, and that he would never be with anyone ever again.</p><br/><p>This vow wasn\u2019t just a bluff to ease his bitter heart. With the knowledge he had, if he sold his pride just a little and decided to enjoy his new life, wealth and honor would have been his. Throwing such a life away, he had made the vow, prepared to walk a path of hardship.</p><br/><p>\u2018These bitches\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Would he throw away such a vow for a few beauties? It wasn\u2019t impossible, but at the very least, now wasn\u2019t the time.</p><br/><p>Then why did Hyrkan accept their request?</p><br/><p>\u2018They\u2019re swans on the outside, but hyenas on the inside.\u2019</p><br/><p>He changed his mind the moment his shoulder was grabbed. When Ilya grabbed his shoulder, Hyrkan felt he couldn\u2019t shake off her hand.</p><br/><p>It meant her strength was higher than Hyrkan\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was expected for Hyrkan\u2019s strength to be lower than a swordsman of his level. Given, the swordsman of the same level wasn\u2019t a tank-type, but a type that went all into strength.</p><br/><p>In other words, Ilya wasn\u2019t a tank. There was no way Hyrkan didn\u2019t catch what this implied.</p><br/><p>In a 3-man party, the role of a tank was vital. But a party came to a high-difficulty hunting ground like the Lizard Swamp without a tank?</p><br/><p>Their biggest mistake was asking for help on a quest important enough to give compensation. If the quest were that important, they would simply ask for help online, and skilled players would come to their aid. That, of course, was given they had the money\u2026 no, considering they appealed their beauty, money might have no meaning. There were plenty of people that would jump to help a group of beauties.</p><br/><p>Even so, they asked Hyrkan for help? It was a clear lie that they needed his help to complete a quest.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are they aiming for my left?\u2019</p><br/><p>They were clearly aiming for Hyrkan. Otherwise, there was no reason to act in such a way.</p><br/><p>That said, they wouldn\u2019t actively try to PK him. If that was their plan, there was no need to approach him the way they did. They would have simply attacked him when he was off guard.</p><br/><p>Considering the way they approached him, it was likely that they would intentionally create a dangerous situation and make monsters kill him.</p><br/><p>\u2018These bitches are even worse than those shitheads from before\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>It was a common trick. One just had to use the fact that players felt happy to meet others in the field. If a problem occurred during battle, it would be an accident, not a PK. It was a truly dirty method. After all, one would have to go through an immense amount of effort to fuck over a single person.</p><br/><p>In any case, Hyrkan wasn\u2019t the type to let off a bunch of schemers.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t in the mood.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you get caught lying, your hand\u2019s got to go.\u2019</p><br/><p>He planned to rob them clean.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go over the situation. Do you have any experience fighting a Lizardman?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve killed some before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 two. After that, we fell into the swamp. We ended up this way while running away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have a priestess and a magician. What was the problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe thing is\u2026 I can\u2019t act as a tank, so there was never a good window to use magic and the priestess\u2019s magic power just kept going down. In the end, we couldn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah, that\u2019s because you set your items to hunt people, not monsters. You\u2019re here because it\u2019s the easiest place for this scenario of yours, and once you came here, there weren\u2019t any idiots to take your bait. That\u2019s probably when I caught your attention. There\u2019s not a single truth coming out of your mouth.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan barely managed to keep his raging heart in check.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you know how to lure Lizardmen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! We can at least do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then, lure them to designated points one by one, and I\u2019ll get them. Don\u2019t needlessly interfere when I fight. The magician should only provide back up when I call for it. By the way, if the priestess buffs my skeletons, this party\u2019s finished. Got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ilya nodded her head as she said added some words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for accepting our selfish request\u2026 thank you so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Oppa*!\u201d</p><br/><p>[T/N: younger girl to an older male, like onii-san. It\u2019s also considered a sign of affection. I\u2019m sure you guys know it from Gangnam Style.]</p><br/><p>One of the other two quickly voiced her thanks, attempting to win Hyrkan over by calling him \u2018oppa.\u2019 The remaining one also slightly lowered her head. Being thanked by three beauties, any guy would grin.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan grinned as well.</p><br/><p>Except, he did it on purpose.</p><br/><p>\u2018I see these bitches grew accustomed to this. Well, I guess it can be addicting. They\u2019ll end up having to pay for it in the end, though.\u2019</p><br/><p>As Hyrkan had ideas about their real intention, he could only feel a chill at their acting skills. Once one got the taste of something like this, it was hard to stop. It was like gambling. Even though they knew it was bad, it was fun and stimulating. Because they were in a VR game, they wouldn\u2019t be punished under the law either.</p><br/><p>\u2018With their looks, don\u2019t they have anything better to do? Why do something like this in Warlord\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>At that point, Hyrkan stopped his thinking.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come to think of it; there\u2019s only a handful of sane beauties in Warlord.\u2019</p><br/><p>Thinking back, of the beauties he had met in Warlord, only a handful was normal. Choi Sulyeon who Hyrkan considered to be the greatest beauty he ever met was even more so\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck.\u2019</p><br/><p>Having remembered Choi Sulyeon, Hyrkan\u2019s mood took a dive. He remembered an unpleasant face. Because of just how beautiful she was, he couldn\u2019t easily erase her from his mind either. She was truly what he would call an enemy of a lifetime.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll lure one over here. Hold on just one moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyrkan didn\u2019t bother to listen to what Ilya was saying. He simply waved his hand back and forth.</p><br/><p>Like so, the girls headed to the swamp area.</p><br/><p>Thus started their secret plan.</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>\u201cUnni, are you just going to leech or rob him clean?\u201d</p><br/><p>At her little sister*\u2019s question, Ilya immediately answered.</p><br/><p>[T/N: not an actual little sister.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, we\u2019re robbing him clean.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he has much. Wouldn\u2019t it be better just to let him kill 10 lizards? If we coax him a little more, we could probably hunt all day for free.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the magician added her thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cNecromancer isn\u2019t a class you can do without money. You saw his fight just now, right? For his Skeleton Warriors to be so strong, he must have at least three or four Unique items.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this, Ilya added her own explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou saw his necklace right? Have you seen one with a jewel that big?\u201d</p><br/><p>The short priestess began to ponder. Although she had seen a countless number of necklaces with jewels, she rarely saw them in Warlord.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that I think of it, I haven\u2019t seen one with a jewel like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust look at his fashion. His items must be on a different level. Our profit from robbing him won\u2019t be small.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAny potential backlash? If he\u2019s so rich, there must be someone behind him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that were the case, he wouldn\u2019t be here alone. Plus, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re openly PKing him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ilya smiled deeply.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just going to be a little accident. The kind that comes from accidentally luring too many monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Watching her smile, the other two smiled as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cI always think this, but Unni must be Warlord\u2019s prettiest bitch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ilya laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m third.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not bad yourself, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the three burst out into laughter. The laughter was short. A Lizardman had found them first and was slowly walking towards them.</p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

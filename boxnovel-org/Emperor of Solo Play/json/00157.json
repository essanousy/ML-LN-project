(2)</p><br/><p>5.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- What should we do? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo asked the question again, but the answer had already crystallized in Sinclair's head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is the golden opportunity to catch the Hahoe Mask.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahoe Mask. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't an exaggeration to say the Hahoe Mask was the single most valuable being one could kill in Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018No. \u00a0I have to catch him no matter what.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to catch the Hahoe Mask before he became a bigger variable. \u00a0He had to kill the Hahoe Mask even if it was an unreasonable task.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he was given a chance to catch the Hahoe Mask, so there was no reason why he should turn down this opportunity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was only one problem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Would the Big Smiles guild really be able to kill the Hahoe Mask?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Finally, luck is with me.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They wouldn't be able catch the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The situation was completely different from the time when Sinclair went out to face the Hahoe Mask at the Cursed Castle. \u00a0At the time, the idea of the Hahoe Mask winning against Sinclair was laughable. \u00a0His Skeleton Warriors weren\u2019t even an annoyance against Sinclair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What about the current Hahoe Mask?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was useless to compare levels. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The difference in Item Setting was too large. \u00a0This was beyond the Hahoe Mask slightly exceeding Sinclair in terms of Item Setting. \u00a0Currently, no User could come close to the Item Setting possessed by the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0He had the Deposed Prince's Sword, Argardo's Armor, Secret Society's Token, Corrupted Arbiter's Ring, Corrupted Destroyer's Necklace... \u00a0He was pretty much like an end-game boss.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What about the Skeletons possessed by the Hahoe Mask?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A Hahoe Mask fan broke down a battle footage released by the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0The gear worn by a Skeleton Warrior on average was worth 23,300 gold.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this was an estimate from the time when he faced the Frost Knight. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask hadn't released the footage yet, but there was a rumor going around that he had summoned a Death Knight when facing the Skull Collector. \u00a0The rumor was from a User that had passed through the Voodook's Tunnel. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask was much stronger than the time he faced the Frost Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What would happen if the Big Smiles guild tried to hunt him down? \u00a0If this was a regular hunting ground, they would have a chance of winning. \u00a0However, this was the Black Continent. \u00a0If one moved a large group of Users, it would just lead to a war of attrition with the Monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even with all these factors against them, Sinclair thought they would be able to catch the Hahoe Mask if luck was with them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reason being...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It is fortunate that the Clover Unit is nearby.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Poker team had pulled V&amp;V guild into the ranks of the top guilds. \u00a0One of the Poker team called the Clover unit was heading toward the Heard Fortress.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Apollo's exploration team and the Clover unit can merge. \u00a0There would be a total of 40 Users. \u00a0Apollo's team can be used as bait, then the Clover unit can step forward\u2026\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He trusted the Clover team. \u00a0Sinclair's backers was the Hands guild, and they had put in a considerable effort in making the Clover unit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Sinclair thought about the final worry he had.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Hahoe Mask and the Stormhunters guild must not meet. \u00a0We have to prevent the two of them from teaming up at all cost.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He worried about the worst possible outcome. \u00a0After he worried about the possibility, Sinclair finally opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cApollo.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Yes. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair\u2019s answer was late, since he had thought over his options. \u00a0However, Apollo didn't act impatient with Sinclair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's kill him. \u00a0Let's use this opportunity to kill him.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The Hahoe Mask?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo seemed slightly surprised, so Sinclair immediately forged ahead with his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt'll be possible if you cooperate with one of the Poker team. \u00a0The V&amp;V guild's Poker team is nearby you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I'll do as you say.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His reaction couldn't be seen, but Apollo had a big smile on his face at Sinclair's answer. \u00a0The flesh on his face bunched up together as he smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's secret weapons were beyond his expectation. \u00a0They were great. \u00a0The Mini Ogre Skeleton Warriors chased down the swift runaway Users, and they tormented the Users that were caught.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When their ankles were caught by the Mini Ogre Skeleton Warriors, the Hahoe Mask appeared, and the User would give up on running away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFight me! \u00a0Fuck. \u00a0Let's see who'll win!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These Users had played the game of Warlord for several years, and they had experienced the ups and downs of this game. \u00a0The Users struggled fiercely against Hyrkan, and they showed a fiery spirit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, their fiery spirit was useless against Hyrkan's summoned Skeleton Warriors and Knights. \u00a0It was a pointless struggle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was a frightening predator.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the moment when a new mask appeared behind Hyrkan's current mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhoa.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018As expected of the 30 great guilds, they use expensive Items.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it didn't take long for this frightening predator to morph into a hyena that roamed around to find rotten meat. \u00a0Hyrkan searched the bodies of the dead Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In Warlord, consumable Items had to be carried around on one\u2019s body. \u00a0Of course, when a User suffered a Game Over, the consumable Items on one's body fell to the floor. \u00a0Even when one revived 48 hours later, the consumable Items weren't restored to the User. \u00a0Only the stored Items inside the wristwatch was retained.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Normally, the consumable Items were treated as trash Items in PK. \u00a0Everyone focused on the wristwatches. \u00a0Hyrkan also followed this behavior.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was a different story on the Black Continent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018These hunts feels different.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of the wristwatches, Hyrkan was taking the consumable Items first. \u00a0He smiled when he noticed this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hyrkan also took the wristwatches.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puhk, puhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sword he held came down on the wrists of the Users, and he took their wristwatches.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Deposed Prince's Sword is awesome. \u00a0It is great for dicing.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Deposed Prince's Sword.... \u00a0It was a masterpiece forged by the Blacksmith Olf. \u00a0It was given to heroes, who had defeated the Immoral Prince. \u00a0It was meant to be used to save the world. \u00a0If Blacksmith Olf saw his sword being praised for being a good butcher\u2019s knife, Hyrkan's stomach would be struck repeatedly by 'Olf's Hammer.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Blacksmith Olf wasn't here now, so he didn't have to worry about such a scenario.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ok.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had a smile as he looked at his full pouch. \u00a0It was as if a hamster had stuffed its food into its cheek. \u00a0This was one of the happiest smiles he had put on in the Black Continent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the smile didn't last long. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-uh-uh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Users disappeared, the monsters showed up to torment Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The role of pursuer and the pursued flipped constantly in this hunting ground. \u00a0However, Hyrkan didn't plan on bypassing these monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the riled up monsters drew aggro from the only User left alive!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan smiled as he saw the monsters run towards him without reserve.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This really is a fucked up game.\u2019</span></p><br/><p>6.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun's eyes were open as he lay on his worn mattress. \u00a0He kept staring at the old wallpaper on his ceiling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah, I want to move to a different place.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Recently, this phrase was never far from his mouth. \u00a0After getting up, Ahn-jaehyun put on his cheap horn rimmed glasses. \u00a0He reflexively turned on the Tablet PC that had been placed next to his glasses. \u00a0However, it felt as if his Tablet PC was more sluggish than normal. \u00a0He might be mistaken, but Ahn-jaehyun's expression turned sullen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, a sigh came out from his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I can't believe I've reached this point.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Money. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The thing he had wanted the most was now in plenty supply. \u00a0It was beyond plenty. \u00a0He was overflowing with money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he didn't have the free time to spend his money. \u00a0His days were scheduled into blocks, and he had to be constantly inside the game. \u00a0He didn't have the time to eat out or even order food.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In recent days, he was nervous most of the time as he went through his busy schedule. \u00a0He had built up his tower through hard work, yet he was afraid a momentary mistake would make it the Leaning Tower of Pisa. \u00a0He had to keep his schedule.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe that was the reason?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun was getting new influx of money from his paid videos and other miscellaneous earnings, yet it didn't feel like his own money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe, if he was able to recklessly spend his money on the Items within the game, he might have felt differently. \u00a0However, he hadn't done that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he unconsciously turned away from the numbers that had excited him to no end before. \u00a0He started searching for Warlord-related articles instead of looking at his his bank account.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The search words mainly focused on 5 guilds including V&amp;V and Big Smiles guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His search turned out a lot of information.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The V&amp;V, Big Smiles, Sweepers, Wul-gwahng and Blossoms guild were explicitly showing their desire to monopolize the Black Continent. \u00a0The Black Continent was the stage of the Ruined Kingdom episode, so this became a hot issue. \u00a0A hot issue always created a lot of content online.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he went through the related articles, Ahn-jaehyun clicked his tongue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Well, they obtained several ace cards they could use to attempt the monopoly. This could bring change to the final outcome.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The topic that brought the most bitterness to Ahn-jaehyun's mouth was the accomplishments of the Poker team. \u00a0They were the V&amp;V guild's strongest force.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He read the articles related to the Poker team, and he watched the battle footage they had released in the Black Continent. \u00a0He let out a bitter sneer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I thought these bastards planned on breaking all the record times for the Raids.....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Until the Stormhunters guild caught the Blaze Slime Dragon, the Poker team was still systematically attacking the record time for the Raids. \u00a0They centered their core contents around this concepts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, they were suddenly operating out of the Black Continent now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, this should be taken lightly by Ahn-jaehyun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It is quite impressive.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The 30 great guilds were able to move massive amount of money through the live channels. \u00a0This wasn't all their money. \u00a0There were backers and investors. \u00a0There were a lot of other people's money sunk into their venture. \u00a0Since the money didn't belong to them, they couldn't easily change directions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the V&amp;V guild had executed this change too easily. \u00a0This was something he should be worried about.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the V&amp;V guild would be on the opposite side of Ahn-jaehyun. \u00a0They would never help him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Recently, the Stormhunters guild was being quiet, but they had stepped onto the Black Continent first. \u00a0They could suddenly become a variable that could torment Ahn-jaehyun in the future.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahn-jaehyun took off his glasses, and he covered his face with his two hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was only one solution to this problem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If they catch my tail, it is the end of me.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to change this competition into a race.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to change it into a game where the person in first place was the victor. \u00a0It didn't matter if there were several hundred or several thousand Users behind him. \u00a0He had to make it so that there would be only one User that could reach first place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After taking away his hands from his face, Ahn-jaehyun put on his glasses as he got up from his seat. \u00a0Ahn-jaehyun went to a sink nearby. \u00a0The kitchen sink was worn and rusted. \u00a0However, there was a high quality coffee machine atop the sink. \u00a0It gave off an elegant atmosphere. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had recently purchased this pod coffee machine. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had spent a good amount of money to purchase this one. \u00a0This machine brought home the fact that he had made a lot of money recently.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, this machine was worth its cost. \u00a0He placed his stained coffee cup on the machine as \u00a0he put in the classy-looking pod. \u00a0Unlike his old acidic coffee, the new coffee was fragrant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, Ahn-jaehyun dropped the oft used grape flavored candies into the coffee.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Afterwards, he brought the coffee to his mouth, and he nodded his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmm. \u00a0It's good.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I feel like a New Yorker. \u00a0I'm glad I bought it.\u2019</span></p><br/><p>7.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ravine. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were enormous cliffs facing each other, and there was a forest in front of the ravine. \u00a0Large stone pillars arose from between the forest, and there were remains of large buildings besides the pillars. \u00a0Moreover, one could faintly see that a fortress had blocked the entry into the ravine in the past.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had saw this from far away, and he let out a big sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Hyrkan started breathing normally again, one could see 19 Skeleton Warriors and two Skeleton Knights lined up behind him. \u00a0They were in their combat-ready stance. \u00a0One could already see traces of battle on them, and it meant that a battle had been performed not too long ago. \u00a0Moreover, it was a sign that more battles was in the near future.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Hyrkan treasured this time where he would be able to take a brief breather.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018As expected, things have change from what I know.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan searched through his memories, and he thought about the first base that had been formed in the Black Continent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before he came to the past, the first base hadn't been located at a ravine. \u00a0It had centered around a lake with black water.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The name wasn't the only thing that had changed. \u00a0Basically, the stage itself had changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had held out hope that only the name had changed. \u00a0Now he decisively quashed such sentiments.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Still, it feels as if I have seen this before\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, he was looking at a stage that was different from what he remembered, but he kept having a sense of deja vu. \u00a0He tilted his head in confusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018An enormous ravine\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 Which location had a ravine as its stage?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he wasn't given time to ruminate over his worries. \u00a0His break didn't last long either.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan turned to look over his back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-uh-uh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if the monsters were letting out a roar for courtesy's sake. \u00a0The sound coaxed Hyrkan to move forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to avoid being in 2nd place.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to avoid being in 2nd place at all cost. \u00a0Before he could fully catch his breath, Hyrkan headed towards the Ruin of the Heard Fortress.</span></p><br/><p>8.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You've entered the Ruins of the Heard Fortress.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You've gained the Title 'Heard Fortress Excavator.'] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You've gained the Title 'Explorer of the Ruined Kingdom.'] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You've gained the Title 'First Discoverer.'] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Heard Fortress was in a terrible state. \u00a0However, Hyrkan was given an awe-inspiring gift for being the first visitor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was finally able to smile when he received the Titles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I avoided being in 2nd place.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had worried about the possibility of other Users coming here first. \u00a0His worry melted away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan immediately checked the fruits of his labor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Heard Fortress Excavator] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Title Effect : All Stats +15 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Explorer of the Ruined Kingdom] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Title Effect : Magic Power +20 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[First Discoverer] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Title Effect : Stamina +40, Magic Power +40 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Title Options were fantastic.

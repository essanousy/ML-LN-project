The convenience store\u2019s part-time worker tilted his head in a daze.</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun adjusted his thick glasses and spoke again.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I get my lottery ticket?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>The part-time worker snapped out of his daze and took the money. He then smoothly picked out a lottery ticket for An Jaehyun. While handing out the ticket, the part-time worker kept examining An Jaehyun\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, have I met you before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Putting the lottery ticket in his wallet, An Jaehyun left the convenience store without giving him an answer. At this, the part-time worker titled his head again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve seen him before\u2026 gah, whatever.\u201d</p><br/><p>The part-time worker shook his head and grabbed his tablet paper from the counter. He unpaused the video and watched\u00a0it with great interest.</p><br/><p>-Mr. Kim Dongsoo, how\u2019s the situation right now?</p><br/><p>-The Albino Dragon received heavy damage to his right wing. Our first objective has been accomplished.</p><br/><p>-What about the losses?</p><br/><p>-We lost five so far.</p><br/><p>-Do you think you\u2019ll succeed in killing the Albino Dragon?</p><br/><p>-The Stormhunter Guild is Warlord\u2019s greatest guild, and our Hahoe Mask team is its strongest attack team. We don\u2019t worry about success or failure. We only worry about how we\u2019ll succeed.</p><br/><p>-How romantic.</p><br/><p>-Haha. Without a bit of romance, who would suffer through such hardships?</p><br/><p>The part-time worker smiled lightly as he watched the video.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of the Stormhunter Guild. It\u2019s really the best. None of the other guilds is its match after joining up with the Hahoe Mask Guild.</p><br/><p>Following his smile was a slight sense of disappointment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a shame. If only they still had the Hero Slaughterer\u2026 what is he doing these days? Did he quit the game completely?\u201d</p><br/><p>The part-time worker once again tilted his head at this question. But that was it.</p><br/><p>Soon, he silently went back to watching more videos.</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun had long disappeared from his mind.</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck. I can\u2019t believe you can\u2019t buy a lottery ticket from your home in this day and age. Why do you have to be there in person? What, are people worried a five-year old will buy one online?\u201d</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun gritted his teeth remembering the part-time worker from just now.</p><br/><p>But his anger soon died down. He remembered the video the part-time worker was watching.</p><br/><p>\u2018Albino Dragon. Level 439.\u2019</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun had already watched the broadcast. In fact, he even bought the 30,000 won live ticket to watch the raid. The Stormhunter Guild failed four times, barely succeeding on the fifth.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I was there with my old team, I would\u2019ve killed it in first try.\u2019</p><br/><p>How sad.</p><br/><p>He was sad that the Stormhunter Guild didn\u2019t fail, and he was sad that he wasn\u2019t there participating.</p><br/><p>What he was most sad about though was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn it. If I killed that thing, I wouldn\u2019t need a lottery ticket.\u2019</p><br/><p>The value of the Albino Dragon.</p><br/><p>It was a huge pile of money. It was the highest leveled monster in Warlord so far. Each raid sold over five hundred thousand live tickets. If the raid was successful, then the edited paid video could get at least ten million views.</p><br/><p>\u2018I heard they sold over 350,000 live tickets. They\u2019re each 30,000 won to boot.\u2019</p><br/><p>A live ticket allowed someone to watch a raid in real-time.</p><br/><p>The successful raid video cost money to view, but it easily passed three million views within its first week of release. Although you\u2019re only left with about forty percent after taxes and fees, it was still an incredible amount.</p><br/><p>There was more.</p><br/><p>\u2018A boss monster in the 430s. The item cost\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Large monsters, especially boss monsters, are pretty much made of money.</p><br/><p>Dragons were especially expensive. From the bottom of their tongue to the wrinkles in their anus, every part of them was money.</p><br/><p>Their hides were used for defensive items and their bones for weapons. A dragon\u2019s heart was the greatest material for a magic weapon, its meat and organs could be used as potion materials, and its eyes sold for a hefty price to a rich collector\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018If a level 400+ unique item pops from those materials, its price would simply be whatever the seller calls.\u2019</p><br/><p>At the very least, those materials can make a level 350 gear. The price of those go by the millions. If it\u2019s over level 400 or if it\u2019s a rare rank, it\u2019d be in the ten millions. If the crafter gets lucky and pops a unique rank, it\u2019d be worth an expensive sports car. Warlord is filled with rich people who would buy something like that without blinking an eye.</p><br/><p>Taking all this into account, the Stormhunter Guild probably made about a hundred billion won with the Albino Dragon raid.</p><br/><p>That was this era.</p><br/><p>Just by killing a single monster in a game, you could earn more than a major corporation affiliate could in a whole year.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun could have been the hero of this era. Back then, if he just crawled and begged like a dog, if he sold his worthless pride and wagged his tail at that woman\u2026</p><br/><p>Or, if he didn\u2019t go crazy because of his worthless pride, if he didn\u2019t war with them over his anger at their betrayal, if he gave up and started over from elsewhere\u2026 he wouldn\u2019t be buying lottery tickets and surviving on ramen noodles like now.</p><br/><p>Bitter regrets.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018So I turned out to be the one regretting that day for the rest of my life.\u2019</p><br/><p>On that day he was betrayed, the words he yelled haunted him in his nightmares. Because of it, An Jaehyun kicked his bed sheets every night.</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun slumped his head down.</p><br/><p>\u201cGod damn it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just a bit more.</p><br/><p>If he wasn\u2019t betrayed, he would have obtained wealth and fame along with everyone else.</p><br/><p>No, the ones who betrayed him did obtain wealth and fame. Their SNS pages were filled with pictures of them riding the best sports car, going to celebrities\u2019 birthday parties, and wearing and using countless brand names.</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun was the only one swimming in the sewage.</p><br/><p>\u20185 years\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun was well past his mid-twenties. He was staring at the 30 year old mark with nothing to show for himself. He was far from any wealth or fame, and he was barely getting by with his gaming skills.</p><br/><p>Bzzz!</p><br/><p>At that time, An Jaehyun\u2019s watch vibrated. He checked its screen and held it next to his ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Taehoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Yo, Jaehyun.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><br/><p>-What are you doing lately? Still playing Warlord? You didn\u2019t delete your character or anything, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe character is still there, but I don\u2019t play it anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>-What level are you?</p><br/><p>\u201cLevel 250.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Gears?</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, don\u2019t mess with me. Or are you really curious?\u201d</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun clenched his teeth.</p><br/><p>He declared war against Stormhunter Guild and the betrayers. He fought against the world by himself.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t so bad at first. An Jaehyun was strong. No one at his level was his match. He could even win 4 on 1 against higher level players. So at first, he killed anyone he came across. His gain wasn\u2019t small either. Items from a Stormhunter Guild member were nothing to scoff at. Each kill could net him about as much as a monthly salary of a major corporation\u2019s new employee.</p><br/><p>The problem was stamina. If he died once, he wouldn\u2019t be able to play for another 48 hours. He was facing up against groups of hundreds of top level players.</p><br/><p>As a result, their difference in stamina turned into difference in levels and items. No other guild or raid team would accept him as a member, and many wouldn\u2019t even buy his items. Choi Sulyeon was a frightening woman. She overwhelmed An Jaehyun, not through the game, but through the real world.</p><br/><p>In the end, An Jaehyun gave up. When he dropped his main weapon from a game over, he quit Warlord. He hasn\u2019t played since. He just watched related videos and broadcasts.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not like he\u2019s given up on games. He looked into other VR games, but none made as much money as Warlord. He managed to get into an AOS game called The Legend, which barely gave him enough to get by.</p><br/><p>He met Jung Taehoon in The Legend. He was a broker. He connected skilled players like An Jaehyun with those hopelessly bad at gaming and collected fees.</p><br/><p>They haven\u2019t had much contact recently. Because of An Jaehyun\u2019s over-the-top skills, The Legend admins put a year-long ban to his account. Jung Taehoon was the first one to cut his contact with An Jaehyun.</p><br/><p>But now he suddenly called and poked at An Jaehyun\u2019s past wounds. It would have made anyone feel bad.</p><br/><p>-Sorry.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust get to the point. I\u2019m tired of having my hand up.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Are you perhaps interested in working at a Chinese workshop? It\u2019s 5 million won a month, excluding bonuses. All paid in cash.</p><br/><p>Hearing his words, An Jaehyun was more sad than happy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuck.\u2019</p><br/><p>A Chinese workshop. It\u2019s pretty much a sweatshop. They work people like machines, human rights don\u2019t apply. They\u2019re just human machines, their personalities and talents ignored completely. It was a place simply to make money.</p><br/><p>It was really the end of the line.</p><br/><p>People who couldn\u2019t do normal part-time jobs went there. For old celebrities like An Jaehyun, going there would be no different to selling organs. It was throwing what little pride he had left down the drain.</p><br/><p>Realizing he was at such a point, he felt sorry for himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, I\u2019m the Hero Slaughterer. I\u2019ve killed those Stormhunter fuckers 733 times, and you\u2019re telling me to go to a Chinese workshop and work like dogs?\u201d</p><br/><p>If he were going to sell his pride like this, he should\u2019ve done it a long time ago.</p><br/><p>-Come on, don\u2019t be so uptight. The conditions are great. Plus, you\u2019re probably not going to make much money off Warlord now that all the Top 30 Guilds have you on their wanted list. Your leveling stopped too. You might\u2019ve been at the top back then, but level 250 now can barely get you to the top one percent. You realize what that means, right? From the 10 million or so players, over a hundred thousand are better than you.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>-Swallow your pride and work for just one year. With your skills, you can earn about a 100 million in a year. You\u2019re going to be thirty soon. It\u2019s a whole different life from then. You should have at least a 100 million prepared.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m hanging up.\u201d</p><br/><p>-Call me if you change your mind. There\u2019s always a spot open for you.</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun lightly spun his watch dial with an expression full of anger. The call ended. He wanted to chuck his phone, but it was impossible for a watch-type phone. Even if he could, he wouldn\u2019t because of the cost.</p><br/><p>\u2018God damn it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Could things get any worse? An Jaehyun wanted his messed up life to be a bad dream.</p><br/><p>But,</p><br/><p>\u20185 million.\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to fall and give in to his life.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he had confidence.</p><br/><p>\u2018Warlord is hard for me right now, but Warlord isn\u2019t the only game. If I get that 100 million, wait until a decent game comes out, start playing from the beginning, get into the top rankings, and make a guild\u2026 given 2,3 years I could probably\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun definitely had talent. He may be socially awkward, tone deaf, hopeless at sports, and uneducated in real life, but in the game world, he had the confidence to not lose to anyone.</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun lifted his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cJung Taehoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew it was unsightly to accept an offer he had just refused, but he didn\u2019t think much of it.</p><br/><p>[Calling Jung Taehoon.]</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun put his wrist watch next to his ears, and he listened to the ringtone. It was Michael Jackson\u2019s Billie Jeans. The half-a-century old song sounded fresh in his ears.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>CRASH!</p><br/><p>A giant truck struck the bus station An Jaehyun was waiting in.</p><br/><p>-Good decision, Jaehyun! Let\u2019s do this! With these conditions, you can totally pull it off. Right? Jaehyun? Say something!</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun.</p><br/><p>He was 29 years old.</p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

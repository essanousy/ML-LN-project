After turning off the camera feature, he immediately checked his stats using his watch. Although he should have felt happy watching the numbers richer than before, his face didn\u2019t say so.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan didn\u2019t stare at his stats for too long. He turned it off soon after and turned to the Skeleton Warriors that had just finished battling. The Skeleton Warriors were walking around, picking up pieces of their body that had fallen on the ground during a fight, and fitting them inside their bodies. Hyrkan gestured his finger toward himself, the \u2018COME HERE!\u2019 type of gesture.</p><br/><p>However, the Skeleton Warriors did not react to this gesture. Hyrkan gestured again, this time pointing to the ground near his feet. The Skeleton Warriors stared at Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>In the end, Hyrkan raised his voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cCOME HERE! AROUND ME, NOW!\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did the Skeleton Warriors quickly go near Hyrkan. As soon as they gathered, Hyrkan squatted down and drew five dots on the dirt.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the Mud Troll we just killed. That\u2019s you, that\u2019s you, that\u2019s you, and that\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Hyrkan began to draw a line using the dots as a reference.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook here. If you approach the enemy from the back like this, obviously he\u2019s going to react and turn around. Then what should the left and right flanks do? Hm? If the enemy turns to the right, the one on the left can attack; if the enemy turns to the left, the one on the right can attack. Move with that in mind!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyrkan explained incessantly like a commander briefing the soldiers on his strategy.</p><br/><p>The explanation didn\u2019t end there. Hyrkan jumped up from the ground, then stretched his hands out towards one skeleton\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Whish!</p><br/><p>The Skeleton Warrior quickly dodged the attack. Because of Hyrkan\u2019s training, they were always prepared to dodge attacks of all kinds.</p><br/><p>Of course, now wasn\u2019t one of those training.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you dodged? Fine, that\u2019s good. But why did you jump to dodge before? Do you have wings? Can you turn mid-air? You can\u2019t, so why jump? Are you a frog?\u201d</p><br/><p>At Hyrkan\u2019s words, the Skeleton Warriors still stared blankly at Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>In truth, what Hyrkan was doing now was a waste of time. The Skeleton Warriors couldn\u2019t understand strategies like this. Their Combat AI allowed them to gain experience only through battles, not through speech. Hyrkan knew this as well.</p><br/><p>The reason he was doing so knowing this was as a form of self-reflection. He was explaining to himself. What went wrong and what needed work. Such self-reflections of his were rather long. Rambling on about this and that, Hyrkan graded his battle.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s just so much to fix. I wouldn\u2019t even give it a 60 out of a 100.\u2019</p><br/><p>60 out of 100.</p><br/><p>That was all Hyrkan could give to the battle just now.</p><br/><p>Of course, Hyrkan wasn\u2019t discouraged from this. He left his self-reflections as self-reflections and moved on.</p><br/><p>\u2018At least, I can praise myself for hitting level 20 12 hours earlier than I thought.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had reached level 20, his top priority goal. Plus, he finished sooner than he expected!</p><br/><p>He had created the result.</p><br/><p>\u2018With this, the advertisement\u2019s taken care of.\u2019</p><br/><p>No one would doubt someone who gave results.</p><br/><p>At the very least, people would still be judging Hyrkan\u2019s skill. During this pending status time, Hyrkan planned to control his pace.</p><br/><p>Although it was important to focus on leveling up, there were many more harvests to be had in Warlord.</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright, let\u2019s head to Bangtz Castle.\u2019</p><br/><p>Now was the time to harvest them.</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>When the high walls of Bangtz Castle entered his vision\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSlot On.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyrkan changed his items.</p><br/><p>His ugly leather clothes and unfashionable magician\u2019s hat turned to the typical fashion of the Subjugation Association\u2019s default clothing.</p><br/><p>\u2018The shit I do because of this\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>In truth, people rarely changed their item slots just for the sake of fashion. The only exception were guild uniforms. In the first place, Slot Change had a cooldown time, and players were limited to just 3. As such, it was exceedingly inefficient to fill up one slot just for fashion.</p><br/><p>Besides, Hyrkan was someone who had little to do with fashion. He would easily believe the word started with P.</p><br/><p>However, not even Hyrkan would dare to wear such leather fashion in a place full of people. He may have held it in if it was just the leather pants, but he couldn\u2019t possibly do so with both his leather top and magician\u2019s hat. Even Hyrkan found himself disgusting.</p><br/><p>\u2018Thank god I have a hahoe mask covering my face. Otherwise\u2026 uhew.\u2019</p><br/><p>In reality, his fashion helped his views and comments grow. Although most comments made fun of his ridiculous outfit, any comment was a positive sign for him.</p><br/><p>After switching his clothes, Hyrkan walked past Bangtz Castle\u2019s wide, open gate.</p><br/><p>Immediately after he stepped past the castle gate, a crowd of guild recruiters surrounded Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, why not join our guild instead of being alone? We provide you with items and hunting support.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you made it this far in that. You won\u2019t be so lucky next time, so why not join our guild? You\u2019re going to die if you walk around alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to pay to get into our guild, but it\u2019s well worth with the items we\u2019ll provide you with. Come to our guild!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, come to mine!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was incredibly annoying. Once Hyrkan snapped his hand out of one, another grabbed his wrist and asked him to join his guild.</p><br/><p>Although most players received similar treatment, it was much more intense for Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>\u2018What, do I have \u2018pushover\u2019 written on my face? Why does this always happen to me?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan was used to such treatment, but it always left him with an unpleasant feeling.</p><br/><p>In VR games, looks and physique were unimportant. Being treated so poorly with that being the case\u2026 in a way, it was truly a talent.</p><br/><p>In any case, by the time Hyrkan arrived at the Magician Class Tower, his once happy expression had turned sour.</p><br/><p>\u2018If only it were the old me\u2026 they would all be in the grave by now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Grumble grumble.</p><br/><p>Like chewing gum, Hyrkan kept complaining to himself. The reason he came to the Class Tower was evident.</p><br/><p>Free skill!</p><br/><p>In Warlord, players received a free Normal-rank skill every 10 levels. In Hyrkan\u2019s case, he received the Skeleton Fragment at level 1 and Demon Curse at level 10. It was the standard necromancer skill tree. Of course, the skill he needed to get at level 20 was decided as well.</p><br/><p>Bone Armor.</p><br/><p>It was a level 20 skill that required the Skeleton Fragment skill of at least E rank to learn. It was an all-purpose skill that could be used on both himself and his Skeleton Warriors.</p><br/><p>Most importantly, it was a necessary skill to learn for his future. Skeleton Fragment at level 1, Bone Armor at level 20, and Skeleton Magician at level 30. Only after those skills became a certain rank could Golem Summoning be learned at level 40.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll have to buy curse magic through skill books\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>As such, Hyrkan could only obtain curse magic trough skill books.</p><br/><p>However, curse magic was widespread to the point a separate class of curse magicians existed. As such, skill books were immensely costly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tsk. Money is the best alright.\u2019</p><br/><p>Thanks to his recent investments, Hyrkan had to count his food cost in 100 won units. Buying skill books were simply impossible for Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>[You obtained the Bone Armor skill.]</p><br/><p>After getting Bone Armor, Hyrkan immediately headed to Bangtz Castle\u2019s Subjugation Association Branch.</p><br/><p>When he arrived, guild recruiters began to irritate Hyrkan as if it was the most natural thing to do.</p><br/><p>This time, however, Hyrkan\u2019s face remained unchanged. He maintained his serious expression until he stepped inside the Subjugation Association Branch.</p><br/><p>\u2018The once in a lifetime opportunity is here.\u2019</p><br/><p>This matter was much more important than the free skill.</p><br/><p>\u2018I have to form a relationship with Ahimbree.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was important to obtain a skill book from Ahimbree, but Hyrkan didn\u2019t want to end their relationship there. He wanted to receive further quests from Ahimbree.</p><br/><p>Warlord\u2019s NPCs were passive. Before players asked them directly, NPCs would rarely seek out players for help. If Hyrkan wanted something from Ahimbree, he had to understand what Ahimbree wanted and dig into it. He had to understand the meaning of each and every word he spoke.</p><br/><p>It was something Hyrkan wasn\u2019t confident about. Although Hyrkan was one hell of a fighter, he was less than average in the art of conversation. If Warlord were a game like reality and NPCs were shrewd like humans, Hyrkan would have a huge problem on his hands.</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright.\u2019</p><br/><p>After resolving himself, Hyrkan waited for his turn at the Subjugation Association\u2019s counter.</p><br/><p>\u201cWould anyone like to join a level 25 Rare quest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a magician to quest with!\u201d</p><br/><p>As always, the Subjugation Association had a market-like atmosphere. When his turn came in this disorderly place, Hyrkan spoke to the NPC at the counter.</p><br/><p>\u201cI came here on Sir Botan\u2019s recommendation. He told me to show you this letter.\u201d</p><br/><p>The NPC smiled in response.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease go up to the 7th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>The situation progressed in a breeze. As soon as Hyrkan was told to do so, he headed to the staircase to head to the 7th floor. In front of the staircase leading up were NPCs standing guard. Hyrkan showed them Hotan\u2019s recommendation letter, and they immediately made way.</p><br/><p>Then, when Hyrkan was about to head up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Why are you blocking me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need an authentication.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAuthentication? Didn\u2019t he just pass by? What authentication?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat man is my friend. We\u2019re together.\u201d</p><br/><p>It became loud where Hyrkan passed by. The few players that were tailing Hyrkan were stopped by the NPCs.</p><br/><p>As soon as Hyrkan heard their voices, he knit his brows.</p><br/><p>\u2018There are hyenas no matter where you go.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a particularly nice sound. If other players seemed to be doing something special, these hyena-like players tailed them and tried to steal it from them. It went without saying that their sound wasn\u2019t pleasant to anyone.</p><br/><p>When their plans went awry, these people didn\u2019t hesitate to PK. They were sensitive to the smell of profit, and they didn\u2019t hesitate to turn to violence and ill-mannered play to get their ways.</p><br/><p>\u2018Guys like those are the most dangerous.\u2019</p><br/><p>Leaving behind the Hyenas\u2019 cries, Hyrkan headed up to the 7th floor. A hallway, filled with several doors, appeared in front of him. As he passed by each door, Hyrkan read the words written on the door.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ahimbree!\u2019</p><br/><p>Once he found the word he was looking for, he stopped and knocked on the door.</p><br/><p>Knock, knock, screech!</p><br/><p>As soon as Hyrkan knocked, the door opened, and a 360 square feet office met his gaze.</p><br/><p>\u2018What a mess.\u2019</p><br/><p>In what couldn\u2019t be called a large office, numerous books and documents were littered around the floor. Like Hyrkan described, the room was a total mess, going past the point of just being cramped.</p><br/><p>To exaggerate a little, there was only enough space for a single person to pass through, and at the end of that space was a desk and a bearded man seemingly in his mid-40s. The man was staring at Hyrkan, looking past the glasses sitting on the bridge of his nose.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan immediately bent down on his waist and introduced himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Hyrkan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m meeting THE Ahimbree.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ahimbree.</p><br/><p>He was someone Hyrkan had only seen in videos. That was how hard it was to see him.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t possible to film NPCs in private spaces like the room Hyrkan was currently in. As such, only when Ahimbree made a public appearance could players have the chance to see his face. However, he was an incredible expert incomparable to ordinary players. He rarely came out to the public. Simply put, if he ever came out, he would solve whatever problem he needed to by himself. There was nothing for players to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you\u2019re here on Hotan\u2019s recommendation.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Hyrkan finished his greeting and stood back up, the conversation began.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyrkan walked up to him and handed him the recommendation letter. After reading the letter, Ahimbree stored it in his desk drawer.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019re quite skilled. I know Hotan\u2019s standards are rather high.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe only favored me a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust because Hotan favored you, there\u2019s no reason for me to do the same, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Ahimbree asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyrkan nodded his head and smoothly continued the conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you just give me a chance, I will prove to you my skill and potential.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyrkan spoke very straightforwardly. If he acted this way in the real world, he would receive suspicious glares first and foremost.</p><br/><p>However, to Warlord\u2019s NPCs, such to-the-point straightforwardness worked. Otherwise, one\u2019s data would remain in the NPC\u2019s database for a few hours, then get erased. That\u2019s how difficult it was to establish a relationship with NPCs. Having played Warlord for so long, Hyrkan knew this better than anybody else.</p><br/><p>Of course, Hyrkan\u2019s actions worked.</p><br/><p>As he stared at Hyrkan, Ahimbree made a devilish smile, one clear enough to be seen through his shaggy beard.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy standards are incomparably higher compared to Hotan\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I cannot meet your expectations, I can only blame myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe smell of a black magician is heavy on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Ahimbree knocked on his desk two times. Then, a book rose up from the pile of books and flew towards Hyrkan like a butterfly. Hyrkan grabbed the book and examined its cover.</p><br/><p>[Madness Helm]</p><br/><p>Hyrkan tilted his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019</p><br/><p>He had never heard of the name before. It wasn\u2019t anywhere in the list of skills provided by Helgen.</p><br/><p>However, Hyrkan didn\u2019t have too much time to ponder.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is a present from Hotan. That will be the end of that.\u201d</p><br/><p>[The quest, \u2018Ahimbree\u2019s Teachings\u2019, has been completed.]</p><br/><p>\u201cNow begins my talk. I am only looking for one type of people right now, and that is someone to fight against the Power of Corruption.\u201d</p><br/><p>[The quest, \u2018Nested Egg\u2019, begins.]</p><br/><p>The successive sound of alerts caused Hyrkan to clench his fist inside his mind.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is what I love about Warlord. It doesn\u2019t throw any underhanded tricks at you.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Hyrkan\u2019s happiness did not last long.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou only have one chance. If you can\u2019t pass this test, it will be difficult for you to ever meet me again. By the way, of the ones who have come to see me on Hotan\u2019s recommendations, only 19 have passed my test.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Huh?\u2019</p><br/><p>Ahimbree\u2019s statement meant 19 others had passed the test ahead of him. Also, although 19 had passed his test, at least twice that number should have tried for the test.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was no way Hyrkan wouldn\u2019t know what this meant.</p><br/><p>\u2018Looks like I\u2019ll be stepping on a\u00a0tail.\u2019</p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

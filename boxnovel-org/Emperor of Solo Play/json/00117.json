My name is Ahmong, and I am the lead broadcaster for this week's Ranking show.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy name is Ken. \u00a0I am the broadcast assistant.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a uniquely shaped desk placed in the middle. \u00a0It \u00a0was something one would see on a news program. \u00a0Three men were sitting behind the table. \u00a0The first man had a silver armor on. \u00a0The second one had a red robe on, and lastly, the last figure wore a white priest robe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the Ahmong and Ken show.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a weekly program where they rated the contents related to Warlord. It was a popular show where it easily garnered 3-4 million views each episode.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cToday's guest is from the Triple Wings guild, and he is one of the top priests in this game. \u00a0We have Kipi-nim here today.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy name is Kipi. \u00a0I'm in charge of healing the Triple Wing guild's main Raid team from the backline. It is a pleasure to meet the viewers of the Ranking show.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The secret to the success of the show was the fact that they used their extensive personal connections to bring on guests. \u00a0Every week a User affiliated with the 30 great guilds appeared \u00a0as the main guest. \u00a0There was no reason to doubt their ability to book guests.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, the content of show was quite unoriginal aside from the guests they were able to book.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe'll immediately start the Ranking show with Kipi-nim. \u00a0What is our first ranking?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis week we are ranking the pay per view earnings ranking.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ranking show was based on provocative topics, but it was information anyone could gather on their own. \u00a0The draw of the show was the conversation shared by the personalities. \u00a0It was akin to gossiping behind other's back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this was the main reason why this show was popular.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is a very hot topic. \u00a0This is great. \u00a0Since this is a hot topic, shall we reveal the ranking from the top?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFirst place is the Red Bulls guild's Thorn Turtle raid video.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIsn't this quite atypical?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is atypical. The 30 great guilds has the regular live channel broadcasting rights, and it is possible to purchase live tickets to view the raid in real time. \u00a0Usually, this would lead to relatively low sales regarding paid videos. However, this one bucks that trend.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat's correct. Usually, there is an inverse relationship between the number of live ticket sold and the number of paid videos sold.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Red Bull's Thorn Turtle Raid sold 1.5 million live tickets, yet over 930 thousand people purchased the paid video.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf we just consider this week, 200 thousand people purchased the paid video. It is incredible. As a veteran of the 30 great guilds, I would like Kipi-nim to give a more detailed explanation on why this is occurring. Please give us your opinion on this subject.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Ahmong's question, Kipi immediately went into his explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUsually, 25 users are allowed to participate in the Thorn Turtle raid. As you all probably know, the video we just saw was completed using only 12 Users. They were extreme in cutting down the number of people participating in the Raid. \u00a0This is why the Red Bull's Thorn Turtle raid footage is worth analyzing.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is worth analyzing?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf one want to analyze a footage, one has to watch it multiple times. \u00a0This inevitably means one has to pay multiple times to view the footage. Moreover, the Thorn Turtle gives pretty good Items compared to its difficulty. It also helps that we have located 3 locations where the Thorn Turtle appears. The wait time for the hunt is pretty short.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoes this mean the Red Bulls capitalized on this information? \u00a0Did they aim for this new trend where Users are starting to analyze footage?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don't think it was done deliberately. I have no idea about the Red Bulls, but usually, these are the priorities for a guild. The first priority is to get the first kill. \u00a0The second is survival. \u00a0When one decreases the headcount of the Raid team, these two priorities are completely abandoned.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh-ho. \u00a0As expected of an active User, your explanation is very persuasive.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is a high probability that this is a training session.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTraining session? Do you guys really do such activities?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course, we do it. It is rare to do a training session by decreasing the number of Users participating in a Raid. \u00a0However, one has to do these training session purposefully to develop the ability to cope with various situations.\u201d \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I never knew the guilds operated in such a manner. You are worth the large amount of money we spent to get you here.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kipi lightly let out a fake cough at the mention of the large sum of money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, it was such a thorough explanation that it seems we won't need additional commentary on the subject. \u00a0Shall we move onto the video ranked 2nd?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhmong. \u00a0We already released the top honor. \u00a0Wouldn't it be boring to go on down the list starting from the second place? \u00a0How about we check the top honors on the other rankings?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0We'll check the individual pay per view video ranking. \u00a0Please announce it for us, Kipi-nim.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After a fake cough, Kipi looked at the Hologram window only he could see, and he calmly read off the prompt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis week's individual pay per view video ranking's top honor goes to....First One Sulwoo's Warlord Diaries. \u00a0In one week, he has an amazing record of 101,000 people buying his video.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn reality, the Perfect One is an exception to the rule. \u00a0There is a stark difference in terms of figure between him and the person ranked second.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt isn't an exaggeration to say that he is the only person, who could contend with the 30 great guilds by himself. \u00a0Of course, the 30 great guilds focus on the live tickets, and the Perfect One focuses on pay per view videos. It is comparing apples and oranges.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you agree with this assessment, Kipi-nim?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe First One's fans are so passionate about him that I have no choice, but to agree with you guys.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoes that mean you don't agree inside? Are you saying the Perfect One isn't unique?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is quite a statement.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kipi laughed awkwardly at Amohng and Ken's words. \u00a0He waved his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he was doing this, Kipi's eyes was still reading the script. \u00a0Everything they were saying and doing was scripted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI agree with you. \u00a0He is an amazing person. \u00a0I have a strange feeling that this will be edited in a weird way. \u00a0Please be kind to me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNow that I think about it, isn't there one other person, who might contend with the 30 great guilds by himself?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe is in our Ranking. \u00a0This is Hahoe Mask's debut video, and it is ranked at 11. \u00a0It is called the Christmas Tree's Nightmare, and 40 thousand people purchased it this week. \u00a0In total, it has been purchased 250,000 times.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is quite hard to achieve this amount of success on one's debut video. \u00a0However, we are talking about the Hahoe Mask, so it just makes me nod my head as if I had expected this result.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you think about the Hahoe Mask, Kipi-nim?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is there to think about? If I could play the game like him, I have nothing else I want in this world.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm not talking about such commentaries. \u00a0Do you have any rumors for us? \u00a0Everyone knows the 30 great guilds have their eyes on the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0You are part of the 30 great guilds, so do you know of any secrets regarding the Hahoe Mask?\" </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe big question on everyone's mind is what the Hahoe Mask actually looks like. \u00a0Some say he is an incredibly handsome man, and others think he is actually a she. \u00a0There are rumors that also say he is the scion of a global magnate.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you know something, please throw us a bone. The editing of your earlier comments on the Perfect One hinges on the answer you give us right now.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ahmong and Ken was skilled in volleying questions. \u00a0It reminded one of soccer players executing a perfect dribble and pass.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI haven't heard a lot of information regarding the Hahoe Mask... Ah. \u00a0I heard he has a bad relationship with the Big Smiles guild.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0Is this an attempt at revenge for the previous transgression committed by the Big Smiles on your guild? \u00a0Is this an attempt to create a schism between the Hahoe Mask and the Big Smiles guild?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs I said before, it is merely a rumor.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen let us stop talking about rumors. Let us have a serious talk about the reason behind the Hahoe Mask's popularity. \u00a0Why is the Hahoe Mask so popular right now?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kipi thought for a brief moment when he was asked the question. The question was written on his script, but Kipi came up with his own answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm\u2026\u2026 Sulwoo is named the Perfect One, because there can only be one person, who can be the best. \u00a0Hahoe Mask is the Only One. \u00a0Hahoe Mask is the only one that can show us the Hahoe Mask's style of battle.\u201d</span></p><br/><p>2.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStick to it! Just stick to it!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if they were responding to Hyrkan's shouts, the Skeleton Warriors unhesitatingly ran towards the enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The opponent was a 30 meter long Dragon with auburn scales.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In Warlord, a Dragon type monster that was 30 meters long was usually considered to be a mid sized monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this particular one wasn't classified as a mid sized monster. \u00a0This bastard didn't have wings or a tail. \u00a0The 30 meter in length was measured from its head to the end of its body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the No Tail Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a level 150 Boss Monster, and the difficulty level wasn't that high compared to the other Dragon Type monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, the Items that could be crafted out of the Ingredient Coins dropped by this monster wasn't that attractive. \u00a0This was why it was an unpopular raid amongst the big guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he considered the difficulty to be low, but it took a pretty good raid team with full preparation to be able to take this boss monster down. \u00a0The No Tail Dragon's arms were very fast. \u00a0Above all else, its arms were able to track its target very accurately.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the case right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The No Tail Dragon slammed a Skeleton Warrior to the floor with its paw. It was a sight reminiscent of a hammer driving in a nail with a single blow. \u00a0Hyrkan's Skeletons were great at dodging yet it wasn't able to dodge the No Tail Dragon. \u00a0This was evidence of the swiftness of the No Tail Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the Skeleton Warrior didn't just die.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the Skeleton Warrior was destroyed, it vomited out the Black Sap, and it splashed onto the Dragon's right paw.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-roo-roo! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A mighty cry leaked out of the No Tail Dragon's mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were three Skeleton Warriors left, and they jumped on the back of the No Tail Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The No Tail Dragon's armor-like auburn leather was a mess. \u00a0It was covered in wounds. \u00a0It almost looked as if there were more wounded locations than intact leather. \u00a0The Skeleton Warriors planted their swords into open wounds. \u00a0The hard scales had already been stripped, and the No Tail Dragon's body was all flesh now. \u00a0It didn't stand a chance against the swords of the Skeleton Warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-oohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The swords embedded deep into the body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-oh-oh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the No Tail Dragon let out a horrible shriek as it suddenly stood on its hind legs. \u00a0Then it immediately fell on its back. \u00a0It was trying to squash the enemies stuck to its back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddul-goo-ruhk, ddul-goo-ruhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the Skeleton Warriors didn't run away. \u00a0They lowered their stance with their swords embedded inside the No Tail Dragon's body. They stopped moving. \u00a0The destruction of the Skeleton Warriors was inevitable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ooh-oohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The powerful impact created a shockwave as the ground shook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-oh-oh-oh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the impact, the No Tail Dragon let out a scream as the leather on its back was dyed black. \u00a0Even its wounds were dyed black. The Black Sap pushed past the No Tail Dragon's rage, and it pushed it towards its throes of death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Is it the third phase now?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The No Tail Dragon's Rage has reached its climax.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The No Tail Dragon's Death Throes is sweeping across the surrounding!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the No Tail Dragon's last ditch effort. \u00a0It had activated a wide area debuff skill. \u00a0The wide area debuff skill was a nightmare in a raid, but it was the signal Hyrkan had been waiting for.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Circlet of Purification has protected the User from the No Tail Dragon's Death Throes.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is the last phase.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan unsheathed the Ivan's Sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'll become level 160 when I catch this bastard. \u00a0I'll graduate from using the Ivan's Sword today.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He thanked the Ivan's Sword. \u00a0It was a sword that had supported him from level 120 to his current level. \u00a0Hyrkan ran towards the No Tail Dragon. \u00a0The Skeleton Knight and the Skeleton Warriors followed behind Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This type of battle was something that could only be shown by Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p>3.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018250,000 people.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While the No Tail Dragon's corpse was melting, Hyrkan once again checked the figure of how many people purchased his video. \u00a0Hyrkan licked his lips when he saw the number of 250,000 buyers. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I never expected such a high figure.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After confirming the number of buyers, Hyrkan was in a state of disbelief.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I expected it to be around 100,000\u2026\u2026.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he was running the Hahoe Mask guild, his pay per view video debuted to the number of 30,000 buyers. \u00a0Everyone cheered when he received the figure. \u00a0He even met Kim-dongsoo on the side to celebrate by drinking alcohol.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This time around his debut video had graded out to be 250,000 viewers. \u00a0Moreover, the purchase count was increasing by the hour. The reviews from the buyers were favorable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It is doing so well that it almost makes me feel uncomfortable.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The corner of Hyrkan's mouth twitched. \u00a0He should be smiling right now, yet he was having a hard time mustering up a smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This situation was clearly a boon for him. However, Hyrkan felt a sense of responsibility instead of happiness in front of this boon. \u00a0There was a difference from getting donations from uploading a public video, and the money one earned through the pay per view video.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If my paid video doesn't measure up to expectation, everyone will try to tear me down.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt the difference in expectation deep in his bones when Hyrkan ran the Hahoe Mask guild. \u00a0He had experienced the result of becoming complacent. \u00a0This was why he didn't let this result swell his head as he prepared to climb to higher places.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The No Tail Dragon Raid was part of the preparation process. \u00a0He planned on uploading the No Tail Dragon raid as a public video.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'll keep putting up free videos to maintain the views on my page. I'll produce the paid videos on the side. \u00a0Which monster should I catch for my next pay per view video.... If I upload a public video right after a pay per view video, wouldn't my intentions be too transparent? Should I upload one that I shouldn't expect a huge profit? Or maybe I should make a weekly diary like the First One?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0This is annoying.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After worrying over his options, Hyrkan let out a voice of frustration.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, he had been worried for several days as he worried about how his paid video would do. \u00a0It was like worrying about a grade when the grade hadn't come out yet. \u00a0When a good grade had come out, it put more burden on him to do better next time. \u00a0He felt a sense of pressure.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This sentiment had manifested in the No Tail Dragon raid. \u00a0If it was before, he would have only thought about how to kill it. \u00a0Now he had to catch it in a way that it would look good on film. \u00a0He had to worry about that now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the midst of a raid, he couldn\u2019t just pause the raid at a scary part just to re-shoot something \u00a0he didn't like.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is what I hate the most.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before he returned to the past, he had suffered quite a bit from stress. \u00a0He would go through much hardship to catch a monster, but accidents were bound to happen.

He felt some joy as he viewed these lists.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he hadn't revealed his identity when he put up the Item up for sale. \u00a0If it was known that Hyrkan had the Circlet of Purification, the parasites would gather around him. \u00a0It would mess him up from conducting his business. \u00a0Of course, he had to edit out the part where he had used the Circlet of Purification in the No Tail Dragon Raid video.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Still, isn\u2019t this a bit too popular? \u00a0Why are the Hydra guild, Red Bulls guild, and the Stormhunters pushing so hard for this Item?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Circlet of Purification was up to the task in healing his sour insides. \u00a0The deals being proposed was much larger than he had expected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was true for the guilds Hyrkan considered to be the 3 great guilds. \u00a0Their offers couldn't even be compared to the rest of the 30 great guilds. When everyone was yelling out a bid of a thousand dollar, the 30 great guilds would yell out 5,000 dollars, and the 3 great guilds would yell out 10,000 dollars. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Moreover\u2026\u2026.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Who the hell is this guild?

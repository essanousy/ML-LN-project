Once one stepped on one, there was bound to be a next one. It was just that it was hard to bridge the gap between the two stones.</p><br/><p>As such, the most important thing in main scenario quests was to step on the first stone. If this came too late, the whole quest progression would be slowed. It was obvious, since a slow start could only mean a late finish.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyrkan, I thank you for the peace and stability you have helped us obtain. It is because of this that I entrust you with this mission.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, the first step Hyrkan just made was incomparable to anything else.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince I started working as Bulkas Mountain Range\u2019s Ranger, I\u2019ve fought with monsters countless times to complete the mission given to me. Recently, there has been a rise in number of monsters that know how to use weapons.\u201d</p><br/><p>Maoong.</p><br/><p>His well-groomed beard coupled with his large build made him look like Santa Claus to Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>With no way of knowing what Hyrkan was thinking, Maoong continued on with his serious speech.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnless those monsters suddenly grew talent for making weapons, they must have gotten them from somewhere. While we were looking into the cause of it, we discovered a suspicious place. I would like you to investigate this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. Won\u2019t the Bulkas Rangers be better suited than me for such a task?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a reason behind it. Of course, I don\u2019t want to force you to do anything. You are our, the Bulkas Rangers\u2019 friend, not my subordinate. The choice is yours. How about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Hyrkan heard what he wanted to hear from Maoong, he didn\u2019t say no. </p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always seen the Bulkas Rangers in respect and I\u2019ve always been thankful of them for their effort in keeping everyone safe. If you are entrusting me with a task, I would of course accept it,\u201d </p><br/><p>[The quest, \u2018Maoong\u2019s Test\u2019, begins.]</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s finally here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan yelled in delight. Just to himself of course. He didn\u2019t have any intention of making the same mistake as he did with Ahimbree.</p><br/><p>Maoong took something out from his sleeve and handed it over to Hyrkan. Hyrkan carefully accepted it, as Maoong immediately told him what it was.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a map.\u201d</p><br/><p>What he received was a map of the Bulkas Mountain Range drawn on a piece of leather.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh yeah!\u2019</p><br/><p>To Hyrkan, it was no different than a treasure map.</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>[Maoong\u2019s Test]</p><br/><p>\u2013 Quest Rank: Unique</p><br/><p>\u2013 Required level: None</p><br/><p>\u2013 Quest content: Bulkas Ranger\u2019s captain, Maoong, has given you this mission. This mission is a test to prove your ability.</p><br/><p>\u2013 Quest reward: From Maoong\u2019s collection.</p><br/><p>A Unique-rank quest.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is 100% the real thing.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was a sure tell sign that it was a main scenario quest. As soon as he saw the rank, he nodded his head. To an extent, he was certain that Maoong\u2019s Test was the starting point of the main scenario quest. When he saw the quest rank, his 99% confidence level turned into 100%.</p><br/><p>Then, Hyrkan\u2019s eyes naturally fell to the word \u2018collection.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Collection\u2026 what could it be?\u2019</p><br/><p>He knew how the Immoral Prince quest would work out. Even so, there was no way for him to know every little detail of each quest. Even if he knew the big rewards, he didn\u2019t have the brain power necessary to remember every single quest reward along the quest line.</p><br/><p>Of course, he knew it wouldn\u2019t be anything small. For example, there was no way a Unique rank quest would just give 100 gold as reward.</p><br/><p>\u2018If it\u2019s a Chronicle Unique, I\u2019ll fly to Japan and get some Wagyu beef. Mark my words.\u2019</p><br/><p>Chronicle Unique would be more than what he could ask for.</p><br/><p>No matter what it was, Hyrkan probably wouldn\u2019t be disappointed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if it isn\u2019t, there\u2019s no problem. Just killing the Bear Warrior should give me about a thousand gold.\u2019</p><br/><p>Bear Warrior.</p><br/><p>Although it wasn\u2019t anywhere on the quest content Maoong gave him, Hyrkan knew it would be the monster he had to kill.</p><br/><p>Its level was 80.</p><br/><p>It was 4 meters tall, rather small compared to what one might imagine. It walked on its two hind legs instead of on fours. In fact, it was even equipped with armor and helmet, and held a sword and shield on each of its hands.</p><br/><p>It even had special battle abilities similar to a swordsman\u2019s Charge and Shout.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see. I\u2019ll get at least two Bear Warrior set items from it\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>As hard to kill as it was, the reward it gave was definite. Boss monsters dropped more items than normal. What was worth the most was the Bear Warrior set, a level 70 Rare rank item set. Its options were quite good. Moreover, killing a single Bear Warrior guaranteed enough crafting jewels to craft at least one Rare item. If one was lucky, he would get enough to make 3.</p><br/><p>\u2018I know this won\u2019t happen, but if it doesn\u2019t drop any crafting jewels like that piece of shit monkey, I\u2019m going to sue Tobot Soft.\u2019</p><br/><p>Plus, its bones, skins, and weapon fragments were used to make Normal rank level 70 items. This also gave quite a bit of money. At this point, a level 70 Normal rank item would go for at least 100 gold. Although the Bear Warrior didn\u2019t drop as many coins since it was a mid-small sized monster, it still dropped enough to make 10 items.</p><br/><p>Of course, the real deal was the raid video.</p><br/><p>A Bear Warrior hunting guide had not yet been made. Bear Warrior wasn\u2019t a boss monster that one could randomly run into in the field. It was a monster that required the Bulkas Ranger quest progression to meet. The first video of any boss raid practically had 1,000,000 views guaranteed, even for a no-name. For someone like Hyrkan who was already well-known, it could become his new most viewed video.</p><br/><p>All in all, Hyrkan would not have to worry about losing out by killing the Bear Warrior.</p><br/><p>As long as he could succeed in killing it, he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about money.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, if he failed to kill it, it would have a big impact on Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>\u2018As long as I don\u2019t make any mistakes, there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll fail.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan made a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u2018Though, I\u2019m not sure how well not making any mistakes would go.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>While Hyrkan was on his way after leaving the Bulkas Ranger Village, he noticed them.</p><br/><p>\u2018Just my luck.\u2019</p><br/><p>There were hyenas on his trail. They weren\u2019t there from the start. They had started following him sometime after he left the village. Once they caught sight of Hyrkan, they began to stealthily follow him.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m not wearing my hahoe mask, yet they\u2019re following me\u2026 they don\u2019t look like they know who I am though.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was no way they knew who he was. Currently, Hyrkan wasn\u2019t wearing his Skeleton Snake set and hahoe mask, but a run-of-the-mill magician robe.</p><br/><p>It was a disguise.</p><br/><p>The fact that Hahoe Mask Hyrkan was currently active in the Bulkas Mountain Range was a fact anyone could learn by just googling \u2018Hyrkan\u2019 and \u2018Bulkas.\u2019 It was Hyrkan who uploaded the hunting guide on Bulkas Mountain Range\u2019s Sword Monkeys after all.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan wasn\u2019t an idiot, and there was no way he wouldn\u2019t disguise himself unless the situation called for it. Although he had been treated as a pushover because of it on several occasions, it was better than being targeted after being known as the Hahoe Mask Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>In any case, the fact that they were chasing him meant they were after a player walking about alone in the Bulkas Mountain Range. It wasn\u2019t the first time Hyrkan was in such a situation.</p><br/><p>\u2018What should I do?\u2019</p><br/><p>If it was any time else, he would only make a move after the other side made their move first. However, he was currently on an extremely important quest.</p><br/><p>It was different from the usual circumstance.</p><br/><p>As such, it was time to do things a bit differently.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to take care of them somehow.\u2019</p><br/><p>No matter what, he had no intention of going to the Bear Warrior\u2019s place with his tail still being bitten.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan first turned and headed off to another direction. He began to move so it was hard for his pursuers to follow him, and he purposely passed by monsters to make it difficult for them to stealthily chase after him. Because of it, they came out of hiding and began to openly chase after him. </p><br/><p>When they made their appearance, Hyrkan stopped, and his pursuers then stopped as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve met before. Do you need something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyrkan was the first to talk. However, no one gave him a reply. All three people staring at him maintained their silence. Meanwhile, Hyrkan examined them carefully.</p><br/><p>\u2018Three swordsmen. Average items and classic style weapons. They don\u2019t seem to be anything special.\u2019</p><br/><p>After coming to his conclusion, he asked again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf our destination is the same, you guys can go on ahead. No need to gain suspicion by being all sneaky.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Hyrkan\u2019s words, they still did not respond. They only talked quietly among themselves. </p><br/><p>\u2018What should we do?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What should we say?\u2019</p><br/><p>Because of the silent surrounding, Hyrkan could faintly hear what they were talking about, and he couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p><br/><p>\u2018They\u2019re complete amateurs.\u2019</p><br/><p>Here, Hyrkan made his move.</p><br/><p>\u201cWarlord sure is full of trash. Don\u2019t they have anything better to do with their money? Why don\u2019t they use that money to donate to a political campaign or something? If they have so much to spare, just use it to wipe your dirty asses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he was only talking to himself, each word was spoken loud and clear.</p><br/><p>It was a provocation.</p><br/><p>And their reaction\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What did you just say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were just going to let wait and see, but you\u2019re asking for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa. Looks like you don\u2019t know who we are. I\u2019ll rip that mouth right out of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was exactly what Hyrkan wanted.</p><br/><p>\u2018Heh, it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve gotten a reaction like this.\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment Hyrkan saw their reaction, he could be 100% certain of one thing.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t from a proper guild or party affiliation. Even the Top 30 Guilds didn\u2019t hesitate to tail someone and take whatever information they had. In fact, they were quite good at it. Because they were, they knew how to deal with situations like these. They either ran, negotiated, or killed. In any case, they knew exactly what to do.</p><br/><p>One thing they didn\u2019t do\u2026 was being provoked so easily and say something like \u2018do you know who my father is?\u2019 Those who did would quickly be abandoned by their guild.</p><br/><p>That could only mean they were from a mediocre guild.</p><br/><p>\u2018Since they\u2019re here, they probably aren\u2019t complete trash. They should at least have played for a long time.\u2019 </p><br/><p>Hyrkan didn\u2019t need to think for long. Since they were from a mediocre guild, there was nothing to worry about.</p><br/><p>Especially when he was facing idiots who were so quickly provoked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to know who you are, but considering that\u2019s all you can say in a 3 on 1 situation, you must know you\u2019re a bunch of losers. Ah, let me ask you one thing. You didn\u2019t forget to wear your adult diapers before logging in, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018what\u2019? I\u2019m saying you\u2019re going to end up shitting yourselves in fear by the time I\u2019m done with you. You better brace yourselves for when you log out.\u201d</p><br/><p>He just had to provoke them a little more.</p><br/><p>\u2018Was it too childish?\u2019</p><br/><p>With a pretty laughable provocation, Hyrkan began to fiddle with his watch. In an instant, he was prepared to change his items. </p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026 on second thought, the diaper thing was probably too much. They can\u2019t be that stupid to fall for something so childish\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course, Hyrkan was pleasantly proven wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck it, let\u2019s just kill him.\u201d </p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what he\u2019s got up in his sleeve though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho cares? It looks like he was avoiding us for a while anyways. Let\u2019s just kill him.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a bit of whispering among themselves, they introduced themselves. </p><br/><p>\u201cYou fucker, you\u2019ll pay for messing with the Apollo Guild!\u201d</p><br/><p>Apollo Guild!</p><br/><p>The moment Hyrkan heard those two words, he reflexively charged at them like a 100-meter dash runner.</p><br/><p>\u201cSlot On!\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until a bit later that Hyrkan began to reminisce about the Apollo Guild.</p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

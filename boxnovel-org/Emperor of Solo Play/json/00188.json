While both sides battled to whittle down the number of each side, eight teams started boring holes through the horde of monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Drill through! \u00a0Drill through!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Strikers carry the Priests and Magicians in!\" </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hurry up and get in there!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A large amount of the force started to be sucked through the holes. \u00a0Then the Users started to build another wall as they stood with their backs towards the Barbarian King. \u00a0It looked as if they were protecting the Barbarian King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We are in place!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-After solidifying your position, I want the Healers to stick close to the Tankers!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-You guys take charge of columns that break away!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"If the situation is desperate, the Magicians should use magic to regain the Aggro!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-This is for the Magician Team. \u00a0Please hold back from using AOE magic. \u00a0It has to be Target Magic. \u00a0I will say this again. \u00a0Please hold back from using AOE Magic. \u00a0We have to make a ring. \u00a0You guys have to fight the battle through Target Magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was called the Donut Plan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a plan devised to stop the monsters, who had come out to protect the Barbarian King, from returning to the Barbarian King. \u00a0The Tankers would block off the route back. \u00a0A wall had to be formed. \u00a0The Barbarian King would be at the center. \u00a0The Users and monsters would form a donut shape around it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the crux of the plan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The Hahoe Mask is getting ready.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The empty hole in the middle of the donut would be the stage where the Hahoe Mask and the Barbarian King would fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The start was announced by the Bone Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Bone Dragon flew high in the sky, and it was the first to attack the Barbarian King. \u00a0It was 20 meters long, and the enormous Bone Dragon was terrifying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was made using a level 220 Dragon type boss monster, so it was well worth its cost. \u00a0\u00a0The Ingredients cost tens of thousand of gold.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Bone Dragon landed in front of the Barbarian King, and the remaining monsters near the Barbarian King charged forward. \u00a0All the large monsters stuck to the enormous body of the Bone Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After several seconds\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-gwah-gwah-gwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was thousand Bone Explosives planted inside the Dragon\u2019s body, and in a flash, all the monster sticking near the Bone Dragon was swept up in the explosion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the signal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The Hahoe Mask is on the move!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the signal was given, Hahoe Mask started running. \u00a0He started to run towards the wall that was paved with the lives of Users. \u00a0The Skeleton Warriors was close behind Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a flash, the group jumped over the wall made by the Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh oh oh!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It\u2019s the Hahoe Mask! \u00a0Hahoe Mask-nim looked at me!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He didn\u2019t look at you. \u00a0He looked at the monster in front of you!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You are the only one we trust, Hahoe Mask! \u00a0Please kill the Barbarian King!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahoe Mask and the Skeletons flew over their heads like sparrows in flight. \u00a0The Tankers, Priests, Strikers and Magicians gave him words of encouragement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahoe Mask left the cheering Users behind as he ran towards the Barbarian King. \u00a0The number of monsters charging towards the Hahoe Mask was few in number.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Bone Dragon had been used as bait, and its suicide bombing had taken out most of the \u00a0miscellaneous monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Warriors were in charge of taking care of the leftover monsters. \u00a0While Hyrkan reduced his speed, the Skeleton Warriors charged past Hyrkan to kill the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several Skeletons unhesitatingly charged towards their master\u2019s biggest enemy. \u00a0\u00a0They fearlessly charged towards the Barbarian King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Barbarian King had done nothing up until now, but it moved in reaction to the Skeletons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hoo-ooh-oong!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The long nose of the Barbarian King was swung like a whip. \u00a0In just a single swing, two Skeleton Warriors approaching the Barbarian King was broken into pieces. \u00a0However, one was able to dodge, and it approached the feet of the Barbarian King. \u00a0The Skeleton Warrior stabbed the Gem embedded in the Barbarian King\u2019s armor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was able to hit the Gem only once.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the Skeleton Warrior finished its single attack, it was immediately grabbed by the Barbarian King\u2019s hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek, kwah-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton had been equipped with the Bone Armor and the Tattoo Scorpion set. \u00a0However, it was crushed in an instant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The Skeleton Warriors were impregnable against most monsters here, yet they were easily broken. \u00a0They were like toys in the hands of the Barbarian King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Warriors exploded as they let out the poison of the Tattoo Scorpion, yet it had no effect on the Barbarian King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Gwah-ahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The explosion, which had erupted in the Barbarian King\u2019s hand, was somewhat effective. The Barbarian King\u2019s hand was frozen. \u00a0The Bone Explosive held the Transcendent Rank Ancient Power, Legendary Rank Ancient Power, Mythos Rank Ancient Power and the Power of Frost. \u00a0It froze the Barbarian King for 3 seconds. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The 3 seconds was a golden opportunity. \u00a0\u00a0Hyrkan threw his Bone Spear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Bone Spear flew towards the shoulder armor, and it embedded itself in a red-colored gem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was surprisingly accurate!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was no time to marvel at Hyrkan\u2019s accuracy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a fight against time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Users wouldn\u2019t be able to last too long against the monsters. \u00a0Moreover, the Skeletons and other summonable familiars wouldn\u2019t be able to last long against the Barbarian King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to destroy 31 Protection Gems in a short amount of time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the very least, the Protection Gem needed two hits to break it. \u00a0This meant he needed to attack it 62 times to destroy all the Gems. \u00a0If each attack took a minute, one had to spend an hour in destroying the Gems.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Hyrkan stayed in place. \u00a0He knew what he wanted to do. \u00a0He\u2019ll let out an all-out attack on the Gems. \u00a0In a flash, he would strike the Gems with his Bone Spears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was a genius.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the stage of the virtual reality game, his skill and talent was unparalleled. \u00a0He was an extraordinary genius, who defied all common sense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he was a Magician, Ballista would probably have to give up his nickname to Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan\u2019s spear flew in a tight arc. \u00a0It was once again embedded in the armor\u2019s Gem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-hwaht!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The first Protection Gem was destroyed.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A Gem had been destroyed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Boo-oh-oh!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the Barbarian King let out a cry that could only be made by a beast with the nose of an elephant. \u00a0The sound went on for a long time as if it was a boat horn.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan unconsciously spoke towards it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Come at me! \u00a0Let's end this!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">15.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-He made his move.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the fierce battlefield, the Strikers attempted Armor Breaking, while the Tankers held the monsters at bay. \u00a0When the Armor Breaking was done, the Magicians sent their magical spells against these monsters. \u00a0The Priests busily moved around to save as many lives as they could.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In such a battle, the members of the Hands guild had been calmly killing the monsters. \u00a0The order came to the nine Users, who had hidden themselves amongst the crowd.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had given a reasonable effort at killing the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They abandoned their spots.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They started walking. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They moved towards the ring being maintained by the Users, who were sacrificing their lives.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hey!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Someone called after them, but they acted as if they couldn\u2019t hear the person. \u00a0They redoubled their efforts to reach the stage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, they couldn\u2019t do as they pleased. \u00a0There were Users tasked with dealing with changing variables, and these Users blocked the paths of the Hands guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hey. \u00a0This place is off limits.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"At, that is......</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The members of the Hands guild paused as they looked at the Users in front of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They weren\u2019t thinking about whether they should fight or not.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were think of a way that\u2019ll allow them to kill the Users in front of them as soon as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As they were pondering such thoughts, they looked closer at the opponents barring their way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a flicker of recognition.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Red Bulls?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Stormhunters?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They finally realized, who was blocking their path.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">17.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were over 200 Users gathered in the Bizma Plain. \u00a0This large group was hidden as they looked at the battle. \u00a0A User wearing red robes also looked at the battlefield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he watched the battlefield, a phone call arrived.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hello?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-Hatch!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As soon as he picked up the phone, he heard an angry shout. \u00a0However, he didn\u2019t frown or sulk when he heard the angry shout. \u00a0Instead, he put on a smile as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah. \u00a0Who is this?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Are you planning on breaking the contract of nonparticipation!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The caller was Horus.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hatch knew who was calling. \u00a0He had answered the call knowing Horus had called him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah. \u00a0What are you talking about?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-You dare...... \u00a0How dare you double cross us like this?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Double cross? \u00a0Do you know who I am?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-Hatch!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are we on friendly terms? \u00a0Did we actually form a contract?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-You son of a bitch! \u00a0Do you think you\u2019ll be able to get away with this?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m asking, because I really don\u2019t know what you are talking about. \u00a0What did I do wrong? \u00a0You said I did something wrong, yet you don\u2019t have a contract. \u00a0Do you have any evidence that\u2019ll stand in the court of law?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-You bastard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah. \u00a0If you want to talk in more details, you can call up our guild\u2019s lawyer. \u00a0We have a really expensive lawyer on retainer, so you shouldn\u2019t do anything rash against us. \u00a0Ah. \u00a0I\u2019m recording our current conversation. \u00a0You might be called to court some day, so you should be careful.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he ended the call, Hahui approached Hatch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Who called you?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah. \u00a0It was my girlfriend.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch answered in a flippant manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahui had a horrified expression on her face. \u00a0It was beyond description. \u00a0Hatch was taken aback when he saw her expression. \u00a0\u00a0Her expression was filled with shock, and she looked as if the world was about to fall all around her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No, it was someone I know. \u00a0It was a joke.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Normally, he would tease her, but Hahui\u2019s expression was too incredible. \u00a0Hatch unconsciously stopped himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You surprised me!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Hatch\u2019s explanation, Hahui\u2019s expression changed instantly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She put on a murderous expression again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahui had on her usual expression, and Hatch was able to come to his senses. \u00a0He responded in his usual manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why were you surprised when I said I had a girlfriend? \u00a0This is strange. Are you interested in me? \u00a0Do you like me?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of answering, Hahui glared at Hatch. \u00a0The one to end this weird spectacle was Shir.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Was it the Hands guild?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As soon as he answered the question, a User quickly approached them. \u00a0It was a User wearing an imposing helmet with horns. \u00a0It was none other than the guild master of the Red Bulls. \u00a0It was Matador Chev.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We\u2019ve engaged with the Helpers of the Hands guild.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir immediately asked a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What\u2019s the result?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"They are still in battle...... \u00a0They are a tough opponent. \u00a0\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I want you to show them your skill. \u00a0If you can\u2019t do this, there was no point in me paying an exorbitant amount of money to purchase your guild.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chev let out an awkward smile instead of answering her. \u00a0He was in a spot now where he had to follow her every order. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t just ignore her words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019ll do my best.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Chev\u2019s answer, Shir turned her head instead of answering him. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were at the Bizma Plain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She looked at the Hahoe Mask, who was dancing with the Barbarian King on a stage made by the Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch carefully spoke to her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What will you do if the Hahoe Mask turns down the offer?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We\u2019ll go with our other plan.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then\u2026\u2026 It\u2019ll be war with the Hahoe Mask\u2026\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir didn\u2019t answer him. \u00a0She looked at the battlefield with an expressionless face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">16.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan hadn\u2019t used all his cards yet. \u00a0Every time he was put in danger, he took out a card. \u00a0When the 50 Skeleton Warriors he brought initially was turned back into Skeleton Fragments, Hyrkan summoned the Skeleton Knights.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Knights were on their Skeleton Steeds, and they fearlessly fought against the Barbarian King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hit and run!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Knights used the mobility of the Skeleton Steed as they performed at optimal level. \u00a0A less knowledgeable person would probably mistake the Skeleton Knights as Death Knights. \u00a0In other words, it was evidence that Hyrkan\u2019s Skeleton Knights had gone through countless high level battles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If it wasn\u2019t for Hyrkan, the Skeleton Warriors and Knights wouldn\u2019t have such excellent battle AI.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was deeply moved.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if he was a parent looking at his children excel in a brilliant manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, at a certain point, he stopped himself from being impressed. \u00a0In the end, the Skeleton Knights could only stall for time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Eventually the Skeleton Knights exited the field, and the Golems started to appear in order. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The four Golems borrowed the appearance of Ogres using the Clay Play Skill. \u00a0The Golems were large enough to rival the size of the Barbarian King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the Golems couldn\u2019t hold out as long as the Skeleton Knights. \u00a0The Barbarian King\u2019s trunk was powerful enough to destroy the Earth Golem and \u00a0Ice Golem with a single blow. \u00a0The demonic spirit of the Barbarian King ate away and crushed the Iron Golem. \u00a0The Fire Golem was the most pitiful out of the bunch. \u00a0The Barbarian King ignored the flames created by the Fire Golem. \u00a0The Fire Golem\u2019s fire was like a flame atop a birthday candle to the Barbarian King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the time bought by the Golems was precious. \u00a0Hyrkan was able to summon the Death Knight thanks to their sacrifices.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After appearing, the Death Knight fought the Barbarian King as if to avenge the Golems.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knight was the only one that was able to fight on equal grounds with the Barbarian King. \u00a0The Death Knight didn\u2019t retreat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Death Knight appeared, the [Undying] Skill was immediately activated, and it awoke more Skeleton Warriors and Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton underlings took form again, and they expressed their undying will towards the Barbarian King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Thank you.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was deeply moved by their efforts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Thank you.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was thankful of the exploits of his Skeletons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The 31st Protection Gem was destroyed.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was able to destroy the 31st Protection Gem. \u00a0It was 48 minutes into the battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan opened his mouth for the first time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The 2nd Phase is starting.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan\u2019s voice had been low. \u00a0A person next to him wouldn\u2019t have been able to hear it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The 2nd Phase is starting!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he had spoken through his Voice Talk program.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The 2nd Phase is starting!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The 2nd Phase in starting!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-The 2nd Phase is starting.!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was like an echo. \u00a0The same phrase filled the battlefield in seconds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan manipulated his watch. \u00a0He set his watch on the second slot, and he immediately yelled out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Slot On!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Goo-roo-roohng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, the heavens let out a sound of warning.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

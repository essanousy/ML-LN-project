Thanks to the caffeine, An Jaehyun\u2019s slow head began to roll.</p><br/><p>\u2018So there\u2019s 3 potential areas.\u2019</p><br/><p>Bring an egg from a nest!</p><br/><p>Although it sounded like an absurd quest, An Jaehyun had his ways from his long time experience with Warlord.</p><br/><p>First, he narrowed down the potential areas. Ahimbree was currently staying in Bangtz Castle. Then, it was likely that the quest area was located near Bangtz Castle.</p><br/><p>From here, the words \u2018egg\u2019 and \u2018nest\u2019 were extremely helpful hints. The target monster was likely to be birds, reptiles, or insects.</p><br/><p>\u201cCave Snake Cliff, Lizard Swamp, Sawtooth Ant Tunnel.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amongst numerous hunting grounds near Bangtz Castle, only three fit the requirements. Of course, these were only the known hunting grounds, and it is possible for there to be hidden hunting grounds. In the first place, players did not disclose the best hunting grounds to the public. Whether it be guilds or players, they used whatever means necessary to monopolize good hunting grounds.</p><br/><p>Luckily, An Jaehyun already knew where to go.</p><br/><p>\u2018Cave Snakes are over level 50, and you have to be around level 40 to hunt Sawtooth Ants.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Cave Snake Cliff was a level 50 hunting ground, and the Sawtooth Ant Tunnel was a level 40 hunting ground. Even if one of them was Ahimbree\u2019s testing place, An Jaehyun couldn\u2019t do anything about it now.</p><br/><p>Then, there was only one choice left.</p><br/><p>\u2018It has to be the Lizard Swamp.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lizard Swamp.</p><br/><p>That would be his next destination. It was a place a level 30 monster called Green Lizards appeared.</p><br/><p>The hunting ground itself wasn\u2019t bad. Given An Jaehyun\u2019s abilities, although Lizard Warriors may be difficult, Green Lizards weren\u2019t a problem. Plus, lizards weren\u2019t monsters players preferred. They were rather difficult to kill for average players. This was because they fought like human beings, just like werewolves. Not only that, but they also carried weapons and wore armors.</p><br/><p>It was possible to kill them if need be, but no players went out of their way to make it more difficult for themselves.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, they were good targets if one knew the hunting method and had the skills to back it up. Even if it weren\u2019t for a test, it would have been a fine hunting ground for An Jaehyun.</p><br/><p>As such, it could be said that he was killing two birds with one stone. He would be leveling up and investigating the quest.</p><br/><p>The problem was\u00a0filming.</p><br/><p>\u2018If it was Ahimbree\u2019s quest area\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Any videos from the Lizard Swamp hunting ground was likely to be investigated.</p><br/><p>Also, Hyrkan had already revealed receiving the Rising Star title through his video. Someone confirmed to have the Rising Star title appearing at what\u2019s expected to be Ahimbree\u2019s testing ground? It was a good scenario to be suspected.</p><br/><p>Even back then, An Jaehyun only slid by because he was wearing the Subjugation Association\u2019s default clothes. If he were wearing his hahoe mask, he would have been suspected whether he accepted the left handshake or not.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Those shitheads are making this harder than it has to be.\u2019</p><br/><p>In truth, An Jaehyun had not expected to be worrying about such things. He was fine with hyenas. In fact, it would have been stranger for there to be no hyenas considering the scale of the quest he was doing.</p><br/><p>However, what was on his tail weren\u2019t hyenas. What was worse was that An Jaehyun didn\u2019t know whether they were lions or tigers.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who are they?\u2019</p><br/><p>One thing was for sure; they were predators.</p><br/><p>\u2018White Mamba set\u2026 there\u2019s no way he\u2019s just a high-leveled player. He has to be a Ranker.\u2019</p><br/><p>But he didn\u2019t know what species they were. It wasn\u2019t just because An Jaehyun couldn\u2019t remember them.</p><br/><p>Looking at just the options, it would be hard to say that the White Mamba set was an incomparably amazing set. However, 3 guilds had collaborated to kill the White Mamba, and a famous designer had been hired to make the set. Same bags would have different pricing if one had a brand name logo on it.</p><br/><p>Usually, items like these weren\u2019t sold at a known price. Guilds would give out these items as presents to their sponsors or friends, or they would keep it as a symbolic uniform.</p><br/><p>In other words, it was easy to trace back.</p><br/><p>However, that man couldn\u2019t be traced back. Someone wearing such a pompous set didn\u2019t leave any trace of himself online. If he came from a famous guild, An Jaehyun could relax and act accordingly, but it wasn\u2019t the case now.</p><br/><p>That was why An Jaehyun was so excessively cautious.</p><br/><p>His intuition was telling him so.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s no way someone who tests people like that has a clean background.\u2019</p><br/><p>If he were part of the Top 30 Guilds or forces that rivaled them, he wouldn\u2019t have acted as he had.</p><br/><p>He would have revealed his guild and offered up a trade. Even that should have been done by a messenger, not a Ranker. High-level players invested most of their playtime in hunting. It was a waste of time to talk and negotiate with suspicious players.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s no way he\u2019s from the Top 30 Guilds. I\u2019ve never seen any of the Top 30 Guilds act like that.\u2019</p><br/><p>From An Jaehyun\u2019s standards, he wasn\u2019t from the Top 30 Guilds.</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2019s part of some organization, though\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>But he was sure that he was part of an organization. The other player who had been hiding while Hyrkan was talking was proof.</p><br/><p>With those unfit to be part of Warlord\u2019s world going after him, An Jaehyun\u2019s headaches were only justified.</p><br/><p>Irritated, An Jaehyun scratched his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Why do I have to worry about this? I have enough on my hands with just the game alone. I\u2019m going to go crazy because of bitches like that Choi Sulyeon. Where did these weird shitheads come from?\u2019</p><br/><p>Nothing is easy in this world.</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun once again remembered the saying.</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>Lizard Swamp.</p><br/><p>This hunting ground that most players avoided was located north of Bangtz Castle. Based on travel speed of most players, it was situated about 5 hours away. It wasn\u2019t a short distance. No one was interested in doing a cross country run without actual gaming.</p><br/><p>It was the same for Hyrkan. It wasn\u2019t likely to run into a pleasant surprise just because he rushed to the Lizard Swamp. It was better to take care of things on the way there.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyrkan\u2019s current action of fiddling with a Skeleton Warrior\u2019s head was also part of \u2018taking care of things on the way there.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018So I just have to draw it here?\u2019</p><br/><p>After messing around with the head for a little bit, Hyrkan used magic. He drew a cross-shaped seal on the back of a Skeleton Warrior\u2019s head, and the cross made its appearance with a scarlet glow.</p><br/><p>The seal?</p><br/><p>\u2018Next, I have to activate the magic.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was, of course, the Unique magic skill, Madness Helm.</p><br/><p>After drawing the seal, Hyrkan slapped the Skeleton Warrior on the back of its head. The Skeleton Warrior then stepped forward, scratching its head as it stared at Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>At that moment,</p><br/><p>Whoosh!</p><br/><p>Hyrkan\u2019s left fist flew like an arrow towards the Skeleton Warrior\u2019s head. It was a perfect jab. Delivered with absolute conciseness, it looked as if his fist moved separately from his body.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan didn\u2019t just throw a jab. He stepped forward and closed their distance as he did.</p><br/><p>Even so, the Skeleton Warrior tilted its head and dodged the jab. As it did, the Skeleton Warrior immediately distanced itself from Hyrkan. Watching this happen, Hyrkan let out a light smile.</p><br/><p>\u2018I know I\u2019m the one who taught it, but it grew well.\u2019</p><br/><p>In the past, it would simply get hit. Even if it did dodge, it only dodged the jab.</p><br/><p>Now, however, it even distanced itself and prepared for the next to come.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, Hyrkan\u2019s blows were much faster than when he was level 10. Being able to react to such a fast attack showed how far it had come. It was the result of Hyrkan training them for over 30 minutes every day.</p><br/><p>Next problem.</p><br/><p>\u2018Will it maintain its evasion even with the Madness Helm buff?\u2019</p><br/><p>One could tell from just its name that Madness Helm was far from the word \u2018calm.\u2019 Once a Skeleton Warrior received this buff, even a complete newbie would guess that it would turn aggressive.</p><br/><p>For most summons, excessive aggression was a merit. However, it was different for Hyrkan\u2019s summons. It was fine to turn aggressive, but it had to maintain Hyrkan\u2019s teachings. If it were only aggressive, it would have gone back to square one.</p><br/><p>\u201cHelm On.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyrkan chanted.</p><br/><p>Immediately afterward, the scarlet seal on the back of the Skeleton Warrior\u2019s head glowed.</p><br/><p>Crack!</p><br/><p>Along with a strange sound, two horns the size of adult male\u2019s fists sprouted out from the Skeleton Warrior\u2019s head. The blue flames in its eyes also turned red as they grew. The flames blazed, seemingly about to burst out of its eyes at any moment.</p><br/><p>Finally, the Skeleton Warrior opened its mouth. It looked like it couldn\u2019t control its blood boiling, though such a thing should be impossible.</p><br/><p>Watching the Skeleton Warrior, Hyrkan smiled. Then, he pulled out his sword from the scabbard on his waist.</p><br/><p>Ching!</p><br/><p>With the sound of a sword being pulled out, Hyrkan charged towards the Skeleton Warrior with all his power. He closed the distance in one breath and swung his sword with the intent of severing the Skeleton Warrior\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Swish!</p><br/><p>The sword made a crescent trace as it swung through the air.</p><br/><p>The Skeleton Warrior dodged the swing by lightly tilting its head back. Hyrkan didn\u2019t watch the scene. The moment the Skeleton Warrior tilted its head back, Hyrkan used the swing\u2019s centrifugal force to spin his body. Using his left foot as a pivot, his right leg drew a circle. Hyrkan\u2019s right foot approached the Skeleton Warrior\u2019s body with a heavy sound.</p><br/><p>Whish!</p><br/><p>The Skeleton Warrior dodged the spinning back round kick by bending its body backward. After tilting its head and bending its body backward, the Skeleton Warrior straightened the bow-bent body once again.</p><br/><p>Watching this, Hyrkan stopped his movements.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh?\u2019</p><br/><p>What entered Hyrkan\u2019s eyes was the appearance of a Skeleton Warrior that did not falter back and stood its ground.</p><br/><p>\u2018It won\u2019t back off?\u2019</p><br/><p>Knowing no retreat on a battlefield*. [TN: Korean idiom]</p><br/><p>Although it would evade attacks, the Skeleton Warrior was determined never to retreat.</p><br/><p>Watching this, a big smile appeared on Hyrkan\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u2018This could be useful\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>As the popularity of Warlord increased, its guilds, including the Top 30 Guilds, struggled to recruit more people. With this shortage of manpower, it went without saying that guilds raced to recruit promising players. [TN: \u2018promising player\u2019 here and in other places is the same word used for the \u2018Rising Star\u2019 in the Rising Star title.]</p><br/><p>Lately, the competition to recruit these \u2018promising players\u2019 was fiercer than ever. What caused this were the words \u20181 year anniversary.\u2019</p><br/><p>In Warlord, it was difficult for latecomers to catch up to the front-runners. In such situation, the words \u20181 year anniversary\u2019 served as a mental cutline. It is impossible for anyone starting after the 1 year anniversary to catch up to the Rankers! Such was what all Rankers believed.</p><br/><p>In other words, promising players recruited before this 1 year anniversary were the last rookies who could challenge the Rankers.</p><br/><p>Such was the background story behind why Choi Sulyeon was currently looking through a list of players with potential. She looked over the selected players\u2019 battle videos and history. Most were players who were known to be skilled in other games and had now gotten used to VR games.</p><br/><p>Their talent and potential couldn\u2019t be called bad.</p><br/><p>However.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s over 10 million people in the VR game world now. How come there isn\u2019t a single useful one?\u2019</p><br/><p>Choi Sulyeon was unsatisfied with the list of promising players. She didn\u2019t look satisfied either.</p><br/><p>In truth, it wasn\u2019t her job to go over promising players one by one. Although she watched YouTube videos from time to time, it was more for a change of pace than for recruiting promising players. With that being the case, she couldn\u2019t be happy with the current situation.</p><br/><p>No one entered her eyes. Looking for a gem in a pile of stones was only worthwhile if a gem was found. With nothing but stones, it was hard to find the motivation.</p><br/><p>In response to Choi Sulyeon\u2019s thorny complaint, her secretary, Park Suji, quickly worked her brain.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young miss is more annoyed than usual. She must have a standard in mind.\u2019</p><br/><p>As a secretary of 5 years, Park Suji quickly figured out Choi Sulyeon\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there someone you have in mind?\u201d</p><br/><p>At her question, Choi Sulyeon knit her brows.</p><br/><p>Did she have someone in mind? She did.</p><br/><p>Except, the skilled players in her mind belonged to other guilds.</p><br/><p>Desiring them was no different than desiring bread within a painting. The money wasn\u2019t the problem. Amongst the Top 30 Guilds was a gentleman\u2019s agreement. At the core of this agreement was player transfer. It was fine if it was something both sides wanted, but a one-sided theft meant war.</p><br/><p>But other than these skilled players, there was no one she had in mind.</p><br/><p>No\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018What was it?\u2019</p><br/><p>She remembered a face. No, it was hard to say \u2018face.\u2019 After all, she had never seen his face.</p><br/><p>There was only one thing she knew.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahoe mask.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Park Suji tilted her head, while Choi Sulyeon finally understood the cause of her irritation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a guy wearing a hahoe mask who uploads videos to YouTube. Look him up. Get rid of the data for these other guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hahoe mask.</p><br/><p>With just one clue, Park Suji nodded her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, miss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, did the Helpers respond yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat an amazing bunch. The audacity on those guys\u2026 oh well, we\u2019ll contact them first. Ask them exactly when and who they\u2019ll dispatch. We\u2019ve got a raid soon, so get an answer as soon as possible. If they\u2019re late, you can threaten them with my name.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, miss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, I\u2019m going to work out in 30 minutes so tell the trainer to get ready. I\u2019ll eat afterward, what\u2019s the menu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Korean beef steak salad. The coffee is the Jamaica Blue Mountain you wanted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s all.</p><br/><p>With that, Choi Sulyeon\u2019s complexion changed. She made serious, grave expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe President?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t said anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hasn\u2019t said anything. Hearing that, a slight smile came out of her stiff expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like father and mother aren\u2019t saying anything since Warlord\u2019s getting so popular. Feels like just yesterday they tried to force me into marriage just because I was spending some money on a game.\u201d</p><br/><p>After reminiscing for a bit, Choi Sulyeon got up from her seat. As she was wearing her thin pajamas, her glamorous, model-like figure showed. Seeing her figure and look, her secretary, Park Suji, felt envy from the bottom of her heart.</p><br/><p>\u2018Life sure is unfair. I don\u2019t know who it\u2019s going to be, but whoever marries the miss in the future must have saved a country in his past life.\u2019</p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\">r |\u00a0\u00a0| </p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

Northland's Item was melted by Blacksmith Olf, and he made this new weapon. \u00a0The mysterious power possessed by the relic of ancient times was imbued within it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Hyrkan finished the Immoral Prince Raid, he received the three Items in succession.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the Item Options of the Items he had received was immediately revealed online.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Hul. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Huhk. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Fuck. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reaction regarding the three Items were honest. \u00a0The reactions seemed a bit bland. \u00a0\u00a0However, everyone were too surprised at that moment. \u00a0The Item Options were beyond what they could have imagined. \u00a0It was incredible. \u00a0It made one think the Option was copied from a different game. \u00a0This was the reason behind their reaction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was especially true for the 'Deposed Prince's Sword'. \u00a0The response was very hot, since there were only 10 of them in existence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Isn't the Options on the Deposed Prince's Sword a cheat?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- This isn't some additional Stat Options. \u00a0They slapped all the Percentage Options on it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Fortunately, these Items can't be traded. \u00a0If it could be traded, I would have died from an ulcer in my stomach.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 Even if it was possible to trade it, I wouldn't have even been able to buy it even if I sold my house.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 I think one needs to sell a building instead of a house if one wants to buy it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- What level Boss Monster would one have to catch to create a Unique Item with comparable Options?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 I think it would have to be at least level 250.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were only 10 of these Items in existence. \u00a0People were also having a hard time accepting this fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was the main beneficiary of receiving these incredible Items, so it was nearly impossible for him to Spec Up through purchasing Items now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was also true in regards to his Skeleton underlings\u2019 equipments. \u00a0He had already put on the best possible Items for his Skeleton underlings before he had faced the Immoral Prince. \u00a0All their weapons were Unique Rank Items. \u00a0On top of it all, the Skeleton Knight was equipped with the 'Black Cobalt King's Sword'. \u00a0It was an expensive Item that even \u00a0wealthy Users balked at the price.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why there was only one avenue he could pursue to Spec Up using his money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The level 150 Curse Skill [Curse Infection] is worth 20 thousand gold. \u00a0The market price for the Skill Book [Malignancy Curse].... \u00a0It is worth 50 thousand gold?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was at the Item Depository. \u00a0It was the location where one could receive one's purchased Skill from the auction in real time. \u00a0This was why this location was filled with Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask he normally wore was off. \u00a0Hyrkan was in disguise as he came here with his original appearance. \u00a0Hyrkan had a big frown on his face. \u00a0It had been caused by the market price of the Necromancer-related Skills that were put up on auction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The market price for the Curse Monk Skill is insane. They want 50,000 gold for a skill book. \u00a0Crazy Bastards.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, the only way to visibly Spec Up through money was to purchase more Skills. \u00a0Hyrkan was well aware of this fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, when he was faced with the prospect of purchasing these Skill Books at market price, he suddenly became parched.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had made the resolve to improve, but these Skills were too expensive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018At least, there are high level Curse Skills available for purchase. \u00a0The other Skill Trees....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Curse Skill Books were expensive, but at least, the were on sale. \u00a0There were no Skill Books up for purchase for the Summon Skill Tree and the Body Reinforcement Skill Tree. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Do I have a choice, but to buy the No Name Skill Books?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, he was left with one solution. \u00a0He'll purchase the No Name Skill Books, and he'll activate them!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The market price for a level 150 Skill Book is around 5,000 gold. \u00a0The level 160 No Name Skill Books are worth 10,000. \u00a0The level 170 No Name Skill Books.... There are none.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the method that had been used by Rich Lich. At the time, Rich Lich was the pioneer for the Necromancer Class, and he bought up all the No Name Skill Books until the market dried up. \u00a0This was how Rich Lich gained his skills. \u00a0Of course, he wasn't able to gain all the Skill he wanted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The No Name Skill Books were a lottery ticket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Skill Book is activated, one had no idea which Skill would pop up. \u00a0If one was lucky, one could get a Rare or Unique Rank Skill. \u00a0However, it mostly gave normal Rank Skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it was more expensive than a normal Skill book. \u00a0The ones above level 170 couldn't even be purchased, since there was no supply.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Well, this is normal.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn't anything out of ordinary. \u00a0The No Name Skill books usually appeared as a Dungeon Reward. \u00a0Currently, the Dungeon hunts were enjoyed by Users under level 170.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, the Users over level 200 only participated in hunts that were conducive to efficiency. \u00a0They refrained from Dungeon hunts. \u00a0If one was already over level 200, it meant your growth speed was abnormal. \u00a0This basically meant one\u2019s process in leveling up so fast was also abnormal. \u00a0The Users over level 200 right now didn't enjoy the process of playing this game. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were just going through the motion to reach the result they desired.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'm the crazy one \u00a0for expecting to find a Skill Book over level 180.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The pinnacle of this abnormal process was represented by the First One Sulwoo and the Hahoe Mask Hyrkan. \u00a0At the very least, Hyrkan didn\u2019t have the right to complain about the current situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he calmed his breathing, Hyrkan discreetly clicked on the No Name Skill book. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's hand hesitated when a new window saying, 'Will you purchase this?', popped up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is driving me nut.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He knew the price of Skill Books were expensive, and he also understood the reason behind the high price.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he didn't jump the gun on his decision. \u00a0A Skill Book purchase was different from purchasing Items. \u00a0One couldn't resell it. \u00a0When the Skill was gained, it was instantly consumed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was already overpriced in the first place, and there was a chance one would be pouring money down the drain. \u00a0If a person had a good head above their shoulders, one wouldn\u2019t participate in this waste. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hyrkan would hesitate. \u00a0It meant he was of sound mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, those who operated at the highest stage of Warlord almost never paid the fair price as they proceeded to conduct wasteful purchases.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was struggling with his decision. \u00a0In the end, it meant he had reached a stage where he wouldn\u2019t be able to survive if he didn\u2019t spend recklessly. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Bring it on.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan touched the Hologram Window.</span></p><br/><p>5.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Level 150 No Name Skill Book x 10.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Level 160 No Name Skill Book x 5.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He spent a total of 100,000 gold. \u00a0He would have never fathomed in the past of using such an enormous amount of gold. \u00a0Hyrkan lined up the purchased Skill Books at the corner of his Item Storage, and he activated the Skill Books one by one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Skill Book's identity is revealed.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Will you learn the Bone Spear Skill?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan unconsciously let out an exclamation when he saw the first result.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone's gazes headed towards Hyrkan, who had let out an exclamation. \u00a0However, their gazes didn't stay long on him. \u00a0Hyrkan wasn't wearing his Hahoe Mask. \u00a0If he had let out an exclamation with his Hahoe Mask on, the atmosphere of this place would have become markedly different. \u00a0Some would approach Hyrkan to find out what had happened, and they would have been surprised when they saw what Hyrkan had gained.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was that good.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Bone Spear. \u00a0Isn't this a very good skill?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a level 150 Summon Skill named Bone Spear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the upgraded version of the Bone Explosives. \u00a0It was similar to the Bone Explosives in the fact that bones were consumed as ingredients whe making it. \u00a0The bones could be made into spears, and these spears could be thrown. \u00a0It wasn't an AOE attack. \u00a0It was a targeted attack. \u00a0In terms of pure attack power, it was much higher compared to the Bone Explosives.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, it was possible for the Skeleton Warriors to throw the Bone Spears. \u00a0If several dozen Skeleton Warriors could throw the Bone Spears like javelins at the same time....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is my day!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The thought of it gave him goosebumps.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, on the other hand, he would be expending much more money every time he used the Bone Spears compared to the Bone Explosives.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan didn't worry about that part right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had gained a hard to acquire Skill on the first try!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's expression had changed for the better.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have a good feeling about this. \u00a0I'll just activate it all right now.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The price he had paid in purchasing the Skill Books were no longer inside Hyrkan's head. \u00a0Hyrkan immediately activated the second Skill Book.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Will you learn the Curse Resin Skill?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's bright expression dimmed a little bit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018\u2026\u2026I should have expected a dud. \u00a0It could have been worse.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan wasn't flustered. \u00a0He calmly activated the third Skill Book.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Will you learn the Curse Resin Skill?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFuck!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A curse word came out of Hyrkan's mouth. \u00a0Everyone's gaze turned towards Hyrkan again. \u00a0However, their gazes didn't last long. \u00a0Instead, there were a little bit more sneers directed at Hyrkan. \u00a0Games were all like this. \u00a0Many people felt joy from other's misfortune.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Why the hell is the Curse Resin coming out twice!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Curse Resin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a level 150 Normal Rank Curse Skill. \u00a0It's effect was simple. \u00a0It creates a Resin that\u2019ll apply a Curse if touched.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a vacuum, the combat effectivity wasn\u2019t too bad. \u00a0Usually, Curse skills had a condition on had to fulfill to get it to work. \u00a0Basically, one had to pierce through the other\u2019s defensive gear. \u00a0The wounding of the flesh would have to occur if the Curse was to work. \u00a0In the case of Voodoo Pictograph, he had to stick to the enemy, and he had to draw out a character. \u00a0With this in mind, it was more easier to splash liquid onto one\u2019s enemy to activate the Curse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, none of the Curse Monks used the Curse Resin Skill. \u00a0They didn't use it even if they had learned the Skill. \u00a0When the Skill Proficiency was at Rank F, the Curse effect was decreased by 40%. \u00a0It basically meant the Skill shouldn't be used until the Skill Proficiency was increased. \u00a0However, one couldn't raise the Skill Proficiency if one didn't use it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, there was a Skill that was better version of this one. \u00a0There was a level 160 Rare Skill where a Cursed Puppet was summoned. \u00a0This Cursed Puppet automatically sticks to it target, and it places a Curse on the target.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why the current market price of the Curse Resin was only 500 gold!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan got fucked over two times in a row to the tune of 4,500 gold.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It can't happen a third time. \u00a0Can it?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan activated his 4th Skill Book.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Will you learn the Curse Resin Skill?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan got fucked over three times in a row to the tune of 4,500 gold.</span></p><br/><p>6.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I bought 170 thousand gold, and now I have about 30 thousand gold left....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He kept the Skills he needed, then he put the other Skill Books on auction. \u00a0Hyrkan's expression wasn't that great.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it couldn't be great. \u00a0He had invested over 100 thousand gold into purchasing 15 Skill Books, and there were merely 2 Skill that was useful to him. \u00a0In the end, he had to use 70 thousand gold to purchase the [Curse Infection] and the [Malignancy Curse] Skills. \u00a0This basically was a concession that meant he wasn't confident that he'll be able get those Skills through the No Name Skill Books.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, he was able to gain two Skills named [Bone Spear] and [Black Heart]. \u00a0In the case of [Black Heart], it was a Skill that Hyrkan really needed. \u00a0However, it would be difficult to use it in battle immediately. The efficacy of the Skills weren't that great compared to the Magic that was consumed. \u00a0It would be something he could use in a pinch, but it wouldn't be used as one of his main Skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018A good first draw always leads to a worse draw\u2026\u2026.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan became silent for a brief moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was true that he had succeeded is his Spec Up. \u00a0However, it didn't feel great. \u00a0He felt crappier than the time he bought the Life Vessel skill for 100 thousand gold.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was to be expected. \u00a0Even if a person was very wealthy, it didn't feel great to lose money at a casino.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When a person is confronted with this situation, the person had two choices.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could frown then he could just chalk this up as a shitty day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Or\u2026\u2026. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The gold I currently have... \u00a0I have around 15 thousand gold.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since he already started this, he should see it to the end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan didn't show an inkling of hesitation. \u00a0He was like a trained assistant that quickly bought Items from auction. \u00a0He purchased the level 160 No Name Skill Book for the price of 12 thousand gold. \u00a0Since Hyrkan had already purchased all the No Name Skill Books worth 10 thousand gold, the only Skill Books left were the overpriced ones.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan didn't see 2 thousand gold as money anymore. \u00a0He had already spent close to 200 thousand gold right now, and the two thousand gold wasn't enough to break his streak of purchases he made in spite.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan immediately purchased the Skill Book from the Auction House. \u00a0Hyrkan received the sent Item through the NPC at the Item Depository. \u00a0He placed his palm on top of the Skill Book.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several Users had been watching Hyrkan activate his Skill Books. \u00a0They snickered as they saw a process that had been dubbed the Skill Gamble.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018That User's eyes are about to flip backwards.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It seems another User will give up on this game.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If you gamble in this game, you'll bring ruin to yourself.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Users started to feel joy from Hyrkan's misfortunes. \u00a0However, their expression changed when they saw the expression on Hyrkan\u2019s face. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Huh?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What the hell?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's surprised expression started infecting the faces of the surrounding Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan couldn't help, but yell out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe [Chivalry] appeared!\u201d</span></p><br/><p>7.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Clover team will move aside and the Spade team will move in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- They are fast.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Yes. \u00a0If we maintain this speed, we'll finish the raid with 6 minutes.... \u00a0Ah! \u00a0When I started to speak, player Hoka rushed in! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- He is going for the winning move. \u00a0It seems he will attach himself to the Blood Ogre's body to cause direct damage. \u00a0It seems he wants to decrease the completion time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Isn't that dangerous? \u00a0Isn't it safer to do Damage Dealing with magic? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- He is trying to decrease the time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- What? \u00a0Even if we keep the same pace, wouldn't we be able to achieve the new record?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- From my perspective, he isn't just aiming for a new record. \u00a0He wants to achieve a new record time that no one dares to challenge again.

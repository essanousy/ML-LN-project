A bolt of thunder fell towards the ground. \u00a0Everything stopped when the sound of the thunder was heard. \u00a0It was as if someone had pressed the pause button. \u00a0All the several thousand small battles going on in the battlefield stopped for a brief moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the battle started again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'What happened?'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Was the Hahoe Mask able to dodge it?'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Did he succeed?'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, at that moment, the Users in battle only had one thought.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Did the Hahoe Mask dodge the Storm Judgement? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If it had occurred as planned, he would have dodged the Judgement. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, was he able to plant the Storm Judgement on the Barbarian King?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The answer came.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Hahoe Mask succeeded on the first one!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It came out through Voice Talk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hell yeah!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wow. \u00a0I got goosebumps right now.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Bullshit. \u00a0You don\u2019t have goosebumps. \u00a0We are within the game.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is a figure of speech.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ok. \u00a0Let\u2019s do this! \"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The Hahoe Mask succeeded!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A shout akin to a thunder exploded forth from the battlefield. \u00a0Everyone started shouting for the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan had barely avoided the thunder, and he walked near the Barbarian King\u2019s heel. \u00a0Hyrkan swallowed the sigh of relief from coming out of his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'\u2026\u2026wow.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the alert announcing him being the target of the Storm Judgement popped up, the three second countdown had started.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Three seconds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a short amount of time where one could let out a long sigh once, and the time would be up. \u00a0He had only a brief amount of time. \u00a0The enemy could stomp him, beat him to death with its trunk or squeeze him to death with its grip. \u00a0However, he had to charge forward towards his enemy despite the danger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No explanation was needed. \u00a0Even if one was able to give a detailed explanation, it was something that wouldn\u2019t be believed unless one saw it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bolt of thunder fell, and at that moment, the thunder struck the Barbarian King. \u00a0Hyrkan slipped to the side, and for a moment, the world became yellow and white.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had goosebumps. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His body shuddered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'This is awesome.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he had a smile on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'If my timing was off by one second\u2026 \u00a0No, if it was off by .5 second, I would have been sent to heaven. \u00a0It wouldn\u2019t have matter what setting I had on.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hahoe Mask was wearing fabric clothes. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The full set was worth 500,000 gold, and it was called the Thunder Mage set. \u00a0Moreover, he was wearing the Circlet of Purification.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had ignored physical defense. \u00a0This setting was solely put on to increase his resistance against the thunder as much as possible. \u00a0The Circlet of Purification was chosen to sidestep the inevitable Stun effect that would arise when hit with the Storm Judgement. \u00a0He didn\u2019t know if it\u2019ll work against the Storm Judgement, but he decided to equip it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His combined outfit was incredibly pricey, and this set would give him one chance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Theoretically, It meant he could survive one hit from the Storm Judgement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, when he witnessed the Storm Judgement, Hyrkan\u2019s intuition gave a different assessment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'There won\u2019t be a next time.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had spent an enormous amount of money as a precaution, yet he realized it wouldn\u2019t play a role in this battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t rely on it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to think of it as him fighting the battle with his bare body. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to think of this as his last and only chance at this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Storm...... \u00a0I really have a bad relationship with anything that starts with Storm.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The funny part was the fact that useless thoughts filled his mind at his most desperate situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Barbarian King extended its hands towards Hyrkan. \u00a0Hyrkan dodged a hand. \u00a0Then he kept dodging.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hweek hweek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Barbarian King\u2019s attack was akin to a boxer jabbing with his fists.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan dodged them all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Barbarian King became frustrated at the nimble Hyrkan, so it brought up its trunk up high before it swung the trunk downward like a whip.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Gwah-ahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan threw his body to avoid the Barbarian King\u2019s elephant-like trunk. \u00a0It had come down like a bolt of lightning. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he didn\u2019t run away too far. \u00a0He had to maintain a certain distance. \u00a0If he was too far away, he wouldn\u2019t be able to get close to the Barbarian King when the Judgement starts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Storm Judgement is heading towards you.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[3... 2...]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Announcement popped up, Hyrkan dove between the Barbarian King\u2019s legs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jjuh-juh-juhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The thunderbolt impacted on the Barbarian King\u2019s body. \u00a0At that moment, Hyrkan could feel it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'It is a lightning rod. \u00a0If a thunder strikes near the Barbarian King, the Barbarian King will absorb everything.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He realized he didn\u2019t need to be too fine with the timing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As expected, this was the method that had to be used to defeat this monster. \u00a0Moreover, this leniency was a little bit of courtesy given by Warlord to the User, who carried out this method.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Fuck. \u00a0I\u2019m so thankful that tears are coming out.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was serious. \u00a0The courtesy almost brought him to tears, and as if to pay back this courtesy, Hyrkan once again engaged the Barbarian King. \u00a0While Hyrkan confronted it, he looked at the status of the Barbarian King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Barbarian King\u2019s body looked a bit charred, but it was still imposing. \u00a0He didn\u2019t know how many times he would have to repeat this action. \u00a0The 31st Raid team had succeeded in this method thrice before they gave up on the Raid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It could be three, ten or twenty times. \u00a0It could also be 31 times to mirror the number of Protection Gems possessed by the Barbarian King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan gritted his teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'There\u2019s no tree that won\u2019t fall if you strike it 10 times. \u00a0It would be great if Warlord\u2019s AI knew this adage\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zzuh-juhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the 11th Storm Judgement. \u00a0It let out a fierce thunderclap as it fell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if this sound had been the signal. \u00a0The two groups on standby moved at that moment. \u00a0They had been far away, but in short order, they came close to the wall of Users protecting the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Users saw the two groups approaching, they looked at them with suspicion. \u00a0Their glares turned into a look of shock.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It's the Stormhunters!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It's the Red Bulls!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were two enormous guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Red Bulls had been the dragon hidden under the water until now. \u00a0The Stormhunters guild had been at the forefront of leading this era.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two guilds didn\u2019t hide their emblems as they charged towards the stage where the Barbarian King was present.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling had been going around taking down Users and monsters trying to approach the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0The news was quickly delivered to Whistling\u2019s ears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Of all the\u2026.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He knew disrupters would come. \u00a0In truth, there had been couple disrupters here already. \u00a0However, he would have never imagined that the Red Bulls and the Stormhunters fell into the same category. \u00a0He didn\u2019t know about the other guilds, but he had thought these two guilds had the pride and self respect that came with their position in the 30 great guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'As expected, they are putting profits above all else?'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he understood why they were doing this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The 30 great guilds of Warlord were organizations that were mostly driven by profit. \u00a0They were basically companies. \u00a0Their goal was to make money through this game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To them, the Barbarian King Raid was worth\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the very least, it would be a figure normal people would balk at. \u00a0It was probably an enormous amount of money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways, the worst case scenario had just occurred.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'How long will they be able to last?'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was sure of it. \u00a0It was impossible to stop them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, could they draw out the fight?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fact that he was having such thoughts was the height of arrogance. \u00a0Whistling, Yojori, Joba and all the regular Users could only buy some time. \u00a0That was the only thing they could do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only thing up in the air was how long they would be able to drag this out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Gulp!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling unconsciously gulped. \u00a0\u00a0In truth, he didn\u2019t know how to deal with this situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Shit.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt an indescribable sense of despair. \u00a0Then the despair immediately changed in sorriness towards Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Whistling had precipitated this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan didn\u2019t need this stage. \u00a0He could prove his worth, and be treated well elsewhere. \u00a0However, Whistling had brought him to this abyss. \u00a0The only thing that could comfort Hyrkan was a victory and success. \u00a0That was it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, everything was about to be ruined. \u00a0They were treading water to stay above the abyss.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Excuse me. \u00a0Shouldn't we tell him?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yojori asked the question. \u00a0Hahoe Mask still didn\u2019t know about the appearance of the two large guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling asked Yojori to keep silent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t tell Hyrkan about this situation. \u00a0Hyrkan was currently fighting a life and death battle with the Barbarian King, and his words might cause him to die. \u00a0Hyrkan was fighting a battle where 1 second determined his fate. \u00a0\u00a0It was a battle with a razor thin margin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As a friend, Whistling wanted to help in anyway he could. \u00a0He wanted Hyrkan to be left alone, so he could carry out the battle. \u00a0This was the only way he could repay his friend.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We\u2019ll just have to block them.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling gritted his teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had already been prepared for death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, at that moment, Whistling was thinking of different ways he could threaten the two guilds. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was there anyway he could file a lawsuit against the Stormhunters and Redbulls for using such tactics?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Could he use this threat to scare them off?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His mind mulled over the problem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he didn\u2019t have much time to ponder over this problem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling could see the Stormhunters guild close the distance with the Hahoe Mask and the Barbarian King. \u00a0They were turning aside the wall of Users easily. \u00a0Moreover, Whistling could see, who was in the front.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'My god.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Storm Queen Shir!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was leading from the front. \u00a0Aside from the Hahoe Mask, she was called the strongest in Warlord. \u00a0Moreover, it would be useless to bring lawyers, the justice system and a lawsuit against her. \u00a0It wouldn\u2019t work on her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling was about to lose his fighting spirit. \u00a0His face looked like the face of a fighting dog, but the fight was about drain out of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Wow. \u00a0It\u2019s the Storm Queen.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Even if I die here, I can boast about this to everyone.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone else pretty much assumed they were all going to die early on. \u00a0At that moment, Whistling sheathed his sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You shall not pass!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he yelled out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He used all his strength to do so.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In his lifetime, Whistling had never yelled this loud before. \u00a0It was as if he was barfing out everything within him into this shout.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the shout, the Stormhunters and the Storm Queen came to a stop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you have pride in yourself as the 30 great guilds, you should leave this to the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0You should think about the etiquette within Warlord!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They stopped, but Whistling kept shouting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"At the very least, you should keep the gamer\u2019s code of conduct!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Whistling\u2019s shout, Shirt glared at Whistling. \u00a0Shir, who was looking straight at Whistling, was beautiful. \u00a0However, her expression was indescribably cold. \u00a0Whistling didn\u2019t avoid her gaze. \u00a0He glared at her like a fighting dog.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While this terrifying war of gazes was occurring, a third person spoke up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We are here to make a deal with the Hahoe Mask.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ballista Hatch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been at the back of the group. \u00a0He ran forward as he shouted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We started the Barbarian King event. \u00a0Of course, we also possess the key that will allow us to finish off the Barbarian King. \u00a0If we let things be, the Barbarian King will start up its activities again.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch gave an explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he ended the explanation, Shir added her words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Even if I do fight with the Hahoe Mask, there is no way I\u2019ll fight him here. \u00a0So get out of my way.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling gritted his teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">19.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the thunder fell another 10 times, the Barbarian King froze in place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He stood erect.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was like a statue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the Barbarian King was still alive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Ah\uff01'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan watched this sight, and for the first time, he let out a sigh of relief inside his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The clear method was effective.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Barbarian King Nesha has fallen asleep.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Barbarian King Nesha will awaken in 24 hours.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the next System Announcement knocked down all his achievements in one fell swoop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'This fucking game!'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the worst possible situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was well aware of the possibility of a 3rd Phase. \u00a0He had expected the Barbarian King to go nuts, so he had prepared accordingly. \u00a0However, he hadn\u2019t been prepared for this scenario.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, he had no idea how he should deal with this scenario.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Barbarian King Nessa will awaken from his sleep in 23 hours 50 seconds.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In front of Hyrkan, the Warlord started its cold, heartless and cruel countdown.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'I...... I have to kill this bastard.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan thought about all the Users, who had given up their lives for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Losses? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That didn\u2019t matter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It hadn\u2019t been important in the first place. \u00a0He didn\u2019t play this game for the money. \u00a0He had needed the money to become the best in Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was afraid of the disappointment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These Users had put their lives on the line for him. \u00a0They had fought for his victory, and even the dead Users were cheering from outside the game. \u00a0He was afraid of the sense of disappointment that\u2019ll be felt by those people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have to kill it!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Eventually, he shouted at the top of his lungs towards the Barbarian King Nessa.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-Hyrkan. \u00a0The Stormhunters guild and Red Bulls guild is heading your way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, he heard Whistling\u2019s voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-They want to propose a deal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan turned his head. \u00a0He could see a large group heading towards the center of the plain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could see her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Storm Queen Shir!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She wasn\u2019t wearing her helmet, and her hair was whipping around her. \u00a0She brought her group towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan looked at them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As time passed, Shir and Hyrkan stared at each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This will be my final proposal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir opened her mouth.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

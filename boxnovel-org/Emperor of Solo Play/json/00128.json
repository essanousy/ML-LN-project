Chiroro frowned as he looked to his side. Apollo was standing next to him. \u00a0When the Raid started, it sounded as if he was constantly eating something. \u00a0This was a first time since the start of the Raid where he wasn't eating anything. \u00a0In fact, Apollo threw his food aside as he yelled out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI knew this would happen. \u00a0This is what you get for putting shitty people in the front. \u00a0This is the end result! Hoong!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chiroro couldn't help, but let out a bitter laugh as he looked at Apollo. \u00a0He had the same feeling as Apollo except it was in regards to Apollo. \u00a0On top of it all, Chiroro was thinking about something else.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Why was Sinclair-nim interested in a bastard like Apollo?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The thought of the Big Smiles guild participating in the Argardo Raid was already gone from his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn't happening only with Chiroro.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Most Warlord fans wouldn\u2019t even remember the Big Smiles guild's defeat. \u00a0There was no space inside their heart and mind to care about the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><br/><p>9.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Agardo appeared, there were always a thousand to two thousand Users around the Havanz castle. \u00a0Half of them were spectators. \u00a0This was obvious, but it was hard to see the action from outside. What one was able to see from outside the Havanz castle was much inferior to what one \u00a0could see from purchasing the live ticket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Despite this fact, people gathered around the Havanz castle. \u00a0This was like watching a baseball game from the far bleachers where one could barely see anything. \u00a0The Users just wanted to be there. In truth, they wanted to be part of history.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one wanted to speak more bluntly about this, it was possible to see a live broadcast inside Warlord. \u00a0The Users were watching it live after positioning themselves near the Havanz castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In others words, the number of people gathered around the Havanz castle was a measure of the interest level, popularity, anticipation and ability of the teams attempting the Raid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, there were almost 6 thousand Users around Havanz castle, and about 5 thousand of them were spectators. \u00a0There were a good number of Users, who hadn't even reached level 100, present here. They had risked their lives to come to the castle. \u00a0This Raid had the power to draw them there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid you get familiar with the plan?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The group was wearing helmets with horns that reminded one of a bull's horns. \u00a0The group had a lot of power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One million seventy nine thousand live tickets were sold.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seven hundred twelve members were participating in the Raid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The average level for the Users participating in the Raid was 161.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Red Bulls were ready for the Argardo Raid, and there were numerous ways they could have decorated themselves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI am well-acquainted with it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His subordinate didn't speak any further. \u00a0When he heard his leader\u2019s words, he didn't give any excuses. \u00a0He didn't ask for more time to conduct an inspection.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their confidence was top notch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chev's mouth looked like a crescent moon when he heard the other's answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBattle.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The crescent moon revealed white chiclets attached to it, and he spoke in a low voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStart!\u201d</span></p><br/><p>10.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a massive battle where a large force was going up against a large force. \u00a0The most important group in the fighting force was the magicians. \u00a0The winner or loser in a large scale battle swung on whether a group had an effective magical power system.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So what did it mean to have an effective magical power system?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First, one had to apply the magic at the right location. \u00a0The powerful magical spells exacted an equal price. \u00a0It consumed an incredible amount of magical power, and the cool time was long. \u00a0It would be a big waste to use a big magic on a small target.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the more important aspect was accuracy. \u00a0Magic didn't differentiate between allies and enemies. \u00a0If one used a magic with low accuracy near a comrade, it was the most effective form of betrayal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, one needed practice to increase the accuracy of magic. Ballista Hatch from the Stormhunters was able to accurately throw long range magic on the move, yet this wasn't a common skill. Most people couldn't do what Hatch could do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the distance increased, the target movement increases and the magician's movement increases, the accuracy of the magic decreased.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The method devised to solve this problem was target designation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMonsters are entering the F11 region! Fire!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFire!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the stage of a battlefield, target areas were drawn. The magicians practiced throwing magic to target designation beforehand. \u00a0After several hours of practice, one could achieve very high accuracy at throwing magic to the target designations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only thing left was for the Tankers to lure the monsters to the target designation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, the magicians had to control the attribute of the attack magic. \u00a0The wrong attribute could damage the Tankers significantly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">F meant Fire. \u00a0The Tankers luring the monsters to this target designation had fire resistance setting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Monsters in F11 region is in a critical state! \u00a0Strikers!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of it all, the Strikers were tirelessly running around the stage, and they prevented the waste of magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monsters with low HP was called low blood. One needed to do a little more damage to kill it, so magic wouldn\u2019t have to be used again. \u00a0These low bloods were the responsibility of the Strikers. This was not an insignificant role.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Red Bulls' Strikers were faster and better than any other group of Strikers. They were like ghosts at finding weaknesses of the weakened monsters. \u00a0They used a suitable combo skill to kill it in one blow. \u00a0They symbolized the Red Bulls. \u00a0The Strikers were the horns of a bull.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They moved with indescribably sophisticated movements. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Red Bull's sophisticated non-stop movements gave them a disparate sense of beauty. This was the reason why there were so many Red Bulls fans. If one looked under the hood of the Red Bulls guild, one wouldn't be able to find a more finely tuned machine. \u00a0The result that came out of this sophistication was unbelievably rough and harsh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe castle wall has fallen!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been 18 minutes since the battle had started, and the Red Bulls had taken down the castle wall that had been barely repaired by the Cement Worms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the castle wall fell, elite troops appeared. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the Primary Raid team, which consisted of Chev and the best Users of Red Bulls. \u00a0They stepped over the fallen wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This elite troop was the most important amongst their forces. \u00a0They should have felt some burden on their shoulder as they were inserted into face Argardo. \u00a0However, none of them felt a sense of burden, since they didn't have a reason to feel such pressure.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is only the warm up. Don't over do it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the warm up. \u00a0No one in this world would feel overwhelmed from doing a warm up.</span></p><br/><p>11.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch was on standby near the Havanz castle. If the Red Bulls guild lost, it would be time for the Stormhunters guild to step forward. \u00a0Hatch and the other officers was nearby as they surveyed the current situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, it would be understandable if Hatch felt offended at doing the grunt work. \u00a0However, Hatch loved this assignment. \u00a0He was finally alone. Hahui was always tormenting him, so Hatch was thankful of any assignment that guaranteed his separation from her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It does feel a little bit lonely without that endlessly chattering girl.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch felt an unknown sadness. \u00a0However, that sadness disappeared when the Red Bulls' battle started. A sound could be heard as Hatch watched the battle occurring in front of him. \u00a0The sound was background noise coming from the Hologram monitor. \u00a0He had purchased the live broadcast.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Endless reaction was being written in the chat window below the live footage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- As expected of the Red Bulls! They are incredibly fast! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If they can't do something of this level, they should just fold.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Big Smiles can't even hold a candle to them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018They deserve to be shut down. How are they still holding out? I think Fighters guilds is better than them.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Is it really ok to bring out the primary raid team so fast? \u00a0What if they receive damage?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018They can't be afraid of their elite troop taking damage. Then there\u2019s no point in having an elite troop. In the Corrupted Count Raid, do you guys realize the Hydra guild had held back Sohank, and their raid turned to shit?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Do you think they'll be able to catch Agardo? \u00a0Truthfully, all the other guilds reached this point.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This guy knows how to watch this game. \u00a0Argardo is a troublesome opponent. Its small stature is the most troublesome part. Only four Users can attack it at once. However, only two can can attack it during a close battle. One has to attempt an Armor Break, while the other attacks. This is the best method, and there is no way one could get magical support.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I think they\u2019ll be able to do the Armor Break. \u00a0However, will their attack work after the Armor Break? \u00a0It has yet to take any damage. \u00a0Maybe we aren\u2019t suppose to catch it. \u00a0Maybe there is some other method to clear it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Yes. \u00a0An invincible monster sometimes means there is something else going on. \u00a0It is a storyline seen often in games. \u00a0This guy also knows a little bit about games.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Big Smiles guild was able to reach here. \u00a0In truth, I don't see what's so special about the Red Bulls. \u00a0In my opinion, they aren't that different from the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This bitch has no knowledge about this game.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch was busily critiquing the live reactions. \u00a0In a flash, he was having fun watching the Raid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Big K is better than I thought. \u00a0He is someone worth paying attention to.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At some point, Hatch started to eat a snack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, when the fight with Agardo was about to start, Hatch's expression changed immediately.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuhk!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch stood up from his seat. \u00a0Surprisingly, there were a lot of Users showing a similar reaction.</span></p><br/><p>12.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the Primary Raid Team was inserted into the castle, the Tankers created space as they lined up as if they were imitating a castle wall. \u00a0When this space was made, the other teams entered. \u00a0If one looked down at Havanz castle from the sky, one would see something akin to a red inkblot spreading out on a black piece of paper.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Finally, the Red Bulls' full force started to overwhelm the forces of the Corrupted army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Argardo has appeared.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The White-eyed Knight had appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The black spot was constantly moving on its silver armor, and the Crying Sword was letting out an endless cry. \u00a0Argardo's appearance was intense. \u00a0It had a small body, but it was letting out a more frightening energy than a dragon. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone watching this live on the broadcast gulped. \u00a0The chatting window was scrolling up endlessly as words were being typed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone had their mouths closed, and their hands had stopped moving.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In this silence, Chev opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"To the viewers watching this live broadcast, I want to apologize first.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone tilted their head in confusion. \u00a0Question marks started to fill the chatting window.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Red Bulls guild took an easy way out in the Argardo Raid.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were a lot of questions being asked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Red Bulls guild will give up the battle opportunity to someone else.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The number of questions being typed were reaching a climax when the question marks started changing into exclamation marks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Hahoe Mask is going to fight 1on1 with Agardo.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he saw Sinclair, Hyrkan became conflicted. Was there really a way where he would be able to participate in the Argardo Raid without any interference from Sinclair?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, he didn't really have to rack his brain to come up with a method. \u00a0There was one solution available to him. \u00a0There were guilds that Sinclair couldn\u2019t interfere with. \u00a0These guilds had too much power behind it. \u00a0Sinclair wouldn\u2019t even be able to breathe on them. \u00a0At the same time, these guilds would treat this Argardo Raid like it was a life and death issue. \u00a0He had a choice of working with one of them, and he only had two guilds he could choose from. \u00a0He didn\u2019t even need to think about it. \u00a0Hyrkan went looking for Chev. \u00a0\u00a0They met in secret as no one else in the world was aware of this meeting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan gave a proposal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want to participate in the Agardo Raid on a condition.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat's the price?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI won't ask for any rights to the profit gained from the live ticket and the pay per view videos.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He just wanted to fight Agardo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Normally, if a normal User had suggested this, Chev wouldn't even acknowledge that User. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the one giving this request was the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll make a decision after I hear these conditions.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no reason to give an immediate rejection.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou have to provide a 1on1 stage for me in the Argardo Raid.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo you want us to take care of the Corrupted army for you?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cInstead, I'll tell you of a way to kill Agardo. \u00a0It won't be a sure-fire method, but I'll let you borrow a tool that'll allow you to pull off this method.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's proposal was an attractive proposal. \u00a0In truth, Chev had alrady made a decision to accept Hyrkan\u2019s proposal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It\u2019s a choice between gaining more profit or gaining less profit.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was somewhat of a happy dilemma for Chev.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Hyrkan failed at the Argardo Raid, the next one to fight it was the Red Bulls. \u00a0If Hyrkan was able to take down Argardo's HP into the reds, Argardo would be a fish in troubled waters. Even if that wasn't the case, Hyrkan's failure could be a teaching moment. It was a scenario where the Red Bulls would be able to get the most profit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if Hyrkan was able to succeed in the Argardo Raid, it wasn't as if they would lose anything. \u00a0The benefit of defeating Argardo would go to Hyrkan, but the title gained from completing the Raid would be shared by everyone in Red Bulls. \u00a0Moreover, all the profit gained from the footage of the Argardo Raid would all go to the Red Bulls. \u00a0Hyrkan would be in the footage... \u00a0It was going to be a massive amount of profit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Above all, the Red Bulls guild had a debt accrued against Hyrkan. \u00a0In truth, the Red Bulls, Stormhunters and the Hydra guild had come together to prepare a very big present. \u00a0They had wanted to bribe him. \u00a0However, it seemed that present was unnecessary now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If this was a proposal given by Chev, Chev would have agreed to everything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this was a request made by Hyrkan to the Red Bulls.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don't think that'll be enough.\u201d \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat's your counter proposal? \u00a0I'll hear it out.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want full rights to the live broadcast. \u00a0I want you to give me the rights to be able to show your battle on our live channel. \u00a0Then I'll provide the best stage for a 1on1 battle.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of an answer, Hyrkan put forth his hand. \u00a0Chev grasped Hyrkan's hand.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

I\u2019ll show the world what it means to earn and spend money like a king.\u2019</p><br/><p>While An Jaehyun was forming a new resolution in his mind, the employee finished reading over the contract and began explaining the final procedure.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll deliver the V-Gear to your home at your convenient time. What would you like to do for the detailed settings? Would you like to do it here, or at home?\u201d</p><br/><p>Detailed setting.</p><br/><p>It was the process of adjusting the V-Gear\u2019s numerous options to match the user.</p><br/><p>It was a rather important process, as important as tuning for instruments. The difference between having it done and not having it done was huge. Rankers, whose lives depended on the 1 or 2% difference, were especially careful about the settings. As a result, top ranking player often did their settings on their own. Of course, it was the case for An Jaehyun as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even so, there was no need to do the entire setting by himself. After roughly setting it up here, An Jaehyun planned on personalizing it as he used it.</p><br/><p>The employee nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call the programmer, please wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>A programmer, who was furiously typing on his laptop, released his hand. Connected to the laptop was an emerald-colored V-Gear.</p><br/><p>\u201cShit, what\u2019s wrong here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no error in the system no matter how many times I check. There\u2019s nothing we can fix.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018what\u2019? It\u2019s a tester problem, so we\u2019ll have to call the tester.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other programmer couldn\u2019t help but smirk at his colleague\u2019s response.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, as if the VVIP will come here. If we call her here, she\u2019ll probably respond with \u2018Who the fuck do you think I am?\u2019 That\u2019s if we can even reach her through the phone in the first place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s why I said shit.\u201d</p><br/><p>These two programmers weren\u2019t the\u00a0run-of-the-mill\u00a0programmers that looked for defects in the system. They were members of Peach Corp\u2019s Japan Branch, and also part of the research and development team under Peach Corp\u2019s Asia Branch. They were top-level VR programmers who participated in the development of the Level 6 model, and their salaries were easily in the several hundred millions.</p><br/><p>The fact that they had come to Korea in a single day and became repair technicians could only mean that this VVIP held an incredibly important position, enough to easily turn top-level VR programmers into mere repair technicians.</p><br/><p>It went without saying that the two programmers were incredibly frustrated at the whole situation.</p><br/><p>They graduated from prestigious schools, found work in their field\u2019s biggest business, and received the best treatment from others. It was probably their first time being treated as they were today.</p><br/><p>But what choice did they have? As long as they were getting paid, they had to listen to the higher up\u2019s orders.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start from the beginning. What was her complaint?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter the Climbing Test, she said her body felt sluggish and that her reaction time was a tempo off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reaction time being off just means the VR physical ability has a slow reception time. As for her body feeling sluggish\u2026 I can only think it\u2019s her being unable to adapt.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, An Jaehyun came up to them along with the programmer to do his settings. It was as An Jaehyun intended. To take a closer look at the 6S model, An Jaehyun led his programmer next to them.</p><br/><p>As a result, An Jaehyun was able to overhear their conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the 6S model, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun immediately asked. The two programmers only just noticed that An Jaehyun had walked up to them, and they couldn\u2019t hide their surprised faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>They had no choice but to be surprised. The 6S model was still in testing, and most people didn\u2019t know the Level 6 model even existed. It would be a different story for specialists of the field, but it was clear that An Jaehyun wasn\u2019t one.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it should be a test model. What is a test model doing here? Is there a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because the tester said her body felt sluggish\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that instant, the other programmer glared at the programmer who had just answered An Jaehyun\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey! What are you telling him that for?!\u2019 was what his eyes were saying. Noticing the man\u2019s gaze, the programmer in question shut his mouth, realizing his mistake. On the other hand, An Jaehyun was completely unconcerned at the two programmers exchanging glances, as he placed his thought on what the man had just said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the body feels sluggish, it\u2019s probably because of the Sensory System.\u201d</p><br/><p>Extended Sensory System.</p><br/><p>It was a new system introduced in the Level 6 model.</p><br/><p>It expanded the sensory limits a human could feel in the virtual world, and Warlord players often called it the sixth sense. It was a good system, but it was also a double-edged sword. One\u2019s sensory limits being expanded meant the user had to intake more information. If one received more information than they could handle, the process could only feel sluggish.</p><br/><p>The point was to adapt to it. If one couldn\u2019t adapt, it meant that the person had no talent in using the Extended Sensory System, at which point it was better to not use it at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cI assume the testing method is Climbing. Lower the Extended Sensory System by 50% and check the Climbing test result. Then, adjust the Extended Sensory System by raising it 5% each time. That should do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Climbing Test was the most frequently used testing method when performing a VR device setting.</p><br/><p>The Climbing Test was rock climbing in the virtual world. It allowed for the checking of how well and to what extent the user was utilizing his or her VR physical abilities, and how good one\u2019s sense of balance was.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the two programmers stared in amazement at An Jaehyun\u2019s explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know this?\u201d</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun didn\u2019t seem to be a professional, but his response was full of confidence. He even knew about the Extended Sensory System. This was a state-of-the-art technology only a few specialists in the field knew about. It wasn\u2019t something a clueless nobody could know.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a problem with me knowing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you perhaps have experience as a tester?\u201d</p><br/><p>Instead of giving an answer, An Jaehyun just shrugged his shoulders. It was a vague reply, but it was the best he could do at the moment. He did have experience, but not as of now.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould you please help us?\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the programmers asked An Jaehyun.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! What are you saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other immediately opposed it. In reality, there was nothing wrong with what he asked. They were working with a device in testing anyways. Collecting data from multiple testers would be the logical thing to do. In fact, it was unusual and illogical for someone to use a testing device as a personal device.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on! We can test it ourselves all day, but it won\u2019t help at all. Why not just get a little help?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two looked over at An Jaehyun, seemingly asking for help. To this, An Jaehyun answered without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018If this is that bitch\u2019s, no reason for me to help.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like he was going to be paid for it. Plus, if it really belonged to Choi Sulyeon like he thought, he would rather die before helping his sworn enemy.</p><br/><p>The two programmers made sullen faces, but An Jaehyun ignored them both. An Jaehyun had no reason to pity them. Since they were handling the 6S model, it was clear they were from the main branch, they were elites that An Jaehyun didn\u2019t even have the qualifications to pity.</p><br/><p>An Jaehyun stared back to his programmer.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go do our setting.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third programmer standing behind with a blank expression finally snapped out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>A lady with a model-like stature and a glamourous figure took off an emerald-colored V-Gear, exposing her long, straight hair. She looked at the programmer who helped her take off the V-Gear and nodded her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI lowered the Extended Sensory System and incrementally increased it like you said, and it feels much better. It should be enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with these words, she signaled with her eyes toward a female bodyguard next to her.</p><br/><p>The female bodyguard began to dismantle the installed V-Gear 6S Level with extreme proficiency. It seemed like she wanted to take it with her straight away. The two programmers let out sigh of relief watching this take course.</p><br/><p>\u2018Geez, she really treats us like slaves.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Money sure talks\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Choi Sulyeon grabbed her jacket from nearby and took out her wallet, then took out two blank checks.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood work.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two were surprised by both her words and the checks.</p><br/><p>\u2018No way.\u2019</p><br/><p>They had expected about a million won, but there was an extra zero on the check they received.</p><br/><p>Money talks? Hell yeah!</p><br/><p>The two immediately thought of this idiom. On the other hand, Choi Sulyeon was completely ignoring the two programmers as she handed them the checks. Her business with them had ended the moment she gave them the checks, and she had no reason to keep a close relationship with either of them.</p><br/><p>At that moment, as if she had just remembered something, she asked them a question.</p><br/><p>At the end of the test, I noticed my time ranked second. What was the first?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two tightly held onto the checks in their hands as they tilted their heads in question.</p><br/><p>\u2018Second? What does she mean?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018She ranked second? As if. That time was on the level of a world-record.\u2019</p><br/><p>Here at the Peach Store, all V-Gears shared the same program installed to a single server, because it was impossible to install the program on individual machines due to licensing and storage space. It was the same for the Climbing Test. The rankings were of the users that tried the Climbing Test that day.</p><br/><p>And Choi Sulyeon had just scored a record of 2 minutes and 51 seconds on\u00a0the\u00a0A-level test.</p><br/><p>Most people can\u2019t even finish the A-level test. No matter how long one takes, anyone who could complete it would be considered good at adapting to the VR world. Furthermore, only a handful of people could finish this test under 3 minutes. Those that could were geniuses, the so called monsters.</p><br/><p>Choi Sulyeon\u2019s record of 2 minutes and 51 seconds was incredible without doubt. She was content at surpassing her past record of 2 minutes and 58 seconds, a whole 7 second difference. She felt it was worth the\u00a0effort in obtaining a 6S model.</p><br/><p>But her record was only in second place.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t understand how. How could her monstrous record be second place?</p><br/><p>The two programmers could only tilt their heads.</p><br/><p>Choi Sulyeon frowned, watching the two.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I see the Climbing Test rankings?\u201d</p><br/><p>At her order, one programmer immediately ran to his laptop. When he saw the record on the screen, his face stiffened.</p><br/><p>\u201c2 minutes 33 seconds\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>An absurd record was sitting on the first place. It was a time impossible for a human being to achieve.</p><br/><p>The two immediately replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like it was a bot result.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe had a bot running to test the product. Looks like we accidentally recorded one of its times.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was an impossible record for a human. Then the answer was simple.</p><br/><p>Choi Sulyeon only gave them a tired look before she turned her head away.</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>After returning home, An Jaehyun stretched as if stared at the V-Gear installed in his small one-room apartment.</p><br/><p>Anyone could easily tell from his face that he was in a bad mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Was it because it\u2019s a Level 1 model? I can\u2019t believe my Climbing time fell to the 30s. It was well in the 20s when I was at my peak. Ugh, it must be because I haven\u2019t played in a while.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Climbing Test result put An Jaehyun in a sour mood, and kept bothering him.</p><br/><p>He realized he was not in his best condition.</p><br/><p>\u2018Necromancer or whatever, I need to first restore myself to my peak condition.\u2019</p><br/><p>With a frown on his face, An Jaehyun finished stretching and grabbed a handful of glucose candy he just purchased. He threw them in his mouth, and he put on the V-Gear glove with a loud chewing noise. Jelly like substance billowed inside the glove, completely immersing his hands down to each fingerprint. An Jaehyun immediately swallowed down the tiny pieces of glucose candy in his mouth.</p><br/><p>Then he laid on the mattress and put on his V-Gear.</p><br/><p>[User An Jaehyun, iris scan complete. Thank you for using the V-Gear.]</p><br/><p>As soon as the iris scan finished, An Jaehyun clamped the mouthpiece inside the V-Gear helmet.</p><br/><p>Biting down strongly, An Jaehyun prepared his mind.</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright, let\u2019s see who gets the last laugh!\u2019</p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

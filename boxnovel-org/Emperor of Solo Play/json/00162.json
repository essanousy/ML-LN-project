On the right edge of his vision, he could see a mirage-like blue gauge. \u00a0He checked the magic status window.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Magic recovery... \u00a0Ok.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Until a moment ago, there hadn't been a single iota of blue light present on the magic status window, but now it was full. \u00a0It was shining like a blue bulb.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the timing of his Level Up was planned out by Hyrkan too. \u00a0He estimated how much EXP he would gain when he caught Anugas, and he hunted until he would immediately level up when he killed Anugas.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn't a strategy often used by Users, but it was a well known method. \u00a0It was a method used to recover health and magic during a hunt... \u00a0Anyways, the Level Up Bonus was more effective than any magic recovery Items in his arsenal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, at that moment, the Level Up Bonus was more important to him than any other time in this game. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Restoration.... \u00a0Ok.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Hyrkan recovered his magical energy, he started mending his Skeleton Warriors and Skeleton Knights. \u00a0The fractured bones started to mend, and the Skeletons, who weren't able to move, could move again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Special Ability 'Undying' has activated.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he activated the Special Ability of the Death Knight. \u00a0There were Skeletons that were too damaged that they would revert back into being Skeleton Fragments if left alone for several minutes. \u00a0These Skeleton Warriors were quickly regaining their shape under the Undying skill of the Death Knight. \u00a0They stood on their own two feet in an imposing manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He retained 15 Skeleton Warriors, 3 Skeleton Knights and a Death Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These 19 Skeletons were veteran heroes. \u00a0It took them only 1 minute to regain their imposing figures. \u00a0They were letting out breathes full of frost.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the Skeleton army regained their dignified appearance, they created a perimeter around Anugas, and Hyrkan stood in the middle of this imposing group.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan let out a sigh. \u00a0It contained many mixed emotions. \u00a0After putting his sword into his sheath, he raised his left arm. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggee-reek, ggee-reek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The short sound of the dial turning on his wristwatch was heard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSlot on.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the sound ended, Hyrkan punctuated it with his low words. \u00a0Accompanying his words, a striking silver armor with black spots started to surround Hyrkan's body. \u00a0In 3 seconds, Hyrkan took on the form that was most familiar to the other Users. \u00a0He changed into his strongest form.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It take about 3 to 5 minutes for Anugas' eye to turn into its Ingredient form.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had killed Anugas.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I caught it, so I can't lose out on this.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan prepared himself for battle. \u00a0He was now going to protect the prey he had killed from the \u00a0other Users.</span></p><br/><p>2.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Hahoe Mask was successful in his Raid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Shir received the report, a sea of fire was unfurled in front of her. \u00a0It reminded one of hell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zzuh-juhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The flames continued to burn, and the gigantic trees split open. \u00a0They had been barely holding their shape against the heat. \u00a0The trees let out dull sounds, which sounded like screams. \u00a0No other sound could be heard. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir swung her sword in a wide arc.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shweek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A crescent sword energy burning with intense flame was emitted when she swung her sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roo! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sword energy pushed itself forward as if it was a flood. \u00a0Devastation could be seen trailing behind the road made out of fire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had combined the Crescent Cut and the Ancient Power of Flame. \u00a0It looked flashy, and its power was terrifying. \u00a0The large trees and boulders, which had been barely holding onto their original form, was cut down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a raging inferno.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After creating the devastating sight in front of her, Shir turned her back against it. \u00a0If the Users wanted to chase after her, they would have to go through the fiery hell she had created.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Shir took couple more steps, her subordinates gathered around her. The first one to speak was Hahui. \u00a0She respected Shir more than anyone else here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Poker team is quick to run away. \u00a0Their talent for running away isn't normal. \u00a0It is as if they had practiced running away before. \u00a0If they had stuck around, I'm sure I could have taken all of them down.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed Hahui was feeling guilty. \u00a0She hadn\u2019t been able succeed in the mission given to her. \u00a0As always, Hahui brought up words that would deflect away from her actions. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Shir just spoke briefly to Hahui.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGood job.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahui put on a bright smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I've caught around 70 of them. \u00a0I think I took down around 50 magicians. \u00a0They were all bunched together, so it was quite easy to kill them. \u00a0Of course, this mission would have been impossible if it wasn't for me.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hatch butted in on the conversation. \u00a0It wasn't a coincidence. \u00a0Of course, he hadn't overheard the conversation through Voice Talk by accident, and his words were calculated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I was able to perform admirably unlike someone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he spoke his words to needle Hahui. \u00a0Hahui's expression cooled. \u00a0She didn't know about anything else, but she couldn't let Hatch get the better of her. \u00a0However, she couldn't come up with any words. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hahui's body shook, and if Hatch was in front of her, her fist would already be planted in his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The most galling part was the fact that she knew Hatch knew this, and this was why he was needling her from afar. \u00a0In many ways, Hatch was the most cautious member of the Stormhunters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGood job.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shir also spoke plainly to Hatch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Yes. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of coming up with more words to make fun of Hahui, Hatch gave a short answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe'll head towards the Ravine.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their mission hadn't ended yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The battle had ended.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the game hadn't ended yet.</span></p><br/><p>3.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- What should we do? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- What happened to the Diamond unit? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- We lost three.

Hahoe Mask had attempted the Anugas Raid, and the Stormhunters guild had helped the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0This meant their opponents were pretty sure they could succeed in the Anugas Raid, and these two forces had allied themselves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I put in one redundancy after another, yet none of them are working. \u00a0What more could be done?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was the fact that they had already formulated an answer to this problem. \u00a0This was why a thousand of their troops were sent to the Heard Fortress. \u00a0They were sent to interfere. \u00a0They also put in contingency plan that dealt with either the Stormhunters guild or the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0They had prepared a mobile unit called the Diamond unit to deal with them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Instead of the Diamond unit, we should have brought the entire Poker team. \u00a0Every member of the Hands guild should have been gathered here.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, their contingency plan had failed. \u00a0The Storm Queen had gathered her elite members, and she had turned the table on them. \u00a0She had hunted down the Diamond unit. \u00a0The Diamond unit was supposed to delay any groups they met for 10 minutes, yet they weren't even able to pull that off. \u00a0The Storm Queen was also a possessor of the Deposed Prince's Sword, and she possessed the Ancient Power of Flame.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, they had a problem, and they had put forth an answer. \u00a0However, the answer wasn't working. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no point in them agonizing over the solution. \u00a0The wise thing to do was to wash their hands of this debacle </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If this was the previous Hands guild, we could have taken out our enemies no matter what the cost. \u00a0In the past, a single order was enough to gather everyone.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sinclair's annoyance started from this fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hands guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hands guild operated under the notice of the world, and death in battle used to be an acceptable option. \u00a0If needed, everyone would die to further their agenda. \u00a0No one would have been averse to it. \u00a0Even in death, they would have dragged down the enemies by their ankles. \u00a0There would have been reward and benefit that would drive the Hands guild Users to make this sacrifice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If everything operated like the past, they would have considered a suicidal death with the Storm Queen to be a great opportunity. \u00a0The forces needed to take down the Storm Queen would have been gathered without any fuss. \u00a0If the Hands guild needed them, they would have gathered in a single location to become a chess piece on the board.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, things weren't like that any more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The members, who had originated from the Hands guild, were starting to enjoy the spotlight. \u00a0They had too much to lose if they weren't able to enter the game for 48 hours. \u00a0One couldn't lose something, one didn't have. \u00a0However, they now had something to lose, and it was a bitter feeling to lose what they possessed. \u00a0This was why they weren't able to mobilize on command. \u00a0Power and rank had become shackles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This will allow the Hahoe Mask and the Stormhunters to take a step forward further away from us.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their body was getting bigger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were becoming more powerful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their opulence was getting larger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, they were becoming slow and sluggish. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If we want to block them, we have to put our life on the line. \u00a0We have to be prepared to take them down with us.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Sinclair clicked his tongue from the bitterness he felt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's all right. \u00a0Let's just take a step back.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn't keep his bitterness out of his voice. \u00a0He spat out his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- What are you saying? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's leave a portion of our forces behind. \u00a0They can follow behind the Stormhunters guild, and they could monitor the Heard Fortress. \u00a0Even if we stake everything on this single die cast, it isn't as if we'll gain a solution. \u00a0What happens if the Stormhunters guild runs away?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- We'll just drive them towards the Heard Fortress....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- No. \u00a0Sinclair is correct. \u00a0If the Hahoe Mask has caught Anugas, there is a high probability of the Block Field beyond the Heard Fortress dissolving. \u00a0Then there would be no point in driving them towards the Heard Fortress.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Then we should just overlook our losses? \u00a0If we end this business here, we'll look like idiots.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Do we have a viable plan? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- We have to find a way! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Voice Talk channel showed signs of becoming loud again. \u00a0Sinclair became annoyed again. \u00a0This was why he deliberately took a breath to calm himself down. He used his acting skill to make his voice sound calm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe only thing we can do now is to sacrifice several members to grab the ankles of the Stormhunters or the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0We don't have any other answers beyond that option. \u00a0If we have volunteers, who are willing to become sacrifices, I'll gladly help with the plan. \u00a0For your information, it'll take me 3 hours to arrive there.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No one had an answer to those words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No one wanted to become the sacrifice. \u00a0At that moment, Sinclair spoke into the Voice Talk channel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn't hold back his bitter words anymore.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn the past, we fought through fire and water. \u00a0Now we are all busy worrying about our own hides.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He spat out the bitter words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFuck\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was also guilty of doing this.</span></p><br/><p>4.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a world where a news originating from New York could be spread in 10 seconds around the world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Something big is happening at the Black Continent! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u3134 What's going on?

As proficiency increases, an increased variety of items could be given to the mage under the Skeleton Warrior.</p><br/><p>-Other : The weapon given to the mage as well as the Skeleton Warrior will become one with the weapon. The mage as well as the Skeleton Warrior has to be summoned to withdraw the weapon\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>The hologram window displayed the Armament Skill\u2019s description, and Hyrkan removed his Hahoe mask. Then he carefully looked over the description of the skill, and he watched the video regarding the use of the skill.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Hyrkan swallowed his exclamation.</p><br/><p>\u2018An incredible one showed up.\u2019</p><br/><p>Armament Skill.</p><br/><p>It\u2019ll allowed the Skeleton Mage as well as the Skeleton Warrior to become incredibly strong. In one fell swoop, the skill would make the Mage into a powerful being.</p><br/><p>\u2018It really is an incredible one\u2026\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>At the same time, it was a skill that required a steep price.</p><br/><p>\u2018A skill that\u2019ll put an incredible dent into my account books has showed up.\u2019</p><br/><p>At that moment, Hyrkan wasn\u2019t filled purely of happiness. \u00a0He started earnestly calculating the figures.</p><br/><p>\u2018So how much do I have to spend?\u2019</p><br/><p>Currently, level 70 Rare rank weapons with decent options were traded between the price of 500 to 1000 gold. Of course, Rare rank items like the Orc Hero\u2019s Sword, which was closer to the Unique rank, was traded at a much more expensive price.</p><br/><p>\u2018First, the number of Skeletons I could summon\u2026\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>This was Hyrkan\u2019s current Rank of skills related to Skeleton Summoning.</p><br/><p>[Skeleton Fragment Rank B], [Skeleton Study Rank D], [Skeleton Magician Rank D].</p><br/><p>There were 5 Skeleton Warriors able to be summoned through the Skeleton Fragment Rank B. \u00a0Skeleton Study Rank D\u2019s effect allowed him to summon an additional 3 Skeletons. \u00a0The effect of Skeleton Magician Rank D allowed him to summon two more. The Corrupt Pursuer\u2019s Necklace allowed for an additional summon with its effect. \u00a0If he only summoned the Skeleton Warriors, he could summon 11 of them at most.</p><br/><p>What if he added these two factors?</p><br/><p>\u201cHoo-ooh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyrkan\u2019s mouth let out a sigh as his complicated emotions were mixed in with it.</p><br/><p>This skill wouldn\u2019t arm the entire body yet. \u00a0It\u2019ll just allow it to take up a decent weapon. Hyrkan needed much more money than the security deposit for his one room. Moreover, as the Armament Skill proficiency increases, he would need more money. When he thought about the breastplate, greave, shoulder, boots, and shield\u2026.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was possible to resell the weapons he purchased later on. \u00a0However, he wouldn\u2019t be able to get the full price for what he paid for. \u00a0It would impact on how much profit he would bring in. \u00a0However, it wouldn\u2019t affect Hyrkan\u2019s way of life too much.</p><br/><p>The important thing was deciding whether he wanted to spend a lot of time selling and purchasing items. \u00a0If not, he had to secure enough funds where he\u2019ll be able to purchase the items in bulk.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan stopped thinking at this point. \u00a0If he thought any more, it felt as if a hole would form in his stomach.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026\u2026for the foreseeable future, it\u2019ll be protein powders, cheap coffees, and grape-flavored candies.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan let out a bitter laugh.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can understand how a head of the household feels when he has to save money to be able to support his children and wife.\u2019</p><br/><p>In the entirety of his life, he had never married anyone. \u00a0Moreover, he hadn\u2019t dated either. \u00a0He already felt as if he had not one, but several children now. His situation was funny.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t have time for this.\u2019</p><br/><p>His mirth didn\u2019t last long.</p><br/><p>First, Hyrkan had to acquire the Skill. \u00a0He once again raised his hand onto the Skill Book. \u00a0It requested whether he would like to acquire the Skill. He chose to accept.</p><br/><p>[You\u2019ve acquired the Armament Skill.]</p><br/><p>After he finished learning the skill, Hyrkan put the thoughts about the Armament Skill to the back of his head. \u00a0He once again started to carefully search his surrounding.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s clear the Dungeon first.\u2019</p><br/><p>The message indicating the Dungeon Clear hadn\u2019t popped up. \u00a0He hadn\u2019t received the Bonus EXP that followed a Dungeon Clear. This meant he hadn\u2019t found the element that was required for a Dungeon Clear. \u00a0Hyrkan had to work on this problem instead of thinking about the Armament Skill.</p><br/><p>\u2018There should be something here. \u00a0There should be something that\u2019ll inform me about the identity of this Dungeon\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan busily searched through the book cases. \u00a0Afterwards, he started searching the desk drawers, when it happened.</p><br/><p>Dul-kung dulkung! \u00a0</p><br/><p>One desk drawer wouldn\u2019t open. \u00a0There weren\u2019t any noticeable change to Hyrkan\u2019s expression as he kicked the desk\u2019s drawer with his foot.</p><br/><p>Kwah-jeek!</p><br/><p>Accompanying a rough sound, the desk drawer was demolished. \u00a0When he looked inside the destroyed drawer, he found a bundle of documents being stored there. \u00a0The owner of this Dungeon used Salamanders as ingredients. \u00a0He wrote down the results of his research in making the Elemental Knights. \u00a0</p><br/><p>The title on the cover was quite grandiose and weighty. \u00a0</p><br/><p>[Research Log about the Ancient Power]</p><br/><p>It looked like a very important title. \u00a0However, when Hyrkan caught sight of the title, he let out a single snort. \u00a0The word \u2018Ancient Power\u2019 was something that was very familiar to him. \u00a0It was like the name of the neighbor\u2019s dog. It was so familiar that he was almost sick and tired of it.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s the Ruined Kingdom\u2019s bait.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ancient Power.</p><br/><p>This was a topic one comes across the main storyline of the Warlord. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t anything complicated. \u00a0It was a trope commonly used in most fantasy novels. \u00a0Some ancient kingdom possessed a special power. \u00a0They used the power in a wrong way, and it destroyed the brilliant and civilized kingdom. \u00a0</p><br/><p>After a long time passes, the power reappears once again in the world, and it drives the world into chaos! \u00a0That was the basic story line.</p><br/><p>Additionally, the power used by the current corrupt count, and Baeduk\u2019s prince was also of the Ancient Power. \u00a0The Warlord users were given frequent clues, so one could piece together this story. \u00a0This was why these elements of the story was hidden in places like the Dungeons as bait. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><br/><p>\u2018When I heard the story for the first time, I was like wow, wow! \u00a0I was like that.\u2019</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, this subject was a bit of a money maker. \u00a0The Top 30 guilds were interested in this main scenario quest, which was viewed through the outlook of a Warlord. \u00a0 \u00a0There were at least one program that dealt with main quests like this. Since he found it here, it probably held a similar story! \u00a0The fan of this piece would gather, and a minor program would have various conversation about the view of the world inside this work. \u00a0Moreover, these types of shows were unexpectedly popular. Hundred thousand to millions of viewers enjoyed watching even this minor view of the world.</p><br/><p>This manuscript wouldn\u2019t bring in an enormous sum of money, but it would bring in enough. \u00a0In the case of the Top 30 Guilds, they frequently purchased and collected such manuscripts. \u00a0</p><br/><p>Hyrkan put away the manuscript. \u00a0He had planned on taking it any ways, but this manuscript felt much more precious now since he had to worry about the Armament Skill.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to earn every penny.\u2019</p><br/><p>At the same time, he started berating himself for hunting in luxury up until now .</p><br/><p>\u2018Shit. \u00a0Why did I do that?\u2019</p><br/><p>It happened at that moment.</p><br/><p>[You\u2019ve reached the Dungeon\u2019s Secret.]</p><br/><p>[You\u2019ve cleared the Dungeon. \u00a0You\u2019ll be given a reward.]</p><br/><p>[You have leveled up.]</p><br/><p>With the notice, the not too short Dungeon Exploration came to an end for Hyrkan.</p><br/><p>Plop plop. \u00a0</p><br/><p>Ahn-jaehyun dropped grape-flavored candies into hi cheap coffee. Then he busily worked his hand over the Tablet PC. \u00a0He was calculating figures using a Calculator App.</p><br/><p>\u2018At the very least, he would have to give level 60 and up rare weapons to the 11 Skeletons. He could purchase those items using his excess funds of 20 thousand gold. \u00a0Since he had the level 70 Set Items of Shadow Hunting Dog Set and the White Mamba\u2019s Tooth Sword, he wouldn\u2019t have to invest any more for his own equipment. \u00a0</p><br/><p>If he sold the Skull Snake Set and the items he earned from this Dungeon Exploration, he\u2019ll be able to obtain 20 thousand gold. However, he would need around that much spare funds for his future hunting. \u00a0Then there was the Orc Hero\u2019s Sword\u2026 \u00a0He would feel the absence if he sold it. \u00a0It would better to give it to a Skeleton.\u2019</p><br/><p>His calculation didn\u2019t end there. \u00a0His calculation continued as he crossed from the game into reality.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll have to purchase a higher model V Gear. \u00a0There was a limit when one used the Level 1. \u00a0It would be hard to immediately get the level 6, but he should at least purchase a level 3 or level 4. If he switched to a higher model while still paying his old installment, his monthly installment would be\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Ahn-jaehyun\u2019s forehead was stacked with wrinkles as he continually calculated everything. \u00a0When he finished his calculation, Ahn-jaehyun\u2019s expression became rigid with his foreheads still furrowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cUheekoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ahn-jaehyun, who had enough money to live in luxury, suddenly found himself in rags now.</p><br/><p>\u2018Suddenly, I\u2019m short on money. \u00a0Fuck.\u2019</p><br/><p>He swallowed his sigh. \u00a0He withdrew his hand from the Tablet PC, and Ahn-jaehyun looked at his one room as he sipped his coffee. \u00a0The inside of his house was so poor that the large monitor and V Gear felt out of place. \u00a0The corner of Ahn-jaehyun\u2019s mouth hung downwards.</p><br/><p>\u2018I thought I was trending up towards the right direction\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>He had thought about moving to a new place when he had some money to spare. \u00a0However, he would have to push that dream further down the line. \u00a0As if his coffee was bitter, Ahn-jaehyun let out a bitter laugh.</p><br/><p>\u2018My intent was to play the game to make a living. Currently, I\u2019m putting my living expenses into the game.\u2019</p><br/><p>Truthfully, Ahn-jaehyun could make an agreement at any time. \u00a0The moment he made an agreement he would be able to live a decent life. He just had to pick up one enthusiastic love call sent by the Top 30 Guilds. \u00a0After 3 years, he would have a decent apartment, and a nice automobile. \u00a0He would also have a pretty expensive watch on his wrist. He would go to meetings, and he will be able to introduce his job as a Warlord Gamer with pride.</p><br/><p>He just had to come to an agreement. \u00a0Then he wouldn\u2019t have to be hungry like right now, and he wouldn\u2019t have to take on any risk.</p><br/><p>\u2018At any rate, my pride is quite expensive.\u2019</p><br/><p>However, he couldn\u2019t make that agreement. \u00a0He knew the truth. \u00a0Ahn-jaehyun drank the bitter coffee, and he let out a bitter laugh.</p><br/><p>However, the numerous grape-flavored candies soon took the edge off the bitterness. \u00a0The sweetness coated the inside of his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Still, this is a favorable development for me.\u2019</p><br/><p>The appearance of the Armament Skill would most definitely damage Ahn-jaehyun\u2019s expense plan. \u00a0On the other hand, the appearance of the Armament skill would significantly increase Ahn-jaehyun\u2019s potential.</p><br/><p>He would get stronger by using weapons. \u00a0This was most definitely a great thing. \u00a0However, the weapons in the game didn\u2019t only serve to increase one\u2019s attack. \u00a0It was the same for the Warlord. \u00a0Numerous types of weapons were used by the Warlord.</p><br/><p>Especially when he reached the Unique Rank and the ruined Kingdom arc, weapons containing the Ancient Power would start to appear. The Aura from the weapon could decrease the stat of the targets. \u00a0On the opposite spectrum, there were weapons that could increase the Stat of the nearby allies. \u00a0There were even defensive gear that was touted to have an absolute defense.</p><br/><p>They were really really expensive weapons. \u00a0If Hyrkan used all the money he had gathered up until now, he wouldn\u2019t be able to buy those weapons. \u00a0What if he could equip his troops with those weapons? \u00a0The Skeleton army commanded by Ahn-jaehyun would induce unimaginable fear.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it wouldn\u2019t end there.</p><br/><p>\u2018At level 100, I\u2019ll acquire the Skeleton Knights\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment any class reached level 100, one would learn one\u2019s main skills. \u00a0It would dramatically strengthen his potential. Amongst his summoning skill, there was a skill called \u2018Skeleton Knights\u2019.The Skeleton Knights were twice as strong as the Skeleton Warriors, and their special ability increased the stat of the Skeleton Warriors.</p><br/><p>Furthermore\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018If I also acquire the Death Knights, afterwards\u2026\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>After the Skeleton Knights, the creme de la creme of the Necromancer was the Death Knights. \u00a0A Death Knight was powerful enough of an existence that it didn\u2019t need to be equipped. In the Rich Lich\u2019s Solo Raid video, Death Knights displayed superior battle capability than a fairly skilled ranker.</p><br/><p>Moreover, if he activated the Death Knight\u2019s special ability called the Immortal Army, the Skeletons surrounding the Death Knight would receive an almost limitless life.</p><br/><p>Boo-roo-roo!</p><br/><p>For a brief moment, Ahn-jaehyun\u2019s body shook. Even in his own opinion, he would be able to possess a ridiculous amount of combat power.</p><br/><p>If only he had money.</p><br/><p>If he was overflowing with money, Ahn-jaehyun would truly become what he wanted to be. \u00a0He\u2019ll be able to become a Warlord.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes. \u00a0I have to quickly make money, so I can give my Skeletons good weapons to carry around. \u00a0It isn\u2019t the time to be standing around like this.\u2019</p><br/><p>The thought forced Ahn-jaehyun into moving.</p><br/><p>Ahn-jaehyun finished his coffee, then he put on his clothes. It was light clothes suited for the end of spring, when summer started to approach. \u00a0His clothes showed off his skinny frame.</p><br/><p>Ahn-jaehyun adjusted his glasses, then he stepped out of the house.</p><br/><p>[Maung\u2019s Request]</p><br/><p>\u2013 Quest Rank : Rare</p><br/><p>\u2013 Quest Requirement Level : None</p><br/><p>\u2013 Quest Summary : Investigate the monsters inside the Pareung Forest.</p><br/><p>\u2013 Quest Reward : Maung\u2019s Trust</p><br/><p>He manipulated the clock to confirm the content of the Quest. \u00a0Then Hyrkan turned his head, and he stared at the mountain in front of him. \u00a0Even viewing it from afar, the large forest gave off a sense of peril.</p><br/><p>The full forest held a foreboding feeling.</p><br/><p>Pareung Forest.</p><br/><p>It was crawling with monsters over level 90. \u00a0It was a region where a single village hadn\u2019t formed even now. Decent regular users wouldn\u2019t even dare to approach this region. The fairly high level users would come with a party formed by the guild. \u00a0It was a place where they would be inserted for a full-scale fighting.</p><br/><p>From the corner of the Pareung Forest, the sound of explosions rang out, and fire rose into the air. \u00a0Sometimes he would hear a chilling and powerful cry of a monster.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan, who was viewing this sight, quickly put on the Hahoe mask slung on the waist of his armor. \u00a0His new armor gave off a sense of sleekness and sophistication. He also wore a hooded shirt inside his armor, and he put on the hood. \u00a0When he put on his hood, darkness descended to cover Hyrkan\u2019s face. \u00a0\u00a0</p><br/><p>Then he was with the Darkness.</p><br/><p>[Shadow Hunting Dog Set\u2019s Special Option \u2018Shadow Hunting Doge\u2019 was activated.]</p><br/><p>[Shadow Hunting Doge Set\u2019s Special Effect increased movement speed.]</p><br/><p>[Shadow Hunting Doge Set\u2019s Special Effect dims the presence of the wearer.]</p><br/><p>[Shadow Hunting Doge Set\u2019s Special Effect decreases defense by 20%.]</p><br/><p>The new power wrapped itself around Hyrkan. As Hyrkan felt the power of his new Defensive Set surround him, he softly spat out his resolve.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill all the bastards, who will interfere with me making my money.\u201d</p><br/><p>His account held $232,120, \u00a0It was a resolve made by someone who had to make a monthly payment of couple thousand a month for the V Gear.</p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

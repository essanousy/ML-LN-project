Within its helmet, two jet-black pupils shone with dignity.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyrkan, can you really kill that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bear Warrior.</p><br/><p>It was the lord of the Bulkas Mountain Range, and as the one in the middle of the strange occurrences happening in the Bulkas Mountain Range, it gave off a fitting aura. Its intimidating presence was enough to make even the most experienced player whimper in fear. It fact, it would be the expected reaction for most.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, I\u2019m Hyrkan. Super Star Hyrkan!\u201d</p><br/><p>In front of such a fearsome monster, the ones that weren\u2019t scared were the strange ones. Some that talked nonsense instead of whimpering were the abnormal and crazy ones.</p><br/><p>Even back then, Hyrkan was showing his extraordinary talent. His presence wasn\u2019t any less than the Bear Warrior\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on, you\u2019re really going to push for that nickname?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJaehyun, I\u2019m fine with most things you do, but that nickname is a little\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep. He\u2019s usually weird, but at times, he really likes to prove his weirdness with his entire body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe can fight so well because he\u2019s crazy. What sane person would go all into strength and jump into a fight with a monster like that? You\u2019ll die with just a single hit and end up sucking on your fingers for two days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAw, shut it! Stop making fun of someone who\u2019s volunteering to go on the frontlines to fight a monster like that. If you don\u2019t stop, I\u2019m going to just leave this guild!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyrkan always made his presence known and proved himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s stop the chitchat and focus on the battle. I\u2019ll distract that guy and open his back, and you guys shoot some magic, got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>That he was more capable than anyone else.</p><br/><p>Moreover\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it looks like I\u2019m about to die, then help. Don\u2019t be stingy with heals. Alright, let\u2019s finish this! Let\u2019s show them we\u2019re not to be stopped here!\u201d</p><br/><p>He constantly proved that those that followed him\u2026 would reach the skies with him.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is the first time I realized how good I am at remembering things.\u2019</p><br/><p>Now, however\u2026 those memories were nothing but emotional baggage he wanted to throw away.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan shoved those memories into oblivion.</p><br/><p>\u2018No need to remember those bastards.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although memories weren\u2019t something one could easily forget, Hyrkan had done so at this moment.</p><br/><p>He only sought memories he found useful.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bear Warrior has 3 phases total.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Bear Warrior had 3 phases which changed based on its HP.</p><br/><p>When its HP was above 70%, its attacks included only its standard attack mixed with two basic skills. Its aggro was directed at the last one to attack it. The two basic skill it had were Shout and Charge. Charge had a 60 second cooldown time, and Shout had 170 seconds. It also had the Fear skill, which was something almost all boss monsters had, and Fear was on a 900 second cooldown time.</p><br/><p>When its HP fell below 70%, it entered its second phase. The Charge skill fell to a 30 second cooldown time, and all of its stats increased by 10%. At the same time, when it was attacked by magic, it would always go after the magician regardless of aggro.</p><br/><p>When its HP fell below 30%, it entered its third phase. The Shout skill turned into a passive skill. Debuff skills no longer worked on it, and the cooldown time on Charge disappeared. On top of all this, its stats increased by 33%.</p><br/><p>The key point in conquering the Bear Warrior was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Taking off its armor and shield.\u2019</p><br/><p>Disarming.</p><br/><p>If compared to a player, it would be a wearing a full set.</p><br/><p>It was equipped with a helmet, a breastplate, shoulder pads, gloves, and boots. Its upper body was entirely covered with armor. Its lower body was mostly protected with only the inside part of its thighs open. Even so, its thick hair protected the thighs, and it was naturally difficult to attack that area.</p><br/><p>Finally, it was equipped with a shield bigger than its own body and a scimitar-shaped sword bigger than an adult male.</p><br/><p>The best way to deal damage was to use magic. Fire attribute magic was especially strong against the Bear Warrior as it pierced its armor. However, using fire attribute magic as the main source of damage caused a huge problem when the Bear Warrior entered its second phase. In its second phase, it became a bulldozer that used Charge at magicians in the back while ignoring everything else.</p><br/><p>When it entered its third phase, that\u2019s when the real hell began. In a situation where there were less magicians, the raid team would now have to deal with fully armed Bear Warrior who couldn\u2019t get debuffed. There was no way the remaining tankers and strikers could deal with it.</p><br/><p>As such, it was best if one could take off at least 2 of its armor parts, preferably its breastplate and shield.</p><br/><p>Without the breastplate, its entire upper body became a target. If needed, one could even climb on its back to deal damage. Without its armor, the Bear Warrior wasn\u2019t so difficult.</p><br/><p>Without the shield, the power of its Charge would lessen greatly. When the Bear Warrior used Charge, it put its shield in front of itself. Plus, if it used Charge without its shield, it took self-inflicted damage.</p><br/><p>That was the very basic of Bear Warrior hunting method.</p><br/><p>\u201929 points on its shoulders and ribs.\u2019</p><br/><p>The real point was to aim for the 29 points joining its armor.</p><br/><p>The very basic hunting method was something anyone could figure out from seeing its appearance. With just that, it couldn\u2019t really be called a hunting method. A real hunting method had to be more detailed.</p><br/><p>The 29 points that Hyrkan knew about. It was something worthy of being sold for money.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll first aim for the left shoulder which is holding the shield.\u2019</p><br/><p>What Hyrkan had to do now was show how it was done.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyrkan took a deep breath of air, then used a skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cGolem Summon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>The clash between the 4-meter tall Golem and the 4-meter tall Bear Warrior was more one-sided than one might have imagined.</p><br/><p>Kuoo!</p><br/><p>Contrary to his ferocious growl, the Bear Warrior moved with shrewdness.</p><br/><p>Clang!</p><br/><p>It blocked the Golem\u2019s arm swing with its shield, and took advantage of any gap in defense it could find to slash its sword.</p><br/><p>Puhat!</p><br/><p>It slashed down at the Golem\u2019s left shoulder as if to instantly sever it. For the Golem who was on the receiving end, it could only be thankful that it was a sword and not an axe.</p><br/><p>\u2018Amazing.\u2019</p><br/><p>Watching this scene, Hyrkan could feel a phantom pain in his shoulder. That was how strong the blow was. The Bear Warrior\u2019s attack was both powerful and excellently executed.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is not the time to be impressed.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan gritted his teeth and organized his thoughts. Then, he swung his right arm like a whip.</p><br/><p>Whoosh!</p><br/><p>The Golem copied Hyrkan\u2019s movements and swung its arm like a whip, albeit slower. The Bear Warrior easily blocked its attack with its shield.</p><br/><p>Kwang!</p><br/><p>Although it looked like a simple clash, the sound suggested otherwise. The boom from their clash was something straight out of a car crash.</p><br/><p>Kuooo!</p><br/><p>The Bear Warrior\u2019s roar cut through the booming sound and rang out.</p><br/><p>Crack!</p><br/><p>It swung down with its sword once again, which penetrated deeply into the Golem\u2019s left shoulder, which had yet to recover. The sword continued down from the Golem\u2019s left shoulder to its chest. The resulting wound was enough to instantly kill a human being. Thankfully, the one with the wound was a Golem.</p><br/><p>Furthermore\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Okay!\u2019</p><br/><p>The chance Hyrkan had been waiting for had come.</p><br/><p>\u201cHardening!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Hyrkan used the skill, his Golem which had partially turned to dirt started hardening. Then, the Golem\u2019s body grabbed onto the Bear Warrior\u2019s sword.</p><br/><p>Kuuu!</p><br/><p>Although the Bear Warrior tried its hardest to pull out the sword, the Golem\u2019s body held onto the sword tightly and refused to let it go.</p><br/><p>Snap!</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Hyrkan snapped his fingers.</p><br/><p>Whish!</p><br/><p>As soon as the signal came, two Skeleton Warriors that had been waiting in the corner made their appearance. Two Black Orc Skeleton Warriors fearlessly charged at the Bear Warrior.</p><br/><p>Puhat!</p><br/><p>In that instant, the Bear Warrior kicked the Golem\u2019s body with its foot, successfully pulling out its sword from its body. With the sword pulled out, the Golem stiffly fell backwards.</p><br/><p>Bom!</p><br/><p>When the Golem\u2019s body touched the ground, the ground rumbled slightly. The Bear Warrior immediately turned its body to face the two Skeleton Warriors charging at it. It then opened its mouth big.</p><br/><p>Through its mouth\u2026</p><br/><p>Kuaaa!</p><br/><p>[Skeleton Warriors ignored the Bear Warrior\u2019s Fear.]</p><br/><p>Fear struck out.</p><br/><p>Of course, Fear had no effect on the Skeleton Warriors. Undead monsters had no such thing as a sense of fear. It was one of the benefits of having Skeleton Warriors.</p><br/><p>Of course, just that wasn\u2019t enough to cover the overwhelming difference between the Skeleton Warriors and the Bear Warrior.</p><br/><p>Swish!</p><br/><p>With a swing of its sword, the Bear Warrior easily took care of one of the Skeleton Warriors.</p><br/><p>Puhat!</p><br/><p>A Skeleton Warrior was cut in two in an instant and fell on the ground.</p><br/><p>Although the other Skeleton Warrior swung its sword at the Bear Warrior, the Bear Warrior\u2019s shield blocked the attack with a \u2018clang.\u2019 Although the Skeleton Warrior tried to continue its attack, a sword bore down like lightning from beyond the shield.</p><br/><p>To evade the attack, the Skeleton Warrior quickly sidestepped to the right.</p><br/><p>Crack!</p><br/><p>However, the Bear Warrior was quicker. The Skeleton Warriors left armor was severed off cleanly.</p><br/><p>As the Skeleton Warrior staggered after losing its balance, the Bear Warrior struck the Skeleton Warrior with its shield. The Skeleton Warrior\u2019s body flew into the air effortlessly.</p><br/><p>An overwhelming strength!</p><br/><p>It was enough to make most players gasp with horror. However, Hyrkan didn\u2019t so much as to flinch at the sight of it.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan. The moment the Bear Warrior struck the Skeleton Warriors with its shield, he was already flying towards the Bear Warrior\u2019s back. Like an arrow flying through the air, Hyrkan drew a parabola and landed on the Bear Warrior\u2019s left shoulder.</p><br/><p>The armor at this spot was lighter than in the rest of the Bear Warrior\u2019s body to allow its joints to move more freely. Hyrkan stabbed his sword in at this spot.</p><br/><p>Crack!</p><br/><p>The sound of armor being penetrated rang out.</p><br/><p>Then\u2026</p><br/><p>Stab!</p><br/><p>So did the sound of its skin being penetrated.</p><br/><p>That was the end to the sound.</p><br/><p>\u2018A bit light.\u2019</p><br/><p>There were no deeper sounds. Instead, another sound rang out.</p><br/><p>[Bear Warrior falls under the Demon Curse.]</p><br/><p>The system alert from the Bear Warrior falling under the Demon Curse.</p><br/><p>Kuooo!</p><br/><p>To cleanse the curse it just received, the Bear Warrior used Shout. The ringing from the shout lightly shook Hyrkan who was hanging by the sword stabbed into the Bear Warrior.</p><br/><p>[Demon Curse disappears due to the Bear Warrior\u2019s Shout.]</p><br/><p>The curse had disappeared!</p><br/><p>However, Hyrkan didn\u2019t panic.</p><br/><p>\u2018A game is just a game.\u2019</p><br/><p>Instead, Hyrkan acted as if he had expected it to happen. He used the sword stuck in the Bear Warrior as a pivot to spin himself like a hand of a clock. From 6 to 10, Hyrkan quickly climbed the Bear Warrior\u2019s shoulder. Immediately afterwards, he pulled out the Orc Hero\u2019s Sword and threw it somewhere.</p><br/><p>Then, in the hole made by the Orc Hero\u2019s Sword, he stabbed in another sword.</p><br/><p>Stab!</p><br/><p>This time, a deeper sound rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAha!\u201d</p><br/><p>As did Hyrkan\u2019s laughter.</p><br/><p>[Bear Warrior falls under the Demon Curse.]</p><br/><p>[Bear Warrior falls under the Slow Curse.]</p><br/><p>[Bear Warrior falls under the Corrosive Ghost.]</p><br/><p>The three curses quickly swallowed the Bear Warrior\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Their effects were instant.</p><br/><p>The Bear Warrior turned its head to the left to bite Hyrkan. However, his movement was visibly slower than before.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan quickly jumped off the Bear Warrior, using its shoulder as a launching pad. Even afterwards, he had some time, which he of course used effectively.</p><br/><p>\u2018Here you go!\u2019</p><br/><p>Hyrkan grabbed a fist-sized skeleton that was hanging on his chest and threw it into the Bear Warrior\u2019s mouth. The skeleton grew in size to that of an apple.</p><br/><p>Then\u2026</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>It exploded.</p><br/><p>It was Hyrkan\u2019s new level 60 skill, Bone Explosive. Like Skeleton Warriors, they had to be crafted using materials from monsters. The one Hyrkan just threw was worth 50 gold. Although it was called an explosive, it was just throwing money in Hyrkan\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Its power was easy to see.</p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t enough to deal fatal damage. In fact, after being struck by the Bone Explosive, the Bear Warrior used Charge at Hyrkan who had just landed on the ground. It was the perfect sneak attack.</p><br/><p>Those who didn\u2019t know about it would fall victim to it without doubt.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmph.\u2019</p><br/><p>However, it was an attack pattern within Hyrkan\u2019s expectations. After landing on the ground, Hyrkan immediately moved to his right.</p><br/><p>Whosh!</p><br/><p>A bulldozer razed the spot Hyrkan had just been. There was nothing Hyrkan could do to stop the Bear Warrior when it was using Charge. It was hard enough to dodge it.</p><br/><p>Kwaaaaa!</p><br/><p>The Bear Warrior stopped only after crashing down five, large trees. Then, it turned around and faced Hyrkan once again.</p><br/><p>Hyrkan didn\u2019t smile at the sight.</p><br/><p>\u2018158 seconds.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was colder than ever.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll get at least 10 points within the next 158 seconds.\u2019</p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

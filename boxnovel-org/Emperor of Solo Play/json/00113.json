The word, Unique, drove people into a fervor. \u00a0This was the same for Rare Boss monsters. \u00a0Either the odds were very low or one had to fulfill a particular set of requirements to be able to meet a Rare Boss monster. The reward given out was proportional to how difficult it was to encounter the monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It gave ingredients Items with good Options, very good EXP, and rare titles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of that...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you thinking about uploading the hunting video again?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Raid videos was an opportunity to bring in a lot of money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course. It's my meal ticket.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he decided to commit to the Black Tree Raid, all the risk regarding the Raid was erased from his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Return! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead, Hyrkan's head was filled with thoughts about the costs in regards to the Black Tree. Hyrkan \u00a0had carried out numerous Raids before, but the most profit he could make until now was riding on this Black Tree Raid. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Hyrkan asked an indirect question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it a problem? \u00a0Do you want me to edit you out? \u00a0Do you want a mosaic? Or do you want a share?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he wasn't asking those questions, because he wanted to cede those things. Still, he asked the question to confirm where he stood with Whistling. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Whistling shook his head from side to side at Hyrkan's questions. It was the reaction Hyrkan had wanted to see. \u00a0However, instead of a smile, Hyrkan couldn't help, but feel amazed by Whistling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He really is an incredible person. \u00a0He is giving up everything to save the Elven tribe....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling was giving up Items and rights that was rightfully his. \u00a0Of course, if one wasn't competent, it was moot point in the first place. \u00a0If Hyrkan was in Whistling's shoes, he would have acted differently. If he couldn't have it, then no one could. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If some else saw Whistling's action, he would be labeled a stupid loser.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan didn't even think those thought. Instead, Hyrkan felt truly amazed by Whistling's action. \u00a0Even if Hyrkan died and woke up again, he would never be able to live his life like Whistling. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling's action made Hyrkan's heart shake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf this business ends well, let's have some melon beer together.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The words that came out of Hyrkan's mouth was very rare. It was hard to hear such words from him. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling answered Hyrkan with his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll show you my battle footage.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling's voice and expression was very serious. His expression was especially overwhelming. His face looked like that of a pitbull, and his face came off as menacing when his face turned serious. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had seen all kinds of monsters... \u00a0These monsters were beyond odd. The monsters had outer appearances that was hair-raising, yet Hyrkan smiled as he killed the monster. He had thought about the Items they would give. \u00a0However, Pitbull's face even made Hyrkan flinch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hyrkan immediately changed his mindset. He locked away such nonsensical thoughts deep within his stomach.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had to make preparations for the battle. \u00a0Of course, Hyrkan didn't need to see the footage. \u00a0He already knew how to take down the Black Tree. \u00a0However, he couldn't explain that to Whistling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling immediately showed the footage of his battles with the Black Tree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Black Tree was quite big. \u00a0It was around 30 meters tall. \u00a0If ten broad shouldered men linked hands, they would barely be able to surround the circumference of the tree. The special characteristic of this tree was the long and thick strand-like branches. \u00a0It was closer to whips than tree branches.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Its attack method was quite simple. \u00a0It took root into the ground, and it swung its whip-like branches towards its enemies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was very simple, but the power behind the strikes were enormous. The tree branch headed towards its target as it divided the wind. \u00a0The sound of the strike would make anyone's neck stiffen. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whitling had tried attack the Black Tree twice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the first attempt, Whistling barely dodged the rampaging tree branches. \u00a0When he approached the main body of the Black Tree, he used his Charge skill to immediately close the distance. \u00a0Then he used a high level Booster skill, and the Flash Skill. \u00a0These skills increased the power and speed of the sword strike. \u00a0Then he used a level 150 Rare Fighter skill called Cut-Cut. \u00a0He had maximized the cutting force of the sword to the extreme.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, when the three skill combo impacted on the Black Tree's Bark, it left behind a cut that was only an inch deep.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It might be a critical wound on a human, but an attack of that caliber wasn't even considered to be a scratch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On this second attempt, Whistling aimed for the knothole. \u00a0He once again evaded the tree branches as he closed the distance with the Black Tree. \u00a0Then he aimed for one of the knotholes. \u00a0The wound was deep, but Black Sap exploded forth from the wound, and it coated Whistling's body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, the Black Tree tried to shake off Whistling, who was stuck to the tree like a bug. \u00a0It used its branch to send Whistling flying. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After being flung far into the distance, Whistling immediately got out of there. \u00a0When he saw the Black Sap eat away at his HP, he immediately realized he couldn't catch this monster by himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From that point, it took him three hours before he had contacted Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIts characteristic are\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The video had ended, and Whistling started to give a more in-depth explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI can see it for myself.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan immediately cut off Whistling with his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Tree Bark has a very high defense. Instead, we have to attack its weakness, which is the knotholes. \u00a0However, if the knothole is attacked, it'll let out the Black Sap. It is probably a poison. \u00a0No, you would have just used an antidote item if it was just a simple poison. \u00a0You were prepared for this possibility. \u00a0This means antidote item and skill won't work on this attack.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling was impressed at Hyrkan's explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are amazing. You just saw the footage once, yet you were able to come up with those answers.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt isn't anything amazing.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan displayed an ambiguous reaction, and he immediately changed the topic towards the Raid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Circlet of Purification will block any negative effect caused by the Black Sap. \u00a0This is why Chieftain Drah gave you that Item.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The solution to the biggest obstacle had already been provided.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHowever, you are the only one able to equip the Circlet of Purification right now. \u00a0You will have to do the Armor Breaking.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the Circlet of Purification couldn't be transferred. To be precise, it returned to its liquid form when held by someone other than Whistling. \u00a0This was why the Armor Breaking or the expansion of the knothole was Whistling's job.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's role was to occupy the several dozen tree branches, so Whistling could focus on his job.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt won't be easy. \u00a0This is especially true for you, Hahoe Mask. \u00a0If the task becomes too arduous, you can just leave me behind.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one looked at the difficulty of their tasks, Hyrkan's role was overwhelmingly more difficult. \u00a0Since Whistling had the Circlet of Purification, he had to just climb the tree to attack the knotholes. \u00a0He had a body that could easily climb a cliff of 90 degree to 150 degrees. \u00a0The act of climbing a tree was nothing to Whistling. Moreover, the Black Tree's Bark was so rough that one could easily find the handholds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, Hyrkan had to face several dozen wild tree branches. \u00a0It was almost impossible to imagine how a single person could pull it off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was such a difficult task that Whistling had told Hyrkan to run away if things got bad.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan's reaction to Whistling's reaction was unexpected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo, it isn't really that hard...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling was surprised. \u00a0However, Hyrkan didn't give an explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are the one doing the hard work. \u00a0My role is just to put a bow on at the end.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling soon found out the meaning of Hyrkan's words.</span></p><br/><p>9.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The process of finding the Black tree had been complicated and difficult. \u00a0Just hearing about how Whistling did it made Hyrkan dizzy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The first requirement was to receive the Black Tree's Curse Quest from the Tehkee tribe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, to find the Black Tree hiding within the lush forest, one needed to find the 'Compass Twig'.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, one could receive this twig only if one had high affinity to the Mooah tribe. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, one needed the 'Tree Alarm Clock' from the Soorey Tribe to be able to wake up the Black Tree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the order of obtaining these Items happened in reverse order. \u00a0One had to increase affinity with the Soorey tribe by doing Quests related to them. \u00a0This will allow one to establish a connection with the Mooah tribe. Then one wouldl be able to receive the request from the Tehkee tribe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one was crazy enough to do all the Quests related to the Elven tribe, one would be able to do the Black Tree hunt. \u00a0Currently, Whistling was the only User that had reached this point.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, at that moment, Whistling was thankful that he had developed a good relationship with Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018How surprising.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, he was in awe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling had climbed up the body of the Black tree, and he was widening the knotwholes. \u00a0When he looked at Hyrkan from the side of his eyes, he saw 15 Skeleton Warriors nimbly dodging the Black Tree's branches.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hoo-oohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The tree branches were letting out a heavy sound as they flew towards the 15 Skeleton Warriors. \u00a0It was like watching a circus show. \u00a0It didn't feel like a battle at all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This had been the cause of Hyrkan's confidence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan confirmed it the moment he saw Whistling's video. \u00a0The branches of the Black Tree moved slower than he had originally expected. \u00a0He realized the Skeletons he had poured much effort and care into developing would be able to dodge the Black Tree\u2019s attacks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he had three more cards he could play aside the Skeleton Warriors to catch the Black Tree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The magic spells are coming. You should dodge it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His first card was the Skeleton Magicians, who could control the aggro.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His second card was his Golem. \u00a0Of course, it wasn't an ordinary Golem. \u00a0When he decided to do the Black Tree Raid, he immediately bought the Ingredient Gem of a level 140 Boss monster called the Elephant Colossus. \u00a0The Elephant Colossus was a large sculpture with the head of an elephant. \u00a0It had a human body with four arms. Hyrkan had used it as ingredient to the Clay Play, because this particular monster was very good at using its arms. As Hyrkan had expected, the Elephant Colossus was able to grab the tree branches, and a tug of war ensued. There were times when all four hands had grasped a tree branch each.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was very effective.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The third card was Hyrkan himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan took an active role as one of the cards. It had been about 50 minutes when the Black Tree entered into its Third Phase.</span></p><br/><p>10.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018As expected of Pitbull, he is very skilled.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan admired Whistling's skill at Armor Breaking. He was giving help, but there was no reason for him to disparage Whistling's skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hyrkan knew about Whistling's capability, but he never expected him to be so good in a Raid. \u00a0Hyrkan had thought Whistling was more specialized towards PVP than Raids.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If his level and Items could be upgraded... \u00a0No, he could get into any primary Raid teams of the 30 great guilds right now.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling's ability shined even in a Raid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fact that he could enter into the first team of the 30 great guilds meant that he was one of the top players in Warlord. However, this person had faded away from people's memories. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was able to have an uncanny appreciation of this User. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, a thought crossed Hyrkan's mind. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I had met someone like Whistling instead of the Hahoe Mask guild before I returned to the past\u2026\u2026.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe Hyrkan would have been like Whistling. \u00a0Instead of using the game as a tool to gain resources and achieve a goal, he might have lived life as he enjoyed the game itself. \u00a0What kind of life would he have lead? \u00a0Hyrkan couldn't even imagine such a scenario.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Stop fucking with yourself, Ahn-jaehyun.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn't imagine it, but he had been trying to imagine it. \u00a0He made a sarcastic remark disparaging himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These thoughts were unbecoming of Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The timing is almost right.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan wasn't suited for some quiet fantasy game. He was intense, which lead to his flashy style. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The flashiness allowed him to make money. \u00a0He could become the best only if he could make money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was what the game meant to Hyrkan. There was no room for romanticism in this game for him. \u00a0It was a matter of life and death. \u00a0This was the only two choice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The same was true of today. \u00a0He wasn't here to simply succeed in the raid. \u00a0He had come here prepared to sell the Raid footage. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGet down, Whistling. \u00a0I'll end this.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was time for him to unveil 'that'.</span></p><br/><p>11.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The first explosive detonated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng, kwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Black Sap continuously dripped down from all over the body. \u00a0The sound of explosives going off was heard, and flames erupted. \u00a0When the flames erupted, the Black Tree looked like a decorated Christmas tree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The string of explosions were so numerous that it couldn't be contained. \u00a0It started to spread. \u00a0It was like looking at night sky in a rural area where the stars dotted the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The explosives are going off quite well.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he watched the sight, Hyrkan was struck with a feeling of admiration inside, but he had a sad expression on his face. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bone Explosives. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the main cause of the explosions going off right now. \u00a0Hyrkan had prepared several hundred Bone Explosives to kill the Black Tree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The total cost of this was unknown. \u00a0Hyrkan had bought ingredients for the Bone Explosives whenever he saw cheap Bone Ingredient Coins come up on the market. He made the Bone Ingredients into Bone Explosives, then he had put it into the Item Storage. \u00a0He had brought out most of the Bone Explosives he had save this time around. \u00a0It was possible for him to calculate the total cost, but he intentionally didn't calculate it. \u00a0His insides would burst if he did.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One thing was for certain. \u00a0Several thousand gold was going off right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The picture will look fantastic.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't really need to catch the Black Tree like this. The large group of bombs were set off for show, and it was a waste of resource. This was evidence that Hyrkan was playing this game for materialistic reasons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling's expression became a bit heavier when he witnessed the sight. \u00a0Whistling quickly realized the reason for the spectacle in front of his eyes. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He's desperate.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As someone who was born into a wealthy family, he could play this game for pleasure. \u00a0Unlike him, Hyrkan had to think about the spectacle, and the way he could sell this footage. \u00a0Hyrkan wasn't playing this game for himself. \u00a0He was playing for others, and Whistling felt sympathy towards Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Whistling didn't pity Hyrkan. \u00a0He didn't have a reason or the qualification to be able to pity him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He just expressed his thanks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling had set up the table, yet he wouldn't have been able to eat the meal if not for Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you need any help, please don't hesitate to call on me. \u00a0If it is a request from you, I'll help you once with no questions asked.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan expressed his thanks. At the same time, Hyrkan put himself under Whistling's debt. \u00a0He had done something that left him grasping the short end of the stick. \u00a0Maybe it was a way for him to leave a point of contact with Whistling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, both Users....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You've gained the Title ' Black Tree Logger'.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Announcement that signaled the end of the hunt rang out.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

This wasn't an unusual sight. \u00a0In Warlord, there were numerous Users that were able to run faster than a cheetah. \u00a0It was something anyone could do if one invested in the Strength Stat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was one person here where the swift movement was incongruous with his physique. A User with an egregiously obese body was moving at lightning speed... \u00a0It was analogous to seeing a pig that should be too fat to move running faster than a cheetah. It was something one didn\u2019t see everyday.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is my first mission! If you guys ruin this for me, all of you will suffer the consequences!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Apollo had become an officer of the Big Smiles guild, the guild had attached skilled Users to him. \u00a0It was to help Apollo out. Apollo was berating one of these skilled Users named Chiroro.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this was possible since this was a game. \u00a0It was almost impossible to shout at someone when one was running at full speed. \u00a0If this wasn't a game, Apollo wouldn't be able to run this fast. \u00a0He would probably pant and sweat profusely just from act of walking out of his house. He probably wouldn't even be able to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Chiroro was nodding his head outwardly, and he was ridiculing Apollo on the inside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This pig is too greedy. \u00a0He'll make me suffer the consequence? \u00a0How laughable. \u00a0If you had just been a little bit more competent at blocking the Pitbull, we wouldn't be in this situation.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling Pitbull. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had messed with a member of the Fighters guild. \u00a0However, this wasn't a decision made solely by Apollo. \u00a0It was a decision made by the Big Smiles Guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So why were they messing with Pitbull? \u00a0The underlying cause in most fights were similar. It was an action taken to settle a wrong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Big Smiles guild had taken heavy damage with the war against the Triple Wings, but their situation had stabilized now. \u00a0Even though they found stability within, the situation around them were a different story. \u00a0Before they knew it, the Big Smiles guild had come out at the bottom of the 30 great guilds ranking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they fell to the floor, there was a host of guilds beneath their feet. \u00a0The Underfoot guilds now looked at the Big Smiles guild in a different light. \u00a0They weren't viewed as a wall they had to climb over. \u00a0The Big Smiles guild was now perceived to be a prey they had to eat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They needed to punish someone as a warning to others. \u00a0They had to show others that this was a dog eat dog world out there, and they were the dog that ate the other dog.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were very confident that they could accomplish this. \u00a0The Big Smiles guild was on the lowest seat, but the resources of a 30 great guild was vastly different from the Underfoot guilds. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem had been clearly defined.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had come up with several plans to solve this problem, and one of them was to capture the Whistling Pitbull.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling was a member of the Fighters guild, and his level was very high. He was also very skilled, but on the face of it, he was a regular guild member. \u00a0Even if some problem arises, the backlash would be mild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he usually played by himself. \u00a0His personality was aggressive, so he didn't back down from fights that came this way. \u00a0This was true even if it was a fight against numerous opponents. \u00a0He would never back down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one put a positive spin to it, he had a very fiery and cool personality. \u00a0On the other hand, these characteristics made him easy to catch. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, Whistling had easily fallen for their provocation. When they had surrounded him, he didn't avoid the fight. \u00a0Whistling actually went on the offensive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the problem started from there. The target of Whistling's sudden attack was Apollo, and Apollo was defeated before he could do anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Well, maybe it was because Pitbull is amazing.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chiroro clicked his tongue when he thought about what had happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been a terrifying sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling used the Charge skill to close the distance with Apollo in an instant, and he used Body Slam on his opponent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo's corpulent flew away like a balloon, and Whistling followed after him. \u00a0Before Apollo could hit the ground, Whistling's skill-infused sword strikes struck Apollo's body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng, kahn-ahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The consecutive sword strikes dented Apollo's armor. \u00a0In the end, Whistling was able to sever Apollo's left arm and right knee. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sudden attack and the Body Slam had made the contest into a one on one battle. He used that brief moment after connecting his skill and sword strikes to use the Body Maiming method.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Also, I never expected him to run away at that point.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After showing his almost godlike techniques, Whistling ran away the moment he saw an opportunity. \u00a0This was the most unexpected part of all of this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling's personality didn't allow him run away. He usually just accepted his death as he fought on in a hopeless situation. \u00a0He was called Pitbull not just because of his appearance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways, if Apollo had been able to hold out, they wouldn't have lost Whistling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I can't believe he was sent flying from a single blow.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chiroro couldn't hold back his mocking laugh when he once again thought about what had happened to Apollo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Items are wasted on that bastard.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo's Items were the best one could get at level 140. \u00a0He had a Unique set. \u00a0It was an Item setting that even Chiroro wouldn\u2019t be able to acquire. He was wearing such Items yet he was defeated with a single blow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Money is everything. \u00a0Yes, money is everything.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The halo of his father was over Apollo. \u00a0He had bought off the other officers, and he had been lucky in being able to hold a weakness over a particular officer. \u00a0Apollo would have never become an officer of the Big Smiles guild if he didn't have all these factors going for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the officers of the Big Smiles guild and the guild members that had similar rank as him welcomed Apollo's appearance. They wanted to receive the crumbs that would fall off Apollo's table. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was true for Chiroro too.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Well, I'll wipe his butt, and I'll receive ample amount of money for my troubles.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Chiroro was sticking so close to Apollo's side. He wanted to get the crumbs by being the closest to Apollo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo was letting out steam as he kept expressing his anger. \u00a0Chiroro was ridiculing him inside as he tried to hold back his sneer. \u00a0At that moment, a message from the Voice Talk program arrived . </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- We found Pitbull! </span></p><br/><p>6.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling gritted his teeth as he saw the five Users surround him. Whistling's vision was very blurry when he looked at the 5 Users. His vision was akin to one's vision when walking in a downpour without an umbrella. \u00a0It was as if the wind was blowing against one's eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, his arms and legs felt as if it was being weighed down by very heavy sandbags. \u00a0He was moving very slow compared to his usual self.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the result of the Debuff magic. He had been hit with Haze and Slow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I was unlucky.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling had been quite successful in his escape. \u00a0In truth, the Puree forest was so large that it was more advantageous for the fugitive than the pursuit group.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Whistling had travelled inside the Puree forest as if it was his home prior to this, so there was zero chance that he would get lost here. If he wanted to, he could hide inside the Tehkee tribe's village where only allowed Users could enter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unfortunately, he had come across the Big Smiles' guild member conducting a regular hunt instead of the the pursuit group.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, Whistling didn't realize they were members of the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0He had been about to pass them by.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His luck worsened when the members of the Big Smiles guild party was infused with several skilled Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon't attack him! Contain! Just contain him!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe just need to buy some time. Just stop him from moving.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon't hoard your consumable Items. \u00a0Put three candies into your mouth!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe effect of the Skill won't last long now. \u00a0I've started Casting, so you guys have to \u00a0buy me some time before I can use my magic.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit. If I reroll a character, I'll never choose Tanker again.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These Users were well aware of the situation, and they had arrived at the most optimal course of action. Whistling felt that it wouldn't be easy for him to get out of this situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The critical blow had been the Debuff magic. In a PK, being stabbed was preferable to being hit by Debuff magic spells.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I should have used the Circlet of Purification.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he boiled everything down into simple terms, this was all happening because of Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling had put away the Circlet of Purification inside the pouch. \u00a0He considered the Item as being owned by the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was also running away, because of the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0He wasn't afraid of dying, but he had to send the Circlet of Purification to the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0He would feel troubled if that was delayed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had connected to the game early, and he had moved as he was being chased by time. \u00a0This was all being done, so he could quickly give the Circlet of Purification to the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Whistling didn't blame the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to survive somehow.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He tried to conceive a plan where he'll come out alive. However, five additional Users appeared, and Whistling couldn't help but feel hopeless at his prospects. </span></p><br/><p>7.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chiroro and Apollo arrived. \u00a0Whistling was in a bad spot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There wouldn\u2019t be any close contest here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling was by himself, and he had 10 opponents. \u00a0Moreover, there were two magicians included in the group of 10 Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The difference in fighting power was so big that it wouldn't be a close fight. \u00a0The ten Users had a numerical advantage, and they were aggressively using the support of the Magicians. \u00a0The Strikers surrounded Whistling, and the Magicians threw their magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGood job!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling was becoming a mess as the one-sided magical bombardment was sent towards him. \u00a0The happiest person from seeing Whistling like this was Apollo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Apollo had ordered for this ugly spectacle to happen. \u00a0As he was coming here, Apollo made sure no one would kill Pitbull until he got there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, Chiroro's face hardened when he saw what was transpiring.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit. \u00a0It would be best if he would just end this.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This business wasn't about punishing or taking revenge on Whistling. This was supposed to be an opening act to a war. The opening act had to be clean.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the current situation was lame. No matter who saw it their actions was lame and cheap. \u00a0There was no way this incident would help Big Smiles in any way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chiroro took a peek at Apollo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He was in charge of running a guild with his namesake, yet why is he so dumb?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chiroro couldn't alter the order already given by Apollo. \u00a0The two of them weren't on equal standings. \u00a0At this moment, they were in a relationship akin to a subordinate and a superior. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Chiroro was well aware of Apollo's personality. \u00a0He was crude and selfish.... \u00a0He was shamefully dirty. \u00a0If a loyal subject spoke out in a negative manner, Apollo was the type to eliminate that subordinate as a first order of business.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo had no idea what Chiroro was thinking, so he had a triumphant expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow dare you mess with me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wanted to show his expression to Whistling, so he had taken off his helmet. \u00a0He spoke in such a manner, yet he stayed far away from Whistling. \u00a0Whistling was surrounded by a ring of Users, and Apollo was about 4 to 5 meters away from the encirclement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why his words hadn\u2019t been heard by Whistling. \u00a0Whistling didn't even glance at Apollo. \u00a0He didn't even realize Apollo had appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If seen from a different perspective, it looked as if Whistling was ignoring Apollo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo's expression hardened as he yelled again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow dare you mess with me!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo yelled out in anger, and the Big Smiles guild members had an expression of derision for a brief moment when Apollo had to repeat his words. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The angry shout reached Whistling this time. \u00a0Whistling turned to at Apollo. Whistling was able to quickly find the source of the voice, since Apollo had a corpulent body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Whistling's expression hardened, and he narrowed his eyes. \u00a0Whistling's expression was deadly. Both the Users close to him and afar became alarmed at his expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo unconsciously avoided looking into Whistling's eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Huh?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Something flew towards Apollo's eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, Apollo's world had turned pitch black.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A nonsensical sound escaped Apollo's mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-uh-uh!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, Apollo's corpulent body was being dragged away by someone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? What the hell!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo couldn't comprehend what had just happened. \u00a0Chiroro was the first one to notice what had happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What's going on?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo, who had been next to him, let out a weird sound. \u00a0When Chiroro turned his head, Apollo had already been dragged away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the User dragging away Apollo was none other than the... </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahoe Mask?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the User with the most recognizable symbol in Warlord. \u00a0It was the Hahoe Mask. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018W...what the hell is going on?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chiroro was still unable to comprehend what was going on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why did the Hahoe Mask suddenly show up here? The Hahoe Mask had stabbed Apollo's eyes, and he had dragged away Apollo. \u00a0Then he started to tirelessly hack and stab Apollo's face and neck. \u00a0Why was he doing this? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH...help me\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chiroro's introspection ended when Apollo suffered a Game Over from the Hahoe Mask's continuous attack. \u00a0No, it was more apt to say a chill had run up his spine, and Chiroro had come to his senses.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahoe Mask!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chiroro let out a shout. \u00a0In a flash, the Hahoe Mask had killed Apollo. \u00a0Hyrkan took off Apollo\u2019s glove, and he was getting ready to sever Apollo's wrist to get at his watch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was clearly ignoring Chiroro.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Chiroro's sound assaulted his ears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Isn't that the Hahoe Mask? \u00a0Why did the Hahoe Mask show up here?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- What should we do? \u00a0Should we catch the Hahoe Mask too?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- What should we do with Pitbull?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Was Apollo-nim killed?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Voice Talk program vomited out a host of voices, and it cluttered Chiroro's mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chiroro yelled out in annoyance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShut the hell up!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His words had come out overly harsh. This was a direct reflection of Chiroro's unsettled mind. \u00a0On top of that, his shout had been heard by Hyrkan. \u00a0Only after taking the watch, Hyrkan looked at Chiroro.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A lot of emotions were mixed in with that sigh. \u00a0Chiroro organized his thoughts before he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you really the Hahoe Mask?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCan't you tell by seeing this?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tap tap.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan rapped against the Hahoe Mask with his finger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat did you attack us? \u00a0Are you perhap in league with the Fighters guild?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFighters?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask tilted his head in confusion. His gesture indicated that he had no idea what Chiroro was talking about. \u00a0It was quite believable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, no matter how one looked at it this looked like the Hahoe Mask jumping in to save the Pitbull.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the Hahoe Mask's response complicated the thoughts inside Chiroro's head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was only one way to defuse this situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid you attack the Big Smiles guild to rescue the Whistling Pitbull?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chiroro had to do it through dialogue. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhistling Pitbull? Do you mean that guy over there?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Chiroro's words, Hyrkan pointed at Pitbull, who was surrounded by Users. At the same time, Hyrkan yelled out his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, the dog-looking dude over there. \u00a0Do you know me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling sniffed instead of answering him. \u00a0It basically mean Whistling didn't know Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen why are you attacking us?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI didn't attack you. \u00a0I just carried out a personal revenge against the Apollo guild.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chiroro's head was about to explode at those words. \u00a0\u00a0This hadn\u2019t been some normal accident.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cApollo is now an officer of the Big Smiles guild! Shall I consider this as a hostile act against the Big Smiles?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Chiroro made a reckless gambit for the win.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of replying, Hyrkan pointed to his surrounding with his chin. \u00a0Chiroro looked out of the corner of his eyes to see where Hyrkan's chin was pointing towards to.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Tsk.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were a host of Skeleton Warriors waiting in Defense mode. When Hyrkan flicked his finger, they would unhesitatingly run towards Chiroro and the Big Smiles guild members.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chiroro swallowed his saliva.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018That's the Hahoe Mask's famous Skeletons.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hahoe Mask's battle capability was as advertised. \u00a0Of course, Chiroro side had enough number on their side, so there was a chance that they could win.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the damage they would take was unavoidable. \u00a0Moreover, the Hahoe Mask was great at escaping. \u00a0If he wanted to, he could use the Skeletons as bait, then he could run away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That would make this situation more troublesome.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if he could see through Chiroro's thoughts, Hyrkan spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll consider your words as a threat towards me. I'll consider those words as a declaration of war towards me by the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0From this point in time, I'll fight against the Big Smiles guild.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chiroro unconsciously swallowed his saliva at the declaration.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His rash gambit had caused a self-mate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I can't let this happen!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The worth of the Hahoe Mask was at an all time high right now. \u00a0If he showed interest in joining a guild, any 30 great guilds would treat him like an officer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the Big Smiles guild made an enemy out of him, the Hahoe Mask could join any guild if he was at a disadvantage. \u00a0This meant they would have an adversarial relationship with the guild he joined. Those in the 30 great guilds wouldn't relish fighting against Big Smiles, but they would do it if it allowed them a chance at gaining Hyrkan. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, there would be a full-scale war. \u00a0If such a situation came to be, there was high probability that the Big Smiles guild will apologize to the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0The Big Smiles guild had already gotten in big trouble from fighting with the Triple Wings, so another war with a 30 great guild was a suicidal move.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, if this situation came to pass, someone would have to take the blame. \u00a0He couldn't predict the future, but it was clear as to who will be charged for precipitating this situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW...wait a moment!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chiroro was the most likely person to be blamed in the future, so he desperately yelled out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm sorry. \u00a0I apologize.

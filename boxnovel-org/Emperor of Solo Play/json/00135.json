Was this part of the plan?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even the members of the Red Bulls guild was puzzled over the situation. \u00a0None of the members of the Red Bulls guild had been given a heads up about this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was only one person that could give an answer about the this situation. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, Chev was fighting a Frost Knight wearing an armor of ice that was freezing its immediate surrounding. \u00a0Chev was the only one, who could answer the question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Hahoe Mask.

A cold creaking sound was emitted between Kims and the Relic Guardian.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI got him!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the method used by Kims to occupy his opponent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chev immediately exited the battlefield. \u00a0Chev distanced himself from the Frost Knight, and another striker rushed into the space vacated by Chev. \u00a0A Priest immediately approached Chev.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Priest's two palms were letting out a green light, and he started touching Chev's back. \u00a0As the green light touched every part of Chev's body, the wounds on his body, and the skin that died from the extreme cold started to regenerate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he received the Healing Skill, Chev started thinking for a brief moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What is the Hahoe Mask's intent?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Red Bulls had to give an answer to the Hydra guild regarding the Hahoe Mask's action. His answer would determine if the two guilds walked together or not. \u00a0The answer was incredibly important. \u00a0This was why he couldn't give a rash, vague or an evasive answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I don't understand what the Hahoe Mask was thinking.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only thing certain right now was the fact that Chev didn't have much time to think about it. \u00a0The Priest finished his Healing skill, and he immediately started on the Buff skills. \u00a0When that finished, the time to think had come to an end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Chev didn't think about Hahoe Mask's intentions. \u00a0At that moment, he thought about what the Red Bulls and the Hydra guild had to do. \u00a0He had to determine which course of action would bring him the most profit. \u00a0This was what he thought about.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Time passed as he thought about it some more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Buff has been applied.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Priest opened his mouth, Chev also opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFocus on the battle. \u00a0While the Hahoe Mask and Stormhunters block the Immoral Prince, we'll take out all the Relic Guardians.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After giving his answer, Chev changed the setting on his mic. \u00a0He immediately gave an order to his broadcast team.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJust send anyone available towards the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0I want you to start the live broadcast, and put up a notice telling everyone of the Hahoe Mask's appearance. \u00a0Don't forget to put in the commercials.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Yes! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn't the end of it. \u00a0Chev immediately spoke into the direct hotline to the Hydra guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe'll focus on hunting down the Relic Guardians.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- \u2026\u2026understood. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Natal heard Chev's words, he didn't immediately give an answer. \u00a0There was a brief pause, and Natal spoke as if there was a bad taste in his mouth. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the conversation ended, Chev gritted his teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I\u2019ve been had by the Hahoe Mask.\u2019</span></p><br/><p>10.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was much harder than expected to fight someone who had higher Stats, higher level and better Items. \u00a0It was also difficult to gain experience against an opponent such as this. \u00a0There was no reason to fight such opponents for most people. \u00a0Instead of fighting, most people just avoided the fight all together.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there were times when these kinds of battles had been the norm for Hyrkan. \u00a0He had fought someone that was 50 levels higher than him, and there was the one who kept Unique Items in his Slots like paperhangings.... \u00a0It had been the norm to fight those bastards. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, those experiences were worth its weight in gold when facing against the Immoral Prince.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shweeeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He evaded the sword swung by the Immoral Prince. \u00a0When Hyrkan approached the Immoral Prince, he moved like a snake slithering across the floor. \u00a0Then he used a technique that looked like a tackle in wrestling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Duhp-suhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's low movements were clever as he quickly grabbed the Immoral Prince's leg. \u00a0In that state, he lifted the Immoral Prince, and he threw it as far as he could. \u00a0The Immoral Prince was in the air, but it didn't fly too far. \u00a0It quickly adjusted in midair, and it landed on the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Immoral Prince landed on the ground, one couldn't see any cracks in its defense. Instead, one could see the dark eyes from between the helmet, and one could see a dark blue light that had the sharpness of a blade. \u00a0However, the light from its eye didn\u2019t mingle with Hyrkan\u2019s gaze, which was behind the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Toohk toohk\u2026\u2026. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Two Bone Explosives had been thrown without the Immoral Prince's knowledge. \u00a0The Bone Explosives rolled up to its heel, and it promptly exploded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-gwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was hard to believe such powerful explosion came from such small Bone Explosives, and the explosion caused dust to rise into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The field of vision had become obstructed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddahk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Hyrkan flicked his finger. \u00a0The four Skeleton Warriors on standby charged towards the Immoral Prince. \u00a0The Immoral Prince quickly dispatched the Skeleton Warriors approaching it. \u00a0Amongst the Skeleton Warriors, there was one that was able to dodge the sword swung by the Immoral Prince three times. \u00a0However, none were able to block the Immoral Prince\u2019s attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The four Skeleton Warriors could only buy a short amount of time. \u00a0Hyrkan clenched his fist during that time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSpirit of Fire.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He spoke out in a low mumble. \u00a0At the same time, fire started to leak out of his clenched fist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fire in Hyrkan's hand started to spread to the floor. The fire scattered across the floor erupted, and a shape of a giant formed from within the flame.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Fire Golem has been summoned.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a level 180 Summon Skill, and this was the first appearance of the Fire Golem. \u00a0It was the first time a Fire Golem had appeared in the history of Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was large, but it couldn\u2019t be compared to the large Earth Golem he summoned before. \u00a0It was around 3 meters tall. \u00a0However, its body was burning up, and it was much more imposing than the Earth Golem. \u00a0\u00a0The two Golems were very different from each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Fire Golem approached the Immoral Prince. \u00a0The sound of the Fire Golem running was a very bleak sound. \u00a0The ground shook every time the Earth Golem stepped on the ground, and the effect was in stark contrast to the Fire Golem. \u00a0\u00a0The effect of the Fire Golem\u2019s footstep was much more focused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roo! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fire erupted at every step taken by the Fire Golem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During all of this, the Immoral Prince had defeated all the Skeleton Warriors. \u00a0When the Immoral Prince caught sight of the Fire Golem, it immediately swung its sword horizontally in a wide arc.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ssooohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying a light wind sound, the Red Moon Sword Qi was revealed once again. \u00a0In a flash, it soundlessly cut the Fire Golem in half. \u00a0The Fire Golem's body feebly fell forward, and it fell as if it was going to fall on top of Immoral Prince.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The process in which the Fire Golem was killed was neat and elegant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the resulting death was intense. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puh-uhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the severed body of the Fire Golem hit the ground, it exploded. \u00a0The explosion was quite powerful. \u00a0An enormous firestorm was created as fireballs were scattered into the surrounding. \u00a0In a flash, the surrounding had turned into a sea of fire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan rushed into the sea of fire. \u00a0It was clever move. \u00a0The fire hid Hyrkan's presence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this ruse didn\u2019t last long.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-koo-koo! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Immoral Prince opened its hand, a whirlwind appeared from its palm. \u00a0In a flash, the fire that was engulfing its body was sucked in. \u00a0It was gone in a flash. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the fire disappeared, it was clear as day as to where Hyrkan was located at. \u00a0Instead of an ambush, he repeated the greeting he conducted when they first met.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a rough greeting filled with the sound of steel clashing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Choo-roong, choo-roong! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if to answer the sound that was created, the Crying Sword started to weep. \u00a0The cry held worry for its master. \u00a0Hyrkan could resist against the Immoral Prince's strength, so Hyrkan's sword arm was flung away. \u00a0Hyrkan's stance was broken, and the sword gave out a cry of worry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immoral Prince didn't miss the opportunity to attack Hyrkan when he was off balance. \u00a0When his sword was flung backwards, Hyrkan's chest became exposed. \u00a0The Immoral Prince stabbed towards his chest. \u00a0At that moment, Hyrkan didn't struggle against his loss of balance. \u00a0He fell backwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kooohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He hadn't used any fall technique. \u00a0He fell like a log toppling backwards, and the Immoral Prince's sword passed over him. \u00a0When Hyrkan was on his back, he raised both his legs. He pushed his feet towards the nether region between its legs. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Hyrkan executed this move, the Immoral Prince's feet was lifted into the air. \u00a0Hyrkan pushed at the Immoral Prince's body, and it shot away as if was a rocket being launched.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When facing a User with overwhelmingly superior Spec, it was a certain loss if one fought by exchanging blows with each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One had to push or pull to cause a loss of balance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was also known as the Push and Pull method by the Users that were adept at PK and PVP. \u00a0This couldn\u2019t be learned by Users, who had a bad habit of picking on weaker Users. \u00a0This was a skill that could be gained by those, who are used fighting opponents stronger than them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was one of the few rewards for fighting such a long bloody battle against the Stormhunters, and everyone else in Warlord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immoral Prince didn\u2019t take much damage from such a technique. \u00a0However, the Immoral Prince was having a hard time escaping the grasp of Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's been over 5 minutes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Hyrkan easily broke the 5 minute record set by the Storm Queen against the Immoral Prince.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At this sight, the Stormhunters guild members, who had come here to catch the Immoral Prince, looked on in a spellbound manner. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIncredible.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One of the people watching the Hahoe Mask was Hahui. \u00a0She was the one, who always gritted her teeth, when the Hahoe Mask was mentioned. \u00a0However, even she couldn\u2019t hold back her admiration. \u00a0Everyone watching Hyrkan\u2019s battle couldn\u2019t help, but show admiration towards him. \u00a0Of course, this was also true for Shir.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Shir didn\u2019t stand there like Hahui, who had her mouth open in an absentminded manner. \u00a0Shir didn\u2019t reveal her emotions. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow long do I have left until the Regeneration is finished?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh? What?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were using Regeneration Skill to reattach Shir's severed arm. \u00a0The Priest had been eyeing the Hahoe Mask's battle. \u00a0At Shir's words, he quickly answered her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh!

No, the Hahoe Mask must not fall into the hands of any guild.\u2019</span></p><br/><p>12.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were several methods one could use when dealing with a User that was stronger than oneself in a PVP. \u00a0There was a method that was widely used, and it was the most effective strategy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All things yield to number!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When facing a single person, there was nothing more effective than two people stepping forward to fight the User. \u00a0Moreover, what if these two were the two best Strikers in Warlord? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One didn't have to imagine it. \u00a0The result was being broadcasted live in front of their eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan moved his sword horizontally to block the Immoral Prince's sword, which had fallen like thunder. Accompanying the sound of steel clashing, Hyrkan's feet were pounded into the ground as if they were nails.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggee-eek, ggee-eek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immoral Prince continued to press down with its sword against Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Choo-roong, choo-roong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Crying Sword was weeping, and Hyrkan's body kept sinking in sync with the sword's cries.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During all of this, Shir had approached the Immoral Prince from behind, and she hugged the Prince's leg. \u00a0She lifted its leg. \u00a0However, it seemed the Immoral Prince was used to this kind of attacks now. \u00a0He put strength into his other leg to resist, but its body inevitably lost a little bit balance. \u00a0It was inevitable. \u00a0When the Prince lost its balance, the pressure that had been pushing down on Hyrkan disappeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of extracting his body, Hyrkan sunk lower to the ground to trip the Immoral Prince. \u00a0The Immoral Prince once again lost his balance, and it fell forward. \u00a0Shir didn't miss the opportunity. \u00a0She lifted the Immoral Prince's leg, and she threw him into the distance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immoral Prince rolled several times across the floor before it righted itself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the Immoral Prince didn't have the luxury to focus its attention on the two. \u00a0Hyrkan flicked his finger, and the three Skeleton Warriors on standby charged towards the Immoral Prince.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At best, the Skeleton Warriors would last 10 seconds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a brief amount of time, but 10 seconds was the amount of time it took for the world record holder to finish a 100 meter dash. \u00a0The two Strikers used the 10 seconds to digest all the available information, and they came up with a new plan. \u00a0Then they threw their body into motion to carry out this plan. \u00a0Ten seconds were plenty of time to do all of this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This time Shir ran forward. \u00a0She was in a sorry state. \u00a0Her concentration had reached its limit, but she still didn't hesitate at all. \u00a0Her price of death was larger than anyone else considering her position and level. \u00a0However, this was one of Shir's strong point. \u00a0She didn't have any self-conceit in regards to what she possessed. \u00a0She never thought about what she would lose. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan could read Shir's plan. \u00a0She was heading towards the rear of the Immoral Prince. \u00a0She was going to attempt an attack to bait a counter-attack from the Immoral Prince. \u00a0She was trying to create an opportunity for Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In this world and in the future, the one who was was able to understand Shir the most in battle was Hyrkan. \u00a0This was the result of an indescribable irony.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways, Hyrkan was in sync with Shir's plan. \u00a0He was moving opposite of her, and he lowered his speed compared to her. \u00a0He allowed her to reach the Immoral Prince first, and he didn't interfere with her intended action.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had given her an unseen consideration, and Shir didn't hesitate to stab her sword in between the crumbling Skeleton Warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immoral Prince was already cognizant of the attack. \u00a0It turned its body to defend. \u00a0Shir\u2019s stab was met with the swinging sword of the Immoral Prince.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng!

They went North and East.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the North held more significance since the Northland was located there. \u00a0It had been the territory ruled by Prince Dean. \u00a0If Prince Dean gained power away from the eyes of others, there was a very high possibility that he gained it in Northland where he had been in charge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why the Hyrdra guild put more meaning and gravity to the North expedition. \u00a0This was why the Hyrdra guild's best fighting asset was included within the expedition group. \u00a0Aside from Sohank, there were 33 other Users included in the Northland expedition team. \u00a0Their basic battle capability was high, and they were excellent in many other aspects too.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their Raiding ability was lacking in comparison to the primary Raid team, but in terms of exploring and regular battles, this force was better than the primary Raid team.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, after a single week into the expedition, they felt as if the stage they stepped onto was too much for them. \u00a0The monsters here were strong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were different types of monsters compared to the ones they had faced before. \u00a0There were a lot of differences on many fronts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These corpses, which was about to be turned into ice cream, were a prime examples.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This Hammerhead Giant used its hammerhead to use a Head-butt attack. \u00a0It was a bizarre form of attack. \u00a0The Deadwood Monkey's camouflage ability was so good that it was chilling. \u00a0Moreover, it possessed a poisonous stinger. \u00a0For an opponent, it was the worst possible combination of skills to face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">New methods would have to be devised to defeat them.. \u00a0Still, in another light, this could might drive up the anticipation and fun they would have in fighting them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was the white furred fox named Crystal Crescent Fox.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe caught the white furred fox in the forest.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Did you kill only one?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey don't travel in a pack, but we caught three of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- So it isn't a rare monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe shouldn't have found it in a forest. \u00a0They shouldn't be living here.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even in reality, beasts were tailored to the region they live in. \u00a0However, the monsters in Warlord didn't always suit their environment perfectly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, most of their characteristics were optimized for their habitat. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Deadwood Monkey exemplified this concept. \u00a0It was dressed to function most optimally in forests. \u00a0It wasn't a rare monster, and he had seen several of them nearby.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fox basically pointed to a single answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Snowfield\u2026\u2026 It is worth being concerned about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A monster that should be at a different stage was in this environment through some special circumstances.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What kind of stage goes well with the white fur? \u00a0A white environment goes well with it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0I'm pretty sure a snowfield will appear soon.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Snowfield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There wasn't some incredible meaning behind those words. \u00a0It was a snowfield. \u00a0\u00a0It was a sight one could see easily in real life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, up until now, no serious amount of monsters had appeared in a snowfield or a desert field. Tobo Soft hadn't officially explained why, but most Users had an idea on the reason behind it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- You'll be working hard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf it's just working hard, I\u2019ll count it as a blessing.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The level of difficulty would be unprecedented.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Let\u2019s say there was a person that could run a 100 meters in 9 seconds. \u00a0If this person ran on a snowfield or a sand pit, how much time would be added to the overall time? \u00a0It was the same concept for the battles. \u00a0Unless one is able to fight from midair, the snow or sand would sharply increase the difficulty of a battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the high difficulty wasn't a problem in itself. \u00a0This would actually increase the fun one would have on this new content. \u00a0However, if the initial barrier was too high from the beginning, the Users wouldn't even dare to attempt it. \u00a0This was a problem since the difficulty of Warlord was already high.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Such a content would arrive some day in the future.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, there was a high probability that they had already reached that point in time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Natal had said one would feel anticipation and worry at the same time. \u00a0A new stage had appeared, and only the ones that could adapt the fastest would survive. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Then that means you are going to have to work hard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The First Head was already aware of this truth, so he was brief with his words. \u00a0He swallowed the words he had been about to say. \u00a0He had been about to tell Natal about the immense difficulty being faced by the team climbing the Urugal mountain range. \u00a0Natal already had a lot to worry about, so he didn't want to put extra burdens on him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the call ended, Natal once again looked at the corpses of the monsters. \u00a0Then he scrolled down his Title list, and he looked at the 'Noble Walk' Title.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The starting point is the same for everyone. \u00a0However, I've already left the starting line earlier than anyone else.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn't checking it to see if he still had it. \u00a0He was looking at it to assure himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There is no reason why we'll come out behind.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had started out before everyone else, so there was no way they could get overtaken. \u00a0This was the message behind his self-assurance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have nothing to worry about. \u00a0I have nothing to worry....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Natal used this self-assurance to calm his restless heart.</span></p><br/><p>5.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJavelin throw!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were three meter long spears being raised from between the trees. \u00a0There were 10 in total, and the bearers of these spears were in a formation. \u00a0They were spread apart forming a parabola. \u00a0At the opening of the parabola, there were goblins wearing bone armors. \u00a0It was the Bone Armor Goblins.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rough sounds were emitted when bone impacted on bone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggee-eek, ggee-eek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Afterward, the Bone Armor Goblins let out a cry of anger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Bone Spears hadn't caused much damage. The Bone Armors was made using the bones from other dead goblins. \u00a0The Bone Armors boasted a high defense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, these were made from their treasured fellow goblins, so it was important to them. \u00a0They didn\u2019t want their Bone Armors to get damaged. \u00a0It was a special characteristic of the Bone Armor Goblins. \u00a0Their attack power went up as the Bone Armors deteriorated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was very well-acquainted with this fact. \u00a0In the past, he had studied all the videos released by the Stormhunters. \u00a0The memory on how to defeat the Bone Armor Goblins were still present inside his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018After you rile these bastards up, they'll go crazy if they see a sandbag.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, an enormous turtle charged towards the Bone Armor Goblins at a decent pace. \u00a0The group of 25 Bone Armor Goblins were so incensed that they had a tunnel vision. \u00a0They had set their hearts on the Turtle Golem, so they charged towards it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The result of their actions was revealed immediately.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The weapon in the Bone Armor Goblin's hand were made by sharpening the leg bones of their dead comrades. \u00a0The Bone Knives were stabbed into the Turtle's shell as if it was slicing into a rotten daikon. \u00a0In a flash, the Turtle Golem resembled a hedgehog. \u00a0However, the Bone Armor Goblins weren't satisfied with stabbing it only once. \u00a0They stuck to the Turtle's Shell, and they started swinging their Bone Knives as if they had gone mad.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At such a devastating sight, Hyrkan didn't show any signs of loss. \u00a0Instead, he yelled out with a little bit of an excitement in his voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHardening!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Turtle Golem immediately turned into stone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggoohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the process of Hardening, several Bone Knives of the Bone Armor Goblins became stuck in the Turtle Golem's body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggeeeeeeeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ones with their Bone Knife stuck let out a keening cry as they tried to dislodge it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggee-eek! \u00a0Ggeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even the ones that didn't have their Bone Knives stuck were letting out the cry, and they continued to swing their Bone Knives at the Turtle Golem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek, kwah-jeek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One could hear the Bone Knives chipping away at the stone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018They are in a frenzy.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every one of them were interested only in the sandbag that had turned into stone. \u00a0This was when Hyrkan, his Skeleton Knights and Skeleton Warriors moved in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan and his Skeleton subordinates showed them the cost of being distracted. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shweek, kwah-jeeek, poohk.....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The weapons started causing wounds, and it sounded like a symphony played by an orchestra.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The outcome had already been decided.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All the Bone Armor Goblins received a critical strike. \u00a0When they tried to change their targets, Hyrkan and his Skeleton underlings ramped up their attacks. \u00a0He had gained an advantage, so he kept pushing to increase this advantage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sound of weapons clashing with each other were heard. \u00a0However, at some point, the weapons started to impact on living beings. \u00a0It changed into sounds of flesh parting, and bones breaking. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It took him about 10 minutes to take down 25 Bone Armor Goblins.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Your level has increased.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he ended the short battle, the Level Up Announcement was heard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018My level up pace is good.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the 183rd such announcement he had heard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">With the sound of the Announcement as background, Hyrkan smiled as he looked at the corpses of the Bone Armored Goblins.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018My condition is better.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had crossed the Terube castle wall and the nameless lake. \u00a0He was immediately confronted with monsters over level 180. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whether it was a large or small monsters that appeared in the past, there had been some common characteristics amongst all of them. \u00a0However, new monsters were starting to appear with more frequency now. \u00a0The previous strategies wouldn\u2019t work with them, and new strategies would have to be developed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Hyrkan didn't need to worry about that. \u00a0Hyrkan didn't need an adjustment time period.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, at that moment, Hyrkan was feeling something he had never felt before when playing a game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This feels exhilarating!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the Immoral Prince episode had ended, Hyrkan hadn't participated in a full-scale battle. \u00a0He only took down monsters he met as he moved from location to location.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the first earnest battle he had participated in a while. \u00a0When he crossed the nameless lake, he had to use his combat powers at full effort.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was surprised at his own combat efficacy in this battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I never believed this day would come for me.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had never thought he was weak. \u00a0He was a monster if compared to the regular Users. \u00a0However, every time Hyrkan went into battle he always had to worry about the risk of a Game Over. \u00a0He always had to weigh the risk of a Game Over to any actions he took. \u00a0He unconsciously avoided tasks that was risky enough to cause his death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have no confidence as to whether I can actually die now.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, he couldn't come up with a risk that would drive him towards a Game Over.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had the Earth Golem and Fire Golem. \u00a0Then there was the 2 Skeleton Knights, and almost 40 Skeleton subordinates that could be summoned! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had the Magic Power Stat to maintain this ridiculous army, and he could just use expensive consumables to supplement any deficiencies! \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lastly, he was equipped with the Chronicle Epic Items that he would have never dreamed of owning before! \u00a0He just had to look at his own Specs!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These factors minimized the risk he felt in the front line. \u00a0The word \u2018Risk\u2019 had always been present in his mind, but now he could erase it from his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were battles without any risk of death. \u00a0Of course, he would be in a good condition in such battles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was like an addicting drug for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I can step on the accelerator, yet there is no way I'll crash. \u00a0I don't have to drive safely anymore.\u2019 \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan unhesitatingly put a magic recovery Item, which was worth 150 golds, into his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bbah-doo-doohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He ate it in one bite instead of economizing it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't need to be thrifty. \u00a0At this moment, he just wanted to continue this feeling he was having. \u00a0That was the only thing in his mind. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he finished his recovery of his magical energy, Hyrkan let out a yell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFollow me!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was the first unaccounted variable for the Hydra guild, who was still far ahead.</span></p><br/><p>6.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thirty people. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At a glance, one could tell they were equipped with expensive Items, and one could see a Smiling icon somewhere on their body, which identified them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Smiles guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were treated as the weakest in the 30 great guilds, but on the other hand, they still possessed the most guild members. \u00a0They were still heads above the normal guilds, and they were beings that were high above in the sky for the normal Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guild members affiliated to such a guild had appeared in front of the Terube castle wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thirty Big Smiles guild members were gathered in front of the high castle wall, but none of them were intimidated by the sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had seen this castle wall countless times before. \u00a0Moreover, there was the hidden rookie, Cho-oohroong, who had conducted countless battles across the castle wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Including himself, Cho-oohroong was leading a group of 30.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe've received the Exploration Quest from Captain Bagel. \u00a0We are allowed to go past the castle wall now.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo nodded his head at Cho-oohroong's words.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGet ready everyone.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Apollo\u2019s words, the 28 Users tilted their bodies to look at a certain User for a signal. \u00a0The User receiving all their gazes nodded his head lightly. \u00a0It seemed Apollo was oblivious to all of this. \u00a0He continued to speak. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs I've said before, if you lack in skills and you lag behind, we will leave you behind. \u00a0I want you guys to harden your heart. \u00a0This is the biggest prey we\u2019ve hunted up to this point. \u00a0It\u2019s the Hydra guild.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a bloody smile on Apollo\u2019s lips. \u00a0By the look of him, it seemed he would have taken down Hyrdra guild if he could do it on his own. \u00a0Everyone sneered at his attitude.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apollo\u2019s words made everyone mock him, and it wasn\u2019t a strange reaction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Our guild is in a bad state. \u00a0Some weird bastard became an officer, and now we have to listen to his commands.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What a pig. \u00a0I best he has a lot of money. \u00a0How much did he spend to buy that officer's seat?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, their mocking smiles disappeared every time they looked at a certain User.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Yes. \u00a0He can only put our trust in him.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This User\u2019s identity\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018We just have to believe in Sinclair-nim.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018We just have to set up the stage. \u00a0Then Sinclair-nim will take down the Second Head.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was Sinclair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The second unaccounted variable by the Hydra guild had shown up.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

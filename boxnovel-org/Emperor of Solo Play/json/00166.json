the System Announcement in his ears. \u00a0A new Quest was added to his Quest List. \u00a0Hyrkan immediately checked the content of the Quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Trace of Bokan] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Quest Rank : Unique </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Quest Level Range : 200 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Quest Content : The Archmage Bokan's trace has been discovered. \u00a0Currently, the evidence is being kept by NPC Diung at the current Heard Fortress Ruin town. \u00a0Please go find and investigate the trace of Bokan. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Quest Reward : Skill Book. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Bokan....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The letter from Ahimbree was very long-winded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blah blah.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were so many words that it almost made him feel annoyed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the content behind the words were very simple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Archmage Bokan was Ahimbree's teacher, and his trace was discovered in the Black Continent. \u00a0Ahimbree wanted Hyrkan to find clues regarding Archmage Bokan on his behalf.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reward was a Skill Book.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At this point in the game, obtaining a Skill Book containing a level 200 and above Skill was like a pipe dream. \u00a0It was something one couldn't acquire even if one had money. \u00a0Of course, his eyes spun from the implications. \u00a0If it hadn't been for Bokan's name, he would have committed to this Quest as if his life was depended on it. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, the name Bokan made him mull over his decision.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7what was his role again?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Archmage Bokan. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This NPC had seven disciples including Ahimbree. \u00a0When one progressed in the Main Scenario Quest, one could hear his name mentioned occasionally.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one put together all the information regarding Bokan, one could deduce that Bokan was someone, who had predicted the grave danger being faced by the world of Warlord right now. \u00a0One could also surmise that he was someone, who had actively fought against this threat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This theory was confirmed when his name appeared in the Immoral Prince storyline. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one looked at the background lore, Archmage Bokan was the one, who had named the Immoral Prince. \u00a0Bokan had hoped the prince would drive out the coming nightmares with the faithfuls, so Bokan had named him Dean.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An information of this level wasn't a secret. \u00a0It basically put a big importance on Bokan's existence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was well aware of this fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Did Bokan ever appear in the Ruined Kingdom episode?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To his knowledge, Archmage Bokan had never appeared in the Ruined Kingdom episode.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before he returned to the past, Hyrkan hadn't been able to influence how the Main Scenario Quest developed. \u00a0He only had enough potential and power to carry out an already developed Main Scenario Quest. \u00a0The trajectory of the Main Scenario Quest had been set, yet he had led the Hahoe Mask guild into attempting a fair amount of Main Scenario Quests.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was also why he had been more attentive regarding the current Main Scenario Quest than the previous two Episodes. \u00a0He had read all the Quest related guides. \u00a0It was so well researched that these text were basically like dissertation papers. \u00a0He memorized the important words, terminologies and english terms related to this episode. \u00a0He also watched the Main Scenario Quest related videos broadcasted by the 30 great guilds. \u00a0He had watched it as if was watching lectures over the internet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there had been no mention of the Archmage Bokan within Hyrkan's memories. \u00a0This character hadn't been present in the Ruined Kingdom episode.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There were several Quests given by Ahimbree, which was linked to the Ruined Kingdom episode. \u00a0Those Quests also gave Skill Books, but I don't remember a Quest that directly dealt with Bokan.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the Quest Routes had already changed. \u00a0Events that should have happened in the Ruined Kingdom episode occurred prior to the start of the episode. \u00a0The Mythos Rank Ancient Powers and Anugas had already appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Simply, the Quest timeline had been accelerated. \u00a0The Rewards that should be appearing later in the game was coming out now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was the fact that Archmage Bokan hadn't appeared even at the end of the Ruined Kingdom episode. \u00a0This meant that this content was from much further down in the story line.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It can't be. \u00a0Will the Dragons come out at this point in the game?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's expression hardened a little bit more as he stared at the Quest Window.</span></p><br/><p>6.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you very much.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou were awesome.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0Yes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt was my privilege to have met you!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0Yes. \u00a0Yes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A party exited the Voodook's Tunnel exit, and there was a restless atmosphere around them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At this point in the game, it was a given the Users would be coming out of the Voodook's Tunnel. \u00a0It was a boring and common occurrence. \u00a0This was why the Users resting nearby or the Users waiting for their party members barely paid attention to who came out of the tunnel. \u00a0They would glance sideways at the exit, but that was the extent to their interest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this party was different. \u00a0There was an excited atmosphere being permeated by the group, and their restless nature drew the eyes of the surrounding Users.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The interested Users quickly saw the reason behind the hubbub.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahoe Mask?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that the Hahoe Mask?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one made a list ranking the Users, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say the Hahoe Mask was the strongest and the best User in Warlord. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The party's atmosphere started to infect the atmosphere as the Users in the surrounding became excited.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Users, who travelled across the Voodook's Tunnel with Hyrkan, asked for a favor, he agreed to it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cExcuse me. \u00a0Do you think I can take a screenshot with you?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI would like to ask you for one too.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0Just don't put your hands on my shoulders.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm playing with you. Shall I give you a kimchi or a cheese?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease say cheese.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI hope you won't cuss me out or say I don't have any manners after uploading the picture.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI would never do that.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI heard your manners are excellent!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Hyrkan's assent, the six Users squeezed in together, and each of them took a screenshot. \u00a0In the process, Hyrkan rewarded them by making the peace sign.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several Users thought it was ridiculous, but the others looked on with jealousy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had to cross the Urugal great mountain range as soon as possible, so he chose to become a third wheel. \u00a0He inserted himself into a party that was getting ready to go into the Voodook's Tunnel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It hadn't been hard. \u00a0It would have been impossible if he had been some other User.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, wasn't he THE Hahoe Mask?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The EXP the party would get would be the same, and they would gain a memory they would be able to look back on. \u00a0Moreover, they were getting the sweet side of the deal, so no party would turn down an opportunity to add the Hahoe Mask to their party.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After his follow-up service, Hyrkan immediately headed towards the top of the Urugal mountain range.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were a good number of Users on the road he was on, and when they discovered Hyrkan, an unsettled atmosphere developed. \u00a0There looked to be enemies amongst the Users, but no one acted against him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan was satisfied with the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is no downside in being popular.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were people, who hated being famous. \u00a0He wasn\u2019t like that. \u00a0Hyrkan was the opposite. \u00a0If he hated being popular, he wouldn't be playing this game for a living.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan liked being famous. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He also enjoyed the benefit of being a popular public figure.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan had a refreshing smile on his face as he crossed the Urugal mountain range.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He once again came face to face with the Black Continent. \u00a0When he saw the endless stretch of land, his smile was erased from his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Hyrkan traveled to the Class Tower to earn his Skills, the situation on the Black Continent continued to move in a fluid manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was especially true after the Heard Fortress town was formed. \u00a0The Users were less cautious in their actions. \u00a0The results created by Users, who were willing to put themselves at risk, was terrifying. \u00a0It would give game developers nightmares.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At times, these kinds of Users were able to create unimaginable progress.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was like that right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">With the Urugal mountain as the starting point, the Users were expanding to the east, north and south.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The traces of the Ruined Kingdom was found, and the Users were combing through the Ruins. \u00a0The secret behind the fall of the Ruined Kingdom was revealed, and the Users dreamed about becoming strong by finding the power left behind the Ruined Kingdom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Stormhunters are going east.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Amongst all of them, the ones with the most eye popping results was the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">East Rush! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Stormhunters guild had gathered all their resources, and they were on an endless rush to the east.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had characterized it as a rush, but in reality, the more apt description was a runaway train.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I was right. \u00a0Che-sulyun is a crazy bitch.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even amongst the Stormhunters guild, there was a hint of madness in Che-sulyun's exploits. \u00a0Che-sulyun had perfected the use of the power of fire. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Would she be able to continue using the nickname Storm Queen? \u00a0It made people ponder over the subject.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the Stormhunters guild were the most reckless with their lives amongst the Users in the Black Continent. \u00a0Every live broadcast had two to three Users dying. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They died, but at the same time, they achieved results that were well worth their lost lives. \u00a0After finding the Balos ruins inside the Olbrid Forest, the Stormhunters guild had already found 2 additional Ruins. \u00a0They were the first ones to find three Ruins. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When one found a normal Ruin for the first time, one could gain around three to five Transcendent Ancient Power. \u00a0At the very least, one Mythos Rank power should have appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Mythos rank Ancient Power was suddenly unleashed, because of Hyrkan. \u00a0However, even the Legendary Rank Ancient Power was incredibly useful. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, if they were able to be the first ones to find the Ruins, they would be able rapidly increase the power of the entire guild. \u00a0This was the most surefire way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Five Star bastards are going north and south.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Five Stars weren't also playing around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their reputation had bottomed out when they got punched by the Hahoe Mask and the Stormhunters guild. \u00a0However, they had the ability to recover from such damage. \u00a0In the end, the fact that they were the biggest force within the Black Continent hadn\u2019t changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Five star were using their forces to expand their territories to the north and south. \u00a0Their moves were validated when they eventually found four ruins.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Poker teams are extraordinary.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, their activities centered around the Poker teams. \u00a0The Poker teams were exposed as being very powerful when they faced down powerful monsters without much problem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018No matter where I go I'll be treated like an uninvited guest.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From now on, Hyrkan had to commit himself to a direction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he learned the evidence about Archmage Bokan at the Heard Fortress ruin, he'll probably be sent to one of three directions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018All right.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For a moment, Hyrkan's expression relaxed a little bit. \u00a0He relaxed it by force. \u00a0The ones that would weep would be the ones that would have to face him. \u00a0He tried to make his thoughts into reality.</span></p><br/><p>7.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Users saw the Hahoe Mask, they had two types of reaction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? \u00a0It's the Hahoe Mask!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The first reaction was surprise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it really the Hahoe Mask?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The other reaction was suspicion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this was the Heard Fortress. \u00a0The Users, who reached the neutral zone inside the Black Continent, felt surprise more so than suspicion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These Users had finished their 2nd Advancement. \u00a0There was no reason why they would feel the need to pull pranks by wearing a Hahoe Mask in the Black Continent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reasoning behind their reactions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow. \u00a0The mood is quite serious.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre they going to fight\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat reason do they have to fight?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStill, you never know. \u00a0It isn't as if the Hahoe Mask has officially allied himself with the 30 great guilds.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Hyrkan appeared at the Heard Fortress Ruin town, the Users assumed he was the real deal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why they were looking forward to the meeting in front of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I never expected the Hydra guild to be here.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hydra guild members had surprised the Users by arriving at the Heard Fortress Ruin town. \u00a0They had arrived a little bit earlier than the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Users in the surrounding wanted to see what kind of chemical reaction would occur when the two sides met!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Hyrkan didn't really want to meet the Hydra guild. \u00a0He had maintained a neutral relationship with the Hydra guild after the Immoral Prince episode, but it wasn't as if they had a cordial relationship. \u00a0Moreover, Hyrkan considered the relationship to be closer to being bad after what happened at the Frozen land.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, the Hydra guild had sought Hyrkan out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is our first meeting since we met at the Frozen land.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was Sohank and Natal. \u00a0The two of them had taken off their helmets, and they had approached the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0There was only one additional User alongside these two. \u00a0The rest of the Hydra guild members were out of sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a silent gesture, which indicated that they didn't want to fight with the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you want with me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan didn't show any signs of being happy at their appearance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Huh?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His eyes narrowed behind the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0It was the familiar faces of Natal and Sohank. Moreover, the User between them also looked familiar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan eventually figured it out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKiyote?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow. \u00a0You remembered me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kiyote reacted as if he had been waiting to hear those words. \u00a0Kiyote stepped forward. \u00a0He left behind Natal and Sohank to stand in front of Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0I'm Kiyote.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are affiliated with the Hydra guild now?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0That isn't important. \u00a0Do you remember that I still possess the right to challenge you once more?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of answering him, Hyrkan smirked. \u00a0Of course, he remembered it. \u00a0At the time, he had received the really expensive Orc Hero's Sword from him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That sword had been a great deal of help to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo you want to use your challenge rights right now?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. \u00a0There is an opponent I have to beat before I can fight you. \u00a0Ah. \u00a0I wanted to say I'm making great use of the tactic I learned from you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he spoke, Kiyote moved his arms. \u00a0He made a gesture as if he was throwing something grasped in his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sand Toss.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Recently, he hadn\u2019t felt the need to use such tactics. \u00a0In the past, it was a tactic he used to great effect in PKs and PVPs. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one fell for such a trick, it usually became a stuff of nightmare. \u00a0It was rare for someone to bite that very same move for one's own use.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan thought Kiyote was refreshing in many ways.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sohank had a merry smile as he looked at Kiyote. \u00a0Kiyote was acting as he liked. \u00a0His courage and single mindedness was something that couldn't be learned over time by working on it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, Natal's face was distorted by anger. The Hahoe Mask had to be treated with special care. \u00a0One had to be very careful when speaking to him, yet Kiyote talked about challenging him? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What nonsense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be the end of them if the Hahoe Mask used the challenge as a pretext to declare a war on their guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Natal pulled at Kiyote's shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMr. Kiyote. \u00a0I want you to keep to the promise you made.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kiyote finally backed off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm sorry. \u00a0I really never expected the Hahoe Mask to remember my name.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Originally, Kiyote hadn\u2019t been scheduled to come with them. \u00a0It had been decided that only Natal and Sohank would go to speak with the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0However, Kiyote had decided to butt in. \u00a0Kiyote said that he had met the Hahoe Mask before, and he had an abnormal relationship with the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kiyote had said that he suffered a loss to the Hahoe Mask, and he would be able to challenge the Hahoe Mask once.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Natal had made Kiyote make a promise with him. \u00a0If the Hahoe Mask didn\u2019t recognize him, he had to shut his mouth. \u00a0Even if he was recognized, he was instructed to speak briefly. \u00a0Natal had told him to keep the conversation to a short greeting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kiyote retreated, and Natal stood in front of the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan spoke to Natal first.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI know we didn't have any direct confrontations on Frozen land. \u00a0Still, if you harbor ill will towards me, shall we resolve our grievances right now?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet us make a gentleman's agreement.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Natal spoke immediately after Hyrkan's words ended.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have no plans on allying myself with you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe feel the same way. \u00a0However, there is no reason why we should maul each other. \u00a0That will only make our competitors happy.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of answering, Hyrkan looked at Sohank. \u00a0Sohank didn't look away from Hyrkan's gaze.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Come at me if you dare! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It is as the rumor said. \u00a0He must have earned the Ancient Power of Darkness.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sohank's confidence was not rooted in his Items or Level. \u00a0He was also much inferior in terms of skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This meant he possessed some other power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The game is really pouring out all the Mythos Rank Ancient Power. \u00a0Originally, it was a power given, so one could fight against the Dragon's army. \u00a0However, every tom, dick and harry has it now...\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan made invidious remarks inside, and he quickly weighed the possibilities.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A gentleman's agreement was something he had wanted. \u00a0Hyrkan also didn't want to make enemy of a User with a Mythos Rank Ancient Power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he couldn't show any weakness here. \u00a0If he did, he would be entering into a losing proposition.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0We don't have to get into unnecessary dog fights. \u00a0So which way are you going? \u00a0Are you going north, east or south?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Natal steadily looked at Hyrkan when Natal heard his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If our paths coincide, is he saying he'll ignore the gentleman's agreement? \u00a0Is that what he is trying to say?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Natal considered Hyrkan's words to be a warning. \u00a0It was a warning that said the Hyrdra guild would have to pay the cost if they really wanted this deal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one considered the Hydra guild's reputation, those terms were a nonstarter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhich way are you going?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll know after I get my Quest. \u00a0If you don't want to tell me, you don't have to.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chul-kuhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He said it was fine with his words, but Hyrkan touched the sword sheathe on his waist. \u00a0Of course, it was a threat. \u00a0The threat implied that they'll hear the sound of his sword if they refused to give him an answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Normally, such tactics were Useless against the Hydra guild, but it was an entirely different story with the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit. \u00a0He is domineering. \u00a0If I could do such feats by myself... \u00a0I would also act like that.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Natal became troubled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe is in a difficult spot. \u00a0He cannot tell you our secrets.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sohank, who hadn't spoke until now, \u00a0resolved Natal\u2019s dilemma.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease be understanding. \u00a0You should consider what the Hydra guild specializes in. \u00a0We have no choice.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you don't want to tell me, then you don't have to. \u00a0Someone might think I had threatened you judging by your words.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Sohank stepped forward, the Hahoe Mask shrugged his shoulders, and he turned his back towards them. \u00a0There was no reason to continue this conversation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Hahoe Mask left, Natal spoke to Sohank.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThanks to you I was able to gain some breathing room.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is my role. \u00a0Anyways, we were able to confirm something. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask has no allies in the Black Continent.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Natal nodded his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two reasons why they had sought out the Hahoe Mask. The first reason was straightforward. \u00a0They wanted a gentleman's agreement where they'll be able to avoid unnecessary fights. \u00a0The other reason was to assess Hahoe Mask's current condition.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a hidden benefactor behind the Hahoe Mask. \u00a0If the Hahoe Mask's benefactor had the means to actively help the Hahoe Mask through troops, the Hahoe Mask wouldn't have backed off right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, in the recent days, he had been helped by the Stormhunters guild when facing the Five Stars. \u00a0If one looked at his recent activities, it seemed he wanted to solve his own problems instead of waiting for some other power to come in and help him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the brief conversation today didn't make them 100 percent confident in their theory. \u00a0However, one needed a suspicion before one could come up with a hypothesis. \u00a0Afterwards, evidence had to be gathered to prove the hypothesis. \u00a0Then one would be able to prove that the suspicion was right.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After hearing the conversation between the two, Kiyote spoke up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat will happen if I challenge and win against the Hahoe Mask? \u00a0What would be my rank? Will I be able to become the 10th Head?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sohank and Natal had been having a serious conversation, but the cat got their tongue when they heard Kiyote's words.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

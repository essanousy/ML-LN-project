However, he reached a point where he was receiving Quests that was great help to his Level Up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, he was able to gain numerous Titles. This was the reward for digging a deep well. \u00a0He had received a good amount of rewards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I was somehow able to earn the Title 'Baheim Tribe's Tree'. \u00a0When I earned the Title, the other Elven tribes also asked for my help. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling had obtained one of the ultimate Titles that increases All Stats by 3%.. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he received the Baheim Tribe's Tree Title, Whistling started being treated like a very competent problem solver. \u00a0He provided solutions to the Elven Tribe's problems. This resulted in other Elven Tribes asking Whistling for help. \u00a0This was the fantasy adventure he had pined for, so he didn't turn down any requests sent his way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- That is when I received a request from the Tehkee Tribe. I earned the Curse of the Black Tree Quest. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, the Tehkee Tribe had come to Whistling, they wanted him to take care of the Black Tree's Curse. \u00a0However, he was unable to carry it out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Quest itself wasn't some insanely hard puzzle. \u00a0It didn't require endless grind either.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I've already found out what the Black Tree's Curse is, and I've also found out the location of the Black Tree. \u00a0It hadn't been too hard to find it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, the Quest had come to a full stop at carrying out the last part of the Quest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- The problem is I can't catch the Black Tree by myself. \u00a0I tried it just in case, but I couldn't come up with an answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he wanted to \u00a0put a period to the Quest, he needed help. \u00a0Moreover, he needed someone who could carry out a Boss Monster Raid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- Currently, I'm at Puree Forest where the Tehkee Tribe is located at.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he heard those words, Hyrkan was able to accurately assess the situation in his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Puree Forest is in the Big Smile guild's territory. \u00a0So that's why you contacted me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Puree Forest was a level 130 hunting ground, and it had been discovered first by the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0Moreover, the Big Smiles guild built a village at the entrance of the Puree Forest. \u00a0Naturally, everyone came to accept that the Puree Forest was under the territory of the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it was Big Smiles\u2019 territory, but it wasn't as if they acted like tyrants. \u00a0The Puree Forest wasn't worth that much to act that way there. Whistling had been soloing inside the Puree Forest, but no one from the Big Smiles bothered him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soloing was ok, but it would be a problem if a different guild operated within the forest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In addition, the only place Whistling could ask for immediate help was the Fighters guild. \u00a0However, they were an Underfoot guild, and they were rumored to be gunning for Big Smile's position in the 30 great guilds. Big Smiles wouldn't welcome it if the Fighters Guild appeared in their territory. \u00a0On the other hand, the Fighters guild had no reason why they should take that the risk to help Whistling. \u00a0Whistling was a regular guild member only in name. \u00a0Moreover, his fame had diminished recently, so they didn't show much interest or love towards Whistling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- My personal connections doesn't reach that far, so you are the only one I could request for help.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason why Whistling had contacted Hyrkan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It couldn't have been easy for him.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After hearing the whole story, Hyrkan started thinking hard on it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two reasons that put him in a bad mood. \u00a0The first reason was the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I don't know what those bastards are thinking.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He definitely had to resolve his unknown issue with the Big Smiles. He wasn't too happy about boldly going into their territory by himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Moreover, Black Tree isn't easy to catch.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The second reason was the difficulty level of the Black Tree. \u00a0Black Tree was a really valuable monster. It was very difficult to catch it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The Black Sap is too troublesome.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Black Tree looked like a normal tree on the outside. \u00a0It wasn't black at all in its appearance. \u00a0However, it was named the Black Tree, because it let out a Black Sap when it was injured.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When one touched the Black Sap, it ate away at one's HP. \u00a0However, the Black Sap was neither a poison nor a magic. \u00a0He would have preferred it if it had been a poison. \u00a0In that case, he could have used an antidote magic or he could have easily taken care of the situation by wearing an Item Setting that was highly resistant against poison. \u00a0However, the Black Sap ignored any physical barrier and magic as it gave damage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't as if the damage was weak. \u00a0One had to have Stamina akin to a Tanker or one's HP would drop in an instant like a bad stock.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of all of that, the Black Tree's Bark boasted a very high defense against physical and magical attacks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The raid method was to attack the knotholes. \u00a0The knothole had a very low defense, so one had to focus on taking off the Bark covering the knothole. \u00a0Then all of one's attack had to be directed towards that single location.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was obvious, but the Black Sap appeared the moment one stabbed the knothole. \u00a0One had to widen the hole while the sap was expelled. \u00a0It was a very tricky job. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If a Tanker wasn't familiar with Armor Breaking than a Striker had to take a big risk in attempting the Armor Break. \u00a0It was a very troublesome job.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Warlord was a game, and there were multiple ways to Raid a Boss monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I had the Circlet of Purification, this won't even be considered work.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Circlet of Purification! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Item was the master key to the Black Tree raid. \u00a0The Circlet of Purification had the Option of 'Immunity from all Negative Effect'. \u00a0The Black Sap would be acknowledged as something that would cause a negative effect.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the Circlet of Purification wasn't easily obtainable. \u00a0It was almost impossible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit. I went through so much hardship that time. \u00a0Shouldn\u2019t it have at least given the Item to me as a courtesy?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Hyrkan had finished the Corrupted Elf Quest, it was required of him to return the Circlet of Purification. He had held out hope for the Item, but the Chieftain of the Baheim Tribe didn't give the Circlet of Purification nor a useful Skill Book to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On a side note, the Ingredient Coins and Gems from the Black Tree could be used to make Rare Rank Items. \u00a0When one wore the 5 parts Black Tree set, the Option of 'Black Sap' was activated. When the defensive gear was damaged, the armor would let out the Black Sap. \u00a0It would eat away at the opponent's HP if the Black Sap makes direct contact. . </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't as good as the Greestone Imoogi set, but it was still a great Option.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of that, the Black Tree was a large monster. \u00a0A lot of Ingredient coins was given when the Black Tree was caught, and there was a large probability of receiving the Ingredient gems.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A single Black Tree allowed one to be able to form 3 to 4 parts to the whole set. \u00a0If one hits the jackpot, one would be able to create more than that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet me ask you one thing\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- You can ask as many as you like. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat if I do catch the monster called the Black Tree? \u00a0What's my cut?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- If you can catch it, you can have everything. I won't be able to catch it anyways without your help, Hahoe Mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018His words is making this decision much harder.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The risk was large, but the return was large too. \u00a0Of course, he was conflicted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if Whistling had read Hyrkan's heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- If you want it, I can give you this Quest's reward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling landed a solid blow on Hyrkan's shaking heart. \u00a0Hyrkan fired back with a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat's the reward?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- It says it'll give me a pouch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPouch? What kind of pouch?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- I have no idea. \u00a0However, Chieftain Drah did say that it will help me dispel the Black Tree's Curse. \u00a0If you can dispel the Black Tree's Curse, you can have this pouch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan's brain brain started to spin quickly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDrah? Do you mean the Chieftain of the Baheim tribe?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- That's correct. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you perhaps know what the pouch looks like?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- It is a very plain pouch. There isn't anything special characteristics I can describe to you.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat's in it?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- There's some unknown silver liquid in there. \u00a0I don't know how to use it, so I'm just keeping it in there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Hyrkan's brain spun quickly, he gave a very quick answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou stay right there! I'll immediately ride my Golem over there, and I'll blast the Black Tree's head away!\u201d</span></p><br/><p>6.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A small village had been built at the entrance of the Puree Forest. There weren't even buildings built within the wooden barricade. \u00a0Users were the only ones within the enclosement. \u00a0It was so shabby that it was hard to call it a village.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Amongst the run down place, the Big Smiles' guild members were present.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were basically guards dispatched to look out for potential trouble. \u00a0They were the lookouts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since they were actual Users being chosen to be a look out in a game, they felt crappy. \u00a0They were basically wasting their time here. \u00a0Time was EXP and EXP was Level. \u00a0There was nothing that felt worse in Warlord than wasting one's time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid you see the newest video? \u00a0It's the Red Bulls Raid video.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI saw it. It was awesome.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is up with our guild in comparison to that guild? I should have gone for Red Bulls instead of Big Smiles.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, these were the words that came out of the dissatisfied</span><span style=\"\">guard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey. \u00a0Watch your mouth.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho cares? No one here will tattle on us, and it isn't as if I'm saying anything wrong.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStill, you should be careful.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou worry too much. \u00a0Anyways, do you really think the Hahoe Mask is Red Bulls' hidden ace?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even a king's pumpkin seed was peeled when no one was looking. \u00a0However, at his comrade's warning, he discreetly changed the subject. His partner immediately took up the thread of the conversation. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf it's true, it's big news. \u00a0If the Hahoe Mask was added to the Red Bulls' 1st Raid team, they'll be able to take down all the monsters that's been discovered. \u00a0That's the truth.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Hahoe Mask is really awesome. \u00a0He's doing everything by himself. He doesn't even need to enter into a guild.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's possible for him to do that, because he has money. \u00a0I heard a rumor that said his family is incredibly rich. \u00a0He is hiding his face, because he is the son of a mega millionaire. \u00a0People will probably recognize his appearance.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs expected, money is everything. If I was the son of a wealthy person, I would put pressure on the Big Smiles with money to gain an officer\u2019s seat in the guild. \u00a0Then I would be able to do whatever I want to do inside the game.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm jealous. \u00a0The Hahoe Mask could buy anything he wants to eat, and he purchases whatever he wants inside the game.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It happened at that moment...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cExcuse me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The User spoke to notify the two of his presence. The two guards, who had been carrying on their conversation, tensed up a little bit. \u00a0They looked at the approaching User in a guarded manner. \u00a0It wouldn't be good for them if someone heard the content of their conversation. \u00a0It was a justified response.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, their wariness was squashed when they saw the other User's face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What the hell? He looks like a pushover.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He has a really soft face.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The User that appeared possessed a face that was very relaxed and soft.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is it?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Big Smiles' guild members immediately relaxed, and they spoke as if they were talking to someone inferior to them. \u00a0There was no indication of suspicion in their manners.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm planning on hunting inside the Puree Forest. \u00a0Do I have to make a reservation or wait for my turn?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was nothing suspicious to his questions. Even a large hunting ground had prime spots, and these prime spots were popular.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe normal hunting region has a designated hunting time. \u00a0It isn't crowded enough where you would have to wait in line.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guard gave an immediate answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre the Big Smiles guild perhaps getting ready for a large scale hunt?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This question was a bit more sensitive in nature.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy do you want to know that?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, the Big Smiles guild weren't occupying the Puree Forest for the profit it generated. This place was kept for leveling up. The guild members of the Big Smiles would come here for a smooth hunt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course, I'm trying to avoid getting in the way of the Big Smiles guild's business.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From a normal User's perspective, it would be best if one's activities didn't intersect with the Big Smiles guild. \u00a0This was why one had to plan with the traffic in mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, guild members of the Big Smiles wasn't obligated to tell everyone of their schedule.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are having a group hunt in 3 hours. \u00a0You should plan accordingly to get out of our way.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the User didn't have such a disarming face, the guard would have never answered that question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn three hours\u2026\u2026 Thank you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The User gave his farewell, and he disappeared. \u00a0The two guards continued their conversation immediately.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy'd you tell him about what we are going to do?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoes it matter in the end? \u00a0At a glance, he looks like someone afraid of unwittingly offending our guild. \u00a0We have to help the less fortunate.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe looked and acted like a pushover. I'll be really frustrated if a party member like him is in my group.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe looks like a burden.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They laughed as they spoke. \u00a0It didn't take long for them to forget about the User.</span></p><br/><p>7.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's been awhile.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling Pitbull greeted Hyrkan, who appeared with his Hahoe Mask on. \u00a0However, Hyrkan didn't return the greeting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's cut the long chatter. \u00a0We are moving immediately. \u00a0The members of the Big Smiles are doing a large scale hunt in three hours.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan wanted an all-out attack at once. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling asked in surprise at Hyrkan's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThree hours? How did you find out about it?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI asked the question to the Big Smiles' guild members residing in the village. \u00a0They told me pretty readily.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat's fascinating. \u00a0I tried to ask them a question, but they became guarded at just my greeting. \u00a0They looked as if they were going to fight me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling tilted his head in puzzlement, since he didn't know why they had responded that way to him. \u00a0Hyrkan didn't know whether he should laugh or cry. Hyrkan knew better than anyone else why the members of the Big Smiles guild had told them about their planned activities.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he decided to bury that particular topic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat's enough talking. \u00a0Three hours isn't a lot of time. \u00a0Is the Black Tree located far from here?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWith our speed, it should take us a little bit over an hour.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If possible, Hyrkan wanted to wrap up the hunt in 3 hours then leave the Puree Forest. \u00a0Nothing positive would come from meeting the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt'll be very close.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling's eyes narrowed when he heard Hyrkan mumbling to himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you have some enmity with the Big Smiles guild?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan showed a slightly surprised reaction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. Not really.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he immediately changed his expression as he spoke his denial.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat made you think that?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling shook his head slightly at Hyrkan's response.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's nothing. \u00a0It seems I spoke something unnecessary. \u00a0Anyways, is the Item within this pouch really that amazing?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whistling wanted to change the mood, so he took out the pouch he received from Chieftain Drah. \u00a0As intended, Hyrkan's expression changed immediately when Whistling pulled out the pouch. \u00a0When Whistling handed him the pouch, Hyrkan's expression turned covetous for a brief moment to an absurd degree. \u00a0Fortunately, the Hahoe Mask hid his expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, his covetous expression turned into anger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'm not part of the Baheim tribe, but I toiled to bring peace to this continent. \u00a0However, they didn't give the reward to me. \u00a0Instead, they gave the Circlet of Purification to someone, who just carried out some Quests for the Tribe? That damn Baheim Tribe.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His stomach ached from just thinking about it. \u00a0He had worked as much as anyone else, yet someone else got the golden prize for reward. \u00a0He was just given more work to do. \u00a0Of course, it wouldn't feel great for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Hykran confirmed it once again with Whistling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou said all the Coins and Quest reward from the Black Tree hunt is all mine? \u00a0Are you sure?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At those words, Whistling vigorously nodded his head. \u00a0Whistling treated this as a given, and this made Hyrkan frown. \u00a0He asked another question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is a bit awkward for me to say this, but are you sure this is fine? \u00a0You won't get anything.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was he worried about someone else? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These kinds of words was the hardest for Hyrkan to push past his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Whistling spoke in a very composed manner at Hyrkan's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The Black Tree's Curse Quest has a time limit. \u00a0If I don't catch the Black Tree within the time limit, the Tehkee tribe will be wiped out from this world. \u00a0I want to stop that from happening. \u00a0I don't care about the reward.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyrkan didn't say anything when he heard those words. \u00a0He didn't laugh bitterly or awkwardly. \u00a0He didn't even furrow his eyebrows. \u00a0He tried hard to suppress any expression from forming on his face. \u00a0If he didn't, Hyrkan would somehow feel as if he himself was very lame.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

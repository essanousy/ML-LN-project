The Power of the Hero (2)</p><br/><p>I immediately came back to Earth. I knew where Yua was. I rushed to her in my armor.</p><br/><p>\u201cSharana!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes, Master!]</p><br/><p>After infusing Sharana into my body, I even used Talaria. Then, I used Divine Speed and was able to reach Walker in just 1 minute 13 seconds.</p><br/><p>In an area strangely silent and deserted, insect type monsters were flying toward Walker. It was undoubtedly Luca Bruno\u2019s doing. In Walker\u2019s arms, I could see Yua struggling to free herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me go! Let me go now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, calm down, Kang Yua! Your oppa is here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Oppa! Oppa, say something to him! I have to go meet someone now!\u201d</p><br/><p>First, I used Peika\u2019s ability to scorch the surrounding monsters, then calmly received Yua from Walker. I could see something condensed in her eyes. Her cheeks were flushed red and her eyes were out of focus. It was the typical charmed status.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me go, Oppa! I would be troubled if I can\u2019t meet him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYua, calm down first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hate Oppa! You don\u2019t even know how I feel! \u2026Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yua\u2019s expression distorted as if she was agonizing over something.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2026 Oppa\u2026 but that person\u2026 uuu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She was in conflict because of me even while she was charmed? Touched, I wanted to hug her and rub my cheek against hers but now wasn\u2019t the time. I took a deep breath and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYua, snap out of it!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You used Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry! All party members are cleansed of negative status effects. All party members\u2019 attack power increases by 50 percent for the duration. All party members become super-armored, unfazed by enemy attacks.]</p><br/><p>In an instant, Yua\u2019s eyes became focused again.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked extremely confused. She touched her cheeks, knocked on her head a few times, then realizing that she was in my embrace, she blushed.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, what\u2019s going on\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, Yua. I dragged you into my problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No, I\u2019m fine. Did I trouble Oppa? I-It\u2019s bad if I did\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t, so don\u2019t worry. Are you okay, now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yes. It was really strange. I suddenly really liked someone I saw for the first time to the point I couldn\u2019t control myself\u2026 It was too strange. Then, Walker ajusshi grabbed me and\u2026 If it wasn\u2019t for him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I put Yua down and dusted her off a couple times. Then, I bowed to Walker.</p><br/><p>\u201cWalker, thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just did what you told me to do. I\u2019m just doing my job.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, it\u2019s thanks to you that Yua is safe. Thank you, really. I won\u2019t forget this debt even if I die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hmph, as long as you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but can you continue protecting Yua right now? I have something to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Interesting. Of course, I\u2019ll protect your sister wholeheartedly. Go wild.\u201d</p><br/><p>I patted Yua\u2019s head one more time, then opened my visor to reveal my eyes. Then, I stared at the insects that were still flying toward me. After meeting my eyes, the insects all turned to stone and fell to the ground. Countless thuds rang out as if there was a hail.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no human\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Oppa\u2019s\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The insects turned to stone the moment they got in my range. Unless there was a healer who possessed mana that surpassed mine, it would be impossible to cancel my ability. Hundreds, then thousands of rock sculptures piled up around us. Then, I lightly waved my hand, creating a tornado with Mad Typhoon. With Sharana\u2019s power amplifying the tornado, I shredded the sculptures into tiny pieces.</p><br/><p>In just a moment, all the monsters disappeared. I made a light sigh and pulled my visor back down. I then turned around to Yua and Walker and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, can I go with you? I want to see Oppa teaching him a lesson! I can\u2019t forgive myself for being unable to choose between Oppa and that person!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed Yua wanted a closure for herself as well. I looked at Walker. He shrugged and remarked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was also vexed because I could only run away. I want to see how he\u2019ll react when he sees you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then let\u2019s go together. Peika, materialize!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ve been waiting!]</p><br/><p>Peika materialized in mid-air as a dragon. When I put Yua and Walker on her back, Yua cheered.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow beautiful\u2026 Oppa is amazing! Do all dungeon explorers have something like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry to break your fantasy, but it\u2019s your Oppa that\u2019s special.\u201d</p><br/><p>I put a Mana Potion in my mouth and ordered Peika to fly. Peika soared into the air, and civilians who saw her from the streets screamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, your sister\u2019s face isn\u2019t hidden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. They already found out anyways. We\u2019ll be more open from now on. I don\u2019t plan on hiding anymore. There\u2019s no reason to either.\u201d</p><br/><p>I doubt Luca Bruno came all the way to Korea, saw Yua for the first time, and charmed her because he was mesmerized by her. He undoubtedly approached her knowing that she was my sister. In that case, there was no longer a need to hide my identity. There was only one thing I needed to do.</p><br/><p>That was to show what would happen if they bothered me.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, full speed. Follow Luca Bruno\u2019s mana.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Got it!]</p><br/><p>Peika shot forward like lightning. He wasn\u2019t far from here. He had even used some ability to prevent people from approaching her. He must have thought that Walker was stronger than him in a direct fight and planned on chasing him away before he acquired Yua.</p><br/><p>Acquire Yua and\u2026 acquire\u2026 Ha\u2026 Hahaha\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cFound you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Peika shot down like an arrow. The people around us screamed and scattered. Meanwhile, I grabbed a man who was running away like the others by the nape of his neck. He looked at me with a flustered expression. As expected, he had disguised himself rather thoroughly. However, he couldn\u2019t hide his mana.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Luca Bruno.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you two doing!? I\u2019m not such a per\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>I threw him on the ground face down. Immediately, tiny monsters that were stuck on his body flooded toward me to counterattack then became petrified and fell. I grabbed his face and jumped down Peika\u2019s back. People gathered around us, murmuring.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA dragon? Is that a dragon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, isn\u2019t that Dragon Knight?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe dragon he\u2019s riding changed! It must be an Asian version!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just an American touring Kore\u2026 Kuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Grabbing his face, on one hand, I poured mana in my foot and kicked him in the face. The mana barrier he had instantly shattered and a few of his teeth flew into the air. The bystanders screamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDragon Knight is beating up an innocent man!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCall the police!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCall them for what?\u201d</p><br/><p>A second, third, fourth\u2026 I wasn\u2019t satisfied with just his face. I threw him down on the ground, raised my foot and slammed it down on his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cKahak!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cLuca Bruno, this will be my only question, so answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho told you about my sister?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this\u2026 to me\u2026 Kak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Was he still trying to hide his identity? I smirked and brought my spear out. Then, I cut off both of his arms. Yua screamed, but I had no plans to go easy because she was watching. I scorched his severed arms using Peika\u2019s power and swung my spear again to fling the blood off. Next, I placed my spear on his back and said firmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext is your heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cB-Brightman! It was Brightman! Not just you, but he has the information on everyone in Revival! An organization he is forming without Guardian knowing is\u2026 Kuhuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>I smacked his back with my spear shaft. Then, I asked again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sure it wasn\u2019t Guardian\u2019s doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOrganization name, members, tell me everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-Now? C-Can you heal me first\u2026? M-My arms\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>I raised my spear. Just when I was about to strike down with it, Luca Bruno shouted desperately.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say it! I\u2019ll say it now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWalker, sorry, but can you take out a note?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker gnawed on his lips and took out a notepad. While he took down each and every word Luca Bruno was spewing out, he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cXin who\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXin Shaomei!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was China\u2019s SS ranker. It seemed I\u2019d need to see her face too. The question was whether she would still have her face afterward.</p><br/><p>After Luca Bruno finished saying everything, I took my spear back. When I looked around, I saw several police cars around us. An officer who seemed to have a high rank shouted on a megaphone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re the police!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo back.\u201d</p><br/><p>I put mana into my words. The police blocking the road were pushed back by the mana\u2019s pressure. It was the same for the people around us. Although there might have been a better way to go about it, I didn\u2019t want to be bothered by anyone right now.</p><br/><p>At the same time, I opened the guild communication channel.</p><br/><p>[All members of Revival on Earth, confirm your family\u2019s safety. If something seems off, notify me immediately. I will take care of it within 5 minutes.]</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t worry, Shin. I have Guardian members and familiars protecting everyone\u2019s families. It\u2019s mainly you and I that\u2019s being targeted.]</p><br/><p>Hwaya immediately responded. I didn\u2019t think other members\u2019 information would have had their information exposed as well. Brightman, just how much money did you use!? I gritted my teeth.</p><br/><p>In any case, I felt grateful to Hwaya for taking care of something I had forgotten about.</p><br/><p>[Hwaya, thanks. I only thought about my own family\u2026 Damn, I didn\u2019t think other members would be targeted at all. It would have been obvious if I thought about it for a moment!]</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s my job to take care of things you don\u2019t have the time to do\u2026 So? That got me many points, right? Did you fall for me yet?]</p><br/><p>[Yeah, I did\u2026 Is your mother okay?]</p><br/><p>[\u2026 U-Un, she\u2019s fine. Walker messaged everyone as he took Yua. I took care of it before it was too late.]</p><br/><p>In the middle of talking to Hwaya, I raised my spear and struck down on the ground once. Ability users that popped out amidst the police force and Luca Bruno who was trying to join them all froze.</p><br/><p>[Everyone, stay with your family. I\u2019m going to go take care of an organization called \u2018Heroes of Shadow.\u2019 I\u2019ll take you when everything\u2019s over.]</p><br/><p>[Shin, I want to go too.]</p><br/><p>[M-Me too!]</p><br/><p>[No, it\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t have to come with me.]</p><br/><p>Sorry, but having you there won\u2019t help me. For now, you guys should focus on increasing your ability through the dungeon.</p><br/><p>I swung my spear and shot out a whirlpool, shredding the ability users limbs and Luca Bruno\u2019s leg.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anyone else you brought with you, tell them to come out now. I\u2019ll take care of all of you together.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Want help?]</p><br/><p>A sluggish voice rang out. It wasn\u2019t from the guild communication channel but from the private messaging system.</p><br/><p>[Daisy?]</p><br/><p>[Insect extermination must be done\u2026 cleanly, leave none behind. Thoroughly. My ability, very useful.]</p><br/><p>Daisy\u2019s unexpected offer made me reconsider.</p><br/><p>[But Daisy, I don\u2019t want to use your power for something like this. Plus, this is Earth\u2019s\u2014]</p><br/><p>[I want to, help. You\u2019re benefactor, friend. Grateful person.]</p><br/><p>To be honest, I was thankful for her offer. Like she said, insect extermination had to be done thoroughly. Otherwise, they might reproduce again. I didn\u2019t want to involve her something like this since she had trouble with people, but she sent me another message, [I want to help.] as if to urge me again.</p><br/><p>[In that case, I\u2019d be happy to have you. Thanks, I\u2019ll come get you in a bit.]</p><br/><p>[Un. I\u2019ll get ready.]</p><br/><p>After I finished talking to Daisy, I approached Luca Bruno. He gasped and crawled backward.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I told you about Brightman, so please\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s beside the fact.\u201d</p><br/><p>I held my spear up and struck down at his \u2018place.\u2019 A fountain of blood shot up into the air. Luca Bruno screamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuaaaaaaaaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, just watching it hurts me\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but it doesn\u2019t look cleanly cut.\u201d</p><br/><p>I struck down once again, and again, and again. Just in case, I used Mad Typhoon to shred the area. Only then was I certain that I finished the job.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuuuuu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, perfect. With this, it wouldn\u2019t matter even if you seduced women.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, my oppa is too cool\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCool!? Cool!? Hey, Kang Shin! Your sister is still weird! She\u2019s not normal!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was then that a white ball of light appeared above Luca Bruno\u2019s forehead. I didn\u2019t feel any hostility from it, so it wasn\u2019t an attack. I tilted my head and reached out toward it. The moment my hand touched it, a message rang out in my head.</p><br/><p>[Would you like to use the Hero\u2019s authority to retrieve the ability given to Luca Bruno?]</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Would a Hero be unable to do what Ciara can\u2026? (faraway look)</p><br/><p>I\u2019m sure everyone knows Shin\u2019s personality by now, but once he sets his mind to something, he gets it done. He doesn\u2019t know when to stop. Though it may be a little cruel, now is the time to get used to it! (Eh?)</p><br/><p>PS \u2013 Yua\u2019s fans, you waited for a long time! It is her turn!</p><br/><p>PS2 \u2013 Hwaya\u2019s wife-power is nothing to scoff at as well\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

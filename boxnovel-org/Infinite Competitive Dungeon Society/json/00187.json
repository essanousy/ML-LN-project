Skill Synthesis (6)</p><br/><p>I burnt the fruit crawling with worms as calmly as I could, then followed Ren to see the children. Now that I thought about it, there was no way I wouldn\u2019t notice the brain worms\u2019 mana. Of course, it was too late for regrets. The milk was already spilled.</p><br/><p>People had eyes in the front of their face so they could look onward. As such, I walked facing onward.(E/N: I think this is a saying?)</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince\u2026 You have a pretty cute side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut your mouth, Ren.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScream again, Rookie. One more time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut your mouth, Lebuik.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was annoyed that I seemed to have dispelled the last remaining awkwardness between them. When my eyes got sharp, they finally became quiet as we headed to where the children were sleeping. Of course, they weren\u2019t too far off. They were in a mud hut that Ren seemed to have made. Lebuik lost the lighthearted smile she had and examined the sleeping children.</p><br/><p>\u201cLina, Uruto, Demi\u2026 With just Your Highness\u2019 power, they\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI lost two children on our way. I still can\u2019t forget the way they looked at me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren remarked calmly and patted the children\u2019s heads. There were three beastman girls and two beastman boys. Two of the humans were girls and the other was a boy.</p><br/><p>I expected them to be 15 or 16 on average, but all eight of them seemed to be somewhere between 10 and 12. Perhaps, they were even younger. Ren\u2019s situation was indeed grave\u2026 Thinking about how long they\u2019ll need before they could grow strong enough to enter the dungeon by themselves, I sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cRen oppa?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSleep, Teeke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn.\u201d</p><br/><p>A human girl who woke up closed her eyes again after seeing Ren. Ren brushed the girl\u2019s hair and looked up. His eyes flashed sharply.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you the map to the coast, Crown Prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to hear Ren\u2019s plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo as you wish, Your Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lebuik and I retorted and nodded our heads. Ren also nodded in response, then suddenly looked back at Lebuik.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that, Sir Lebuik. There is no country anywhere in this continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Your Highness\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCall me Ren. That is the only name I have left. You don\u2019t need to address me with an honorific either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cH-H-H-How could I dare call Your Highness\u2019 name! T-T-T-That would be like if we were lovers\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Lovers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just calling each other by name. Stop overreacting\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was clear as day that Lebuik was in love with Ren, but as expected of Ren who was single his entire life, he couldn\u2019t catch any one of Lebuik\u2019s signals. Come on, Ren! Why do you think Lebuik came back after she abandoned this world!? It\u2019s because she has a lingering attachment, you idiot! I felt like going crazy from wanting to shout this out loud.(E/N: Says you shin)</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince, you look like you want to say something\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I know I\u2019m not in the position to say something like that, so I decided not to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince is truly mysterious\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Your head is more mysterious!</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhum, Your Hi\u2026 Ren-nim, I still cannot, not use an honorific. I hope Ren-nim understands\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk respectfully either. Talk to me as if I was Crown Prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-In that case\u2026 Okay. Is that\u2026 good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcellent. I\u2019m happy, I feel like I\u2019ve gotten closer to Sir.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRen-nim\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lebuik\u2019s breathing became unpleasantly rough. I wanted to leave so she could express her carnal desires, but it seemed she still had a hint of humanity left as she restrained herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2019m not a knight anymore, so please leave out \u2018sir\u2019. Just call me Lebuik.\u201d</p><br/><p>It felt like she was just trying to advance their relationship by changing the way Ren called her, but I stayed silent and just looked at the map Ren opened. Ren seemed to be hesitating, but with Lebuik\u2019s persistent persuasion, he conceded and decided to call her by her name. Lebuik immediately messaged me.</p><br/><p>[I can die happy! Re, Ren-nim is calling me by my name\u2026 Thank you for bringing me, Rookie!]</p><br/><p>You don\u2019t need to thank me, just go die.</p><br/><p>The distance between the forest we were in, Celbitz, and our destination coast, Mileet, was about 1,000 km. To hide our tracks as much as possible, we would travel through mountain ranges. However, there was about a 50 km long distance from the end of the mountain ranges to the coast where we would be in a completely open area. There, we had to be ready to face attacks from the enemy. I couldn\u2019t help but sigh thinking just how Ren would have made it without me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll move about 50 km per day. Thankfully, the children are well-trained for their age, so they can keep up. They were all members of the royalty or the nobility, so they can read, write, and even wield mana. The beastman children are especially outstanding. If needed, they can run while carrying the human children on their backs. Huhu, they\u2019re truly admirable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that how you\u2019ve been traveling through the forest until now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>I bitterly smiled traveling a thousand kilometers just on foot\u2026 I could only laugh in vain. I checked the map again and took out a piece of paper to draw on. Eight small circles and five large triangles. Written with mana, the markings didn\u2019t solidify but floated around like ice on water.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s speed up. We should be able to since we\u2019re explorers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, but what about the children?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll carry them.\u201d</p><br/><p>I took the small circles and placed them on the triangles. Ren, who was looking at the paper, asked carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince, there are other dangers in the forest other than the El Patiz. It\u2019s full of strong monsters and monsters that like to ambush. If we\u2019re carrying the children, how are we supposed to react? If it wasn\u2019t for that, I would have carried them in turns.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHear me out. To protect the children from ambushes, we\u2019ll put Lotte in the back.\u201d</p><br/><p>I took a black triangle representing Lotte and dragged it behind the other shapes. In her human form, Lotte was a lot more mobile and still retained her strengths as an attacker. She would be able to deal with most situations by herself. Even if we met with someone on par with Luka continent\u2019s Demon Army Commander, I believed she would be able to hold on. Of course, to ensure her maneuverability, she wouldn\u2019t carry any children.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not enough. We might be safe from enemies ambushing us from behind, but what about the front? I can tell that this woman is strong, so wouldn\u2019t it be better to put her in the front to charge forward without caring about our back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll have a point of weakness. You can leave the front to me. To be honest, I\u2019m the strongest out of anyone here.\u201d</p><br/><p>I dragged the golden triangle representing me and placed it in the front. Ren nodded in response, while Lebuik\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You may not know, but I\u2019m a level 69 explorer! I acknowledge that you\u2019re strong enough to work as a Dimensional Mercenary, but in terms of strength, I\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLebuik, this\u2026 Crown Prince is the guild Revival\u2019s master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!? You mean, the savage who toys with an administrative guild master!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, you, meet me outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>5 minutes passed before we got back on track. Ren let out a dry cough, trying to ignore the giant bump on Lebuik\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Crown Prince will be in charge of the front, Lebuik and I will have to carry four children each.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, the two of you have to guard the sides.\u201d</p><br/><p>I placed two of the triangles on the left and right sides. There was now one large triangle and eight small circles in the middle. Ren tilted his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince, sorry, but I\u2019m bad with puzzles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRookie, stop beating around the bush and get to the point.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s simple. We\u2019ll let someone else carry them.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were five triangles from the beginning. Realizing this now, Ren tilted his head. I grinned and summoned Ruyue. She immediately took my mana, materialized into her humanoid wolf form, and jumped on me.</p><br/><p>[Shin!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, Ruyue. I\u2019m sorry, but can you materialize in your wolf form?\u201d</p><br/><p>[But I like the beastman form more!]</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Okay!]</p><br/><p>I liked that Ruyue listened to whatever I asked her to do. I was thankful that she met a master like me and not one with lecherous intentions.</p><br/><p>When Ruyue transformed into a giant wolf form, Ren and Lebuik nodded their heads, finally understanding what I meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo she can transform into different forms. Amazing. She was a beautiful girl, and her wolf form is just as beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Grrr.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lebuik seemed to be burning her competitive spirit at Ren\u2019s words, but because I was too lazy to say anything, I just ignored her.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue should be able to carry all the children on her back. She has the intelligence to protect them from falling off, and more importantly, she\u2019s quick and silent when she travels.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Shin is praising me!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, Ruyue is amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ehehehe.]</p><br/><p>I scratched Ruyue\u2019s chin. Ren looked jealous for a moment, then went back to a serious expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll leave the children to her and focus on guarding them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. Much better, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Crown Prince really is amazing. I don\u2019t have the words to express my admiration for Crown Prince\u2019s abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRen is amazing too. No one will be able to win against Ren\u2019s desire to protect these children.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuk, don\u2019t flatter me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren blushed and turned his head. His lion ears were twitching, unsure of what to do. Lebuik began to glare at me this time. Wait, was she considering me a competitor!?</p><br/><p>Before the sun rose, Ren woke up the children one by one. They all got up silently without a word of complaint, immediately stretching and dusting off their bodies. As if they promised beforehand, they became shocked after seeing me, cheered after seeing Lebuik, and exclaimed in surprise after seeing Ruyue.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this cool oppa?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a cool armor! Between Hyung[1. Hyung = older brother (male to male)] and Ren, who wins?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRen oppa is still cooler!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnni, you were alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKnight noona, I wanted to see you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, look! A cool wolf!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! What a beautiful fur!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be ancestor-nim from the myths?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo soft\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWolf-nim, did you come to protect us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking just how overwhelmingly popular Ruyue was, I looked at Lebuik. She was somberly looking at the morning sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2019m a deserter\u2026 but still, losing to a wolf\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re kids, Lebuik.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHu, I only have Ren-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you confess already?\u201d</p><br/><p>After breakfast, we put all the children on Ruyue\u2019s back. I could handle Ruyue\u2019s materialization with Peruta Circuit\u2019s natural mana recovery, so I didn\u2019t even need to drink Mana Potions. However, the children seemed hesitant to ride on Ruyue.</p><br/><p>\u201cRiding on this Wolf-nim\u2019s back\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Wolf-nim will get our bad luck!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat soft fur!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys, Ruyue doesn\u2019t mind you guys being on her back, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I hate everyone other than Shin, but I\u2019ll allow it since you guys are kids!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWolf-nim talked!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWolf-nim really was an unni!\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked Ren why the children treated Ruyue so respectfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe beastman empire\u2019s founding mythology starts with the meeting of a golden lion and a silver wolf. That\u2019s probably why the children like the girl so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that why Ren likes Ruyue too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUk, n-no! I didn\u2019t have any impure thoughts! I just thought she was beautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop, Lebuik!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Lebuik?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren tilted his head and turned around. Lebuik, who was holding her claymore, quickly hid her hands behind her back and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Ren-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince, did Lebuik do something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, nothing. So Ren, what do you think about Lebuik?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, Lebuik is extremely beautiful and strong. She became my guardian knight at a young age. Even during a war, many soldiers became lovesick because of her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lebuik threw her weapon down, put her hands on her cheeks, and squirmed. I sighed in relief and stopped Ren.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren suddenly grinned and whispered in my ears.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Are you interested in Lebuik, Crown Prince? Now that I think about it, you did bring her here\u2026 Should I introduce you to her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you come to that conclusion, you idiot!\u201d</p><br/><p>We didn\u2019t have the time for such petty conversations. Once the children got on Ruyue, we quickly set off. Ren was the slowest, so we had to slow ourselves down for him, but we were traveling about 7 times as fast as when Ren was alone.</p><br/><p>Like Ren said, we had to deal with the forest\u2019s monsters. Most of them were quite grotesque, and usually popped out from the ground or jumped down from the trees. However, the reason I made a formation that thoroughly protected the children wasn\u2019t to protect them against monsters. Forest monsters no longer posed any threat to me.</p><br/><p>[Kiaaaa!]</p><br/><p>[What are you trying to achieve by entering this forest!?]</p><br/><p>An orangutan-like monster with a melted body that seemed to have bathed in hydrochloric acid jumped down from a tree, while another monster that looked like a spider magnified hundreds of times and wrapped in iron armor popped out of the ground. Ren and Lebuik both held up their claymores and prepared to face them. I, on the other hand, simply stared at them with my eyes.</p><br/><p>They became stone and clunked down.</p><br/><p>\u201cEk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? They\u2019re stone. What, you\u2019ve never seen Evil Eyes of Petrification before?\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied with a hint of sassiness and broke the petrified monsters with my spear. Then, I urged them on.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hurry! Don\u2019t just stand there dumbfounded!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve heard of Evil Eyes of Petrification!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSay it earlier if you have such an ability!\u201d</p><br/><p>I ran forward as I snickered at the party members who were touched by my ability. They gritted their teeth and followed suit. Whenever monsters appeared, I turned them to stone, and we marched forward as we broke them.</p><br/><p>In the end, we covered 700 km in just one day. There was only 300 km left until our destination.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

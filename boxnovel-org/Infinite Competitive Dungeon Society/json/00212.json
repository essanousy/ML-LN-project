The Third Taming (3)</p><br/><p>What the Succubus Queen, Licorice, did next was truly shocking. When she slightly lifted up her dress, the 213 succubi in the castle all transformed into bats and flew into her dress. Although the dress was see-through, I couldn\u2019t see the bats once they went in!</p><br/><p>In utter shock, I stared at her dress fixedly and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, you won\u2019t see them even if you stare so intently. Do you want to try lifting my dress up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo thanks!\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice fiddled with the hem of her dress seductively, but I answered with a forehead flick. While she muttered in pain, the castle she and the other succubi were living in began to crumble.</p><br/><p>Once the pain seemingly subsided, Licorice raised her head and looked at the crumbling castle with a touched expression. She then turned around to face me and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, I have lost my home now, so you have to take responsibility. Food, clothing, shelter, and everything else!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuccubi eat food?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, but we do have a preference, huhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice stared intently at a certain part of my body as she licked her lips. I was already worrying how the guild members would react once they saw her.</p><br/><p>Wait, no, after the Floor Master battle, the first one I saw was always\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim? What hap\u2026 Kyak!?\u201d</p><br/><p>As I expected, we were sent to the front of the Floor Shop. I didn\u2019t know what happened to the dungeon when I entered the Event Dungeon, but Loretta, who was approaching me with a worried expression, screamed in shock when she saw Licorice .</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that monster!? Shin-nim, n-next to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Loretta. This is Licorice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHi! I\u2019m Licorice, Dear Husband named me. Who are you? Dear Husband\u2019s concubine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh look, Loretta\u2019s double-edged battle axe\u2026 Wait, no, stop with that!</p><br/><p>For the next 5 minutes, I explained what had happened. Of course, I introduced Loretta to Licorice as well. Loretta clenched her fists, seemingly thinking about something extremely violent, as she flapped her ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 Hmm, 213 succubi and a Succubus Queen\u2026 Not to mention, they\u2019re a clan highly apt in battle\u2026 Uuu, they\u2019ll be of great help to Shin-nim. Uu\u2026 I\u2019ll have to accept\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re his concubine, so what relation do you have with Dear Husband that gives you the right to accept me or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLicorice, shut up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, this elf is glaring at me. Scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Licorice seemed unable to withstand Loretta\u2019s killing intent as she hid behind my back and trembled. That seemed to make Loretta even more furious.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, that\u2019s enough!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? But this isn\u2019t my fault!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou could have killed them all with an iron will and stone heart!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want me to kill them when they never had any hostility against me!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hard-pressed for a correct response, Loretta drooped her ears and grumbled. At that moment, Licorice tapped on my arm and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, I want to go to your home now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHome? You mean the one in the Residential Area? Or the one on Earth?\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking about Licorice and the 213 succubi that should be hiding in her dress, I felt like I was going nuts. As Licorice\u2019s master, I could command her servants perfectly. While each of them had a strength greater than a typical SS rank monster\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLicorice, we\u2019re going to Earth, now. Loretta, I\u2019ll be back in a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Shin-nim. I\u2019m trusting you, okay? You have to come back! Don\u2019t be seduced by a mere succubus!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMere succubus!? A succubus is a lot better than a mere elf!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuiet both of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>After giving Loretta and Licorice appropriate punishments, I returned to Earth with the fretting Licorice. As no one was home, I messaged Hwaya and headed to our guild house on Earth.</p><br/><p>Although I was sure I only contacted Hwaya, when I arrived at the guild house, Sumire, Yua, Ludia, and Ye-Eun were all there.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you all here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya\u2019s answer was particularly noteworthy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, you said, \u2018I got a force we could completely trust!\u2019, so that obviously made me think, \u2018what woman is it this time?\u2019 So I gathered people I thought would be my allies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it really was a woman... Hwaya Unni\u2019s intuition is scary!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo who is she? She doesn\u2019t look human.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Ye-Eun\u2019s respect for Hwaya seemed to have rose, Ludia who specialized in holy magic seemed to have felt Licorice\u2019s aura as she put up her guard. Just like I did for Loretta, I explained what happened with Licorice to them.</p><br/><p>\u201c214\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re all succubi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, she looks much stronger than the Succubus Queen I met before. Is she really a Succubus Queen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, isn\u2019t it obvious that I\u2019d be stronger than the ones who entrusted their existences to the dungeon? They\u2019re tied to the dungeon, but I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuccubus\u2026 Huu.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know why, but Ludia put her staff down seemingly relieved. At that moment, Licorice tilted her head and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand that they\u2019re all Dear Husband\u2019s women, but who\u2019s the legal wife? You see, Mares have a strict hierarchy. If you tell me, I\u2019ll behave accordingly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Silence descended. When I was about to say something with a sigh, the atmosphere changed. Ludia put up her staff again, while the air heated up from Hwaya\u2019s fireballs.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought about making it clear. Legal wife\u2026 For now, I\u2019ll accept that position.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat position belongs to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m confident in fighting too!\u201d</p><br/><p>I used Divine Speed and calmed them down by flicking their foreheads. Then, I continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn any case, with Licorice\u2019s servants, things will get a lot easier. They all have human intelligence and there\u2019s no need to worry about them betraying us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, we do have a lot of work to do and it\u2019s not like we can keep seeking outside help\u2026 and I feel sorry making Sumire work all the time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, if we think of them as 213 SS rankers, that\u2019s indeed frightening. They can probably conquer the world with just their strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy servants are competent! If it\u2019s Dear Husband\u2019s command, they\u2019ll do anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice raised her hand and spoke with a bright voice. After contemplating for a brief moment, Hwaya nodded her head.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Alright. I\u2019m looking forward to working together. With your sincerity and ability, let\u2019s maintain a healthy competitive relationship. That said, I can\u2019t accept all 213 others as competitors. Let them find other men!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, my clan normally chooses one man to serve. You see, we share a strong link. With it, we can share experiences and grow stronger quicker. But there\u2019s also a clear disadvantage. We feel excruciating pain when we do it with other men. So it\u2019s always been that the queen chooses a man, while the others follow. Don\u2019t worry! Our Dear Husband can easily handle 200 or 300 of us and not even feel tired!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the problem!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>So that\u2019s why they were all together in that Event Dungeon\u2026 Just when I thought a good relationship would be established between Hwaya and Licorice, it was shattered. That said, everyone accepted the succubus clan\u2019s usefulness. First, the Succubus Queen\u2019s direct subordinate, the Elder Succubus \u2018Mirei\u2019, became Hwaya\u2019s secretary. Though Sumire planned to stay in Korea, she had become free from all the work we\u2019ve been putting on her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI like her. She\u2019s even dressed modestly. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease take good care of me, Hwaya-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leather jacket, leather pants, and grey hair that flowed down to one side of her shoulder. With serene grey eyes, she was the picture-perfect secretary. Not to mention, as Mirei had strength that was only second to Licorice, she could fight with Hwaya if something happened.</p><br/><p>Additionally, dozens of other succubi were placed under Mirei to monitor and collect data on monsters, Event Dungeons, and Event Raids that appeared on Earth.</p><br/><p>Until now, Revival didn\u2019t have a proper information sector. As a result, information had to flow from an outside source to Hwaya then to me. With this new addition, everything would change.</p><br/><p>As all of them had the power of an SS ranker, the proactiveness and information collecting prowess were far greater than before. As Mirei could create mental links between herself and Licorice at any time, Hwaya and I received information practically as they came. The succubi\u2019s ability couldn\u2019t be described as just great.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you guys lose?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe fate got in our way so I could meet Dear Husband.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was more difficult to deal with stealthy approaches like Hwaya\u2019s, but I liked that Licorice was so brazen. That way, I could strike her down without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Eh? Why did I sound like a horrible guy just now?</p><br/><p>However, other than Licorice, Mirei, and the thirty succubi under her command, there were still 182 succubi. What were they supposed to do? They couldn\u2019t all climb the dungeon. Should we send them to other countries? While I was wracking my stupid brain, Licorice asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, why are there so many neglected monsters in this world?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s because people can\u2019t easily enter territories that monsters claimed. It\u2019s dangerous and we don\u2019t even know what monsters are there. Since everyone\u2019s busy dealing with the monsters appearing near human territories, they can\u2019t gather the numbers to tackle such large areas.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Licorice pointed at the 182 bats filling the mansion.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t they there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You\u2019re right!\u201d</p><br/><p>The real territorial war between humans and monsters began with a trivial thought. Just like everything in the world usually was.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Above the Frozen Land (2)</p><br/><p>The giant Skeleton Wolf certainly looked like the fusion of a Giant Wolf and a Wendigo. It emitted freezing energy, was huge, and carried immense power. However, no matter how powerful he was, as long as it was within my expectation, it wasn\u2019t of any threat to me.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>It was also incredibly fast. Yet, I was faster. Its freezing energy was powerful, but weaker than Ruyue\u2019s. It could enlarge its head or front paw, but I didn\u2019t allow myself to get hit even once. Compared to the Hermit King who could completely erase his presence, the Skeleton Wolf\u2019s presence was just too big.</p><br/><p>When it enlarged a part of its body, the energy gathering in that area was too large for me not to notice it. The only way I would be hit is if I purposely let myself be hit. I couldn\u2019t even understand why I couldn\u2019t notice it in the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis older brother has other things to do today! I don\u2019t have time to play around with you! Overlord!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since I didn\u2019t plan on fighting after this, I used Overlord without hesitation. There was no way Beyond\u2019s 25th Floor Master could withstand a power that could kill worlds\u2019 enemies. When the Skeleton Wolf saw the energy inside me expanding, it howled.</p><br/><p>[Kuoooooo!]</p><br/><p>[Frost Skeleton Wolf\u2019s \u2018Collapsing Roar\u2019 rings out. Everything with form begins to collapse. Everything being collapsed will freeze with the Frost Skeleton Wolf\u2019s mana and will attack you!]</p><br/><p>I see, so this was the reason the Floor Master room was a snowy mountain! After hearing message noona\u2019s report, I quickly summoned Sharana, infusing her into me and flying up. The ground below me was the first to collapse, while the peak of the snowy mountain followed suit. Then, controlled by the Frost Skeleton Wolf\u2019s mana, they all began to fly towards me. After using Collapsing Roar, the Frost Skeleton Wolf also froze parts of the air and charged towards me in the sky.</p><br/><p>Watching everything shooting towards me with intent to kill, I smirked. It was like watching a bigger version of Gaia Buster! With my current stats, even if I couldn\u2019t perform the same feat, I would probably be able to do half of what the Skeleton Wolf could do.</p><br/><p>Although there wasn\u2019t anywhere for me to use Gaia Buster at the moment, once I got back to Antarctica, there would be more than enough land.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, I\u2019ll leave the defense to you! Peika, let\u2019s go full power!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un!]</p><br/><p>[Show that doggy Master\u2019s power!]</p><br/><p>Ruyue flew up and reached forward towards the incoming boulders of ice. After taking over 20% of my mana, she enclosed them all with her own ice and put them under her control.</p><br/><p>Noting that I was safe from attacks, I accelerated in an instant and pointed my golden lightning covered spear towards the Frost Skeleton Wolf. Peika\u2019s lightning was heightened by Lightning God\u2019s power and mixed with Heroic Aura to transform into a platinum colored lightning. Even after being concentrated into a single point, streaks of lightning crackled outward. Though a bit embarrassing, it was a scene worthy of the name Lightning God.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not strong enough! The height I\u2019m envisioning is higher and farther, the pinnacle of the dungeon!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll return it to you! Take it!]</p><br/><p>At the same time I thrust forward with my spear, Ruyue\u2019s shout also rang out. The countless chunks of frozen land and boulders in the air all shot towards the Skeleton Wolf following her command. The Skeleton Wolf could only howl and face them head on, but his howling was beginning to sound like screams.</p><br/><p>[You cleared Beyond\u2019s 25th floor. You obtained the qualification to challenge the First Dungeon\u2019s 76th floor.]</p><br/><p>[Your maximum HP and MP increase by 2%. You obtained 5 bonus stats.]</p><br/><p>[Experience has been added to skills you frequently used to progress through Beyond\u2019s 25th floor.]</p><br/><p>[You defeated Beyond\u2019s fifth Floor Master, Frost Skeleton Wolf! You obtained the title \u2018Frost Skeleton Wolf Slayer.\u2019 All stats increase by 1.]</p><br/><p>[Choose your reward.]</p><br/><p>[1. Collapsing Ring.]</p><br/><p>[He was weak!]</p><br/><p>\u201cEven Beyond\u2019s Floor Master is nothing to Ruyue. Amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ehehehe.]</p><br/><p>Although Skeleton Wolf was weaker than the Dragon Zombie, its ability to collapse and control land was truly terrifying. If I didn\u2019t have my elementals, I might have had more trouble.</p><br/><p>Still, to seize the control of those huge boulders\u2026 Did the terrain boost Ruyue\u2019s ability? In any case, since I knew she had the highest contribution, I praised her wholeheartedly as I patted her. Then, I read the messages I just received.</p><br/><p>It somewhat made sense that I wasn\u2019t the first to defeat the Frost Skeleton Wolf solo, but I was still surprised. It meant there was someone else that climbed to Beyond\u2019s 25th floor.</p><br/><p>The seniors before me, just how far in Beyond did they go? What about in the First Dungeon? What about that man in Beyond\u2019s Residential Area? Although I was full of questions, I buried them inside. I knew it was only a matter of time until I found out.</p><br/><p>Next, the Collapsing Ring\u2019s effect was beyond my expectations. Just like how the Echo Ring from Beyond\u2019s Floor Master amplified roar type skills, the Collapsing Ring had a terrifying effect of doubling the range of all skills that crumbled land.</p><br/><p>I immediately thought of earthquake magic that magicians used, but what I had was Gaia Buster. I wanted to test it out immediately, but the snowy mountain ruined by the Frost Skeleton Wolf\u2019s Collapsing Roar wasn\u2019t a place I could stay leisurely. When I left, I saw a completely unexpected customer at the Floor Shop.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s that Hero in Double Crisis.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGek.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHold on, what\u2019s up with that sound like a frog that just got stepped on with a high-heel?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Shin-nim. That was really fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one talking to Loretta was none other than Eleine, Lost Valley\u2019s master. As the last talk I had about her wasn\u2019t particularly joyful, it felt awkward seeing her face. I silently looked at Loretta, asking her with my face why she was here.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, she said she had to talk about work. I didn\u2019t know when Shin-nim would return, so I couldn\u2019t leave the Floor Shop.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should do things in moderation, Loretta. If you fall too deep, you won\u2019t know how to climb back up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe quiet before you fall too deep to climb back, Eleine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eleine pouted and went silent. With a wry smile, I waved goodbye and was about to leave when Loretta stopped me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be done soon, so stay and play with me, please?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf an administrative guild master came all the way to discuss something, it can\u2019t be simple. I\u2019ll come back later, we can play then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eleine nodded seriously while still staying quiet. Loretta glared at Eleine with killing intent, but in the end, she sighed and took out an axe from the\u2026 Wait, that wasn\u2019t a sigh of resignation!?</p><br/><p>Eleine, who didn\u2019t notice Loretta\u2019s axe, suddenly looked at me with sparkling eyes. When I was wondering what was up, she spoke rather unexpected words.</p><br/><p>\u201cHero, I already heard you defeated two worlds\u2019 enemies! Then can you take care of our business too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before I could respond, Loretta fixed her grip on her axe and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cEleine\u2026 Cut it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it natural to give quests to qualified explorers? That\u2019s the administrative guild members\u2019 job.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s already busy! If you keep bothering my Shin-nim, I\u2019ll make you regret it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even after hearing Loretta\u2019s threat, Eleine continued to look at me with great interest. I shook my head with a wry smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but I can\u2019t right now. There are too many things I have to do on Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? We still have some time so contact me when you\u2019re done with\u2026 Hiik!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta\u2019s giant axe struck the dungeon floor, making a thunder roar that rang out with Eleine\u2019s shriek.</p><br/><p>\u201cL-Loretta, are you really doing this!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, I\u2019m sorry but we\u2019ll have to play later. I have something else to take care of now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, mm\u2026 Okay. Try to avoid murder, Loretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>At my advice, Loretta retorted lightly, as if she was about to catch an annoying mosquito flying around in the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll consider it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Hero! You\u2019re running away! I\u2019ll get my revenge!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, I won\u2019t mind even if Loretta becomes a criminal. Just saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Shin-nim! I understand!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHero, you! That\u2019s assisting murder! A crime! Hey!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, I safely escaped from Loretta and Eleine.</p><br/><p>\u201cStrange. Really strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice looked uncomfortable during the entire time we were exploring Antarctica.</p><br/><p>\u201cI had fun with Dear Husband, but why doesn\u2019t it feel like it? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s just your imagination. Maybe you\u2019ll change your mind once we clear a dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it must be because it wasn\u2019t enough. In that case, I have to spend more time with Dear Husband.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Stop spouting nonsense and look in front of you, bat.]</p><br/><p>\u201cEek, this birdbrain\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice glared at Lotte and gritted her teeth. However, Lotte was right. Even though we could travel quickly on Lotte\u2019s back, it wasn\u2019t easy to find Event Dungeons in this huge continent. Licorice, who had the result of the succubi\u2019s exploration in her head, needed to focus for us to finish exploring Antarctica quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven Dear Husband\u2026 I feel like I\u2019m just a map.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo your best for a little longer, Licorice. When we\u2019re done, I\u2019ll reward you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what Dear Husband says\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice complained a little and closed her eyes to focus on the database in her head. Then, she ordered Lotte to turn to the right and fly straight.</p><br/><p>When we arrived at a certain point, she faced a giant glacier and tilted her head. Then, she closed her eyes again before opening them back up.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>What she said next surprised me greatly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe dungeon that was here, I think it was cleared already.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

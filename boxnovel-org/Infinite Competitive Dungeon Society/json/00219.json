(5)</p><br/><p>Even if Yua needed to tame new monsters, I couldn\u2019t delay my dungeon progress to make time for it. Of the 2 year time period, a month had already passed.</p><br/><p>However, there was a way to hunt monsters on Earth and not slow down the dungeon progress. That was the period of time where I needed to grind Floor Masters, during which I had free time once I finished my daily grind. Since the 65th Floor Master was a Succubus Queen, the 70th Floor Master was likely the Incubus King. Even if he was three times stronger than the Succubus Queen, I still had the confidence to defeat him in under 5 minutes. Even if I took an hour to rest between the fights, I only need 1 hour and 50 minutes to grind him 10 times. In other words, I would have about 22 hours of free time. It was more than enough time to take care of Earth\u2019s monsters or travel to Mars and back.</p><br/><p>Telling Yua to wait a week was the same as declaring that I would reach the 70th floor in a week. This was possible for a simple reason. The First Dungeon posed no problem for me whatsoever, and Beyond floors\u2019 property was also helping me.</p><br/><p>To be fair, I was a bit worried about the Grim Reaper. He was one of the most difficult Floor Masters I fought. However, with the terrain property helping me, it seemed doable.</p><br/><p>[Guooooo!]</p><br/><p>[Hateful human, do you not know the word \u2018fair\u2019!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I want to ask you bastards.\u201d</p><br/><p>After breaking through the First Dungeon\u2019s 67th floor in the blink of an eye, I immediately charged into Beyond\u2019s 17th floor. There, I thoroughly scorched the Dullahans. While they possessed powerful skills and tough bodies, they seemed to have left their ability to learn and manners at home. It was the first time I was able to sweep Beyond\u2019s floor so easily. Against the Orc Lords, I really had to use my brain.</p><br/><p>[You cleared Beyond\u2019s 17h floor. You obtained the qualification to challenge the First Dungeon\u2019s 68th floor.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained 5 bonus stats. Your maximum HP and MP increase by 2%.]</p><br/><p>[Experience has been added to skills you frequently used to progress through Beyond\u2019s 17th floor.]</p><br/><p>[You mastered high rank Martial Arts Technique! Your body and mana reaches a perfect harmony. Positive effects will be added to all actions done with your body. All physical attack damage and speed increases by 20%.]</p><br/><p>[Although you have the groundwork to create a higher martial path, you cannot create a new technique yet due to your lack understanding in Martial Arts.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The only thing I did on the 17th floor that could be considered Martial Arts was kicking the heads that flew at me. I only did it out of annoyance as the Dullahans literally used their heads when I said they didn\u2019t try to use their head. I didn\u2019t think it would lead to this!</p><br/><p>I especially liked Martial Arts Technique as it affected other abilities and skills. I didn\u2019t think I would master it so quickly, but I couldn\u2019t complain, as the 20% increase to physical attack damage and speed applied to my Spear Technique.</p><br/><p>However, it suspected that it would be difficult or even impossible to create a higher Martial Arts Technique. I had only learned and honed what was passed down in the family and having had experience with creating Mad Typhoon, I couldn\u2019t even begin to understand how to create a new Martial Arts Technique.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting stronger. It really feels like the best way to move has been ingrained on my mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>20% increase to attack power and speed. Although it looked simple in numbers, in truth, it only meant that I could more skillfully draw out the power hidden in my body. Mastering a skill by Beyond\u2019s skill experience enhancement was great, but I still needed time to thoroughly understand the change. Of course, as I didn\u2019t have much time, I would have to get used to it through brawling with monsters.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s bring Lotte and head to the 68th floor!\u201d</p><br/><p>I gave a spirited shout and jumped into the gate. Being able to focus solely on the dungeon was a refreshing feeling!</p><br/><p>After finishing our joyride through the 68th floor, I sent Lotte back to the mansion and was about to jump into Beyond\u2019s 18th floor. At that moment, I received a message. As it was a man\u2019s voice, I thought it was Ren or Father, but when I heard the entire message, I froze in front of the gate to Beyond.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s been a while, friend.]</p><br/><p>Right, I was thinking it was about time I was interrupted\u2026 Someone didn\u2019t want me to just freely climb the dungeon! After letting out an inaudible sigh, I opened my mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Ellos.\u201d</p><br/><p>How many months had it been? From what I remember, the last time I talked to Ellos was when Ludia and Shuna went with Ellos\u2019 party to defeat the 40th Floor Master. Immediately after that, Ludia\u2019s Luka continent was\u2026</p><br/><p>When I contacted Ellos after everything had been taken care of, he didn\u2019t pick up. After obtaining an ability after coming to Earth, Ludia could climb the dungeon with just Shuna so there was no problem, but we were both worried about being unable to contact Ellos. After all, he was the first friend I made in the dungeon.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was worried sick. I knew you weren\u2019t dead because you didn\u2019t disappear from my friend list, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Haha, sorry. A lot\u2026 happened.]</p><br/><p>Just like always, he sounded calm and collected. If he was gone for a few months, he must have been so busy that he could barely sleep, but his voice did not show any such signs.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs everything taken care of?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yeah. We stopped the invader\u2019s major attack. The Hero survived too somehow.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yeah\u2026 It\u2019s great that you and Palludia are alive too. I\u2019ll see you later. We can defeat a Floor Master together or something.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, yeah, hurry up.\u201d</p><br/><p>I knew it would be impossible to party with Ellos. Even so, I encouraged him fully. Ellos probably didn\u2019t think that I could have reached the 70th floor in just a few months.</p><br/><p>Although not a long time had passed, many things had changed. Thinking about everything that happened, I was about to say goodbye.</p><br/><p>Ellos, however, seemed to have something else to say.</p><br/><p>[I heard you became a Dimensional Mercenary.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? Oh, yeah, you knew?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m really proud to be your friend. I respect you as a friend too\u2026 When you\u2019re free, can you come to my continent? We\u2019re currently preparing a final offensive to drive away the invaders.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen my Dimensional Travel cooldown time ends, I\u2019ll be more than happy to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Haha, thanks. You couldn\u2019t be more reliable.]</p><br/><p>It seemed the war between the Edias continent and its invader was coming to an end. Unlike the Luka continent and the Panan continent, the Edias continent seemed to have the power to resist and was even winning by the sound of it. Perhaps, there were warriors as powerful as me fighting alongside the Hero.</p><br/><p>If Ellos\u2019 world could drive away the world\u2019s enemy, it was a cause for celebration. If I couldn\u2019t give them a hand, I would be even happier. I inwardly placed a Dimensional Mercenary mission on reserve and jumped into Beyond\u2019s 18th floor feeling refreshed.</p><br/><p>[Foolish human.]</p><br/><p>[Why must you give yourself to death?]</p><br/><p>As expected, I ran into Grim Reapers filling up a wide passageway.</p><br/><p>The Grim Reaper possessed several abilities. They were skilled in handling their large scythes, shot aura waves, shot dozens of small scythes, and even blinked behind me suddenly. The Death Roar they used doubled the undeads\u2019 attack and halved the livings\u2019 defense. They could even make scythes pop up from the ground. I really wanted to ask, couldn\u2019t they have conquered a world by themselves? Not to mention, they were even stronger in Beyond.</p><br/><p>[We shall guide you to death.]</p><br/><p>[Come with us.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019d want to go with you floating hobos!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I prepared myself for what was to come, leaving everything to continued use of Divine Speed and mana recovery through Absolute Soul. The Grim Reapers teleported like ghosts from horror movies and sent aura waves flying toward me. Using Ruyue\u2019s power to block them, I flew up.</p><br/><p>[Die!]</p><br/><p>In the next moment, a Grim Reaper appeared behind me and swung his scythe. However, the cape hanging on my back immediately fluttered and hit the scythe away. Although the Grim Reapers\u2019 sudden blink attack was the most annoying attack, it was a considered an ambush. As such, Felixes\u2019 Chaotic Cape nullified it with its anti-ambush effect.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re first! Heroic Strike!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kiaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>The spear I thrust out penetrated the reaper\u2019s body. Although small scythes shot out, they were easily blocked by my armor. They didn\u2019t work either! Even though the Grim Reapers had gotten stronger, my increase in strength had more than made up for it!</p><br/><p>With an evil grin, I twisted the spear which was still stuck inside him. The reaper instantly became particles of light and scattered into the air. Just a single Heroic Strike with a normal amount of mana could kill a reaper.</p><br/><p>[This human is resisting.]</p><br/><p>[Foolish!]</p><br/><p>After sending one reaper away, I turned to the others. In the air, dozens of large scythes were slashing down towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you get tired?\u201d</p><br/><p>I quickly dodged and the scythes also struck the ground. The passageway immediately began to transform. The floor, which was made of stone-like material, became metallic and sharp spikes protruded out, making it impossible to step foot on the ground. Of course, I didn\u2019t believe that the spikes would stay on the ground forever.</p><br/><p>The Grim Reapers shouted together.</p><br/><p>[As you rejected a comfortable death, you shall face a cruel gruesome death!]</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>[Grim Reaper uses Death Roar! Absolute Soul, Overwhelm, and high charm nullifies Death Roar!]</p><br/><p>[What!?]</p><br/><p>[O-Our roar\u2026!]</p><br/><p>I was also surprised. I didn\u2019t think I could completely nullify Death Roar. I thought only worlds\u2019 enemies could ignore the dungeon\u2019s skills. However, not only did I nullify the debuff from Death Roar, I even nullified the self-buffing part of Death Roar. Wait\u2026 then was it the same for Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry\u2026?</p><br/><p>[His league\u2026 A truly lofty league\u2026!]</p><br/><p>[Overwhelming Grim Reapers\u2026 Is this man human!?]</p><br/><p>The reapers also seemed shocked as they froze in the air. I didn\u2019t miss the opportunity and used Elemental Tempest and Sacrifice.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>[You\u2026 You are the dungeon\u2019s\u2026!]</p><br/><p>The reapers disappeared muttering things I couldn\u2019t understand. After absorbing elemental power, the passageway began to glow in a five-colored light and shot out its spikes. However, with no reapers attacking me, dodging them was piece of cake. I quickly weaved through the spikes and flew across the passageway, murmuring.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m this much, the world\u2019s enemy\u2026 I need to get stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was no longer the kid that didn\u2019t know anything. Now that I could fathom the enemy\u2019s power, I could set a clearer goal for myself.</p><br/><p>Although the dungeon was powerful, it undoubtedly had a limit. Perhaps, what the dungeon wanted from me was to surpass the power it bestowed me. Overlord, gods\u2019 true names, and Absolute Soul. These were all ways to accomplish that.</p><br/><p>Although I should be happy, I wasn\u2019t. With a stiff expression, I progressed through Beyond, believing that someone beyond the dungeon could answer my questions.</p><br/><p>Four days later, I reached the First Dungeon\u2019s 70th floor. It was two days earlier than the promised day with Yua.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

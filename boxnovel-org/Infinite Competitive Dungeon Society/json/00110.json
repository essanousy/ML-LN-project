Requirements of a Dimensional Mercenary (3)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 What about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>[D-Dungeon. I ran away to the dungeon. Most of the explorers in the battlefield died, and only Shuna and I managed to escape to the dungeon. I\u2019m scared, I can\u2019t go back. E-Even though I\u2019m the crown princess. Even though I have to be at the battlefield\u2026!]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 And the Demon Lord?\u201d</p><br/><p>[He got heavily injured from fighting the Hero before squeezing out the last of his strength and turning everyone into stone. Shina was there. I ran away\u2026 while watching everything happen.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Shina isn\u2019t the only one that got captured.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yeah\u2026 S-Shin\u2026 I, I\u2019m scared. I can\u2019t go back to my world\u2026]</p><br/><p>Even over the dungeon\u2019s messages, her trembling voice reached me perfectly. I bit my lips, not knowing what to do. After a bit of pondering, I thought that I needed to see her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>[In my house at the Residential Area\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s meet first.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Okay.]</p><br/><p>I wouldn\u2019t be able to focus on breaking through the dungeon in this situation anyways. I immediately headed to the Residential Area and received her invitation to go to her house.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I arrived, Ludia bumped into my chest. No, she had run into my embrace. Thankfully, I wasn\u2019t wearing my armor.</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHic\u2026 hic\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without bursting out into tears, she eked out whimpers as she stayed in my embrace. I could feel my shirt getting wet from her tears. Flustered, I didn\u2019t know what to do and could only pat her back as she cried. Ludia stayed like that for a few minutes before she calmed down and got off.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia\u2019s eyes were bloodshot from crying. She then sat on the chair without any strength. Her usual self resembled a cat ready to fight with its hair raised, but she currently looked completely powerless. \u2018She must have had no one to turn to if she contacted me\u2026\u2019 For an instant, the absurd thought crossed my mind, but I erased it immediately. I shook my head as if to shake away my delusion and asked her,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Miss Shuna? Is she also in her house?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShuna\u2019s the princess of a small kingdom\u2026 she doesn\u2019t have the money. She\u2019s sleeping here for now, but\u2026 because she isn\u2019t a family member, I can\u2019t register her. If her vitality hits zero in the dungeon\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll go back to the Luka continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUt\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When I said that, Ludia bit her lips. She then covered her face with her hands, and a hot sigh came out between them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Hero died\u2026 W-What do I do? The continent\u2019s hope has disappeared. Although the Demon Lord got weakened, it won\u2019t stay weak forever. What about Shina? What about father and mother? Our empire\u2019s people\u2026? They\u2019re only looking at me\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the other explorers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyone who survived ran away. The Hero was the strongest, but he died. The Demon Lord\u2019s army will finish getting ready soon and attack. Now is the only time to save Shina\u2026 but I can\u2019t do it\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, calm down a little\u2026! Just because the Hero died, it doesn\u2019t mean your world is ending.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ending, Shin\u2026 If you die, your world will end too.\u201d</p><br/><p>At her words, I became unable to breathe for an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the exact reason, but that\u2019s what everyone says\u2026 That if the Hero dies, his world will fall to ruin without doubt\u2026 The Hero is the world itself. He is its center and core. As long as the Hero is alive, the world can continue to endure, but it\u2019s over when he dies. There\u2019s no chance of survival. My continent will no longer\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t hear Ludia\u2019s words very well. The world will end if the hero dies? It sounded like a cruel joke. Can\u2019t there be another Hero? Can\u2019t someone else accept his legacy? Is that why the monsters targeted the Hero? To destroy the world?</p><br/><p>Then if I die, Earth will end?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why Heroes bear such heavy weights\u2026 That\u2019s why they\u2019re strong\u2026 That\u2019s why you\u2019re so charming\u2026! Because you need to attract others to you in order to protect yourself\u2026 in order to protect the world\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I finally understood why my charm stat increased on its own. I didn\u2019t want to know, but it was already too late.</p><br/><p>I felt like something heavy was pressing down on my shoulders. Was I possessed by a ghost? I tried to make a joke, but it wasn\u2019t funny at all.</p><br/><p>I began to realize. The daily life Loretta wanted was getting farther away. I was taken aback by the absurdity, and the strength in my body disappeared. I wanted to flop down onto the ground, but I couldn\u2019t because of Ludia, who seemed to lack even more energy. I gritted my teeth and put strength into my body. Ludia was looking at me. She was asking me.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould I go back? Shin, tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 can\u2019t be the one to tell you. What do you want to do, Ludia?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t ask me such a cruel question. I really don\u2019t know\u2026 No, in truth, I want to run away\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t much I could do to calm down Ludia in her state of panic. However, because the appearance of lifeless dungeon explorers I\u2019ve been seeing overlapped with the current Ludia, it was hard for me to leave her alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, I can\u2019t give you an answer\u2026 but I don\u2019t want to see you die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo\u2026 you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia looked at me with a surprised expression. I nodded my head seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. You\u2019re a precious friend, so it\u2019s only normal that I\u2019d worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia\u2019s face turned red. Because of the state of her emotions, I wasn\u2019t sure how much it changed.</p><br/><p>I continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I know words can\u2019t match actions. Ludia, think carefully. Take the entire day if you need to, and act on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want me to stay?\u201d</p><br/><p>She seemed to be deep in thought, then mumbled with her mouth closed.</p><br/><p>\u201cStay for one night\u2026 no, two hours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCloser.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I approached her, Ludia grabbed onto my sleeve without a word. I pulled a chair and sat down next to her. I was also confused. I needed time to organize my thoughts.</p><br/><p>Ludia seemed to have relaxed after holding onto my sleeve, as she fell asleep with her head down. Her sleeping appearance was extremely lovely, but it didn\u2019t enter my eyes.</p><br/><p>I contemplated. About me, about the Hero, and about Earth. Starting from how I became the Hero to if the world would really end when the Hero died. I really pondered until my head felt like it would explode. After two hours, I barely managed to arrive at a conclusion. The answer was quite simple.</p><br/><p>I wouldn\u2019t care.</p><br/><p>I never asked anyone to let me be the Hero. I\u2019d just been called Hero before I noticed. People might say, \u2018you\u2019re only strong because you\u2019re the Hero!\u2019 But to me, it was a load of bull. Plus, just because I was told that my world would end on the event of my death, it didn\u2019t mean that I needed to act any differently.</p><br/><p>The world will end if I die? What, should I go hide somewhere? Should I just climb the dungeon without risking myself in Event Raids or Field Dungeons? No, not even over my dead body.</p><br/><p>I will do what I want, and no one will stop me. I won\u2019t let them. I decided how to live my life. I won\u2019t waver because of some nonsense like the world ending if I die. Even if that were true, the world was over for me once I died anyway. Ah, but I still needed to ensure Yua and mother\u2019s safety. As for father, he would be fine on his own!</p><br/><p>I had worried for nothing. Now that I thought about it, it was simple. In fact, I felt much better now that I had organized my thoughts, and I felt like I knew what to do from now.</p><br/><p>First, break through the 48th floor! Then, find out if there\u2019s anything I can do for Shina. I had a strong feeling that there was something I could do. Was this also the Hero\u2019s ability? Shit, no, I needed to stop thinking about Heroes!</p><br/><p>When I got up, Ludia opened her eyes, still half-closed.</p><br/><p>She looked at me and slowly asked, \u201cAre you leaving? Don\u2019t\u2026 leave me alone\u2026 Stay with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have Miss Shuna, Ludia. You\u2019re not alone. If you call me later, I\u2019ll come running for you. But for now, there\u2019s something I need to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>I imbued mana into my bracelet and equipped my armor. In front of Ludia, whose eyes opened wide, I closed the visor of my helmet and grinned. Though, she wouldn\u2019t be able to see it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere has to be a way I can help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Don\u2019t. You can\u2019t. You need to protect your own world. Don\u2019t involve yourself with other worlds, stupid!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand. It\u2019s not just to help you. Shina\u2019s also my friend, and I don\u2019t like seeing you the way you are. I hate seeing people so helpless. So I\u2019ll find a way to help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing this to get you to help me! What I want is something else! It was just your warmth! I don\u2019t want to drag you to hell because of me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. I also know\u2026 that people that aren\u2019t seeking help from others are the ones who want help most desperately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! You\u2019re wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Because she thought it was a hopeless situation, she couldn\u2019t so unashamedly reach out for help. However, no matter how hopeless the situation seemed, it might actually be solved easily and simply with the help of others.</p><br/><p>That had to be why they existed. I ignored Ludia\u2019s shouts and left her house. I thought to myself\u2026</p><br/><p>To look into Dimensional Mercenaries.</p><br/><p>After breaking through the 48th floor, I arrived at the Floor Shop. Was she surprised that I arrived earlier than she expected? While Loretta was frozen for a moment, I asked what I need to. It was about Dimensional Mercenaries.</p><br/><p>Loretta became silent at my question. Then, she asked me with a quiet voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim now somewhat knows what kind of an existence the Hero is, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, to a certain extent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, you\u2019re trying to become a Dimensional Mercenary, whose lives can\u2019t be guaranteed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe possibility that you\u2019ll die in a dimension other than your own\u2026 you\u2019ve considered it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I won\u2019t die, Loretta. So I haven\u2019t considered it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally\u2026 Nobody can stop you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta smiled at my words, then pinched my cheek with a sulking expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t forgive you if you die. I\u2019ll follow you to the ends of hell and bother you, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, I won\u2019t die. So hurry up and tell me about Dimensional Mercenaries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are many requirements to become a Dimensional Mercenary. First, level. Explorers that aren\u2019t Gold ranked, or level 51, do not have the qualification to become a Dimensional Mercenary. Second, magic. You need the \u2018Dimensional Travel\u2019 magic, which serves as the basis of a Dimensional Mercenary, and the \u2018Return\u2019 magic, which acts as the safety device to let Dimensional Mercenaries return to their home in any situation. Without any of these magic, you cannot become a Dimensional Mercenary. Third, league. Without having made at least 10 achievements and being at least the incarnation of a god, you cannot become a Dimensional Mercenary. However, Shin-nim has Hermes\u2019 true name and have made many achievements, so you already passed this requirement.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll become Gold ranked soon, so all I need is the Dimensional Travel magic.\u201d</p><br/><p>She grinned and shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are a few ways you can obtain the Dimensional Travel magic\u2026 but there is one simplest, yet most difficult, method. It\u2019s to defeat the 50th Floor Master alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is that the most difficult? That seems to be the easiest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim is the only one who would think that.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Loretta\u2019s brusque words, I replied with a vague smile. However, my heart was burning. Dimensional Mercenary! I was only a step away from becoming one! Feeling like fate was guiding me\u2026 I felt dirty. However, there was no choice for now. I\u2019d make use of anything I could!</p><br/><p>First would the 50th floor. The day I would become First Dungeon\u2019s Gold rank explorer was approaching.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Whew, we\u2019re going back to battles. Look forward to the 50th Floor Master next chapter!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

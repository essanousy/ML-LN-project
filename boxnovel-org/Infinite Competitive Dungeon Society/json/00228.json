Overlord (8)</p><br/><p>The temperature rose as we got closer to the volcano, and the earth melted from the unnaturally high temperature. As Ina, Hwaya, and I were fine as we had methods to deal with heat, Ye-Eun seemed to be holding on barely with just her monstrous willpower, and Daisy didn\u2019t seem to be doing any better.</p><br/><p>\u201cHot\u2026 Clothes off\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Daisy. You\u2019ll hurt my eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, rude man. My body, pretty decent.\u201d</p><br/><p>No, I meant that Hwaya would poke my eyes\u2026 But Hwaya would really poke my eyes out if I said that, so I stayed silent. Hwaya spoke out in my place.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaisy, the reason I like you is that we don\u2019t growl at each other about Shin. Don\u2019t try to make an enemy out of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026? Not sure, what you mean.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the surrounding heat became more intense, and an ominous smoke was spewing out of the volcano.</p><br/><p>[Hero, it\u2019s him. The king is inside the volcanic crater.]</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it. Guys, it\u2019s time. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re easing your tension, but that\u2019s enough joking around.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, I\u2019m not joking. This is more important than this so-called Lava King.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m sorry, but us surviving is much more important to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yeah\u2026 I got it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya\u2019s face reddened and she turned away. I might have been a bit harsh, but I didn\u2019t regret it.</p><br/><p>We were getting closer to the crater. The atmospheric mana vibrated, the earth tremored, and an overwhelming pressure descended on us. I stuck out my tongue and licked my lips. Even though I knew my life was at risk, my heart trembled in excitement as it always does before fighting a powerful opponent. Exhilaration dominated over fear. Even I thought I was a bit perverted.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I took a slow breath and calmed myself. Although I asked Ye-Eun to call Duca to fight, I planned on fighting the Lava King without the help of Peruta.</p><br/><p>If I used Deific Manifestation and couldn\u2019t defeat the Lava King, I would be leaving myself open to attack. More importantly, Peruta couldn\u2019t use my class-specific skills and skills within the Collector\u2019s Pocket Watch. Unless Peruta came in his real body, he was far weaker than me when I used Overlord. That was how much I\u2019d grown.</p><br/><p>Though, that also meant that I was much weaker without class-specific skills and the pocket watch\u2019s skills.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy, I can\u2019t use Deific Manifestation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? Did it fail?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. So I can\u2019t use it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Ina\u2019s strong even without it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn!\u201d</p><br/><p>The others also took out their weapons and raised their spirits as they checked their health and mana. The moment we arrived at the mouth of the volcano, Lotte suddenly shouted.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s erupting!]</p><br/><p>Lotte immediately turned her body and flew away. At the same time, a colossal heatwave swept over us. I poured mana into my eyes to withstand the light and heat, and when I checked the surroundings, a giant tree of lava was sprouting up. Dear god\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t ordinary lava. It\u2019s an overwhelming lump of mana\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuhahaha! Why have you come all this way? You have killed all of my subordinates. You are the first to have ever done so! Kuhahaha!]</p><br/><p>A hearty laugh of a man rang out. Shockingly, the lava that erupted as if to cover the skies didn\u2019t fall and were gathering in one point. Then, easily absorbing all of its mana, he appeared.</p><br/><p>Elegant red scales covered his giant body, and two crooked horns rose above his head. He had yellow reptilian eyes, a long and thick tail, and a pair of bat-like wings that stretched out towards the sky.</p><br/><p>Simply put, he was a dragon, a giant dragon that easily reached 150 meters in length.</p><br/><p>[The \u2018Lava King\u2019 Grand Raid commences! You met one of the enemies aiming for the world\u2019s power! The dungeon\u2019s power is not fully effective against a world's enemy. The Grand Raid system exists to give what little support it can to explorers who are fighting against the world's enemies. The Lord\u2019s blessing converges on your party. As a result, the enemy can only ignore up to 30% of your party members\u2019 skills and levels!]</p><br/><p>[Absolute Soul nullifies a part of the enemy\u2019s power. Your skills and levels will be 90% effective against the enemy!]</p><br/><p>[Remember that you will not be able to bring out your items\u2019 and skills\u2019 full power. We wish you luck! You will receive a huge reward if you defeat the Lava King!]</p><br/><p>[Why have you come to disturb my sleep? Until \u2018he\u2019 arrives, I planned to simply sleep, but you lot have ruined it. Now there are no more monsters to serve as materials for my army, so now I\u2019ll have to relocate too.]</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll make it so that you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as I felt his overwhelming existence, I smiled with effort and retorted. Inside my head, I was busy flicking the abacus beads and calculating his league. He seemed to be level 90 at the very least, and he could even ignore everyone\u2019s skills and levels. Isn\u2019t that too much!? I was thankful that I had learned Absolute Soul.</p><br/><p>However, his scale armor and the endless pit of mana in his body could only make me sigh. He seemed to have reached the limit in both physical and magical defense. It was likely\u2026 that he possessed the so-called EX ranked power, or one that was only a step below it.</p><br/><p>[Mm, as expected of a Hero. You can carry such a large strength in that tiny human body. Tsk, really, killing you would be such a waste. If only you weren\u2019t a Hero, I would have taken you in as my subordinate.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but I have no plans to bathe in lava.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuhaha! I like your character too! Truly a waste!]</p><br/><p>His giant eyes were solely focused on me as if the others weren\u2019t worthy of even talking to him. At that moment\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cKana, might melt\u2026 I\u2019ll use Deific Manifestation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDeific Manifestation!\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy and Ye-Eun both used Deific Manifestation. Ye-Eun\u2019s master, Duca, was the first to descend. The moment she opened her eyes, she saw the giant dragon and screamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoa, what\u2019s this!? It\u2019s so strong! Is this the world\u2019s enemy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s the one right under him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Dear! We meet again. We must be fated!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya silently ignited a fireball above her palm. Someone else then smacked Duca\u2019s head. Surprisingly, it was Daisy!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou! Duca! To think I have to see you even after death, I\u2019m appalled.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Hecate!? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy disciple called me. Focus on that giant turd, would you!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy\u2019s master and Duca knew each other!? I wasn\u2019t the only one shocked. The Lava King also seemed shocked.</p><br/><p>[You two are\u2026 gods! I can smell the stench of gods!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you noticed us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy\u2019s master, Hecate, snorted as she talked back to the Lava King. Then, she approached me and whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cChild, you have Zeus\u2019 power. Can you use it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No, not yet\u2026 Do you know Zeus?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, how unfortunate. Also, how could I not know Zeus? I\u2019m Hecate after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>I had no clue what she meant . I told myself to look into it later.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must have heard from Daisy, but we have to defeat him! Please help us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Duca, follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to play with Dear a bit more\u2026 Chet.\u201d</p><br/><p>With Hecate\u2019s power, undead monsters began to appear in the air. Although they were monsters Daisy normally controlled, they seemed to be blessed with a special power. Duca also seemed to have received Hecate\u2019s power as she floated in the air while grumbling.</p><br/><p>[Kuku, this is getting exciting! I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be hiding this much power! Kuhaha! Kuhahha\u2026 Die!]</p><br/><p>This sly bastard! The Lava King suddenly sent a fireball towards us in the middle of laughing. Because of its incredible speed, I was about to use Divine Speed, but Lotte quickly turned around with a sneer and dodged it. Meanwhile, Hwaya and Ina both flew up into the air.</p><br/><p>However, what Hwaya did as she flew up shocked me. The flames she shot out from her hands was gently enveloping the flames shot out by the Lava King. She could receive his flames head on! Hwaya spoke as she made a provocative smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour flames sure are tasty.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hm? A human? A human that can wield flames so freely\u2026 Who are you? Truly an interesting bunch! Kuhaha!]</p><br/><p>He shot out more flames. This time, the flames didn\u2019t just come from him. The volcano also erupted and spewed out a lava that was filled with mana. It then broke into dozens and rained down on us.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, I can\u2019t block them all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the ones coming my way!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>The moment the words left my mouth, Lotte breathed out golden flames from mouth. Her flames clashed with eight streams of flames flying towards us before swallowing them and disappearing.</p><br/><p>What the others did weren\u2019t so different. Ina\u2019s ice froze the lava, and Duca easily evaded the attacks coming her way. As for Hecate, she swung the whip in her hand, and a blue barrier appeared around her and the elite squadron of undead monster, protecting them.</p><br/><p>[Good, good! It would be boring if it was so easy! Kuhaha!]</p><br/><p>The Lava King only laughed even though his attacks were blocked. It could only mean that he hadn\u2019t used his full strength. Immediately afterwards, the surrounding temperature shot up once more to the point that average ability users would be burned to death just by being in this space.</p><br/><p>[But to pick a fight with me with just this much strength, truly foolish!]</p><br/><p>Giant fireballs appeared in the air. Their pure and oppressive essence of fire blazed as they danced. Ina frowned and held her arms out, creating numerous crystals of ice. However, even Ina couldn\u2019t completely cancel out the fireballs.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too hot. I hate sweating.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuhaha! A little kid with such an overwhelming magic power! It seems I might have come knocking on death\u2019s door! Kuhahahaha, life should always be blazing! In front of this king, set your lives ablaze!]</p><br/><p>[Foolish brute, you\u2019re destined to burn yourself to death!]</p><br/><p>Although the voice was undoubtedly Daisy\u2019s, Hecate\u2019s voice gave it a mystical silvery feeling. Hecate swung her whip, and the undead monsters charged towards the flame dragon. They all dodged the oncoming fireballs as they each attacked the flame dragon.</p><br/><p>[Kuhaha! Dead beings injuring this Lava King, truly interesting!]</p><br/><p>The Lava King exploded with an enormous amount of mana. Even with protective barriers surrounding them, half of the undead monsters were instantly annihilated. Hecate made an annoyed growl and swung her whip, strengthened the undead monsters again. However, the Lava King seemed to have only just begun. He flapped his wings once and the undead monsters were all pushed back. Then, he immediately charged towards us.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll annihilate everything! You will pay the price for looking down on me! Kuhaha!]</p><br/><p>\u201cAs if!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duca shouted and instantly disappeared from my sight. Immediately afterwards, the Lava King stopped charging. Shockingly, a streak of blood shot out from his neck. Duca had successfully injured him!</p><br/><p>\u201cKu, this guy is too big! It feels like I only poured a bucket of water in a sandy beach!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuhuhu, it\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve felt pain!]</p><br/><p>His howl shook the earth and raised the surrounding temperature once more. I was dumbfounded. With just his existence and his overwhelming mana, he was trying to steam us to death!</p><br/><p>[This is what is known as \u2018absolute\u2019! Absolute Fire!]</p><br/><p>The volcano erupted once again. Shockingly, he jumped into the lava, and when he reemerged, the wound on his neck was gone.</p><br/><p>[Tiny human, how will you extinguish an inextinguishable flame? As long as fire exists in this world, I will never die! That is why I, Lava King, reign as a king!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too noisy, you damned lizard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya shouted and reached out with her hands. A part of the lava being absorbed by the Lava King changed direction and flowed into Hwaya. She threw her Cyclops Lord\u2019s Golden Eye into the air and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cEit, everyone get ready to attack! Golden Pupils, curse him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh? Cyclops Lord\u2019s Golden Eye had another effect? While I stood shocked, the Golden Eye fiercely rotated, seemingly compressing its power. Then, in an instant, it shot out a beam of light toward the flame dragon. The result could only be described as shocking. When the Lava King was hit by the golden laser, the Golden Eye that shattered!</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaa! That one hurt quite a lot! Impressive, impressive!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI lost an Epic grade item, so it better have! What are you all doing!? Attack him!\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know how big of an attack that was, but since it could deal that much pain to the Lava King who could ignore a portion of items\u2019 effects, it was understandable that the Golden Eye shattered. I turned my eyes away from Hwaya who seemed to be on the verge of tears and tightened the grip on my spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cLotte, sorry, we\u2019ll have to fight separately.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I can\u2019t injure him alone. Hero should do what Hero needs to do.]</p><br/><p>Lotte\u2019s fierce wingbeat smashed away the heatwave. I gave her a grin and jumped off her back. The Lava King then shouted.</p><br/><p>[Oh? You\u2019re fighting me yourself? Outstanding! Truly a blaze!]</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but I\u2019m no blaze!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Then what are you!? Kuhaha!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m an Overlord!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>In that instant, I became a giant covered in black armor.</p><br/><p>[You used Overlord! While the skill is active, your HP and MP triples, and all stats double! When attacking the enemy, you have 10% chance to afflict a random highest rank status effect. When attacked by an enemy, you have 20% chance to afflict a random highest rank status effect.]</p><br/><p>Through my body, the power of an absolute destroyer had descended on Earth!</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>It will come up again, but gods from Earth\u2019s mythology can share the same origin as other worlds\u2019 gods. In other words, different named gods can refer to the same god! Because Daisy\u2019s master appeared on Earth, she assumed the name of Hecate. If she appeared in a different world\u2026 Huhu.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

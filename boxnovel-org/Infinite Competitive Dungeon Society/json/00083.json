Under the Two Moons (6)</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaaaaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika! Ruyue!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the succubus screamed crazily, I regained my consciousness and yelled out Peika and Ruyue\u2019s names. My two elementals immediately made their appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cKiaaaaaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Master!]</p><br/><p>[Are you okay? Are you okay?]</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore I become weird again, pull out her other eye!\u201d</p><br/><p>Taking my eyes off the succubus, I yelled at the top of my lungs. Although I also needed to request help from the other dungeon explorers, as I didn\u2019t know if they would come immediately and couldn\u2019t think straight from the fear of being completely subordinate to one being, I could only yell out my simple command. I could have also called Peruta using Deific Manifestation, but I had forgotten about my reliable master from the extreme fear I felt.</p><br/><p>Peika and Ruyue seemed to have noticed how desperate I was as they flew toward the succubus without even replying. I couldn\u2019t see it. I didn\u2019t see it.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaaak! You bitch, I\u2019ll kill you! Bloody Raven Wing! Flame Cutter!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Frozen Arrow!]</p><br/><p>[Thunder Spear!]</p><br/><p>Things exploded and ravaged through the room. Although shards flew at me, as they were only remnant pieces of the attacks, they could not damage me by much. The students being controlled by the succubus could have been injured, but I wasn\u2019t in a position to worry about them.</p><br/><p>I then started to think about what had just happened. When I was about to give up my life to the succubus, when I stood there without being able to do anything, I could still vividly recall the sense of helplessness.</p><br/><p>But in that situation where my vital energy was about to be taken away, the succubus\u2019 eye was ripped out. However, all the other students should have been under succubus\u2019 control, and because they were ordinary people, they could not have done anything, even if they weren\u2019t under her control.</p><br/><p>Before the succubus\u2019 eye was ripped out, Su Ye-Eun had taken off her hoody. It meant she had withstood the succubus\u2019 charm longer than me. Not to mention, Su Ye-Eun wasn\u2019t next to me right now. In that case, there was only one answer.</p><br/><p>The one who ripped out succubus\u2019 eye was Su Ye-Eun.</p><br/><p>How!? She should have had monsterphobia, and even if she didn\u2019t, how did she rip out the eye of a raid boss!? Of course, the answer was simple. Su Ye-Eun didn\u2019t have monsterphobia and instead had a strong ability that allowed her to rip out the eye of a B-rank raid boss. Her stealth ability didn\u2019t just hide her appearance, it hid her ability as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone rise! Kill these damned things!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the succubus\u2019 shrill voice, I snapped out of my thoughts and raised my head. The students that were watching blankly on the ground began to rise.</p><br/><p>Shit. In this place where lightning, fire, and ice flew around, their lives would be in danger just by getting up! No matter how desperate the situation was, I couldn\u2019t just stand and watch students throw themselves into a pit of fire. But what could I do? After a bit of thought, I remembered I had a way to stop them.</p><br/><p>\u201cKiaaaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You used Vengeful Spirit\u2019s Wail. All enemies within its area become confused and feared!]</p><br/><p>\u201cUeeeeek.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see in front of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to complete Master\u2019s orders.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHiik, don\u2019t come here! Stop!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although they were being controlled by the succubus, they still had the physical abilities of ordinary students. After being affected by Vengeful Spirit\u2019s Wail, they fought each other or rolled on the ground. One by one, I hurriedly picked them up and threw them out into the hallway. I could smell blood rising from the hallway. She really killed so many people!</p><br/><p>Damn it, had no one contacted Guardian yet? Now that I thought about it, there wasn\u2019t anyone to contact them! This damned succubus must have charmed people the moment she sneaked into the college. Since this MT was started by her, it was likely the pension\u2019s security cameras weren\u2019t working either.</p><br/><p>Past the open door, a thundering sound rang out. A chill ran down my back. This woman was calling her minions! To use the dungeon explorer communication channel that I had been forgetting about, I put my hand on my mouth. At that moment\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaak! My eyes, my eyes!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Master, that strange woman pulled out both her eyes! Her charming power disappeared!]</p><br/><p>[That woman is scary. Scary.]</p><br/><p>Peika and Ruyue flew back toward me. Her charming power disappeared? Recalling the sense of helplessness I felt, I turned around carefully. There, I saw Su Ye-Eun fully revealing her pretty face and fluttering black hair, and attacking the Blood Succubus. She disappeared and reappeared here and there, while her hands were dyed red from the Blood Succubus\u2019 blood.</p><br/><p>Su Ye-Eun\u2019s eyes glowed red, unlike normal. Using stealth, she hid herself from the succubus, then attacked with her fingernails when the succubus made an opening. Her fingernails clearly had mana imbued into them, giving them a red aura. Although slightly barbaric, she was flashy and strong.</p><br/><p>As for the Blood Succubus, even as blood dripped down from her eye sockets, she managed to detect Su Ye-Eun\u2019s location and threw magic at her. As expected of a raid boss monster! The walls were already destroyed and the windows were all shattered. If things got worse, the entire building could collapse.</p><br/><p>After taking Succubus\u2019 attacks, Su Ye-Eun was bleeding here and there. Although her attack power was strong, her defense was low. At this rate, they would both kill each other. Since I knew I no longer had to worry about Blood Succubus\u2019 charm, I couldn\u2019t just stand here and watch Su Ye-Eun get beaten.</p><br/><p>I took out Black Earthen Spear from my inventory. Although I considered using Deific Manifestation for a moment, I threw the thought out soon. What was I afraid of? I had to get revenge with my own hands. I shouldn\u2019t back away, especially after knowing I was strong enough!</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Got it!]</p><br/><p>Without having to say much, Peika went into my spear. Possibly because she felt the fluctuation of energy, the Blood Succubus, who was still dripping blood from her two eye sockets, looked at me. It was truly a sight of horror.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Ye-Eun. You can rest now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUt!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Ye-Eun was startled by my voice, then obediently fell back. I was worried about her mental state from her sudden change, but it seemed she was okay. At the same time Su Ye-Eun fell back, I charged at the Blood Succubus.</p><br/><p>\u201cYouuuuu!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Blood Succubus hesitated about who to attack between me and Su Ye-Eun, but in the end, she chose the one who was charging at her, me. Dozens of fireballs appeared in the air and flew toward me. Ruyue snorted.</p><br/><p>[Ice Wall!]</p><br/><p>Although they were both B-rank raid bosses, there was a clear difference between the 20-man raid Blood Succubus and the 500-man raid Giant Iron Boar. Given ample amount of mana, Ruyue\u2019s ice wall stood strong even after receiving all of the Blood Succubus\u2019 attacks.</p><br/><p>In truth, the succubus without her charm ability was like a tiger without its claws. There was nothing to be afraid of.</p><br/><p>I used Divine Speed. In the blink of an eye, I was in front of the succubus. Swinging my spear, I first cut off one side of the succubus\u2019 wings. It was because her wings were exuding an aura of charm. Although she wasn\u2019t strong enough to charm me without her eyes, there was no need to leave behind a potential source of danger.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaak! W-Wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>The succubus finally seemed to have noticed my strength. A dumb monster would have attacked without understanding the difference in strength and died, but the Blood Succubus, who was having a life or death battle with Su Ye-Eun just a moment ago, shrunk back like the mouse in front of a cat.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, wait, let me live. Please. I, I\u2019ll give you my loyalty. I\u2019m just a poor succubus. That woman is the one who bullied me. If you save me from her, I can even give you my body\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I interrupted her. I didn\u2019t want to waste any more time by listening to her. Who knew if she\u2019d recover during that time and pull a fast one on me?</p><br/><p>\u201cI just wanted to live! I\u2019ll be loyal to you, so please, don\u2019t kill me. I won\u2019t kill that woman either! I was only a little excited because I appeared in a world like this. I, I\u2019ll apologize! My body will be quite useful!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour body, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yes! Once my eyes recover, I\u2019ll serve you with a beauty that no man can resist. I will do anything you want, so please let me live! I will be your slave!\u201d</p><br/><p>A succubus that can take the form of a beauty. What men wouldn\u2019t be tempted by being able to have such a woman? Her offer was indeed tempting and she chose her words well.</p><br/><p>However, she chose the wrong opponent.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen who\u2019s going to pay for all those that died?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPay? What do you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBye.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWai\u2014\u201c</p><br/><p>Without a shred of hesitation, I severed the succubus\u2019 head. The Black Earthen Spear, which I had poured ample amount of mana into while waiting, had easily sliced through her neck. I caught the succubus\u2019 head, which had flown into the air. Now that she was dead, she really wasn\u2019t much. I became frustrated, realizing I could have died from being charmed by her so easily. I would have to reflect on this time and time again.</p><br/><p>At the same time the succubus lost her life, the students that were rolling the floor stopped moving. They were no longer in her control and had fainted.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, a fanfare rang out.</p><br/><p>[Event Raid Complete! With just one member, you succeeded in the Event Raid! This great achievement increases the rewards by an enormous amount! Your vastly superior rank to the raid boss decreases the rewards by an enormous amount!]</p><br/><p>[You completed an Event Raid and obtained 1 stat point as reward.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained Blood Succubus\u2019 Earrings.]</p><br/><p>Leaving the messages behind for later, I turned around and looked at Su Ye-Eun. She was looking at me blankly, then realizing that I was staring at her, she snapped out of her daze. She held up her hands and saw the blood on them. Her lips and hands began to shake, which then spread to the rest of her body. It was the symptom that made me suspect she had monsterphobia.</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No, Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-It\u2019s not me. I-It\u2019s not, s-so don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfraid\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing that, I began to understand the real reason she trembled in front of monsters.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t afraid of monsters. She was afraid of herself, who became exceedingly cruel when fighting monsters, and she was afraid of others who became scared after watching her.</p><br/><p>I retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean afraid? You were really cool. Plus, I\u2019m the one who sent her head flying. Why would I be afraid of you for something like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>I was a bit sorry since my words might not have been the most comforting.</p><br/><p>However, they seemed to have worked as Su Ye-Eun\u2019s shaking became weaker. Her eyes, which still glowed red, grew bigger.</p><br/><p>\u201cC-Cool? I wasn\u2019t scary?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, extremely cool, like a female warrior. Ah, I\u2019d still recommend you use a weapon though\u2026 but you were a lot of cooler than when you shook in front of a monster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 R-Really? I was cool?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded my head without hesitation. Since I was saying what I honestly felt, there was no reason to hold back. Su Ye-Eun had saved me when I was about to die. If I were a girl, I would have fallen for her valiant appearance.</p><br/><p>Su Ye-Eun started crying. Without showing any signs of doing so, she sobbed abruptly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHic, hic\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, hey, what, why, did I do something wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHic, uwaaaaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>She ran to my embrace and cried her heart out. It seemed I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. In fact, it was probably the opposite.</p><br/><p>I would be glad if she could let off some of the burden in her heart, but I was still flustered, as I could do nothing to stop her from crying. Other students in the building would soon realize what had happened. If we wanted to avoid being found out, we would have to escape soon\u2026</p><br/><p>There was no other choice. I first called out to Peika and gave her a special order and ample mana. After Peika got out of the room, I put my hand on Su Ye-Eun\u2019s shoulder and comforted her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere, there, Su Ye-Eun. Don\u2019t cry. I don\u2019t know what happened in the past, but let\u2019s first wash ourselves off and get rid of the damn evidence, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHic, you called me intimately before as just Ye-Eun\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>British, Lukan, or Korean, why did they care so much about how their names were called!?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Ye-Eun. No more crying. Let\u2019s clean up and go rest, okay? I\u2019ll hear you out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHic, hic, Ueeeeeeeh!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed it would take a while before she would stop crying. I patted Su Ye-Eun\u2026 Ye-Eun, who was crying in my embrace and looked up at the night sky through the broken windows. The two moons were unusually bright tonight.</p><br/><p>Almost as if to signify that the world had changed.</p><br/><p>Almost as if to say there was still time before the sun would rise.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

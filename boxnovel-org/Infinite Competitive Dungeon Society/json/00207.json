The Qualification of an Explorer (4)</p><br/><p>With Beyond\u2019s 14th floor in front of me, I left the dungeon and joined Hwaya to greet Ilayda Van and Laz Michel. Though we gained much attention, neither Hwaya nor me cared much for it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI bought a building in Seoul to use as our guild house.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea. We can\u2019t only meet at the Residential Area after all. By the way, where\u2019s Ina?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the dungeon. Kids have to go out and play after eating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMakes sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>51st floor was where giant monsters appeared, and they were nowhere close enough to threatening Ina. I became a bit sad, thinking my daughter might surpass me, but that was my fate as a Beyond explorer. No, perhaps, Ina might enter Beyond too! With her skills, she could certainly get a god\u2019s true name and meet the requirements!</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re overflowing with money anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unlike the houses we saw on our way here, in front of us was a huge and modern mansion. It was as if someone had bought the nearby land, tore down the old buildings, and built a new one. Although we were in a quiet residential area, the center of traffic was only 10 minutes away. A land like this must have cost an astronomical\u2026 No, let\u2019s stop there.</p><br/><p>The building seemed to be made from Poison Wax Bee\u2019s saliva and Blue Stone Golem\u2019s mana-rich body parts. With these materials, ordinary explosions and monster attacks wasn\u2019t able to shake the building in the slightest. It also had a garden. While it wasn\u2019t big compared to the size of the building, it was still big enough for Ina to run around and play.</p><br/><p>When I was looking at the entrance to the mansion with a stupefied expression, Hwaya muttered with a hint of playfulness.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of my dowry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding, geez.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t laugh at your jokes lately!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go in.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were already guests in the mansion. Leon, Sumire, Sophie, Ren, Lebuik, and other members of Revival were all present. It wasn\u2019t that strange since we had our press conference only yesterday and no one had a reason to leave Korea. After greeting them, I finally realized.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I see. Are we having a welcoming party for the new members? That\u2019s why everyone\u2019s here, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep. I was about to tell you about it, but you just rushed into the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>We could have done it at our guild house in the dungeon, so why on Earth? Seeing my curious gaze, Hwaya responded with a grin.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s to show off a bit. We\u2019re currently in the world\u2019s center of attention, so we should emphasize us all being together in one place. Marianne\u2019s Garden is nice, but people won\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing or where we are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Today is a day to celebrate the guild\u2019s expansion, but showing off our appearance might be just as important.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed they weren\u2019t the only ones here. As proof, Elfa flew into my embrace. Yua then popped out from behind her and quickly dragged her back. From how swiftly she moved, I could tell how much Yua grew. My sister was growing unbeknownst to me\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cLaz Michel and Ilayda Van are going to arrive soon. Stop making that stupid face and get ready to greet out guests.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><br/><p>While other members were busy preparing for the welcoming party, Father and Walker were drinking without helping out. I could see Yua chastising him even from where I was standing. Oh, it seemed Leon had joined them too. Right, Leon liked drinking too\u2026 Really, Ren was the only proper man here.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you want to join them, but stop fidgeting so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t a proper man either\u2026</p><br/><p>When we finished setting everything up including the two Soul Contracts and finished checking over everything, we heard knocks on the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, Unni, they\u2019re here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet them in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although we would order outsiders around for external affairs, we decided not to let outsiders handle any internal affairs. As such, Sumire was working as Hwaya\u2019s secretary. Although it was fine for now, as the number of explorers grew, we would have to deal with outside organizations. We needed to find a solution.</p><br/><p>In any case, Sumire opened the door, and two people came inside the reception room. The first one to enter was Turkey\u2019s healing ability user, Ilayda Van. She looked like she was the same age as Hwaya. At the same time, she was shorter than Hwaya, had smaller breasts, and had smaller eyes. Regardless, she had good style and looked like an innocent beauty.</p><br/><p>The second to enter was Laz Michel, who I had gotten somewhat used to seeing by now. When he saw me, he raised his hand and greeted me.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice to see you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been a day. Did you stay in Seoul?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep. The hotels here are quite nice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sumire then led them to their seats. This was our first time meeting Ilayda Van. Although I thought about greeting her to create a more relaxing atmosphere, I decided to leave that to Hwaya, who was sitting next to me with her eyes on fire.</p><br/><p>After greeting the two important guests, I handed them the contracts.</p><br/><p>\u201cI assume you already know about Revival\u2019s purpose. Joining Revival means that you will join us in our fight against the world\u2019s enemies. Is that fine with the both of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>In truth, when I first created Revival, I only thought about fighting them on my own. The only reason Revival was created was to give Ludia and Shuna a place to stay. But after the Event Dungeons we cleared together, I thought that it would be best for Earth\u2019s explorers to come together. That was when Revival was truly created.</p><br/><p>Now that we were together, we had but one goal. It was to fight the world\u2019s enemies. We knew the reason for the dungeon\u2019s existence and the reason for monsters appearing on Earth. We had to fight, not for anyone else, but for ourselves, our families, and our friends.</p><br/><p>As for Daisy, Ren, and Lebuik, they were cooperating with us to save their own worlds. It went without saying that they were just as desperate as the rest of Revival\u2019s members.</p><br/><p>Laz Michel nodded resolutely.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have come otherwise. I decided to put my trust in you, so it\u2019s only obvious that I lend you my strength. The world\u2019s enemy\u2026 Two of them, you said. If we have to fight such terrifying foes soon, we\u2019ll have to hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same for me. The Turkish government also agrees with me. If my ability can help protect our world, I would be happy to contribute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ilayda Van spoke with a clear voice as she stared straight into my eyes. Hwaya pushed her face next to mine and made a threatening hiss, but I pushed her face away slightly. Are you a snake?</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat. Read over the contract and sign it. Once that\u2019s done, you\u2019ll be a member of Revival.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Ina had become a Gold rank explorer recently, Ilayda Van and Laz Michel became First Dungeon explorers using her appointments.</p><br/><p>For the record, I had used my appointments for Ye-Eun and Ina, so I didn\u2019t have any left. As for Hwaya, she was still in the Second Dungeon. It would be a waste to make SS rankers into Second Dungeon explorers only. Leon? Leon would surely climb the Second Dungeon as if his life was on the line.</p><br/><p>Once the contract was signed and Ina appointed them as explorers, I reached my hand out to Laz Michel.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to working with you, Michel. With this, you won\u2019t be able to run away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to working with you too, Shin. You won\u2019t regret taking me in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, Hwaya was in charge of Ilayda Van. As they say, a monarch only walks on royal road. There was no need to take a single step in a place that was clearly filled with mines!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really feel real yet. I\u2019ll have to see this dungeon for myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel the same way. You said we should climb together, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was impossible to climb the dungeon with just a healing ability. As such, we told her to climb the dungeon with Michel. Of course, we didn\u2019t forget to tell Michel to fight Floor Masters on his own first before challenging them together. That way, he\u2019ll be able to get the solo kill titles.</p><br/><p>More importantly\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, wait. You guys must be dying to go, but wait a bit longer. We have a welcoming party planned for our new members, you see.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was understandable that they\u2019d want to jump right into the dungeon, but the party we planned painstakingly would then be ruined. Though, this party would most likely end up devolving to a drinking party\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI love parties!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, you\u2019re right. I see some faces I haven\u2019t seen before, so I guess I should take some time to get to know them.\u201d</p><br/><p>They seemed interested as well. I smiled and got up from my seat. Just when I was trying to act cool, Ina jumped on my back and ruined everything. Ilayda Van asked with widened eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you two know each other from before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my daughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaughter!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing me answer without any hesitation, Hwaya gave me a thumbs up. I understood from her reaction. Once I said I had a daughter, I could stop other women from making advances on me!</p><br/><p>\u201cOoh, melting tuna!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right, today\u2019s main dish was the melting tuna. Yua had already taken everything I had left of the giant melting tuna this morning. Tuna sashimi, tuna steak, tuna salad\u2026 Father, Walker, and Leon were already digging in impatiently, but there was nothing to worry about as we had enough to fill the bellies of 30 more people.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat, I love sashimi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you know what you\u2019re talking about. How old are you by the way?\u201d</p><br/><p>Father, who quickly grew close with whoever shared his love for food and alcohol, approached Laz Michel with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAjusshi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya suddenly shouted and snatched the soju bottle away from Father\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you start drinking when everyone isn\u2019t here yet! Your son is the main host too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You almost ruptured my eardrums, Daughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to act with poise in official settings? You can\u2019t make the guild master look bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, but this could hardly be called an official\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen were you planning on undermining Shin\u2019s authority in front of the new members? If you go too far, I\u2019ll tell Mrs. Kang!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Father instantly flinched back. After subjugating Father, Hwaya gave Walker and Leon a terrifying glare. Like a slug that had been peppered with salt, the two of them shrunk back. After that, Hwaya slammed the soju bottle down on the table and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe party starts now! Everyone, give the new members a round of applause!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnni is really energetic..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What a cool woman\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya instantly gained control over the somewhat disordered atmosphere and whipped it to shape. Everyone began clapping as to not provoke Hwaya\u2019s wrath. The claps then became more natural and everyone greeted Michel and Van. The two of them also greeted each of Revival\u2019s members.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know much about the dungeon. Please take good care of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try my best to be of help to everyone. It\u2019s a pleasure to work with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Shin, it\u2019s time for your opening address.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed Hwaya was a bit worked up. I put down Ina who was hanging by my neck, took up the soju bottle like a mic and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I said before, today we received two new members \u2013 Laz Michel, a body-reinforcement ability user, and the healer Ilayda Van, who will protect everyone along with Ludia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHealer\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia looked at Van with a slightly surprised expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we have our own reasons for joining Revival. However, we have the same purpose. That is to protect the place we belong.\u201d</p><br/><p>I put the soju bottle down on the table lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only the beginning. With what happened yesterday, more changes will come and we will be in the center of it all. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get busy almost to the point of death, but we\u2019ll surely gain something from it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Crown Prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like your honesty, Son.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy with being able to help Oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Trustworthy. Guild master, pass.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was enough of seriousness. I grinned and took up the soju bottle again. Everyone\u2019s gazes fell on the bottle.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen for today, let\u2019s drink! Forget welcoming party, let\u2019s drink when we can! Cheers!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoooooo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheers!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin! My preparations!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMommy, can I drink too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Ina!\u201d</p><br/><p>That day, no one could enter the dungeon sober.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

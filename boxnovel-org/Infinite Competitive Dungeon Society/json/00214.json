The Third Taming (5)</p><br/><p>Even as I shivered with uneasiness, I reached out to pick the reward which was just too good to pass up. Immediately, the back of my right hand heated up. I had somewhat expected it. After my legs, arms, and the back of my left hand, it was only proper that the next tattoo took the back of the right hand. It couldn\u2019t have been my eyes or lips. I wasn\u2019t worried at all!</p><br/><p>Feeling relieved that it wasn\u2019t a place that was hard to cover, I took off my gauntlet and checked my right hand. There, I saw a pair of spread bat wings entangled by two chains. While it was giving off a pink glow and a feeling of elegance, I was relieved that it was a much more wholesome symbol than I thought.</p><br/><p>However, I soon came to regret feeling so quickly relieved.</p><br/><p>[You obtained the Succubus Queen\u2019s Tattoo. Your charm and magic increases by 50. Against members of the opposite sex, the effect doubles. Once per day, you can double your mana.]</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, excellent.\u201d</p><br/><p>As someone who was experiencing the effect of the charm stat every day, the Succubus Queen\u2019s Tattoo was a great boon. Increasing both magic and charm by 50! Not to mention, the effect of charm doubled against members of the opposite sex. It was truly a monstrous effect.</p><br/><p>However, doubling my mana once per day\u2026 it was an amazing effect, but it was almost as if\u2026 No, it must be my imagination.[1. A Korean reader asked the author what this meant. The Author replied, \u201cTry substituting mana with some other unit\u2026\u201d]</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s head out then.\u201d</p><br/><p>After putting my gauntlet back up, I left the Floor Master room. Loretta, who was sitting by the Floor Shop with her chin on her hand, expression changed when she saw me leaving the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cShi, Shin-nim!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Is something wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Was there a tattoo on my body that I didn\u2019t notice? When I became flustered and asked, Loretta took out her double-edged axe and spoke with a flushed face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you suddenly become so much more charming!? What happened to you, Shin-nim!? If you tell me honestly, nothing bad will happen! I-I-It can\u2019t b-be, w-with that damned succubus, you\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The axe in her hand was bending with a creaking noise. T-That thing, I held it once and it was really heavy\u2026 Loretta could bend it with just her hands!? As I was scared for my life, I decided to explain everything thoroughly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I see. It was the tattoo\u2019s power.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking relieved, Loretta chucked the axe behind her. The dungeon floor caved in. Scary...</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought Shin-nim again\u2026 Huu, nevermind. That\u2019s good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like I\u2019m still lacking in practice. I thought I was controlling the charming aura I was emitting pretty well. Huu, it\u2019s going to take ages again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim\u2019s current charm stat entered a dangerous level. It should be fine for members of the same sex, but for the opposite sex, it will be a disaster. Just imagine every woman that meets Shin-nim\u2019s eyes falling in love with Shin-nim. Once it happens, that\u2019s it. There\u2019s no way to escape it. It\u2019s not a status effect, just that Shin-nim\u2019s charm had conquered their heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cruel\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What I had to deal with now was tiring enough!</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim\u2019s charm can even shake my heart now. You have to control it carefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn, so having higher stats wasn\u2019t always good! Of course, as magic had increased by 50 points in addition to charm, I needed time to train and digest the increase. I sighed. I then plopped down on the ground and began to circulate Peruta Circuit. Loretta placed her elbow back on the Floor Shop counter and watched me with a warm smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least for this time, I get to have Shin-nim for myself, huhuhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say something so corny. I can\u2019t focus.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYesss~. Huhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Afterwards, for 10 hours every day, I sat in front of the Floor Shop and trained in controlling my charm. Of course, I didn\u2019t forget to grind the Succubus Queen 10 times a day for the magic and charm increasing invigoration elixir it dropped. Although it may seem like a vain effort, I couldn\u2019t sit idly either.</p><br/><p>As I had to avoid seeing those of the opposite sex as much as possible, the only person I saw from Revival daily was Ren, who I had to meet anyways for the thrashing phase.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Crown Prince hates me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you at all. There, you\u2019re open!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there even a single moment in Crown Prince\u2019s eyes where I don\u2019t have an opening!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew it, you hate me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRen is just too weak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Because of the charm discharge problem I was having, the underground training room became a prohibited area for the time being. Although Ye-Eun and Sophie who used the room often seemed to be displeased, when I explained the circumstance, they reluctantly accepted it.</p><br/><p>As a result, Ren and I got to occupy the training room for ourselves, while Father and Walker sometimes dropped by to watch Ren getting beat up. I was thankful that Michel and Leon were devoting all their time to climbing the dungeon. If there were new spectators, Ren would undoubtedly cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, my son is truly talented in beating people up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that first hand. Kang Shin\u2019s beaten me up before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease leave! Are you happy watching me getting beaten up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOpening!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was relieving the stress of being unable to see Ina and Yua by beating up Ren\u2026 Kuhum. Feeling glad that I was helping Ren with his growth, I spent honest days in the dungeon.</p><br/><p>Ever since Ren began to stay on Earth, it seemed he had a change of heart as his quick temperament and habit of losing his sanity in battles was being mended smoothly. Although now might be too early, when I would be grinding the 70th Floor Master, if I held Ren for 10 days, his habit of going berserk might be completely fixed.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince, do you believe you can protect Earth?\u201d</p><br/><p>On the 10th day since my 65th Floor Master grinding began, when neither Father nor Walker was in the training room, Ren asked. It seemed he hadn\u2019t been just getting beaten up, as he was dodging my attacks skillfully. As I was about to call it a day so I could go grind the Floor Master, I took my spear back and retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I do. Does Ren think I\u2019ll fail?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, don\u2019t kid. If there\u2019s anyone in this guild with an absolute trust in Crown Prince, it would be me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren retorted with a bitter smile as he leaned against his claymore. As he had used up most of his stamina and mana, he was moving quite slowly.</p><br/><p>He slowly swept his hair up. As he dripped with sweat, his lion\u2019s mane-like hair became entangled.</p><br/><p>He spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe in myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh right, Ren had become Panan continent\u2019s Hero. I was the one who made him one.</p><br/><p>Remembering that crucial fact, I replied with a shrug.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lacking in training.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, I am. That\u2019s what I thought Crown Prince would say\u2026 But I\u2019m really shaking. The kids that are looking only at me\u2026 Ah, of course, Elfa is also looking at Crown Prince, but the point is, both Lebuik and the kids trust me wholeheartedly. They trust that I\u2019ll chase the El Patiz out and reclaim the Panan continent. I\u2026 I find that extremely pressuring.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it so much. There are still 2 years at least.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied as if it was something trivial and returned my spear to its choker form. Ren looked at me and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you die, Earth will lose its future. Have you not thought about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you die, billions of people will lose their future. Even if they don\u2019t fall into the monsters\u2019 hands, they will slowly wither away. Have you never despaired thinking about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you die, those left on Earth will resent you and curse you with all their heart. Have you ever woken up in the middle of the night when they appear in your dreams?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><br/><p>After replying that far, I glared at Ren.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you stupid? I\u2019m busily swinging my spear, climbing the dungeon, and gathering more members of Revival. I already had my mind full of all these, so how would I have the time to think about something that hasn\u2019t even happened and despair? Rather than worrying about all that, just swing your sword one more time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you do that? What I\u2019m saying is, how can you shake away all this pressure?\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed an unforeseen side effect came over Ren\u2019s thrashing phase. He was feeling pressure as a Hero and he had come to doubt his abilities. For someone who looked so reliable, he couldn\u2019t be more delicate. Simply put, it was annoying.</p><br/><p>\u201cRen, how many beastmen are alive in Panan continent?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but it can\u2019t be many. There\u2019s the possibility that there are none left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat would happen if Ren suddenly dies and loses the Hero\u2019s power?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumans and beastmen wouldn\u2019t be able to proliferate on Panan continent ever again\u2026 Though Lebuik and the kids will be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen even if Ren dies, it\u2019s not like a lot of people will lose their future, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, but then the Panan continent will\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>I gathered mana at my fingertips and flicked it at him. It hit Ren\u2019s forehead and pushed him backward.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know how many people will die, so how can you be so scared? There\u2019s probably nothing more pathetic than that. Plus, it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll be going back to Panan continent alone. I and other members of Revival will also go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRen, you said you trusted me. Then there\u2019s nothing to worry about. I\u2019ll go back to Panan continent with Ren, and if Ren\u2019s strength isn\u2019t enough, I\u2019ll offer my power. So rather than worrying about the consequences of Ren dying, just focus on your training.\u201d</p><br/><p>I then dealt the heavy blow.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s double the thrashing phase\u2019s intensity. I was happy thinking that Ren was getting better, but it turns out Ren was just out of steam. I\u2019ll make sure Ren gets Ren\u2019s lost spirit back. Aren\u2019t you happy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not happy at all! Double!? Did you just say double!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren\u2019s ears perked up and shook. However, I had no intention of taking back my words.</p><br/><p>However, as I had understood how he was feeling, I decided to be a bit more honest.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m also human, Ren. Of course, I thought about such things and got a bit depressed. But Ren, if I die, will Ren blame me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not! You\u2019re doing everything you can!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWould Yua, Hwaya, or Ina blame me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRather than Earth facing an end, I think they\u2019d be sadder that Crown Prince died.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. So there\u2019s nothing I need to fear. I\u2019m already doing all that I can.\u201d</p><br/><p>I put my hands on his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cRen, you do everything you can too. Then, you won\u2019t have anything to fear. Plus, I\u2019m the one that made Ren a Hero. I think of Ren as my disciple, so I\u2019ll help Ren too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re doubling the thrashing phase\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Ren\u2019s sullen face, a sinister thought crossed my mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, by the way, Ren, if it gets too hard, ask Lebuik to sleep together with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cH-H-H-H-How can I do that! To Lebuik!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say Lebuik was like a mother? When things get hard, falling asleep in mother\u2019s embrace is the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this and that are totally different things!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust believe me. Go to Lebuik\u2019s room at night and ask, \u2018Can I rely on you a bit?\u2019 Lebuik treasures Ren too. She\u2019ll surely let you in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLebuik will never do that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRen, do as I say. Lebuik won\u2019t refuse, I promise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally. You can kick me otherwise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm\u2026 Alright, if Crown Prince is willing to go that far, I\u2019ll give it a try\u2026 I didn\u2019t know Lebuik thought of me as a son\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, something like that. I\u2019m sure she thinks of making a son with you.\u2019 I replied to his murmuring in my heart and began to think about how Lebuik would repay this favor. Right, banquet noodles would be best.[2. Traditionally Korean noodles served at weddings.]</p><br/>\n</div>"}

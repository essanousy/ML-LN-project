Draconian Lin (4)</p><br/><p>[I succeeded in breaking through the 25th floor by myself.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that was fast!\u201d</p><br/><p>[It was all thanks to your training and the Muscle Strengthening Elixirs.]</p><br/><p>I was in the middle of dashing through the 30th floor pathway when Ren contacted me. While completely crushing the skeleton warriors that were running at me, I answered Ren.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere really weren\u2019t a lot of people on the 25th floor. If you\u2019re having trouble finding party members, ask the Floor Shop owner for an item called Party Member Scarecrow. You can start grinding with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Eh? I\u2019m not doing it with Crown Prince?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI already finished grinding.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuk, so fast\u2026 as expected of my master.]</p><br/><p>\u201cRen is fast too. The Giant Ghoul was easy, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[If there\u2019s one thing I learned from sparring with you, it\u2019s dodging attacks. I can somehow dodge the zombies\u2019 attacks or the Giant Ghoul\u2019s claws, but\u2026 his Diehard skill annoys me greatly. Because of it, I had to spend 5 hours to defeat him.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you blow up his heart while he\u2019s using the skill, he\u2019ll die.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Crown Prince is the only one who can do such a strange thing. Regardless, since I obtained the Death Counter skill, solo raids should be somewhat doable.]</p><br/><p>While using Heroic Strike boosted by Divine Speed to take care of two named monsters, Skeleton Warmage and Skeleton Scout, I answered Ren.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really like Ren\u2019s attitude for these things. Good luck. Don\u2019t let something like the Giant Ghoul kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Crown Prince is probably the only one who can call the 25th Floor Master as \u2018something like\u2019\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, but Ren can\u2019t store skills like I do. You\u2019ll have to choose between Diehard and Dragon Skin. I\u2019ll recommend Dragon Skin. The Giant Ghoul Set isn\u2019t something a person should wear.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Can I buy Crown Prince\u2019s pocket watch from somewhere?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can try asking your Floor Shop owner.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I already did, but he only asked how I heard about such an ancient artifact\u2026 That Loretta woman, just who is she?]</p><br/><p>While cursing at the Skeleton Warmage for only dropping 5,000 gold and curiously examining the \u2018Silverbone Crossbow\u2019 the Skeleton Scout dropped, I answered Ren.</p><br/><p>\u201cA kind and pretty shop noona\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>[She\u2019s only kind to Crown Prince\u2026]</p><br/><p>Oh, this crossbow was pretty good! If there were crossbow bolts in my inventory, it reloaded automatically and shot out consecutively. Wasn\u2019t this a machine gun!? For a completely plain looking crossbow other than the fact that it was made of silver bones, it sure had excellent functions. Oh! It even dealt bonus damage if the bolts were made from ground skeleton bones!</p><br/><p>I had finally found a better use for the bones skeletons occasionally dropped other than selling them to Lin. Although it didn\u2019t seem usable against boss monsters, it seemed useful for cleaning up trash mobs. I was greatly satisfied by the unexpected lucky drop.</p><br/><p>\u201cRegardless, good luck, Ren. We can raid together around the 50th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>[There are people who can\u2019t ever climb to that 50th floor!]</p><br/><p>\u201cRen can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I retorted as I hung the crossbow by my waist.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause Ren is my disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 That\u2026 are you acknowledging me?]</p><br/><p>\u201cTo tell you the truth, I want to train you for at least a year more.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I won\u2019t be your disciple!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding. You\u2019re doing great. Keep it up. Goodbye.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ah, uh, wait!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><br/><p>As the skeletons kept running away because of my Skull Breaker title, I used Provoke to draw them towards me. I then used Tempest to destroy them while I asked Ren.</p><br/><p>[Do\u2026 Do you know the name Lebuik Vandeon Granaris?]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 No, you see. I know it\u2019s impossible as well, but\u2026 I\u2019m asking just in case.]</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>[If you ever hear about Lebuik Vandeon Granaris\u2026 Do tell me. I beg you.]</p><br/><p>Since Ren\u2019s voice was unusually tense, I also became serious as I answered him. As I saw the door to the 30th Floor Master up ahead, I became even more serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince I\u2019m always climbing the dungeon by myself, I doubt I\u2019ll hear much of other people\u2019s names\u2026 but sure. I\u2019ll tell you if I hear about him.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Thank you.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were so concerned about the man who turned you into a dungeon explorer.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m not concerned! Crown Prince really has a dirty personality!]</p><br/><p>In the past, Ren had mentioned it was Sir Lebuik who chose him to become a dungeon explorer among numerous other young talents. Since he couldn\u2019t forget about him, it seemed he was a special person to Ren.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a bit curious too. He was your first master, right? I wonder how strong he is.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Pft, I know fully well how competitive you are, but I doubt you will be his match. If Sir Lebuik is alive, he should at least be Gold rank\u2026 Ah.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m in front of the 30th Floor Master door. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>[M-Mmm, I see. Then\u2026 I\u2019ll talk to you later.]</p><br/><p>I ended my conversation with Ren. Although I didn\u2019t mean to, I felt like I had asked leading questions. Ren was the one at fault for being stupid, it wasn\u2019t my fault.</p><br/><p>Alright, now that I had rationalized it to myself, I should go into the boss fight. The 30th floor\u2019s \u2018first\u2019 was already taken by someone else. Although it would have been safer to challenge the Floor Master with a full party of 10\u2026</p><br/><p>I now knew how much stronger I was compared to the other explorers. I was confident that I could handle the 30th Floor Master by myself, especially since I had my skills as an Elementalist and the pocket watch. Plus, since Lin had set his quest\u2019s clear condition to breaking through the dungeon without party play, I couldn\u2019t do so anyways.</p><br/><p>\u201cFight me!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a spirited shout, I slammed opened the door. The Field was surprisingly a vast wilderness, where only a pale blue moon shone the dark night sky. In the area, which was much larger than the 25th floor\u2019s graveyard, about 200 or so skeletons were lined up. Each and every one of them wore a sturdy suit of armor and were armed with weapons. I could also see skeleton mages and skeleton archers amongst their ranks.</p><br/><p>However, their straight-line formation broke down the moment I entered the Field.</p><br/><p>\u201cKiik, it\u2019s the Skull Breaker!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be intimidated, Captain will punish you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cS-Skull Breaker! We have nowhere to run!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, what if we stay still and just leave it to Captain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d</p><br/><p>[All of you shut up!]</p><br/><p>A thundering voice rang out from the back, which straightened up the skeletons\u2019 slackened discipline. When I laid my eyes on the owner of the voice, I was incredibly surprised. My god!</p><br/><p>\u201cA skeleton mount! I\u2019m jealous!\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s been a while since a challenger who knows his stuff appeared\u2026]</p><br/><p>The 30th Floor Master was a skeleton wearing full plate armor and carrying a large sword made of bones. As his armor covered his entire body and his helmet covered his face, his appearance was just like a knight\u2019s. A huge knight over 2.5 meters in size. He spoke with a ghastly voice that seemed to flow out from the pit of hell.</p><br/><p>[I am the Skeleton Knight. Remember my face. I am the one who will send you into endless despair.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I really should remember the face of a coward who calls himself a knight but attempts to fight me with his army.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Kill that bastard who\u2019s full of talk!]</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain, we can\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about Captain, but our bones will get crushed in a single hit!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we just tie up Captain and offer him? Then, we can surrender!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You bastards!]</p><br/><p>The skeletons downfall was their overly high intelligence. They figured out the difference in our leagues and thought to surrender. It was the first time I had faced such monsters in the dungeon. The Skull Breaker title was more amazing than I ever imagined.</p><br/><p>[Fight him. NOW!]</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, big talk for someone who\u2019s going to stay hidden until the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is why knights suck.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhew, let\u2019s just go fight. Hey, if we\u2019re going to die anyways, let\u2019s not bother resisting. If Skull Breaker gets tired and loses to Captain, that would be infuriating!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I will murder you all!]</p><br/><p>As all the skeletons were drowning in their sense of defeat, I attacked the mages and archers hidden in their midst.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, I\u2019ll leave it to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I got it, Master! Thunder Arrow!]</p><br/><p>With that, close to a hundred lightning arrows appeared in the sky. The skeletons that were looking at each other and talking all turned to face the arrows. In that instant, the lightning arrows soared through the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn Elementalist!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKugagagagaga!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t even do anything yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGigagagaga!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Not good enough!]</p><br/><p>While the skeletons were panicking, only the Skeleton Knight protected himself by swinging his large sword. However, the lightning arrows he blocked were only to stop him from protecting his skeleton minions. It was a feint, per se.</p><br/><p>While he was blocking the lightning arrows coming towards him, dozens of other lightning arrows completed their duty. The lightning arrows that were focused on the few mages and archers all pierced their targets and exploded them into pieces.</p><br/><p>\u201cUguk! The magicians and archers were all killed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank god I\u2019m not an archer!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, if we want to survive, we just have to arm Captain with a bow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Kugak!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Skeleton Knight swung his sword and cut down a few of his skeleton minions. The wilderness that was full of the clicking sounds of their bones and their voices became completely silent for a moment.</p><br/><p>[What are you doing with your enemy right in front of you, you fools!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell said, Skeleton Knight. I was starting to get annoyed too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Agreeing with Skeleton Knight, I bent my knees and slightly pulled my body backwards. Instead of the Black Earthen Spear, I held my Silver Spear as I pulled my arm back. Peika went into the Silver Spear on her own accord.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 someone who cuts down his own soldiers annoys me even more!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Everyone charge! Crush him! Those that refuse will have their bones crushed by my sword!]</p><br/><p>\u201cGugelgel, follow Captain\u2019s command.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are only alive because of this cursed body. Let\u2019s go set it ablaze.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur lives already ended a long time ago. I want to put an end to my days, forced to live as a soldier even in death.\u201d</p><br/><p>I pulled my arms back as much as I could and concentrated my strength into it. The Silver Spear in my grip radiated a brilliant white light and flickered with lightning. My eyes were fixed, not at the skeletons running towards me, but the Skeleton Knight sitting on his skeleton mount.</p><br/><p>[Block his attack! Destroy him!]</p><br/><p>\u201cTry it if you\u2026 can!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I finished my retort, I threw my spear forward with all the strength I could muster. Although I didn\u2019t shout Heroic Strike or Divine Speed, both skills were undoubtedly activated. It was because the speed I threw my spear was unusually fast.</p><br/><p>I remembered something similar happening in the past. If I was extremely focused, skills would be activated without saying it out loud!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

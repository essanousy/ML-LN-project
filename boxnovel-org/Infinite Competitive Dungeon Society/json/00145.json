What We Can Do (3)</p><br/><p>[I had a feeling you\u2019d call me soon.]</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes. Your mana was getting clearer. I knew you would soon reach the necessary realm.]</p><br/><p>It sounded like I was a cultivator in a martial arts novel. Of course, Peruta was probably telling the truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI learned a lot from you back in the Luka continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Huhu, it seems you realized something about Peruta Circuit. First, let\u2019s have a spar. I can pass my spear technique down afterward.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><br/><p>We didn\u2019t need to say much. I immediately closed my eyes, and Peruta created an Imagine World. We now had 37 hours to work with. Within this time, I had to learn Peruta\u2019s Spear Technique. Otherwise, I would have to wait another month.</p><br/><p>Peruta Circuit was a method to bring the flow of mana toward its user. The spiraling mana sucked in external mana, and at the same time, strengthened the mana through rotational force. The whirlpool of mana didn\u2019t just happen in the mana pathway but spread out through the entire body and the outside. A special flow occurs inside the mana whirlpool, which only the user can manipulate. Depending on how it\u2019s used, it can block an opponent\u2019s attack or strengthened one\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cHo, you already learned the practical application of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be compared to your spearmanship though.\u201d</p><br/><p>A whirlpool completely matching the flow of Peruta Circuit circulated through the spear Peruta was holding. As each of his attacks were heavy, in order to block it, I had to use the same whirlpool in my attacks or pour my aura into the spear until the limit.</p><br/><p>Of course, that was the past me. After the special training I went through, I could imbue aura into my spear and draw Peruta Circuit\u2019s whirlpool from it. Even so, the difference between mine and Peruta\u2019s was like heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s the current you, you\u2019ll understand it naturally while we spar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I can guarantee you. If you experience it for just 30 hours\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As he raised his spear wrapped in a whirlpool, Peruta gave a teasing smile. It was my own face, but I wanted to punch it! However, before I could charge toward him, he attacked me first.</p><br/><p>I jumped to the side to dodge his spear which was slashing down vertically, then counterattacked. As expected, Peruta read my movements and struck my spear away with his spear swirling with a whirlpool.</p><br/><p>\u201cOho, your dodging skills improved!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just came back from a place where I\u2019d die if I\u2026 didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re still not there yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>Peruta\u2019s spear was terrifyingly fast and powerful. His spear technique wasn\u2019t just utilizing Peruta Circuit\u2019s whirlpool. His spear\u2019s movement and its trajectory were as free as the capricious wind. It\u2019s methodical flow suddenly twisted and distorted, and if it caught me, it would swallow me like a raging tide. It was light, then heavy. It was calm, then violent. As someone facing it, it couldn\u2019t be more annoying.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can do it. You already know the key!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 think so\u2026 at all\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Peruta\u2019s comforting only gave me despair. Although we shared the same body, the realm of martial arts he embodied was far and lofty. He was called an ancient Martial God and a War God. Even so, I\u2026</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, you\u2019re getting more natural!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not at all\u2026! I\u2019m only just starting!\u201d</p><br/><p>I will catch up to him! It\u2019s not like I couldn\u2019t see the difference between us before, and now, I knew the height in front of my eyes was a level I could reach!</p><br/><p>By the time 10 hour passed, my white aura began to swirl around my spear in the shape of a whirlpool. The result of starting to show from repeatedly clashing with Peruta\u2019s spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou took your first step! Good, but are you satisfied with just that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d</p><br/><p>His spearmanship wasn\u2019t the only thing I had to catch up to. His movements as he wielded his spear, his spear flowing with his movements, his footwork, the Peruta Circuit\u2019s mana erupting from his feet, the flow that amplified, converged, and released!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to try to follow my movements. Peruta Circuit is an unconstrained whirlpool. You just have to mix it however you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I already\u2026 know that!\u201d</p><br/><p>The whirlpool enveloping my spear was fast and destructive. Although it wasn\u2019t as capricious as Peruta\u2019s nor was it as mysterious and elusive, it became stronger as it advanced and overwhelmed the enemy with its unpredictable destructive power! It was persistent and relentless!</p><br/><p>Peruta Circuit\u2019s current became more and more powerful as it flowed. Even as it stumbled, it did not stop, and continuously and endlessly drew in mana. The pain it gave made me happy. I felt like I finally understood how to wield mana. What was left was to direct it, not just using my spear, but using my entire body!</p><br/><p>[You learned the Unique Spear Technique, \u2018Peruta \u2013 Mad Typhoon.\u2019 Although it is based on Peruta Circuit, this Unique Spear Technique has been tempered by your martial path, which naturally manipulates its shocking flow of mana into speed and destructive force. You obtained 2 skill points. Current skill points: 10]</p><br/><p>This message was heard 24 hours after the start of my sparring with Peruta. Although the way I enveloped my spiraling white aura around my spear was different than Peruta\u2019s method, I became able to clash with him without being pushed back. It seemed Peruta had also realized it, as his smile became deeper.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations. You paved your own way forward.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a bit too straightforward.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just your character. Once your movement is added on top of it, not many will be able to dodge your spear.\u201d</p><br/><p>After finding out that I had learned my own Spear Technique, Peruta stopped. With a satisfied expression, he looked at me and my spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor me to reach that realm, it took me 70 years in human time. This is only the start, so don\u2019t become overconfident.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c70 years\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Peruta spent 70 years to reach this height, he only considered it the start? As I thought, I had a lot to learn from his mindset.</p><br/><p>After that, Peruta advised me about Peruta Circuit and spearmanship, then disappeared saying he\u2019d see me in a month. Once I was left alone in the basement training room, I collapsed. Since I did 24 hours\u2019 worth of movements in 24 minutes, it was only natural for fatigue to build up. I looked at the clock. It was 2 in the afternoon. I didn\u2019t have the time to stay lying on the floor like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, wash me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Okay!]</p><br/><p>In an instant, ice enveloped my entire body, then disappeared. My body drenched in sweat was now clean. Along with the cleanliness, drowsiness naturally swept over me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaa\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>No. Go with the flow. Peruta seemed to be telling me so. I couldn\u2019t go against master\u2019s words, so I obediently went to sleep.</p><br/><p>When I woke up, Sumire was in front of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>I blinked. Then, I realized I was using Sumire\u2019s laps as pillows.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, Sumire? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe floor is hard, Shin-nim. My laps are hard from muscles too, but I thought they were still better than the floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to go so far\u2026 Well, thanks though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! You trained immediately after coming back from your training, I\u2019m impressed!\u201d</p><br/><p>I got up. Sumire also got up slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs everyone back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Because Shin-nim is coming back today, we came back after clearing 3 Event Dungeons. I came down to practice spearmanship while we waited, but then I found Shin-nim here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have woken me up\u2026 Do you want to lightly spar?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sumire\u2019s eyes sparkled. It seemed she was waiting for those exact words. Looking at Sumire grabbing her spear and taking her stance, I grinned. Then, I likewise grabbed my spear.</p><br/><p>After the spar, Sumire reached mid-rank Spear Technique. This girl\u2026 was really a genius.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I was expecting you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia ran into my embrace the moment she saw me. I patted her back to calm her down and reported to the others that I was back. We could now talk about the things we needed to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re at our limit. Even if the remaining Event Dungeon turn into Field Dungeons, the countries they\u2019re in can manage them. They have tight security around their gates, preventing anyone from entering without their permission. There are 162 such dungeons.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya explained as she gritted her teeth. I had already somewhat heard about it through the communication channel, but now that I heard the exact number, I could only sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long did it take for the first wave of Event Dungeons to turn into Field Dungeons?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo months, Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sumire answered quickly. Since the Event Dungeons appeared a month ago, while I was in still in Beyond\u2019s 3rd floor, we still had a month left.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t be open to discussions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker spoke as one corner of his mouth curled up. Seeing as how he was here, it seemed Yua was already home.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though Mastiford specifically contacted the British government, they\u2019re still trying to protect their gates.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t just that Event Dungeons would turn into Field Dungeons. The Event Dungeons might not get turned into Field Dungeons and have their bosses freed. That would be more of a headache\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, humans naturally delude themselves into thinking they can control everything. If there is a precedent, it is especially so. They\u2019ll think they\u2019re prepared and that there\u2019s no need to worry about it. The result will almost always be disastrous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker had quite a twisted view on the world. Of course, with the way things were going, I couldn\u2019t deny him. How annoying.</p><br/><p>When I looked at Hwaya, she was frowning. Was it because Ludia was still in my embrace? Like a barnacle, she wouldn\u2019t get off of me even when Ye-Eun and Shuna pulled on her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Hwaya?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuardian\u2019s leaders are extremely forward in protecting the gates.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can say it straight out. Brightman, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>I should\u2019ve beaten that guy up earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just Brightman. Most SS rankers are helping to thoroughly protect their countries\u2019 gates. So much so that it\u2019s taking longer to clear dungeons ranked S+ or above.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu, I at least hoped that the ones who obtained their abilities through the dreams would be better\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>No, I couldn\u2019t just stay here and sigh all day. I had to do what I could do.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start with Korea. Is Korea also protecting its Event Dungeons?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf the 18 Event Dungeons in Korea, the three Event Dungeons ranked D or below were instantly destroyed when they appeared, and Event Raids didn\u2019t break out either. There are 4 dungeons ranked S or above, of which two are S rank and two are S+ rank. As you know, Korea doesn\u2019t have any SS rankers and only a few S rankers. Because of that, they weren\u2019t prioritized in the Guardian\u2019s ordering. They probably won\u2019t get cleared within the next month.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the others?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe list of the other 11 Event Dungeons are: 1 A+, 2 A, 1 B+, 3 B, 2 C+, and 2 C. The Korean government is also trying to protect the dungeons ranked B+ or below. The dungeons ranked higher than that can\u2019t be cleared because of their lack of ability users. Once they enter, they can\u2019t get out until they clear the dungeon, so they\u2019re being careful about where to send their troops.\u201d</p><br/><p>After thinking for a bit, I came to a decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to clean up Korea first. Is that okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, you know that the government is protecting the gates, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, father, but I\u2019ll do it forcefully. It\u2019ll be fine. Our country is too weak to stop us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you can say that as a Korean\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But it\u2019s true! Even if Korea\u2019s 3 S rankers worked together, they won\u2019t even be able to pierce through Sumire or Shuna\u2019s defense!</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s split into three teams. Hwaya, you go with Walker and Shuna.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, go with Sumire and Ye-Eun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOoh, going on a stroll with my new daughter candidates doesn\u2019t sound so bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with Ludia.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia looked ready to burst into tears, so it was probably difficult to separate from her again. Plus, with her power of the earth for defense and healing ability, she was undoubtedly the best candidate to bring with me. Ah, Ludia\u2019s face lit up. How cute.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe way I split the members is simple. I made it so that no one in Korea will be able to stop us. Even if Event Raids break out, we should be able to take care of them. Let\u2019s split the eleven low-ranked dungeons into three based on their distance and start. Don\u2019t openly reveal your identities. Equip something like Otus\u2019 Secret.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow pleasant. You\u2019re giving us orders right after coming back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is only the start, Walker. My goal is to completely sweep through all the Event Dungeons on Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRegardless of people coming to stop us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going to stop us?\u201d</p><br/><p>With a grin, I retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one can stop me now, Walker.\u201d</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note: N/A</p><br/>\n</div>"}

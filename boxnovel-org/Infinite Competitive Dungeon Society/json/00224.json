Overlord (4)</p><br/><p>After that, these so-called Destroyers appeared in many other places. There was one where Ye-Eun was, and other teams also reported that they discovered the Destroyers. Although Hwaya and Ina\u2019s team instantly destroyed the one they found, the other teams had difficulty defeating them and had to request for help.</p><br/><p>Naturally, we began to move together as we met up, and by the time I killed the fourth Destroyer, everyone had gathered together.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we done with the ones that came outside?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHu, I can feel the heavy mana vibrating! Also, hasn\u2019t it been getting hotter, guys?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHotter? Well, maybe with all the bullets you\u2019ve been shooting out\u2026 Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Only after Leon\u2019s comment did I realize that the temperature rose. Because of my elementals and Felixes\u2019 Chaotic Cape, I had not noticed the change in temperature until now. Meanwhile, the others were already dripping with sweat. Other than me, the only ones unaffected were Ina, Hwaya, and Daisy.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, can you cool the air around us so that the guild members are comfortable?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un! But I can\u2019t when we\u2019re fighting. The heat energy here is too strong.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Got it!]</p><br/><p>Ruyue immediately released her freezing energy, and the others could finally catch their breaths.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe heat hasn\u2019t affected me much since I became an ability user, but this is impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hero, we need to hurry before it gets hotter. This is a sign that the king has started to move his forces. We have to take care of his subordinates before he get serious.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Let\u2019s hurry, everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since we couldn\u2019t take out our plane here, everyone got on Lotte\u2019s back. She grit her teeth and grumbled, but she accepted my request after I promised her a reward.</p><br/><p>[Since we\u2019re in a hurry\u2026 I\u2019ll allow it!]</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, Lotte\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ilayda and Plene also left, as the two of them wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand a hit from the king. Plene became depressed, saying that she couldn\u2019t be of help again, while Ilayda also argued, saying that she wanted to stay. Since Plene\u2019s power helped us immensely in recovering the Philippines, it was relatively easy to console her, but convincing Ilayda was harder.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need my ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Ilayda, it\u2019s too dangerous. It\u2019s possible that you might die from the aftershock of the king\u2019s attack. You have to level up a bit more. Once you become Gold ranked, you can accompany us on jobs like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t complain even if I die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be troubled if you die. We\u2019re going to need your ability in the future, so please, leave it to Ludia for today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m more than enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case\u2026 I\u2019ll acquiesce. I\u2019ll get stronger so that I can be of help to everyone!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ludia stepped up, Ilayda seemed convinced and went back to the mansion with Plene who had become happier after I consoled her. Michel then spoke with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe has a type of obsession with these things. I found out after I got to know her better. She won\u2019t hesitate to risk her life to save others, a bit too philanthropic, you could say. Because of her immense love for others, it almost looks like she has no love for herself\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMichel can take care of her. It should be the guild master\u2019s job to take care of his guild members, but I\u2019m banned from talking to Ilayda about personal things.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, I pointed behind me. Ludia and Hwaya were glaring at Michel.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin can\u2019t take care of each and every guild member personally, Michel Ajusshi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you trying to make me, Mitarus\u2019 priestess, commit murder\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>I simply laughed without saying anything. Michel placed his hand on my shoulder with a look of pity.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s tough\u2026 you can talk to me. It\u2019s a bit embarrassing to say this, but I\u2019ve had my fair share of such experiences when I was younger\u2026 I know how you feel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMichel\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt like I was tearing up. I nodded my head ever so slightly so that the girls wouldn\u2019t find out.</p><br/><p>As we got closer to the volcano, the ground fissured and shot fire into the air. Lotte also became more and more anxious.</p><br/><p>[Hero, I\u2019m speeding up!]</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Ruyue finally announced her surrender.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s too hard with my power alone.]</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Ruyue\u2019s strengthened ability couldn\u2019t block the temperature change!? When she returned to my weapon, the others immediately began to feel tormented.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is too much!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIlina, can you do something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m bad at using my power delicately\u2026 I can freeze you though!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNevermind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too hot. Should I take off my armor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be hotter if you do. Just endure it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t think it was possible for any environment to affect Revival\u2019s members so harshly. I shouted out a message as I grit my teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeat can greatly hinder your movements. When we encounter this king, I\u2019ll handle him from the front .If the heat gets unbearable to the point you think you can\u2019t continue, tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, my body isn\u2019t so weak that a heat of this level can hinder my movements.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just you, Father. Others aren\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps, only Lebuik and Ren, who were beastmen, and Michel, who trained in the ways of the sword his entire life, could be like Father. Thankfully, Hwaya, who seemed most likely to be affected by environmental effects, was a flame ability user.</p><br/><p>[I see one!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHeroic Strike!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment a Destroyer entered my sight, I threw my spear and intercepted him. Everyone else also poured long-ranged attacks and killed it. However, up ahead, over ten Destroyers were marching towards us.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! Lotte, how many of them do you think are there?\u201d</p><br/><p>[From what we\u2019ve seen so far, over a thousand! There are also many that are stronger than the Destroyers.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I almost lost hope. A thousand SSS+ rank monsters and more monsters above that level? There was the king to worry about too! A sigh naturally left my mouth.</p><br/><p>[Hero, we must lower their count now. The king\u2019s army increases in size over time. Now that we\u2019re here, we can\u2019t go back.]</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. We can\u2019t back off now.\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s good that we killed so many monsters before\u2026 The Witch made a wise decision.]</p><br/><p>At Lotte\u2019s words, I got a hunch.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that army made of monsters? Is that why they called all monsters living in the Philippines to the volcano?\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s why the Lava King is terrifying. The more he fought, the stronger his army became.]</p><br/><p>\u201cA role model for necromancers. I must take notes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy said an unnecessary comment as she clapped in admiration. I then smacked her head, while Hwaya grit her teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I knew beforehand, I would have gathered an army and attacked much earlier!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knew this Lava King would be here? You did well Hwaya\u2026 There\u2019s no need to blame yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>I tightened my grip on my spear. Seeing the Destroyers beginning to make their appearance on the land booming with fire, I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, materialize into your humanoid form! It\u2019s time to show your prowess!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Got it!]</p><br/><p>Ruyue transformed into a wolf girl. Ren exclaimed in awe, forgetting the current circumstance.</p><br/><p>\u201cB-Beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRen, Lebuik! Stop blabbering and get ready to fight! We\u2019re descending now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cG-Got it, Crown Prince!\u201d</p><br/><p>I glared at Ren and Lebuik, and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cEvery time you get hit today, I\u2019ll lengthen your thrashing phase by one day. Lebuik will also get a taste of a thrashing phase if you\u2019re not careful! Everyone else, get ready to fight! We\u2019re going to destroy this army before the king comes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll protect Daddy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lotte shot down like an arrow. Ruyue cooled the path we would take, as she charged forward first and swept the Destroyers. Her claws became enveloped in ice as they slashed at the Destroyers. A destroyer had been destroyed without having a chance to counterattack\u2026 Eh?</p><br/><p>\u201cHer weapon might be different, but her movements are a lot like Kang Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why her movements looked familiar! It\u2019s our clan\u2019s movements. The meticulousness and viciousness in charging forward without looking around while not being hit even once.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call it vicious!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Elementals naturally take after their masters. We should go too, Master!]</p><br/><p>Instead of Ruyue, I infused Peika into my spear. I couldn\u2019t use chaos flames today, and if I couldn\u2019t use Ruyue, Peika was the second best option. Now that it had come to this, I became a bit sad that I had already used Sky God\u2019s Rage today. At that moment, as if she had read my mind, Peika commented.</p><br/><p>[Leave it to me, Master. I\u2019ll show you a lightning that can even cut through fire.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Peika. I will.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un!]</p><br/><p>At that instant, I felt the connection between Peika and me getting deeper. With a smile, I made Lotte land. Once everyone including the succubi battle units landed, I got back on Lotte\u2019s back and shot up. Hwaya shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, be careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Rather than that, don\u2019t die, everyone. As long as no one dies, we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at Ludia, who had over twenty Elixirs. When a large number of Event Dungeons appeared on Earth, she had taken all the Elixirs.</p><br/><p>Knowing what I meant, Ludia sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to use them for Shin only\u2026 but I guess there\u2019s no choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, Ludia, if you want Shin to love you, you\u2019ll have to show a generous side of you to others.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me Ludia, Hwaya Mastiford.\u201d</p><br/><p>It looked like everything would be okay. I softly smiled and turned away. The volcano in the distance that seemed to be shooting out mana for a while finally erupted grandly. The heat even made me frown. Lotte shouted like she was screaming.</p><br/><p>[Presences of monsters in this area disappeared! A unique soldier has been born!]</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, there are all these Destroyers too\u2026 Lotte, accelerate!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Got it!]</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, take this!\u201d</p><br/><p>When we were about to charge at a nearby Destroyer, a crystal ball flew toward us. When I quickly grabbed it, I saw a dark-pink colored spherical object. Of course, it wasn\u2019t for decoration. Such a tiny ball contained an immense amount of mana.</p><br/><p>I tilted my head in confusion and saw Licorice smiling at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s made from a portion of all the mana collected by the battle units. It contains our love, so use it when you need it, Dear Husband.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Licorice, this is the succubi\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Dear Husband dies, it won\u2019t matter no matter how strong we get. I hope that will be of help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>I thought she\u2019d boast more, but she only made a small smile before flying back. Dozens of magic circles appeared around her, shooting our magic that targeted down the Destroyers. Each and every one of them was powerful enough to make me shake. Obtaining Licorice before the Philippines subjugation was truly a godlike move.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t lose to Ruyue or Licorice!\u201d</p><br/><p>I put the crystal ball away as I reaffirmed my resolve. Just from a quick estimate, the crystal ball contained three times my mana. As I currently had over 120,000 mana, this small crystal ball had over 360,000 mana in it. If something like this exploded, it would be able to easily blow up a country. Without a doubt, it would help me greatly.</p><br/><p>[Hero, I\u2019m going to strictly charge from now!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me to kill everything in one hit? Got it. I\u2019ll show you what Wind King\u2019s Rage is!\u201d</p><br/><p>My body flashed for a moment, and a massive wind and lightning energy fell into me. Sharana, who was infused into my body, and Peika, who was infused into my spear, both exclaimed.</p><br/><p>[Master, great!]</p><br/><p>[Huhu, Master is the best!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is only the beginning! You guys control this energy!\u2019</p><br/><p>Lotte charged. Her destination was the new Destroyer that just popped out of the fissured ground and overflowing lava!</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Guoooooo!]</p><br/><p>I thrust my spear forward, each attack containing lethal power.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>Wind and lightning stormed. Lotte\u2019s charge didn\u2019t stop. From the giant hole I just pierced through, lava spurted out like blood. The Destroyer immediately collapsed. It had died.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you\u2026 fight me! Mere soldiers like you, I can take care of all of you by myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You used Provoke! All enemies in the area will hold infinite hostility for you. Just by coming out victorious against them, you will make another achievement!]</p><br/><p>The Destroyers marched forward. Just like Lotte said, about a thousand Destroyers popped up from every corner of the ground, as they all glared at me and moved towards me. I gulped down my saliva along with a surging sense of tension and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wind King\u2019s Rage wouldn\u2019t stop until all of them were dead. With Absolute Soul\u2019s power, I would make that possible! Second, third, fourth\u2026!</p><br/><p>[Gruaaaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>Leaving behind giant holes and bursting lava, Lotte charged forward. The whirlpool of wind and lightning enveloping my body cut through the air as it left traces of destruction. It wasn\u2019t just me. Other members of Revival also charged alongside me. About two hundred succubi shot magical attacks without rest, while the roar of the fighting Destroyers shook the land.</p><br/><p>The war between Revival and the Lava King\u2019s Army had now begun.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

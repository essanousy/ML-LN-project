Skill Synthesis (5)</p><br/><p>I could only bring one explorer with me using Dimensional Travel. However, contracted beings like elementals and tamed monsters could come with me just like how I could bring them to the dungeon from Earth.</p><br/><p>I could always unsummon the elementals if things got dangerous, but tamed monsters were a bit more troublesome. Both Plene and Lotte made a fuss about coming with me, but Plene wasn\u2019t suited as an elite force. She couldn\u2019t defend herself well, and her ability wasn\u2019t suited for direct fights. Plus, I didn\u2019t know how much her ability worked against these brain-eating worms. Although I felt sorry for leaving her out, there was nothing I could do.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Lotte didn\u2019t lose to many in terms of strength. Plus, now that she could transform into a human (I was curious just how she obtained that ability), her range of activity increased as well. She was all around a reliable companion to have.</p><br/><p>For the record, I made sure that she wore proper clothing when she was in her human form. I gifted her some elastic leather clothes. Although she refused to wear clothes at first, when I pouted and acted sad that she wouldn\u2019t accept my gift, she frowned and put the clothes on. Huhu, I was getting more skilled at handling my subordinates!</p><br/><p>Lotte looked smugly at Plene when I told Plene that she couldn't come but Lotte could.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhuhu, you see, Fish? This is the Hero\u2019s choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fish! I\u2019m a siren!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 It\u2019s just that your ability isn\u2019t suited for what I\u2019m doing, Plene. Wish us a safe return.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHic\u2026 Okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re weak! Do you know why, Fish?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fish! And I\u2019m not weak! Shin said I was a good singer!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are weak because you are lacking. In training\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTraining?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, let\u2019s go, Lotte.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ever since she transformed into a human, she was learning lots of weird things.</p><br/><p>Regardless, there were only 5 minutes left until I had to go see Lebuik at the pub. I hurriedly left the resort with Lotte and headed to the First Dungeon\u2019s Residential Area. The first thing I did was accepting the Dimensional Mercenary request. Then, while I was making my way to the pub, the people\u2019s attentions became focused on me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Revival\u2019s master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEarth\u2019s Hero?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you check the guild rank? It\u2019s already B.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t even think about messing with that guild. An administrative guild has its back.\u201d</p><br/><p>We\u2019re different from Desert Scorpion! We have no intention of abusing an administrative guild\u2019s authority! Though I wanted to tell them off, I didn\u2019t. Lotte became angry instead.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre they cursing Hero? Not that I think highly of Hero, but it is true that Hero is strong enough to make me submit. How strong are they that they\u2019re cursing Hero in the middle of the street? I must test their strengths!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLotte, please. Also, don\u2019t use words like \u2018submit.\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHero should be proud. Hero made me submit without using force. That shows how grand Hero is!\u201d</p><br/><p>Our surroundings became noisy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, did you hear that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was wondering if it was a new woman. It\u2019s as I thought\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout using force\u2026 That must mean\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgaaaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHero?\u201d</p><br/><p>I grabbed Lotte\u2019s hand and ran to the pub using Gale Track. There, I saw Lebuik with a solemn expression on her face. She wore a set of upgraded armor from the last time I saw her and she had a large black claymore on her back.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You\u2019re here. I thought about it for a long time, but if I could see Ren-nim\u2019s face one last time, I\u2019ll have no regr\u2014 Kyak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>If I stayed in the Residential Area any longer, my reputation is going to plummet to the point of no return! Lebuik seemed to be giving excuses as to why she was going to Panan, but I was too lazy to listen to her. She should just say she wants to see Ren!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Dimensional Travel!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cW-Wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToo late!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Residential Area melted down. As if to paint over the now blank canvas, a new world appeared. The sky was pitch black with not even a single star in sight. Everything was quiet. We were in a small open area in the middle of a dense forest.</p><br/><p>\u201cI said wait a bit, Roo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lebuik was just about to say something to me when she suddenly stopped. She froze and seemed to be staring at behind me. Then, she fell as if her legs gave out.</p><br/><p>I turned around. There, I saw Ren, who was staring at me with widened eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cRen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really\u2026 You really came, Crown Prince\u2026? Damn, I told you not to come, so why?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Dimensional Travel was used for a Dimensional Mercenary request, the user was naturally summoned next to the person who made the request. Otherwise, the user would be summoned to the friend-listed person. Of course, I would have ended up next to Ren regardless.</p><br/><p>Ren\u2019s voice was quiet unlike usual. In fact, his voice seemed to be suppressed as it didn\u2019t travel well. I closed my eyes, then opened them back up after a brief moment. I had analyzed the mana in the surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it an artifact?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I obtained an item that prevents sound from traveling far. The dungeon sure is a nice place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren took out a pentagonally shaped pendant and smiled. Then, he frowned again. He seemed to have remembered what he was talking about.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, don\u2019t change the subject, Crown Prince. It\u2019s not too late, you should\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I think it\u2019s too dangerous, I\u2019ll run away on my own, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Now that you say that, I\u2019m hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren\u2019s perked up lion ears drooped. My fists cried at the cuteness unbefitting of Ren\u2019s face, but I swallowed down the urge.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn any case, I\u2019ll prevent El Patiz from aiming for Crown Prince, even if costs me my life. I won\u2019t stop Crown Prince now, but if it gets dangerous please do go back when I give the signal.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I got it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen first, I\u2019ll introduce you to the children. They haven\u2019t been able to rest for a while, so they practically collapsed when they got the chance. Huhu, you\u2019ll be surprised how cute they are.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren\u2019s ears danced and showed his affection for the children. At that moment, I fully comprehended Ren. I see, so the reason Ren\u2019s trying so hard is\u2026 I nodded my head seriously and lightly tapped Ren\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cRen\u2026 Huu, I understand Ren. It\u2019s understandable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn? Thank you for understanding\u2026 But understand what? Rather than that, who\u2019s the beautiful woman next to you? A Dimensional Mercenary?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren, who didn\u2019t have immunity against women, backed up after noticing Lotte. I introduced her.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my pet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Lotte, the Hero named me. Don\u2019t trouble Hero, Lion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPet!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRookie, you\u2019re the worst!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>And from that, Ren finally noticed the woman sitting on the ground. Lebuik quickly clasped her mouth with her hands, but it was too late. Ren discovered Lebuik and widened his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir\u2026 Lebuik\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Your Highness\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lebuik quickly dusted off the dirt on her armor and displayed her respect for Ren.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you really were alive, Sir Lebuik.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cM-My apologies\u2026 Even if I have ten mouths, I have no excuses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lebuik\u2019s ears drooped and stuck to her hair. To be honest, just looking at their ears were interesting.</p><br/><p>However, Ren burst into laughter. His ears seemed to be jumping around in joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad! I\u2019m extremely happy that you are alive, Sir Lebuik.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was worried that Sir would have missed the chance to go back to the dungeon. After all, Sir Lebuik\u2019s loyalty was the greatest in our world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No, Your Highness. I\u2019m just a defeated cat that turned tail and ran in the face of our enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>So she was a cat\u2026 While I was musing about the novel image of a defeated cat, Ren smiled bitterly and lightly tapped her shoulder pauldrons.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaise your head, Sir Lebuik. The only reason I\u2019m alive now is all thanks to the swordsmanship Sir taught me. Plus, I\u2019m touched that Sir didn\u2019t forget about me and returned.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRen-niiim\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, her tail is shaking. The tail protruding out from a hole in her armor wagged gently and expressed ecstasy. To be able to show the appearance of a girl in love just by the movement of a tail, beastmen were amazing!</p><br/><p>Worried that Lebuik would jump on Ren, I quickly shoved my hand between them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, While I\u2019m happy for your reunion, but let\u2019s leave it at that. Ren, when are we setting off?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, I want to let the children sleep longer, but we\u2019ll probably have to leave before the sun rises. The assassins\u2019 tracking techniques are truly vexing. Well, the El Patiz that took over the assassins\u2019 brains, to be exact.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, I solemnly swear that I shall protect Your Highness no matter what!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather that Sir survives.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, no, I will\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose beastmen are weird. Why are they so bent on dying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was just about to ask the same question, Lotte.\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what I said, but I knew Lebuik was planning on paying the price for abandoning Ren.</p><br/><p>To be honest, when I told her about the situation, I only half-expected her to come. I couldn\u2019t really understand if it was love or re-emerged loyalty that was pushing her to do this. I just hoped that her actions would bring good results for both her and Ren.</p><br/><p>\u201cA fruit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lotte seemed to be perfectly familiar with her human form, as she jumped to the perfect height and grabbed a fruit hanging on a tree branch. She then wiped it off with her sleeve and took a bite. Her movements were rather wild. Even in her human form, there were traces of her true body. The biggest example was her sharp canine teeth. I took the fruit she held out after taking a bite and also bit down. Then, I asked Ren.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs flying a bad idea?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a way of flying. Even if we did, the sky is filled with enemies. In fact, we\u2019re in this forest so that we won\u2019t be noticed by the enemy\u2019s air squadrons.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRen, can you draw the path from here to the coast?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a map. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRookie, you look pretty used to all this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about you, Lebuik? For a knight, you don\u2019t look used to this at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Lebuik has little experience on the battlefield. She was my guard knight and sword teacher. Please understand, Crown Prince. You have experience commanding an empire\u2019s soldiers and fighting in wars. It\u2019s not right to compare Sir Lebuik with Crown Prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>For a moment, I seriously contemplated what world\u2019s crown prince he was talking about. I mean, didn\u2019t I make it clear that I wasn\u2019t really a crown prince!? But when I looked at Lebuik, who was tearing up, I lost the will to say anything. I nodded my head generously and took another bite of the fruit. Then, Lotte exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHero, there\u2019s a worm in that fruit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince!?\u201d</p><br/><p>From then, I trembled for 30 seconds, but thankfully, it wasn\u2019t a brain worm. Thank god\u2026 but just when I was trying to show off! If there was a hole, I wanted to crawl into it!</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Ren is a <del>lolicon</del> saint!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

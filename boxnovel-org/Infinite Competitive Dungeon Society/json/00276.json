Third Season (1)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>In Licorice\u2019s hands were Pure Black Desire, which had reverted to its bracelet form, tattered Felixes\u2019 Lava Cape, and my other items. When my body was reconstructing itself, Pure Black Desire and my other items seemed to have fallen down. Thankfully, Licorice had picked them up.</p><br/><p>Pure Black Desire had an indestructible effect, so I didn\u2019t need to worry about it. Felixes\u2019 Lava Cape could also auto-repair itself even if only a single piece of it remained. Unfortunately for the other equipment\u2026</p><br/><p>Ugh, did all my other items go to waste? For a moment, a chill went down my back. Hoping that it wasn\u2019t true, I caught the bracelet Licorice threw at me and equipped it.</p><br/><p>I felt my physical ability heightening in an instant, as a black metal covered my body. Uuu, it felt cold against bare skin.</p><br/><p>I lowered my altitude slightly and faced the two girls. Licorice gave me the rest of the equipment wrapped into a bundle by my cape. From a glance, it looked like the cape was salvageable, but the accessories were the problem.</p><br/><p>Items I obtained not too long ago like Shadow-Hidden Blade, Thorn Throne, and Echo Ring seemed fine. Thankfully, their disabilities had held out. On the other hand, not even a trace of Golden Teardrop or Flesh Golem\u2019s Second Finger remained. They were low-grade accessories, and the stats they gave didn\u2019t affect me that much either. Still, I still felt like I suffered a loss as they had been with me for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a waste.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, what a\u2026 What are you looking at?\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed Licorice was regretting something else. Realizing that her gaze was fixated on a certain part of my body, I smacked her head. Just like how I couldn\u2019t go back in time to be naked again, the broken accessories couldn\u2019t be reversed. I just had to take care of the ones I had left.</p><br/><p>\u201cHero, what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lotte asked inexplicitly, and I replied in an extremely simple manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything other than me disappeared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lotte became lost for words. I made a wry smile and opened my inventory. Right, it opened. It had to. The invaders\u2019 magical tool, the violet crystal, no longer remained on this continent. I put all the equipment and accessories in my inventory and stretched. As I closed the inventory, an enormous power poured into me.</p><br/><p>Obviously, it was the power of the explorer given to me by the dungeon and by Sherafina.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to the world\u2019s power, Dear Husband?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI sucked it in too. I couldn\u2019t isolate it given the circumstance. Still\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I closed my eyes. The moment Ellos died, the world\u2019s power left his body. Immediately afterward, the surrounding current of mana swept it away, and my whirlpool eventually trapped it. Just like that, it became a part of me naturally.</p><br/><p>I managed to prevent it from mixing with the world\u2019s power I had, but now that it was inside me, it wasn\u2019t going to leave easily. The more I thought about it, the angrier I got. Ellos, this bastard. As a Hero, he used himself as a suicide bomb. I knew he loved Baruella, but that was overdoing it! And\u2026 and!</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaaah, damn it! That son of a bitch!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down, Dear Husband, your mana\u2019s erupting out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, right. Sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>I calmed myself down thanks to Licorice. A truly enormous amount of mana was used during the process of reconstructing my body from scratch, but the amount of mana still circulating around my body through Peruta Circuit\u2019s path was still nothing to scoff at. It seemed to roughly be double the amount I had before\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSherafina should have seen through me by now, right? Let\u2019s see.\u201d</p><br/><p>For the first time in a long time, I opened my status window.</p><br/><p>[Name: Kang Shin Race: Human Sex: Male</p><br/><p>Class: Elementalist (Sub \u2013 Skill Mixer, Tamer) Title: Lightning God Rank: Platinum 9</p><br/><p>Level: 81</p><br/><p>HP \u2013 352,180/352,180 MP \u2013 497,590/497,590</p><br/><p>Strength \u2013 539(+215) Dexterity \u2013 572(+195) Constitution \u2013 763(+71)</p><br/><p>Intelligence \u2013 144(+70) Magic \u2013 879(+185) Charm \u2013 407(+130) Luck \u2013 182(+90)</p><br/><p>Normal Skills \u2013 High-rank Martial Arts (Master \u2013 Attack power, attack speed +20%), Peruta \u2013 Mad Typhoon (Lv 8), High-rank Crossbow Marksmanship (Lv 2), Wind King\u2019s Rage (Lv 5), High-rank Heroic Strike (Lv 5), High-rank Provoke (Lv 9), Divine Speed (Master), Return (Master), Peruta Circuit (Master), Dimensional Travel (Lv 5), Overwhelm (Lv 7), Absolute Soul (Lv 7), Weapon Swap (Lv 7), Captivation (Lv 5), Deific Manifestation, Riding, Mistification, Breath of Death</p><br/><p>Class Skills \u2013 High-rank Spirit Mastery (Lv 9), High-rank Spirit Aura (Lv 9), High-rank Elemental Control (Lv 9), High-rank Elemental Contract (Lv 9), Lightning Spear Storm (Lv 7), High-rank Elemental Blade (Lv 7), High-rank Elemental Tempest (Lv 8)</p><br/><p>Subclass Skill \u2013 Endow Skill, Skill Synthesis, Taming (Master), Spirit of the Collector, Spirit of the Mixer, Spirit of the Tamer (Master)]</p><br/><p>After checking out my status, I made an exclamation of surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing. This was the result of the dungeon\u2019s power being added to my body\u2019s true strength. There wasn\u2019t a single stat that didn\u2019t go up. Intelligence increased by around 50, magic and charm increased by around 100, strength and dexterity increased by around 200, and constitution and magic increased by around 400. I could clearly see which areas this bodily reconstruction strengthened.</p><br/><p>\u201cNah, let\u2019s forget it. They\u2019re just numbers.\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t overestimate myself just because of stats. After closing the status window, I made a vow to myself. A power that solely belonged to me. If I could use the dungeon\u2019s power, I would gladly use it, but when I couldn\u2019t, I had to rely on my own power to defeat the enemy. The Demon Lord most certainly had a method of nullifying the dungeon\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe even measured my skill growth. What a frightening woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at the mastered Peruta Circuit and smiled. She could have said something, but she didn\u2019t. I found it pretty cute.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yeah\u2026 Nevermind Ellos. Let\u2019s go back, I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo back? Where?\u201d</p><br/><p>I pondered for a moment before I spat out.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo the empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>On our way back, we noticed the decrease in the density of atmospheric mana.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, it\u2019s finally breathable!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d</p><br/><p>For me, I felt it was a shame considering how well I could wield that mana. Of course, since I didn\u2019t plan on living on this continent, that feeling didn\u2019t last long.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband is really terrifying. Did you take the entire continent\u2019s mana\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, probably not. The mana density will probably go back up the farther you get from the mountain range. Eventually, it\u2019ll balance itself out with only being thinned out slightly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid Dear Husband expect this to happen from the beginning? Since entering Edias continent?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you lower the scale to a fifth of what happened, then yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>I expected to fight the world\u2019s enemy, and I vowed to find Peruta\u2019s vestige. I suspected that Ellos may have changed, and I felt like I would grow stronger once again.</p><br/><p>Everything I expected to happen did happen, just in a far explosive scale. This was the result.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Ellos didn\u2019t make Kahar\u2019s power go berserk, the magical tool wouldn\u2019t have exploded, and if the magical tool didn\u2019t explode, Hazen would have been fine and I wouldn\u2019t have grown to this extent.\u201d</p><br/><p>If Ellos didn\u2019t do what he did and I had to fight Hazen, I would have needed to use Shiva\u2019s Eye. Could I have won? I wasn\u2019t confident. Hazen was powerful, and he even had the power of the Destruction God Etos. Even if I won, I would have had to bare a huge sacrifice. Even if I found Peruta\u2019s vestige, I might not have mastered Peruta Circuit.</p><br/><p>Back then, I was completely devoted to Peruta Circuit with my life on the line. It only made sense, as failure would have meant death. Thankfully, Peruta\u2019s mana cooperated with me, and I managed to go beyond making Peruta Circuit totally mine and achieved a type of evolution.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband really changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded in agreement. I couldn\u2019t lie. After all, I had transformed from head to toe.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou look tired, Dear Husband.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Licorice.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed that wasn\u2019t what Licorice meant. She was talking about something other than just my outer appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can trust me. Got it, Dear Husband?\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Licorice embraced my back. I didn\u2019t say anything in response and simply accepted her. Her body\u2019s natural scent seemed to console me.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband is my most precious person\u2026 Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the other succubi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDummy, is now the time to talk about that? Just accept that Dear Husband is my most precious person!\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, my question was kind of dumb. I smirked and reached backward to pat her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Licorice.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Bat\u2026 Now isn\u2019t the time to flirt.]</p><br/><p>[Birdbrain, this is the best time.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I trust Lotte, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I reached out with my other hand and patted Lotte, I thought about Ellos. Ellos who had lost Baruella, Hazen who had never considered Ellos\u2019 feelings, and myself who somewhat understood it but still couldn\u2019t forgive him.</p><br/><p>Right, for example, just as an example, suppose Hwaya died. If I could involve my friend and get my revenge, would I have done what he did? What if Ludia died? What if it was Ye-Eun or Daisy? What if it was Father, Mother, Ren, Leon, Sumire, Lotte, or Licorice?</p><br/><p>What if Yua and Ina died?</p><br/><p>After thinking about it that far, I raised my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were all who I had to protect. I couldn\u2019t sacrifice any one of them to avenge someone else. Not even Walker.</p><br/><p>Some of them might be more important to me than others. After all, I was only human. I couldn\u2019t possibly say I thought of everyone equally. Still, taking revenge by sacrificing their lives, that was something I couldn\u2019t do.</p><br/><p>In the end, that\u2019s what it was.</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t someone who Ellos had to protect.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 What did I think about Ellos?\u201d</p><br/><p>Were we even friends?</p><br/><p>We met for the first time on the dungeon\u2019s 5th floor. He was kind, and even after his party moved on and I had no other choice but to remain on the 5th floor, he continued to contact me and encourage me. When we met the second time, I positions had swapped. Still, the way we treated each other hadn\u2019t changed. We respected each other and hoped we could both protect our worlds.</p><br/><p>Now I thought about it, that was it.</p><br/><p>We didn\u2019t share any special bond, nor did we spend enough time to trust each other unconditionally. Not only that, I was suspicious and wary of him.</p><br/><p>That was all there was between us.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, you can\u2019t protect everyone you come to know. It\u2019s even harder to connect with them emotionally.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I know\u2026 Even though I know that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that my anger had subsided, all that remained was emptiness. I felt empty like I didn\u2019t want to do anything. I wanted to throw this world away and just return to Earth.</p><br/><p>But I couldn\u2019t do that. Just because Ellos threw away this world, I couldn\u2019t do the same. I couldn\u2019t make everyone struggling to survive in this continent despair because of two irresponsible Heroes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey need hope, too. They also need a new Hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked up and scanned our surroundings. Right, I couldn\u2019t stay down forever. I was going to give them hope. A new hope.</p><br/><p>Instead of a Hero who died and a Hero who abandoned himself and his world, I had to make a new Hero with the heart to protect his continent. It might take some time, but it should be possible. I hoped so. If I couldn\u2019t find someone like that, that would be the end for this continent. After all, this continent still had an absurdly long road ahead.</p><br/><p>I thought of what Hazen said. I recalled his hate-filled face, as he said he would need to infinitely fight with other worlds to survive.</p><br/><p>It was easy to regard everything as a lie and forget. That was better for my heart, too.</p><br/><p>But, if he was right\u2026</p><br/><p>If it didn\u2019t end\u2026</p><br/><p>If, even after defeating the Demon Lord and all monsters, a pathway to another world opened and enemies poured in\u2026</p><br/><p>I clenched my fists.</p><br/><p>\u201cLicorice, let\u2019s survive until the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUntil the end. The end of the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I could see the empire\u2019s palace. Now, it was time to go see the new Hero candidate.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Fairy Garden (6)</p><br/><p>As I walked onward thinking about Loretta, the trees became denser and the number of elementals decreased. The sound of birds chirping rang out along with the cries of other animals. It was truly a mystical place.</p><br/><p>In an instant, the forest\u2019s atmosphere changed again. The warm, peaceful atmosphere became more uneasy.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Thinking like that instinctively and pushing myself through the trees, I found a small log cabin in the woods. It was almost as if it popped out of a fairytale. I approached the cabin and knocked on its door. Loretta\u2019s answer was swift and concise.</p><br/><p>[Not working. I\u2019m resting. Go away, and don\u2019t come back.]</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kyak!]</p><br/><p>Crashing and clattering sounds rang out from the inside, followed by an absolute silence. I was lost for words as the silence continued, before the door quietly and slowly opened.</p><br/><p>From inside, two golden eyes peeked out. So Loretta had golden eyes. They were truly big and beautiful.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, mm, Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Loretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUu, uuu\u2026 Pretend you didn\u2019t hear what I said.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat would depend on Loretta\u2019s reception.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The inside of the cabin was exceedingly normal. Although the living room was too small to even be called a living room, it was extremely clean. Other than a tea cup on a table, there was nothing inside that seemed like decorations. I could see two rooms, but they couldn\u2019t have been big considering the size of the cabin from the outside. Unlike the grandiose title of Fairy Garden\u2019s Master, the house was humble.</p><br/><p>Loretta was the only special part about it.</p><br/><p>Perhaps realizing that I was staring at her, Loretta blinked her big eyes and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, do I look that different?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta from the Floor Shop was an extremely lively girl. However, other than her voice, Loretta\u2019s real self did not share any similarities with the Loretta I knew. The Loretta I was looking at right now was a beauty exuding nobility and elegance.</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She was an incredibly beautiful elf with snow-white skin, and was tall enough to look me in the eye. Considering that my height was over 190 cm, she was also just as tall.</p><br/><p>However, her perfect body proportions did not make her height stand out. In fact, it added to her mystical appearance. Her slender waist, her arms, her legs, and her voluptuous chest all seemed to suggest that she wasn\u2019t human. After all, a human couldn\u2019t have a figure of such proportions.</p><br/><p>Her big, golden eyes, shapely nose, and pink-colored full lips made her look like a piece of art. Her flushed cheeks made her look healthy, and her long-ears added a magical charm to her otherworldly atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Her long, soft black hair flowed down to her waist, tied loosely by a ribbon, revealing its abundance. She looked like she just woke up, as she was wearing a see-through nightgown. Because of it, I didn\u2019t know where to direct my gaze. Her figure was shown fully, and her half-opened gown revealed her\u2026 uuuuu!</p><br/><p>\u201cL-Loretta, can you wear some proper clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes? Kyak!\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing what I said, Loretta looked down at herself and screamed. She then hastily ran into her room. Before I could talk with her, wearing her usual clothes, a bit more time had to pass.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I apologize, Shin-nim. I\u2019ve shown you a shameful sight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not at all. In fact, I would have wanted to see more of\u2026 hiik!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat will be 10 million gold, customer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because she had an incredibly embarrassed expression, I had no choice but to apologize.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason I invited Shin-nim to this place is...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason I invited Shin-nim to this place is...!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta didn\u2019t seem to want to accept my apology, as she continued without facing me. I was at a loss for what to do. Although she looked completely different on the outside, because the way she acted was the same, I couldn\u2019t help but smile as I watched her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you know, it will be convenient to find a place to stay in the dungeon\u2019s Residential Area. At the Residential Area, you can sell equipment or consumables, or buy items you need from other explorers. There are places where you can relieve fatigue built up from the dungeon as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>She picked up the teacup in front of her and took a sip. Although she looked graceful, her head was still turned away from me. She was very cute.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough Shin-nim had no problem climbing alone thus far, it won\u2019t stay like that forever. There is no place like the Residential Area to get closer to other worlds\u2019 explorers. When you make friends here, even though you might not party with them as you climb the dungeon, they might invite you to Event Dungeons or Raids, or vice versa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Shin-nim should know, if you entered the mansion. Unless Shin-nim gets authorized using a Mana Stone, Shin-nim cannot freely go back and forth between the dungeon and the Residential Area.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut finding a Mana Stone that\u2019s suitable for a Special Mansion like Marianne\u2019s Garden probably will not be possible for a while. So\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta hesitated slightly, then continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo if Shin-nim is okay with it, I\u2019d like to invite Shin-nim as Fairy Garden\u2019s temporary guild member.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTemporary guild member.\u201d</p><br/><p>She faced me. From the front, her explosive beauty came into view once again and made me flustered.</p><br/><p>Pointy ears, thin facial lines, a sharp nose and long neck. Such features made her look nonhuman, but they only added to her charm.</p><br/><p>Her sparkling golden eyes shone as if something was lighting it up from inside. I felt like staring into it would suck me in.</p><br/><p>\u201cA temporary guild member is\u2026 Shin-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yeah. Continue your explanation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Huhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta\u2019s expression became slightly haughty. Damn, this elf found out!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy were you staring at me so fixedly, Shin-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, nothing at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhung\u2026 huhu. Why were you looking at me so much? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta\u2019s eyes darted around my face as she spoke with a humming voice. Even if you do that, I won\u2019t tell you honestly! Saying that I was too enchanted by her beautiful eyes\u2026 Unless I wanted to confess to her and get rejected, I couldn\u2019t say it out loud.</p><br/><p>She continued making fun of me, trying to get me to confess, but because she lost her mystical beauty the more she did so, I was able to regain my composure. Eventually, she clicked her tongue and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cA temporary guild member isn\u2019t anything special. It\u2019s just someone who\u2019s registered with Fairy Garden\u2019s guild area and can thus stay here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, so that\u2019s why\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Although you can\u2019t become a full-fledged guild member because of your status as an explorer, it can at least help you go back and forth between the dungeon and the mansion since Shin-nim cannot get authorized for now. Of course, it won\u2019t be for free. In exchange for becoming a temporary guild member, Shin-nim will have to help with the paperwork of Fairy Garden\u2019s Master\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm\u2026 but Loretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta stopped her explanation in the middle and blinked her eyes as she looked at me. Since she already looked so excited to put me to work, I delivered the fatal blow.</p><br/><p>\u201cI already got authorized. For Marianne\u2019s Garden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI got authorized. There was an Event Raid on Earth. I got the entire corpse of an Event Raid boss, and it had a Mana Stone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 is that so\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta shoulders drooped. I didn\u2019t know for sure, but her long ears seemed to have drooped as well. With a slightly disappointed expression, she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, that\u2019s good. Yep, it\u2019s good\u2026 Stupid Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>I definitely heard it. She called me stupid. It wasn\u2019t like obtaining a Mana Stone was my fault. I answered Loretta with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must have a lot of work to do. So much that you need an assistant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that was just a preten\u2026 Ah, nothing! Yeah, I have lots!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much I can do if you\u2019re busy with work, but if you have time, come visit my mansion. I haven\u2019t even looked around it yet, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s at least a teahouse where Loretta and I can drink tea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta\u2019s ears perked up. As she blinked her golden eyes, she asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can go visit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-Then\u2026 can you add me to your friend list?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s possible!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I shot up from my seat in surprise. Loretta covered her mouth with her hands and snickered.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! We also belong to the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, what exactly is Loretta\u2019s identity?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a secret, for now. But I hope I can tell you one day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you?\u201d</p><br/><p>At my question, Loretta smiled lightly and nodded her head. Placing her index finger on my mouth, she quietly whispered.</p><br/><p>Although her fingers were tickling me, I couldn\u2019t open my mouth. Her golden eyes, which seemed to suck me in, were staring right at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne day, to you only. It\u2019ll be a secret to anyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>I left Loretta\u2019s log cabin. Loretta saw me off at the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake care, Shin-nim. Make sure to answer me when I message you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m off then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, um, Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I was about to turn away, Loretta stopped me. She held both of my hands, while her eyes wandered around me without being able to look at me directly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy real appearance. Is it strange?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cB-But\u2026 you didn\u2019t say it properly before.\u201d</p><br/><p>She really was a cute noona. For someone who had a noble charm on top of incredible beauty, she really should be more confident in herself. I thought she knew that by the way she acted, but I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d waver all the way at the end.</p><br/><p>Of course, I felt that this made her even more charming. As such, I decided to tell her how I felt without a hint of deceit.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot at all. You\u2019re incredibly beautiful. I was almost entranced.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHik!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta made a strange sound and plunked down on the ground. Girls really were weak to compliments. At her picture-like reaction, I snickered and turned away.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going. Message me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yes. I\u2019ll message you, I\u2019ll definitely message you! Even tomorrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you were busy\u2026 I should call Peika too\u2026 Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Strange. When I tried to pass on my intent through our mental connection, it was severed in the middle. Thinking our contract had been severed, my heart skipped a beat, but that wasn\u2019t it. The contract was still there. What was wrong? Why couldn\u2019t I communicate with her? When I tried to unsummon her in confusion, a series of messages rang out in my ear.</p><br/><p>[Your contracted elemental, Peika, and the fairies she was playing with discovered a hidden area of \u2018Fairy Garden!\u2019]</p><br/><p>[An Event Dungeon, \u2018Frozen Elemental\u2019s Prison,\u2019 has been created! As it was discovered by a contracted elemental, the contracted master will automatically receive the right to enter the dungeon! Would you like to enter the dungeon? This dungeon can only be entered by you.]</p><br/><p>[A quest has appeared!]</p><br/><p>[Quest \u2013 Save the Contracted Elemental!</p><br/><p>Description \u2013 While playing with the fairies and elementals at your request, your contracted elemental opened the entrance to Fairy Garden\u2019s sealed hidden area, almost as if guided by fate. The moment the hidden area was opened, the contracted elemental was sucked into the hidden area along with other fairies and elementals. Quickly save her! Otherwise, the mad ice elemental may freeze your elemental along with the other elementals and fairies!]</p><br/><p>\u2026 What!?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

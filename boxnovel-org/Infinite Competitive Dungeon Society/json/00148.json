What We Can Do (6)</p><br/><p>After my one-sided proclamation ended, we left the caf\u00e9 and jumped on Lotte\u2019s back. When I first tamed her, she refused to let others ride on her, but after getting used to the guild members and getting more familiar with me, she allowed this much.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will go too. It looks like the Guardian headquarter won\u2019t approve of you, but I want to see with my own eyes the skills you are so confident of.\u201d</p><br/><p>A young woman popped out from the crowd and asked to join us. She was another one of Korea\u2019s S rankers\u2026 But, of course, I couldn\u2019t remember her name. Feeling her glare, I nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure. You can follow us if you can.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Lotte won\u2019t let non-guild members ride her, you see.\u201d</p><br/><p>[If you asked me to let that whore ride on me, I would have eaten her whole.]</p><br/><p>Lotte muttered. I scratched her neck to calm her down and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cW-Wait! Yeon Hwawoo-ssi, Yeon Hwawoo-ssi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lotte flapped her wings. Not even the S rankers could resist the wind pressure. Lotte kicked off the ground and leaped up. The concrete ground crumbled, but Lotte was already flying.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, Yeon Hwawoo-ssi! I said, take me with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy god.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was a wind ability user!? That S ranker flew slightly slower than Lotte as she shouted at the top of her lungs. Plene, who was still stuck to my back, complained.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like that woman\u2019s voice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow women are going after him even though he\u2019s wearing a mask. What do we do about this man? Should we just wrap his head around with a boxing tape?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t turn me into a mummy!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m going to go faster.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, Lotte.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Mm.]</p><br/><p>When Lotte raised her speed, the woman fell behind for a moment, but soon, she sped up and continued to follow us. Looking at her, I realized she was holding the hands of the other two S rankers. I could see Woo Youngha\u2019s pale face clearly, as she grabbed him by his neck like she would to a cat. Seeing me show interest in the rankers, Hwaya introduced them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all in Guardian, which is why A+ rank is the highest in Korea\u2019s Freedom Wing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really know everything, Hwaya.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-Not everything. I just know what I have to\u2026 You need to know your enemy so you can prepare for them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnemy, huh\u2026 It sure is getting crazy, damn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumans biggest enemy is themselves, Kang Shin. You should have felt it in Britain. If you think everyone will come to your side after listening to you, you\u2019ll only be badly hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker said with a snort. Seeing him crossing his arms and gazing at the clouds, I felt that he looked a bit lonely. Then, I considered why he said that. Was he\u2026 worrying about me?</p><br/><p>I muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Are you actually a good guy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting. Screw off.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was certain Walker was changing. Perhaps one day, quicker than I would have thought, the contract might become unnecessary.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe important thing is that we\u2019re doing the right thing, son. Event Raids that break out when you least expect it, and Field Dungeons that resets a few months after being cleared. Didn\u2019t you experience them both with your own body? Event Dungeons cause too much harm. No matter how big the potential gain is, our work must continue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, father. I won\u2019t hesitate. I already made up my mind a month ago. Plus, I knew from the very beginning that what we were doing was right.\u201d</p><br/><p>I lightly smiled and retorted. I wasn\u2019t troubled about that at all. What I did today\u2026 although I couldn\u2019t be sure, I felt like it would go the way I wanted.</p><br/><p>Our first target was the S+ rank Event Dungeon. Coincidentally, it appeared in Yeungdeungpo. I was surprised Hwaya lasted until today with how stressed out she must have been.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, I\u2019m going to have to tell Mom to move. Shin, is there a house up for sale near yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but my mother will jump for joy, so please don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, the Event Dungeon appeared in the middle of a park. The park, of course, became off limits, and countless Guardian forces were protecting it. It was to prevent meaningless deaths.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Dragon Knight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis wyvern sure is huge!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-Is he really trying to enter this gate? Isn\u2019t he crazy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lotte flapped her wings midair and glared at the gate. Frightened by Lotte, they panicked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not enter! This place is under Guardian\u2019s jurisdiction and is not open to the public! If you want to enter, you must form a party and get approved by the government!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see!\u201d</p><br/><p>I politely responded to the voice coming from below.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t care!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lotte immediately charged into the gate.</p><br/><p>[You entered the S+ rank Event Dungeon, Forest of Rage.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s another forest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me there are more spiders\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this place is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe came in\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh? I turned around at the unfamiliar voices. Lo and behold, Korea\u2019s three S rankers were there! I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d really follow us into the gate!</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you went ahead without caring about us\u2026 It was hard catching up to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Good job, but you know this place is an S+ ranked dungeon, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, now that you mention it!\u201d</p><br/><p>There were no S+ rank Awakened in Korea. These three were all S rank Awakened. I wondered what gave them the confidence to march into this dungeon. At that moment, a roar rang out across the entire dungeon.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaang!]</p><br/><p>The S rankers became stiff. For the record, Walker also went stiff.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, if I die here, I\u2019ll reveal your evil deeds in my will, Kuuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t die, so don\u2019t worry, Walker.\u201d</p><br/><p>I grinned and took out my spear. Although Yeon Hwawoo was known to use his fists, he was just revealed to be the same person as Dragon Knight, who already fought against the drake with a spear. As such, it didn\u2019t matter even if I used a spear.</p><br/><p>Spinning the spear in my hand, I dispersed my mana into the surroundings. Then, I stopped not long after.</p><br/><p>\u201cI found it.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, a great breaking sound rang out from the forest.</p><br/><p>[Hero! I can feel the Hero\u2019s presence!]</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, get down and prepare. 11 o\u2019clock, 5 meters tall. It\u2019s charging straight at us. It looks like a close-ranged type, but a part of its body has mana clumped together, so it might be hiding a trump card.\u201d</p><br/><p>I concisely explained the information I gathered from mana detection, then began circulating Peruta Circuit. Ludia spread her arms out and cast Blessing on the party members. In an instant, the whirlpool around my spear became stronger.</p><br/><p>With a boom, the trees in front of us fell and it made its appearance. As I said before, it was 5 meters tall. Although it was shaped like a human, its skin was green and unnaturally muscular, while it had only one eye.</p><br/><p>\u201cCyclops!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hero, I will have the Herooo, kyakuk!]</p><br/><p>The Gluttony Spear I threw out easily turned the cyclops\u2019 head to dust. I hadn\u2019t even used Heroic Strike, so it really died in vain. I retrieved the Gluttony Spear by pulling on its mana and spoke to my companions.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll support you guys from above. They shouldn\u2019t be that hard from what I see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot that hard!? They weaken others by casting the fear status effect!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, you should block something like fearing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving the raging Walker be, I ordered Plene.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the cyclopes appear, sing your weakening song, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn, okay! The song where we all have fun together, right!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, Dragon Knight! What should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>She\u2019s asking me? What a smart woman!</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell you to fight, but since you decided to observe us, do it while you run away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You want us to run?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLotte, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>With just me on her back, Lotte flew up. Although the rankers probably wanted to ride on Lotte, I didn\u2019t even turn around as I flew forward. If I could fly in the dungeon, I was clearly better off fighting on Lotte. If I got into a serious fight on Lotte, not only would they vomit and get motion sickness, but they would also get thrown off.</p><br/><p>[What will you do, Hero?]</p><br/><p>\u201cMy guild members are strong. They should be able to take on two of them at once.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Then we should find groups of three or more.]</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lotte raised her flying speed. This dungeon was contained the one-eyed giants, cyclopes. Befitting the title of S+ rank, they had powerful strength, resistance against mana, and ability to weaken magic and aura. However, Mad Typhoon was greatly effective against such special traits.</p><br/><p>The endlessly spinning whirlpool of aura broke down their resistance and dealt special blows that were impossible to regenerate from. Peruta, who created this, was indeed worthy of being called a god.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaang!]</p><br/><p>\u201cGale Track!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kraaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>Lotte roared and charged. No matter how big the cyclopes were, Dark Wing Lotte was the biggest and strongest of all wyverns. Not even the cyclopes could block her charge. Imbued with a gale, the Gluttony Spear pierced through the cyclopes. The trees in Lotte\u2019s path all fell and marked our track.</p><br/><p>\u201cLotte, go there, where five of the mare gathered! I\u2019m using the final blow!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Understood, Hero!]</p><br/><p>After sending twenty cyclopes flying, a strong wind energy gathered around the Gluttony Spear, which had been strengthened by 140%. Even as Lotte charged forward, the energy flowing in from all sides transferred to the whirlpool of aura. The whirlpool almost looked like it was enveloping both Lotte and me.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yeah!]</p><br/><p>Looking at the cyclopes that got up from their rest and prepared to throw trees at us, I shouted my elemental\u2019s name. Peika instantly gathered golden lightning to the tip of my spear. It was a Thunder Bomb, which had all of her power concentrated.</p><br/><p>\u201cThunder Tempest!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unable to hold in my excitement, I shouted out the skill name. Immediately afterwards, I strongly clashed with the group of cyclopes. The force of the whirlpool mixed with the lightning and a violent explosion broke out.</p><br/><p>[Kiaaaaa\u2026!]</p><br/><p>[It was\u2026 the Hero\u2026!]</p><br/><p>The cyclopes standing in the front instantly died, and the ones behind them were also swept away by the explosion. Although the ground tremored loudly from their collapse, they were like music to my ears.</p><br/><p>I had become strong. Even an S+ rank dungeon was a playground for me. Delighted, I made a big smile, when suddenly\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are we supposed to do if you kill them all? We\u2019re practically just spectators!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya\u2019s voice rang out from far away. When I turned around, there were cyclopes in the path Lotte and I crossed. After using Gale Track, I had killed all the cyclopes I could see, so I forgot to leave some for the others.</p><br/><p>[S-Sorry. I went a bit too wild.]</p><br/><p>[No, you did well. It\u2019s better the more overwhelming you appear to them. You were cool.]</p><br/><p>[Scary basta\u2026 Kuuk!]</p><br/><p>Contrary to what she just shouted, Hwaya had a very satisfied tone in the guild communication channel. Although I hadn\u2019t planned on it, I had ended up showing the S rankers an effective show of force.</p><br/><p>Of course, not all cyclopes were dead. Other than the five cyclopes that ate the brunt of my final blow, others were collapsed on the ground with their limbs or chunks of their bodies torn apart. I then traced Gale Track\u2019s path and took care of the cyclopes left alive.</p><br/><p>\u201cD-Dragon Knight\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe killed these monstrous creatures in one blow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>After joining the others, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh, seeing the three rankers\u2019 change in expression. Although they were the only ones with that expression, once we finished cleaning up Korea\u2019s dungeons\u2026</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaa!]</p><br/><p>[Kill the Heroooo!]</p><br/><p>Because of the ruckus I caused, more and more cyclopes were gathering. I spun my spear around again as I turned around.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s finish within 3 hours. I want to get rid of the other three before the day breaks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTaking care of Korea in just one night. \u2026That sounds fun!\u201d</p><br/><p>Father grinned.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, you know, I have to guard your sister tomorrow, too\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo your best, Walker!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou devil! Kuaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker screamed. Startled, the S rankers backed off from Walker.</p><br/><p>I slightly pitied Walker, but only just a little.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Guardian (6)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Chapter 236. Guardian (6)</p><br/><p>Sion Empire was Sylon continent\u2019s centermost nation worthy of being called an empire. With its great power, it ceaselessly received tributes from the surrounding nations, and possessed a powerful army of knights and magicians that could protect the empire from humans and monsters that threatened its safety. Of course, most citizens of the Sion Empire were human.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore the Book Walkers\u2019 invasion, they were Selone Empire\u2019s enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrey elves, beautiful appearances, mesmerizing figures.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why are you short and un\u2014 Kuhuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmpire\u2019s people, adored grey elves\u2026 as sex slaves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy smacked my head and continued normally. I gritted my teeth and glared at her. Lin then spoke with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo the Book Walkers\u2019 invasion forced them to become allies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, they continued to fight. Those annoying bastards, got what they deserved.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy expressed her irritation by kicking the air with her enamel boots. Pockets of exploding air showed just how much she disliked Hydelcyon.</p><br/><p>\u201cLodert Hydelcyon, especially annoying. Creepy eyes. Thinking about him, even more annoying. Cancer, pervert.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why is this Sipua woman in love with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumans aren\u2019t born evil, he must have changed. Plus, if couples only looked at each other\u2019s personality, wouldn\u2019t all married couples be sages?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk.\u201d</p><br/><p>I only said asked a simple question and I was showing off my inexperience with dating\u2026! Between Daisy and Lin, isn\u2019t my position looking weak!?</p><br/><p>At the moment, we were in the galloping on Iana\u2019s back. Iana was as fast as Lotte who had evolved into a Blaze Queen. I was curious how such a small boar could be so fast, but it was actually quite simple. Daisy was focusing all of her magic power on Iana.</p><br/><p>As I said before, there wasn\u2019t much space on Iana\u2019s back. Thus, the three of us had to stick close together. Lin was in the front, I was in the middle, and Daisy was behind me holding onto my back.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, don\u2019t stick so close to me. You\u2019re giving off a weird scent and it\u2019s annoying me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying this too, Lin!? I\u2019ve been trying to control this thing too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you eat an air freshener or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make the same joke as my father!\u201d</p><br/><p>While I was yelling at Lin, Daisy spoke in a murmuring voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to, take out Laki.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLaki? What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a world\u2019s enemy we turned into an undead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin shouted, almost freaking out.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t! If you do, they\u2019ll notice us immediately!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though it\u2019s a weak one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWeak one my ass! There is no such thing when it comes to worlds\u2019 enemies! You, it looks like I need to give you another Hero training!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did you ever teach me!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wait, now that I think of it, he may or may not have given me some good advice here and there\u2026 As I didn\u2019t want to admit it, I just chucked it to the back of my mind. At that moment, Daisy cut in.</p><br/><p>\u201cBook Walkers, appear in groups. My information, already known. Will come to capture me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCapture you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBook Walkers, few females. Mating with other races, able to reproduce.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgek.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have my data. Will assume, easy capture.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy\u2019s expression was extremely calm as she said that. She told me not to use my power. Was she relying on Lin\u2019s unconfirmed strength? I tilted my head, and Daisy continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cData renewal, did not happen. Even with one level difference, it takes while, to adapt. From back then, I grew a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I get it now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEvil Eyes, god\u2019s true name, hard to calculate and adapt. True name holder, Evil Eye holder, I\u2019m only one in this continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo even if they know about god\u2019s true names and Evil Eyes, it\u2019s hard to record them in their books and come up with a countermeasure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s why, I can hold out for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>That seemed to be a common point between world\u2019s enemies. Although it was comparatively easy to counter the dungeon\u2019s system, powers that originated from the dungeon yet surpassed its control, god\u2019s true names, Evil Eyes, and Enigma were hard for them to counter\u2026 Although I had another question in mind, there was something else I wanted to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaisy, can I ask you something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I know the answer, sure\u2026 My breasts are big too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not curious about your chest size! And I already know its big!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 How did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou better answer well, Kang Shin. Where my bullet will go in will depend on your answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already decided that you\u2019ll shoot me!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I dug my own grave\u2026! I was just referring to the first time I saw Daisy! Damn, if Loretta found out about this, my eyes will be in danger again\u2026! I desperately changed the topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s important! My question is, are god\u2019s true names and Evil Eyes part of the dungeon\u2019s system?\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy tilted her head at my question and answered slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cEvil Eyes and true names, similar principle. An outside support, borrowing the dungeon\u2019s system.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you be more detailed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of a Beyond explorer, she knows her stuff. I\u2019ll explain the rest though.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin spoke as he took out a handgun. I was worried that he\u2019d shoot it at me, but thankfully, he aimed it up and shot empty air.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing there, righ\u2026 Ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you can feel it now? Right, there was a sentry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Iana accelerated the moment Lin\u2019s words left his mouth. From far away, a menacing killing intent was surging towards us. I could even feel magic. Lin shot bullet after bullet, annihilating each killing intent and spoke as if nothing was wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cGods from myths have once existed. We don\u2019t know the meaning of the divinity they obtained, but we know that they know many things, see many things, and exist at the same time in many eras. The only strange thing is that even though they can do all these things, they cannot appear with their real bodies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReal existences, real bodies\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven before the dungeon existed, there were those who obtained gods\u2019 true names. What the dungeon calls achievements, when one built them up until they reached a god\u2019s domain, the god bestowed that person with his name. When the dungeon was created\u2026 the Lord and the gods came to an agreement.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid the gods agree to accept achievements from the dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrecisely. The gods agreed to accept them, but they also set harsh requirements. After all, they couldn\u2019t give out their names to just anyone. People befitting their existences have to take their names for them to raise their divinity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean they\u2019re lending out their names to people who deserve them so they can spread their names far and wide?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like your intelligence stat isn\u2019t just for show. That\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin reloaded his gun in a smooth motion and continued to shoot. Daisy whispered in my ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t come up with, countermeasure. Can\u2019t see his attacks. If they die before writing on their books, it\u2019s meaningless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like that, it became easy for dungeon explorers to obtain gods\u2019 true names. But, they aren\u2019t part of the dungeon\u2019s power. A god\u2019s true name is a god\u2019s true name. Nothing more, nothing less. The dungeon\u2019s titles are lower grade copies of gods\u2019 true names.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I was shocked to hear that titles were lesser copies of gods\u2019 true names. However, Lin wasn\u2019t finished yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cEvil Eyes are by-products of myths. For example, let\u2019s see\u2026 Who does your world have known for its Evil Eyes of Petrification?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, the basilisk from European legends, the Medusa from the more famous Greek mythology\u2026 Ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s also Irish mythology\u2019s Balor of the Evil Eye, Judaism\u2019s Sariel\u2026 Do you get it now? Why Evil Eyes are treated so specially. Obtaining an Evil Eye is the same as obtaining a god\u2019s true name. Although there are other rewards in the dungeon that originates from myths or legends, other than Evil Eyes, most are lesser copies like the dungeon\u2019s titles. Some even say Evil Eyes are even harder to obtain than gods\u2019 true names.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Evil Eyes also\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey also carry bountiful divine power. They\u2019re different from the dungeon\u2019s objects. Even I don\u2019t have Evil Eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no way I would miss this chance.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy also joined in.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have them too, huhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis girl!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin\u2019s gunshots stopped and Iana stopped running so quickly. Before I even noticed, we had arrived in front of crumbled castle walls.</p><br/><p>\u201cEllian City. Resistance Army, if alive, all here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are still survivors in this world controlled by Book Walkers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderground base, sturdy. The greatest magic power left to humanity, all here\u2026 Lodert Hydelcyon, saw here last.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her words were like a finishing blow. Lin grinned.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell done. Bringing you along was the right choice, Grey Elf.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCall me, Ectradion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, Ectradion. Sipua is here, I can feel it. It looks like we\u2019ll get things over with today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rather than that, didn\u2019t that mean Lodert Hydelcyon is alive? He really was harder to kill than a cockroach. While I was feeling exhausted, Lin took out another handgun, held it in his right hand, and tensed up his shoulder. I couldn\u2019t help but ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre there that many?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike a nest of cockroaches. It\u2019s going to get annoying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me participate too. Kang Shin, just watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>In case I decided to fight, Daisy made a frightening expression, shoving her face up to mine and insisting solemnly. I quickly took a step back and nodded. I was being treated like a burden! While I shook my head, Daisy opened her inventory and took out a giant mantis. It was Meki.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeki will handle the front. You can go wild.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerfect. Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin immediately jumped over the crumbled castle wall and charged into the city. From all sides, Book Walkers began to make their appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe human we\u2019ve been waiting for!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe human who killed many of our kin is laughing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will take a long time to analyze his data!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe female who escaped last time came back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur data says that she\u2019s an excellent female. It looks like she grew even more!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin couldn\u2019t hold himself back and burst their heads open as he shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaaaak! These guys\u2019 way of talking irritates me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin\u2019s shots never missed their targets and had terrifying destructive power. No more than a single bullet was needed to kill a Book Walker. Since they were gathered here to find and kill the Resistance Army, they must have been elites amongst the Book Walkers, but Lin still only needed a single bullet to kill each one.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe cannot allow attacks and take down the damage! We must watch from afar and record!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cData remembers that a kin has established a safe distance!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDead! Already dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSounds good! More kin are coming out! We can analyze his data by writing down small pieces!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you! Meki!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Guoooooooooo!]</p><br/><p>Meki, the Mantis Queen that had been reborn as an undead, roared furiously and spread her wings open. At the same time, the aura of wind Meki shot out sliced apart a few of the weaker Book Walkers. The Mantis Queen also had gotten stronger after becoming an undead!</p><br/><p>\u201cMeki, kill the recorders!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Guooooo!]</p><br/><p>Meki roared in confirmation and charged towards the Book Walkers. Every time Meki\u2019s giant scythe sliced through the air, the buildings left standing were cut down along with the heads of Book Walkers.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat one\u2019s strong too! A form we had no record of!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA powerful cutting power! We require resistance to cutting power!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe require a special entity! Resistance won\u2019t cut it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know when new kin will be born! We don\u2019t know if any kin knows when that is!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s two days later! We must input new data!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTime, I won\u2019t give you!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Daisy\u2019s shout, Meki got even faster. Meki swung her scythes almost as quickly as Lin fired his guns. No, perhaps, Meki was even quicker. While I watched the Book Walkers being torn apart, Daisy spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe moment they record, everyone obtains resistance. What\u2019s scarier is, newly born entities. Transcends resistance, an ability akin to total immunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo the ones born later are stronger.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. They learn, they evolve, in the blink of an eye.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no end to them, damn it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrevent them from taking records, defeat a suitable amount. Then, move to underground passageway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin became faster. The Book Walkers, who were on the defensive trying to write down Lin\u2019s and Meki\u2019s movements, quickly had their heads cut off.</p><br/><p>\u201cObservation recording, not accurate, but still forms resistance. If possible, eliminate all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s break through first!\u201d</p><br/><p>We cut down all the Book Walkers blocking our way and charged into the city. The Book Walkers\u2019 endless appearances made me reminisce the Panan continent\u2019s nightmare, but none of them could do anything against Lin\u2019s bullets and Meki\u2019s scythe. However, it was frightening that more and more of them were beginning to dodge Meki\u2019s attacks.</p><br/><p>\u201cResistance, beginning to build up. Meki\u2019s movement pattern, must change.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the observation recording you mentioned?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. Abilities used even a little bit, Book Walkers will write down. Impossible to prevent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy spoke as she gritted her teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo prevent it, an ability transcending ordinary comprehension is needed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGods\u2019 true names and Evil Eyes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Kang Shin\u2019s power, Enigma. Or that Dragon Horn\u2019s power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDragon Horn!? Did you just call me Dragon Horn!?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Meki, who had just shot out two aura blades with her scythes and completely decimated the Book Walkers in the front, unexpectedly charged towards us. While the Book Walkers assumed their observation recording stance, Daisy rolled on the ground. Meki had disappeared into her inventory\u2026</p><br/><p>And we had unknowingly entered underground.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

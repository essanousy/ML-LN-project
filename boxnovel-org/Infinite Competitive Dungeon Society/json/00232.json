Guardian (2)</p><br/><p>After the fight was over and confirming that there wasn\u2019t even a single monster remaining in the Philippines, we returned home on the plane we put in Hwaya\u2019s inventory. Although everyone was exhausted, we were full of smiles knowing that we had achieved more than what we came to do. That said, a few were still unhappy.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy own son is ignoring his father\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Father\u2019s mumbling as he leaned against his seat, I flinched. However, to my surprise, Walker who had his body buried deep into his seat stood up for me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be ignored, get yourself a god\u2019s true name, Kang Yungoong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s easy, why don\u2019t you do it, Walker?\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker retorted to Father\u2019s rebuttal with a grin.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. People should know where they belong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEdward says that, but he was vexed too. He doesn\u2019t like getting left out of things, you see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that you mention it, he did come to our raids when we didn\u2019t call him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t spread false rumors, Sophie.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Yua\u2019s expression continued to be heavy. It was because of the Lava King\u2019s Egg I gave her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the right to take this, Oppa. Everyone got hurt because of me, and many succubi even died\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knew the Philippines would have such a monster? It\u2019s not Yua\u2019s fault.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was nothing I could do. I thought I could be of help to Oppa now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all the more reason you should take it. Yua is the most suitable one for raising whatever monster that comes out of the egg.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Yua\u2019s dejected look, I patted her head. Who would like hurting others because of something they said or did? Although Yua couldn\u2019t be blamed for what happened, she couldn\u2019t help but feel pained. However, nothing would change by staying dejected. If I put it a bit stronger, it was foolish.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of Yua, we discovered the Lava King sooner and defeated him. The sacrifice we had to make in the process is regrettable, but it\u2019ll be fine as long as Yua doesn\u2019t forget about it. You can get stronger for the remaining succubi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yes, Oppa. I will.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yua\u2019s expression became slightly brighter. Good, once she had a clear goal, she would undoubtedly march forward without losing sight of herself.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Ye-Eun who was standing up from her seat behind us spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come you get strangely smarter and kinder whenever you talk to Yua?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you implying I\u2019m mean and stupid when I\u2019m talking to you and the others?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOwwww!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even while I punished Ye-Eun appropriately, the plane was soaring to its destination. For the record, Leon was piloting the plane for the way back instead of Walker. Why were all the men in our guild so able!?</p><br/><p>After we returned to Korea, we were showered with countless camera flashes. Of course, I simply ignored them. The most important thing right now was to get some rest. We had reclaimed an entire country. It wasn\u2019t something that people would forget because we stayed quiet for a day or two. Furthermore, there were more important things we had to tend to.</p><br/><p>We decided to hold the funeral for the six dead succubi at the resort area. The main reason was that it was the most environmentally beautiful place we knew. As the dead succubi didn\u2019t leave behind any corpses, we buried an empty coffin along with gifts we had for the parted.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband should already know this, but funerals aren\u2019t part of succubi\u2019s tradition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMakes sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn, because our existences are like morning dew, disappearing the moment we die\u2026 That\u2019s why this feels so unfamiliar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy. That even though we won\u2019t leave anything behind, everyone here will remember us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLicorice\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I had not known her for a long time, because she had always shown her playful side, the current her felt extremely unfamiliar. However, Licorice was the Succubus Queen, naturally having lived for a much longer time than me. She had undoubtedly experienced much more and had grown much more. Perhaps because these thoughts were written on my face, Licorice made a small smile and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot long after I was born in Enesis, I became the Succubus Queen. It was really only luck that I was born with this bloodline.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. But immediately after that, my world lost its power. At a young age, I had to lead my clan to cross over to Elesia. For the sole purpose of obtaining a world\u2019s power, I claimed countless lives without knowing good or evil.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice stared at the tombstone we placed and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the time, there was only one thing on my mind \u2013 my clan. We had to survive. We had to survive. That was the only thing I could think of. That\u2019s why when even a single member dies, I lose my reason and go wild\u2026 You saw it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the war ended and I realized that we\u2019d lost\u2026 I negotiated with the Lord and found shelter in a place isolated from the dungeon. In truth, I just wanted to rest a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I knew I couldn\u2019t stay like that forever. If I did, the entire clan would simply wither away. I knew a day would come when we would have to fight again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether I was on the side of the humans or the monsters, whether I was on the defending side or the attacking side, none of that mattered. What mattered was that my clan survived, just that. Ah, no. I would be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t looking forward to meeting the man who would become my husband. You see, the one regret I had was never having even touched a man\u2019s hands after being born as a succubus. Huhu, I was scared on one hand, but my heart also fluttered on the other\u2026 That\u2019s how I waited for Dear Husband.\u201d</p><br/><p>For that part, Licorice spoke as she looked at me coquettishly. Unable to find the words to respond, I scratched my face awkwardly.</p><br/><p>The attacking side and the defending side, monsters and humans. Which side was at fault? That, I didn\u2019t know. I had always struggled to protect the place I belonged, and the only thing that had changed was that there were more people I had to protect. Of course, Licorice and her clan included. That\u2019s why the fact that those I had to protect died made me\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t need blame yourself, Dear Husband. We had long since prepared ourselves for this fight and this sacrifice. We never even dreamed of surviving until the end without any casualty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Did she also have the Evil Eyes Daisy had? I stared at Licorice with doubtful eyes, but she only gave me an enchanting smile in return. In the end, I sighed and retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Will you continue to fight with us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Dear Husband dies, I\u2019ll die too. Plus, I have to avenge the dead clan members! Don\u2019t ask such obvious questions, Stupid Husband.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one who calls people stupid is the stupid one! \u2026 In any case, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, I\u2019m happy to have met Dear Husband. I\u2019m glad that my husband is you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her expression was too happy for me to nitpick about when I had become her husband. I told myself to address that problem later and shut my mouth. However\u2026 I also had a feeling that I might have to change my stubbornness in this regard.</p><br/><p>Once the funeral ended, I visited Fairy Garden for the first time in a while. Of course, I only had one goal. That was to give Pure Black Desire to Lin for repair. However, when I visited Lin\u2019s workshop, a shocking scene entered my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin\u2026 Lin is working on his own accord!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m! A! Blacksmith! You! Damned! Bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin retorted to the beat of his hammer with a stronger force behind each strike. Curious as to what he was making, I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you working on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t! Anyone! Taught! You! Not! To! Talk! To! Someone! Who\u2019s! In! The! Middle! Of! Working!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Lin\u2019s different than those novice blacksmiths. Plus, why should anyone wait four to five hours to see a blacksmith? It\u2019s not like they have anything to learn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin\u2019s shouting suddenly stopped. I thought he would put on an aloof act next, but that didn\u2019t seem to be the case. He put down his hammer and dipped a red-hot piece of metal in water to cool it down.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA ring.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor me!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, have you been hit by a hammer before? Are you trying to have a taste?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though I had gotten much stronger than the first time I had met Lin, I still had no confidence to win against him. He seemed weaker than Loretta, but he was still a Transcendent who had far surpassed my level. As such, I declined his offer politely and asked again.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo who is it for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoka.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLokanyan!?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I looked at him with a shocked face, Lin responded awkwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, we got one. It\u2019s a bit late, but I thought I should make her a ring.\u201d</p><br/><p>For a moment, I tried to process what he just said. Then, I spoke with a blank expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations, Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou understood with just that? Damn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think that Lin would become a father\u2026 Pfft.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, you don\u2019t think a hammer is enough and want to try the anvil?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForgive me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin looked at the completed ring. Then, he began the detailed refining process as he breathed out fire from his mouth. In this entire world, the only person\u2026 no, draconian who would make a ring like this would be Lin. I asked Lin again.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Lin, um\u2026 how?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI always planned on taking responsibility for Loka\u2026 It\u2019s just that we haven\u2019t gotten a baby until now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the most surprising thing I heard out of your mouth\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot that I won\u2019t do it with other women.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the worst thing I heard out of your mouth\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Light flashed. Lin was imbuing the ring with magic as he was refining it. It let me realize once again how skilled he was as a blacksmith and as a magician.</p><br/><p>Even as he was performing such a difficult task, he yapped endlessly in response.</p><br/><p>\u201cMen with both ability and charm are few in number, and all women want such men. If they want me, I\u2019ll give myself to the women I like. I\u2019ll be able to enjoy myself, and the women will be happy too. It\u2019s killing two birds with one stone. You shouldn\u2019t think too hard either. I heard from Noonim that it\u2019s quite crazy. No one\u2019s doubting that you\u2019re a Hero, you don\u2019t have to bring so many women around\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never be able to do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen just do what you want. But know this. What will happen to the women who are only looking at you is up to you. It\u2019ll be nice if they\u2019ll leave for other men, but there are surprisingly many women who can\u2019t do that. Not everyone can be like Loretta Noonim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard she has a\u2026 first love.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you hoping girls you throw away will remember you for hundreds and thousands of years? Then you\u2019re the worst.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, your Loretta\u2019s Noonim\u2019s new love found with great difficulty. You managed to make Noonim fall for you when she had given up on love, but if you make her sad again\u2026 I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The killing intent that shot out for a moment made me flinch. I realized once again how much I had grown. If it was in the past, I wouldn\u2019t have noticed anything, even if I fell under a status effect. Lin seemed to have noticed that too as the corner of his mouth twisted up to a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying it. Well, if you have the ability, it\u2019s best to just accept everyone. It\u2019s not like Noonim will give up at this point just because there are one or two more women.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin\u2019s values and mine are too different.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, we lived in a different world after all. In the world I came from, strength was all that mattered. Those with power would be forgiven no matter what they did, and those without power chose a master to protect their bodies and minds. The lucky ones were the ones who could make the choice for themselves. Most didn\u2019t have such luck\u2026 There were many men who took up women, and also many women who took up men. I was especially strong, so many wanted to come under me. Amongst them, women paid with their bodies.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time Lin had said anything about his world. I became a bit curious, and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo did you accept them all?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you crazy? I have eyes too. Plus, what am I going to do if I accept every girl that comes to me? If I was lax about that kind of stuff, I would have never see the end of it. If you don\u2019t have feelings for them, you have to cut them off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was kind of like your current guild. I only accepted those with abilities. Of course, they weren\u2019t just women, but men too. There were also many that I simply protected, and I didn\u2019t always make them my women or servant. I had my fair share of troubles you see. Also, it\u2019s not like I could take them with me wherever I went.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWas Lokanyan also\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou could say that she was my first ally.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you done asking now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m still curious about a lot of things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen bring a good bottle of wine later. The rest won\u2019t be free.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin cooled down his ring and scrutinized it to check that everything was perfect. Then, as if satisfied, he sighed and put away the ring somewhere. Then, he took out of a cigarette from a place different than the place he had stored his ring. Finally, he tilted his head and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, what are you here for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRepair my Pure Black Desire, Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaaaaak! More work!? Come on, just how did you poke holes in a Legend grade armor!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see, I fought a weak world\u2019s enemy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat weak world\u2019s enemy? There is no such thing! Uuuu, I should have chased you out the moment I saw you!\u201d</p><br/><p>I suddenly felt much better. When I met Lin, I really had to see his troubled face!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

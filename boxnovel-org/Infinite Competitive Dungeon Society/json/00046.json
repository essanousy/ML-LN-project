It seems there will be no further effect if you consume more of the same item.]</p><br/><p>The moment the 10th increase appeared for Muscle Strengthening Elixir, I saw my strength and dexterity increase by 3 for a total of 12. Combined together, they were almost 5 levels worth of stats.</p><br/><p>[Name: Kang Shin \u00a0 \u00a0 Race: Human \u00a0 \u00a0 Sex: Male</p><br/><p>Class: Elementalist (Sub \u2013 Skill Collector) \u00a0 \u00a0 Title: Lizard Knight Master \u00a0 \u00a0 Rank: Silver 9</p><br/><p>Level: 21</p><br/><p>HP \u2013 7,650/7,650 \u00a0 \u00a0 MP \u2013 5,460/5,460</p><br/><p>Strength \u2013 70(+22) \u00a0 \u00a0 Dexterity \u2013 63(+15) \u00a0 \u00a0 Constitution \u2013 60(+15)</p><br/><p>Intelligence \u2013 20(+5) \u00a0 \u00a0 Magic \u2013 77(+5) \u00a0 \u00a0 Charm \u2013 45(+5) \u00a0 \u00a0 Luck \u2013 21(+5)</p><br/><p>Normal Skill \u2013 High-rank Martial Arts (Lv 1), High-rank Spear Technique (Lv 4), Peruta Circuit (Lv 4), Mid-rank Heroic Strike (Lv 3), Low-rank Provoke (Lv 9), Return (Lv 1), Deific Manifestation</p><br/><p>Class Skill \u2013 Low-rank Spirit Mastery (Lv 9), Low-rank Spirit Aura (Lv 6), Low-rank Elemental Control (Lv 7), Low-rank Elemental Contract (Lv 7), Low-rank Elemental Tempest (Lv 8), Thunder Beast (Lv 1)</p><br/><p>Subclass Skill \u2013 Endow Skill, Spirit of the Collector]</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, 22 bonus stats just in strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>5 from the title\u2019s effect, 2 from the Power Earring I obtained on the 5th floor, 10 from the Lizard Knight set effect.</p><br/><p>The other 5 came from Black Earthen Spear, which had a cheaty effect of increasing my strength by 5 and dexterity by 10. As expected of a reward from an A-rank dungeon.</p><br/><p>There was more. All attacks done with the spear applied poison damage, and poisoned the enemy with a fixed chance!</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t regret picking the Black Earthen Spear at all. Although it had not been long since I got my Silver Spear, it was simply incomparable to the Black Earthen Spear, both in terms of stat bonuses and extra effects.</p><br/><p>\u201cThough I\u2019d love to enter another Event Dungeon\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After Korea\u2019s Gate suddenly disappeared, other countries went on high alert and increased the security on their Gates. Although many countries investigated why Korea\u2019s Gate disappeared, unless a dungeon explorer told them, they had no way of knowing. Mastiford had also gone on TV to warn the world about the danger of Gates.</p><br/><p>With the excuse that she saw it in her dream when she awakened, she warned that a disaster might strike if they were cleared hastily. Her words had also increased security around the Gates.</p><br/><p>As there was no guarantee that a raid boss would not appear, I couldn\u2019t just randomly clear an Event Dungeon. Even if I knew a raid boss wouldn\u2019t appear, there was no way for me to enter an Event Dungeon without being found out by other countries, not unless I had Mastiford\u2019s help, anyways. Knowing stat points and other delicious rewards waited, I could not do anything about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo there\u2019s only one thing I can do.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at the scene in front of me and grabbed a handful of popcorn, which I took out from my inventory. Then, I shouted in a mumble, \u201cKeep going Ren!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince! I hate you!\u201d Ren shouted as he frantically \u2018parried\u2019 the Lizard Knight\u2019s attack with his claymore. That was right. I was currently watching Ren\u2019s one-on-one fight against the Lizard Knight. It was a fight that really had you on the edge of your seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give up! Put more strength into your legs!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgaaaaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren squeezed out all the strength he could muster as he swung his claymore. His form had been honed through 3 weeks of training. As he had an abnormally high strength from the beginning, if he learned enough techniques, there was a good chance he could defeat the Lizard Knight alone.</p><br/><p>In truth, the \u2018thrashing phase\u2019 was supposed to last a full month. However, there was no need to break my promise with Palludia and stay for one more week.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe tail\u2019s coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I yelled out, Ren instantly reacted and slid toward the Lizard Knight. The tail swung empty air, and having approached the Lizard Knight, Ren rushed into close quarters of the Lizard Knight whose form had been disrupted from swinging its tail. Then, he shouted as he raised his claymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cLion Upper!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKahak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood!\u201d</p><br/><p>I clapped. Not facing the enemy directly, but going for a fatal blow using the inevitable opening the enemy created. That was at the core of my teaching. Ren had just done exactly that.</p><br/><p>Realizing I had succeeded in putting down his hot-blooded temper, I felt like crying tears of joy. With this, he could proudly say he had passed the thrashing phase.</p><br/><p>\u201cShiiik! Human, die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs if! Lion Strike!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though I was eating popcorn as I cheered Ren on, I tensed up when the Lizard Knight raised its spear. If Ren failed, I had to jump in and pick up where he left off. It was why I was here in the first place.</p><br/><p>However, it seemed I had worried for nothing. Ren used the perfect skill for the occasion, making the Lizard Knight let go of his spear. When he became flustered, Ren\u2019s attack poured in.</p><br/><p>\u201cLion Cross Attack!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ren really likes lions.\u2019 Thinking absent-mindedly, I watched a cross-shaped wound appear on the Lizard Knight\u2019s chest. It was deep. He didn\u2019t consume elixirs by grinding Floor Masters like me, so why was he so strong? Even though I raised my strength with the Muscle Compressing Elixir and Muscle Strengthening Elixir, I felt like I would lose by a slight margin if I compared my strength with Ren directly.</p><br/><p>As I tried to wrap my head around this mystery, Lizard Knight used Dragon Skin. At this point, Ren started using the tactic I had taught him.</p><br/><p>That is, he picked up the Lizard Knight\u2019s spear faster than he could, and ran away.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive it back, Human!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, Lizard Knightttt!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren picked up my way of talking as well. I called it the IED (Intermittent Explosive Disorder[1. behavioral disorder characterized by explosive outbursts of anger and violence, often to the point of rage, that are disproportionate to the situation at hand (e.g., impulsive screaming triggered by relatively inconsequential events).]) Reflection. It was because monsters who heard it would almost die from IED. I wondered if the dungeon would let that become a status effect. Today, Ren\u2019s and my Provoke skill proficiency was diligently increasing.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive it to me now, Human!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I ever would!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Lizard Knight became slower in his Dragon Skin state. As such, he always used his earthquake attack to deal great damage. However, if you made him drop his spear, he would always try to pick up his spear first.</p><br/><p>If you took his spear and ran away, the Lizard Knight would always chase after the one who took it. He could try to use his hands to attempt the earthquake attack, but he never did, no matter what. He always tried to get his spear back.</p><br/><p>With the 50 percent decrease in speed from Dragon Skin, it was hard to catch up to someone focused on running away. Even so, he chased after Ren with his reddened skin. Against such a horrifying sight, the one running away would also be motivated to run faster. Since the runner would die the moment he was caught, he quite literally ran with his life on the line.</p><br/><p>The result was a game of tag that made any spectators watching laugh hysterically.</p><br/><p>\u201cRen, I can see your legs!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you couldn't see my legs, I\u2019d be a ghost, not a human! Uhuk, he\u2019s going to get me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHUMAAAAAN!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Lizard Knight roared as he chased after Ren. Oh! Ren was getting faster! Humans truly showed greatest growth in the most desperate situations. I came to such conclusion as I shoved some more popcorn in my mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cH-HUMAAAAN!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not deaf, you lizard bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKushaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren and the Lizard Knight were making laps around the wide boss room. The Lizard Knight, who saw me in the middle of chasing Ren, came after me as if to finish me off first. When I grabbed him and sent him flying back, he coughed up blood, got back up while shaking his head, and continued chasing Ren. It seemed he instinctively understood that he was no match for me without his spear. When the Lizard Knight began chasing him again, Ren frowned and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnfair, Crown Prince! Why are you so relaxed!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not relaxed at all, Ren. In fact, I\u2019m tensed. My hands are all sweaty from thinking about whether you\u2019ll be caught or not. Nom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that as you eat popcorn!\u201d</p><br/><p>Their running competition ended in less than 5 minutes. Once Dragon Skin had worn off, the Lizard Knight had caught up to Ren.</p><br/><p>\u201cI caught you, Human!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who caught you!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Ren instantly turned around and threw the spear randomly at his face. The Lizard Knight instinctively grabbed the spear, then made a regretful expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cLion Rage Rush!\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately afterwards, Ren\u2019s claymore radiating with a golden aura pierced its chest. It was a clean and powerful strike.</p><br/><p>Although the Lizard Knight tried to strike down at Ren with his spear, his trembling arms no longer had any strength. In the end, he dropped his head without ever stabbing Ren. He was dead.</p><br/><p>[You defeated the Floor Master!]</p><br/><p>[10,000 gold is distributed evenly among party members. You received 5,000 gold.]</p><br/><p>Holding his claymore, Ren stood still silently. I clapped as I put the popcorn away.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations, Ren.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You defeated him alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026 Huhuhuhu. Thank you, thank you, Crown Prince! I never thought I would succeed in hunting the Lizard Knight alone!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren raised his claymore into the air with a happy expression. I also smiled and responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did well. Well, you\u2019ll have to do it again by yourself if you want to receive the special reward and title.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren looked at me with a blank expression, then asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I see\u2026 Then what was this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe thrashing phase graduation test.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing my words, Ren became silent for a long time. His hands holding the claymore trembled as he opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cA-Are you saying\u2026 that I have to do another Floor Master solo raid?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep. You did it once, who\u2019s to say you can\u2019t do it again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren slowly turned to face me. His hands were holding his claymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cCROWN PRINCEEE!\u201d</p><br/><p>Smacking my lips, I cleaned the popcorn crumbs on my mouth. Getting up with my spear in hand, I mumbled regretfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, it hasn\u2019t been fully fixed yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>3 weeks. Although the time I spent with Ren was short, it was enough to form a close bond between us. Standing in front of the Floor Shop, I shook hands with Ren, who currently looked like a mess.</p><br/><p>\u201cI taught you everything I could. If you succeed in the Lizard Knight solo raid, you can go around calling yourself a warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Crown Prince. But it hurts where you hit me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou reap what you sow. Alright, then. I wish you luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Before you go, there\u2019s something I want to confess.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but I\u2019m into women.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like women too! That\u2019s not the confession I\u2019m talking about!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren shouted angrily. I laughed at his predictable reaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what confession are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 not human.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh? That wasn\u2019t what I expected at all. Not knowing how to respond, I just stiffened with my smiling face. Ren then put strength in his body with a humph.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, two triangular tufts of fur appeared. No, rather than tufts, those were ears.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Ears?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a beastman. You\u2019ve probably heard of them before. A race that possesses the traits of both beast and human.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019ve heard of werewolves before. Ones that turn into wolves under the full moon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFull moon? I\u2019m not sure what you mean, but I am the last surviving member of the lion beastman, called werelions. Although we can\u2019t turn into lions, we do have strength that vastly surpasses that of humans. In exchange, our wild nature explodes out often\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>So that\u2019s why he was so strong! The mystery had been solved completely. A race possessing traits of both human and beast. As I was thinking rather stupid things like how Panan continent also had lions, I noticed Ren\u2019s lion ears twitch. With Ren\u2019s handsome, but not at all cute, face, it created somewhat of a weird combination. Looking at it, I could feel something boiling inside of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cRen, put away your ears.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince, why are you holding up your spear? Why are you pointing it at me?\u201d</p><br/><p>I shouted at Ren who was asking such an obvious question.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need animal ears from men!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUwoaaah! C-Calm down! Uwaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like that, it would take a little longer until Ren could go do his solo raid.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for everything. I\u2019ll report to you once I succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoodbye, Ren. Try not to take your ears out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, I have no plans to show them to anyone other than Crown Prince. Then, I\u2019m off.\u201d</p><br/><p>After confirming that we had each other on our friend lists, we disbanded the party. Ren returned to the dungeon he came from. Confirming that he had disappeared, I let out a deep sigh. Now that a comrade I spent some time with was gone, I felt a little empty. Unconsciously, I mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m alone again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean alone, Shin-nim? I\u2019m disappointed.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I turned around, I saw Loretta with her elbows on her shop desk and her chin on her hand, staring at me with her oval eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been by your side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, sorry, Loretta. You\u2019re right. It\u2019s us two again. I feel a bit happy since Loretta pointed it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because I felt like a connection other than that of shopkeeper and customer existed between us, I felt happy. Hearing my words, Loretta\u2019s face reddened. Then, as if to hide her face, she put her hands over it.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim. You did that on purpose, right? You did it fully knowing everything, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKnowing what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaaaah! You\u2019re really frustrating! Go away, don\u2019t come back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if I do, I\u2019ll see you again on the 21st Floor Shop.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care! Just go for now! Ah before you go, here\u2019s Holy Water! 1,500 gold per bottle!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still selling!? Your business spirit is astonishing as always!\u201d</p><br/><p>A woman\u2019s heart was indeed complicated. I didn\u2019t know just which rhythm to beat to! I climbed to the 21st floor grumbling. In my hand were five bottles of Holy Water, which was 7,500 gold.</p><br/><p>There was one week left. To appease the little crown princess\u2019s anger, it was time for me, who wasn\u2019t some knight nor hero, to run to the 25th floor!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

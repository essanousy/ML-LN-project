I smiled bashfully in response.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been two hours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim\u2026 You became level 25 in just two hours\u2026 How?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder? Hahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I smiled awkwardly, Loretta puffed her cheeks angrily. She then reached forward with her hands and pinched my cheeks. It didn\u2019t hurt at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was worried. That Shin-nim would go wild without heed to my warning. It was just as I expected, too. Though, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d actually succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ghouls couldn\u2019t get through my defense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa, really, what am I going to do with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta let go of my cheeks and let out a deep sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you understand, Shin-nim? Shin-nim just leveled up four times in just 7 hours. I assume you already distributed your level-up stat points. No matter how confident you are in your physical ability, you won\u2019t be able to fully bring out the power of level 25 for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of the update, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. I don\u2019t even need to ask, but you were planning on going through the 25th floor and challenging the Floor Master right away, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>I flinched at her pinpoint accuracy. To be honest, I was feeling quite self-confident after breaking all the way through the 24th floor. I remembered my fight with the 20th Floor Master, and was excited from thinking about the reward I would get for being the first to defeat the 25th Floor Master solo in my first try. I planned to keep running forward\u2026 but it seemed my plans were discovered. As expected, after 5 years of watching over me, Loretta knew me quite well.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way. You need to rest. Just do some light exercise if you want to work out. For at least 5 hours! Although even 5 hours shouldn\u2019t be enough, with Shin-nim\u2019s physical ability, you\u2019ll at least grow somewhat used to it. Make sure you rest for 3 hours afterwards. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI got it, so don\u2019t look at me with such scary eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I smiled bitterly. Then, I remembered the message I got when I broke through the 24th floor. The message that asked me to make a choice. I decided to ask Loretta about it since I was curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, if you had to choose between Hermes and Incarnation of Light, which would you choose?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? What an interesting question. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta became absorbed in thought. She had her index finger on her cheek and was tapping on it as she thought seriously about my question. It seemed she had soon come to a decision as she told me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe incarnation of an element, or a god. Although I\u2019d prefer to choose the element, the other side isn\u2019t an incarnation, but a god\u2019s name. In that case, there\u2019s really only once choice. A god\u2019s true name possesses his equivalent power. So Hermes. Hermes is what I\u2019d choose.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. I didn\u2019t really understand though.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I said that, Loretta gave me a cute grin, as if to say \u2018that\u2019s what I thought.\u2019 She then asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did Shin-nim hear about that? Regardless of which myth, to hear a god\u2019s name in the dungeon, you should at least be on the 50th floor\u2026 Are you friends with a Gold rank explorer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, no, I\u2019ve just been told to choose between those two titles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know, between Hermes and Incarnation of Light.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWHAT!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta\u2019s eyes quickly widened. Then she grabbed my shoulders abruptly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHermes! Hurry, hurry! Before another miracle happens and some other explorer takes the true name before Shin-nim! Hurry!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO-Okay! I\u2019ll choose Hermes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as I was being shaken by Loretta, I made my will known. In that instant, a fanfare rang out.</p><br/><p>[You became the first explorer on Earth to obtain a god\u2019s true name! Congratulations! For accomplishing this Grand Achievement, you receive 3 skill points. Current skill points: 9]</p><br/><p>[You obtained the title \u2018Hermes.\u2019 Your speed increases by 15 percent. All stats increase by 5. You obtained the qualification. Your affinity to all elements increases, and your affinity to the wind element increases greatly. Once per day, you can summon \u2018Talaria\u2019 for 10 minutes. Talaria allows you to step in the air freely and even fly. However, when inside the dungeon, you cannot use it for the pure purpose of moving around. As your body familiarizes itself to the true name, more abilities will become open.]</p><br/><p>\u201cD-Did you get it? Did you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I earned the Hermes title, I felt my body become significantly lighter. Even taking into account two of the three deleted titles that raised my speed by 6 percent, my speed rose by 9 percent. It wasn\u2019t too surprising that my body felt so light. Not to mention, my strength and dexterity went up by 5 each as well.</p><br/><p>Being able to move 15 percent quicker was nice. That said, it seemed I would need more than one or two days to get used to this speed. In fact, until I grasped my physical ability in detail and knew every little change to it, I felt this ability would do more harm than good for a little while. In exchange, once I got used to the change, the increase in my strength would be incomparable to if someone else received the same ability.</p><br/><p>Plus, there was Talaria. It was the name of Hermes\u2019 winged sandals. Although it was only for 10 minutes every day, being able to fly had great benefits. Of course, this would also take more than a day or two to get used to.</p><br/><p>Most important was the fact that there was more I hadn\u2019t unlocked. As my body familiarized itself to the true name\u2026 that short statement was crucial. I would be getting more abilities in the future. I was dazed. I didn\u2019t even know why I was able to obtain Hermes. It was a title in a completely different league than the titles from the 21st through 23rd floors.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think you\u2019d really obtain Hermes\u2019s true name. You did it, Shin-nim! You obtained the qualification!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat qualification?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUt! Ah\u2026 mm\u2026 That\u2019s a secret for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018As I thought.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t help but smile. A god\u2019s true name must represent something other than just raw stats. I could just slowly find out. If it was necessary to me right now, I knew Loretta would have explained it to me.</p><br/><p>Hermes\u2019 true name was certainly an amazing ability. But in a way, although it was amazing, it wasn\u2019t enough to completely change my identity. It was important that I didn\u2019t get too self-confident. Although I might be the first to have obtained Hermes\u2019 true name, Earth shouldn\u2019t be the only world with myths. In that case, it wouldn\u2019t be weird if there were other dungeon explorers who obtained the true names of gods from their myths.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would Hermes appear here? Ah, I see. Hermes is the messenger god, but he is also the emissary who guides deceased souls to the Underworld. Since that\u2019s the case, he must have been affected by all the zombies and ghouls that were slaughtered in such a short amount of time. Though, the biggest reason had to be the record speed clears that had never happened in First Dungeon\u2019s history\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Ah, it\u2019s nothing! Nothing at all, Shin-nim! In any case, congratulations! Hermes\u2019 power will be of great help to you in the days to come. But...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta raised her index finger and advised me in a solemn voice I\u2019d never heard from her before.</p><br/><p>\u201cA god\u2019s true name is heavy, Shin-nim. Remember that a day will come when you will have to pay the cost of using his name, so don\u2019t become too drunk on its power. Thankfully, Hermes isn\u2019t a god known for his battle prowess.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something to be thankful about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, Shin-nim is only a level 25 explorer. It will be hard for you to handle a god\u2019s power at that level. In fact, you have a greater chance of falling from losing yourself in its power. It\u2019s only because it\u2019s Hermes that it would be of help to Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I not understanding because of my low intelligence?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I said that, I did kind of have an idea what she meant. For example, let\u2019s say I obtained the true name of Athena, who was known as the goddess of war. I would end up relying on her power more than my own, which would be no different than relying on others\u2019 strengths. Even if I tried to find my own style again later, it would be too late. I could only continue climbing the dungeon with something wrong.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Hermes\u2019 power was entirely supportive in nature. Using it in battle would only increase my battle prowess. As it needed my strength as a basis, Hermes was indeed an excellent ability.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t help but be incredibly happy at the fact that my desire to quickly climb the dungeon led to such results.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry to say this while you\u2019re so happy, but there is bad news as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBad news?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I stared at Loretta fixedly, she put out her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore that, I\u2019ll need 30,000 gold for the information cost.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I have to buy it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, I always want to keep a win-win relationship with you. Without money, I\u2019m not allowed to open my mouth, and if Shin-nim doesn\u2019t hear what I have to say, you will come to regret it slightly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta was giving me a hint. After all, there had to be a reason why she brought it up in the first place. 30,000 gold wasn\u2019t big enough to risk breaking our friendly relationship.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Here, 30,000 gold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Most importantly, with the large amount of gold I had gained from clearing the Event Dungeon, I didn\u2019t need to worry too much about spending gold frivolously. Loretta mumbled a quiet \u2018yes\u2019 and took my money.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe glory of succeeding in the 25th Floor Master solo raid on the first try was taken by a foreign world\u2019s Hero 1,500 years ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGek!\u201d</p><br/><p>It really was bad news! Like Loretta said, I would have regretted it if I didn\u2019t hear it, but I didn\u2019t want to have to pay 30,000 gold to hear it! The satisfaction of obtaining Hermes\u2019 true name disappeared, and I stooped my shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe 30,000 gold was for this piece of information as well as the information about the 20th Floor Master from before. Although it was on credit\u2026 with this, Shin-nim and I won\u2019t have to receive any penalties. Whew, thank goodness I don\u2019t need to hear from that oldie aga\u2026 Ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta put her hands over her mouth in the middle of talking. I got the feeling she was intentionally doing it to give me some information. When I looked at her with narrow eyes, she stuck her tongue out and said, \u201cehet.\u201d It was so cute that I almost fell for her.</p><br/><p>After letting out a dry cough, I asked her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, can I know about the availability of the \u2018first\u2019 for 30th and 35th floors?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep, that\u2019ll be 50,000 gold, customer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 Maybe she really was just hungry for gold. Watching her smile so happily, I imagined myself flicking her forehead.</p><br/><p>Translator's note: Be sure to check out this chapter's announcement post!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Overlord (1)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Chapter 221. Overlord (1)</p><br/><p>The 17 members of Revival along with Plene, Lotte, and Licorice, totaling 20, got on Hwaya\u2019s private plane. As the succubi battle units were already in the Philippines, only we needed to go. For the record, Walker was the pilot, being unexpectedly skilled in many areas.</p><br/><p>Among these members, not everyone was harmonious. In particular, although I hadn\u2019t been paying much attention, the monster members didn\u2019t get along.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou vulgar bat, get off of Hero\u2019s lap.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you stupid because you\u2019re bird-brained? This is where I belong, Dear Husband\u2019s lap. Stop squawking noisily and go away, wyvern. Your scales are getting in the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to be next to Shin too\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Plene was weaker in both magical and physical abilities, she had the least say, while Lotte and Licorice fought fierce psychological battles. Strictly speaking, Lotte was weaker than Licorice. However, Lotte was still above Licorice in physical abilities.</p><br/><p>Of course, I wasn\u2019t too happy with this arrangement. The fact that they were fighting over me was even more troublesome. The other girls already gave me a headache, but now even the monsters were joining in!</p><br/><p>When I was just about to say something, a thin layer of ice spread over Licorice who was sitting on my laps.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaak! What\u2019s this!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy\u2019s lap is mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ina pushed off the slightly frozen Licorice and plumped down on my laps. I widened my eyes and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cIna! You can control your ice magic now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA little bit. Did I do well, Daddy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep, yep. Good job.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, Dear Husband abandoned me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cServes you right, bat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou go away. And you too, sparkly eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>My daughter\u2026 My daughter was establishing order! Touched by Ina\u2019s power to shoo the monsters away, I hugged Ina, who made cute noises.</p><br/><p>Ah, of course, Yua was sitting in the window seat next to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder if my kids will be safe in the Philippines\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yua murmured in worry and looked out the window, though there were only clouds in sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you talking about your mantises?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, they\u2019re still young\u2026 so I\u2019m a bit worried.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although a few of them had died as they climbed the dungeon, most of the mantises survived and grew stronger with Yua. With the buffs Yua could cast as a Tamer, each mantis had power on par with an S rank monster. I couldn\u2019t help but shiver thinking about how strong they would be when they fully grew up. Even now, they certainly weren\u2019t weak.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. They look all grown up to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey only got bigger in size. They\u2019re still kids at heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. Guys grow up by being apart from their mothers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there are more girls\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know. Sorry, mantis girls.</p><br/><p>In any case, they were live monsters and couldn\u2019t enter the inventory like Daisy\u2019s undead monsters. For when we needed to travel, we temporarily put them in the guild\u2019s resort, Resting Place of the Angels. Yua would then go back to the dungeon and bring them out when she needed them. Looking back, obtaining Resting Place of the Angels was god\u2019s work.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be there in thirty minutes. The succubi units cleared space for us to land, but with so many monsters are popping up from the ocean, they\u2019re apparently having trouble holding on. Get ready. Yua, make sure you bring out your mantises when you see an opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Unni.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, are you ready?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the effect of my Evil Eyes strengthened by charm, I was sure everyone would be stunned. With a grin, I initiated Peruta Circuit. The time to release the power I had been hiding was getting closer.</p><br/><p>Twenty minutes afterwards, while the plane was still soaring through the sky, Hwaya shouted sharply.</p><br/><p>\u201cAttack incoming!\u201d</p><br/><p>The outside suddenly got noisier. At the same time, Hwaya did something, making the plane\u2019s walls transparent as if we were floating in air. I mused, \u2018Technology sure advances fast\u2026\u2019 However, now wasn\u2019t the time for that. There were already monsters all around the plane.</p><br/><p>Of the flying monsters in the Philippines, there were harpies, giant eagles and hawks, dinosaur-like monsters, flying insects, and even wyverns. I immediately thought of capturing a strong male to introduce him to Lotte, but I rejected the idea when I turned around and saw Lotte\u2019s cold and terrifying gaze. Damn, could my tamed beasts read my mind!?</p><br/><p>\u201cAn ambush by flying monsters. Daisy, can you take care of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKana, already on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy answered confidently. Immediately afterwards, a ginormous tuna\u2026 like monster appeared in the air. I was wondering what monster Kana was. It was none other than Aikan, one of Daisy\u2019s strongest undead monsters!</p><br/><p>\u201cKana, learned transparency. Grew up well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy strutted out chest and made a proud expression. I thought undead monsters couldn\u2019t grow\u2026? Regardless, it was amazing that it learned a new skill. Unlike what I thought before, it seemed undead monsters could grow.</p><br/><p>[Ooooooong!]</p><br/><p>Aikan cried reliantly. Just from that, some of the weaker monsters exploded. What a monster\u2026 Daisy\u2019s obtaining it in the Panan continent couldn\u2019t have been better.</p><br/><p>\u201cKana, send them flying. Beam!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Daisy shouted, Aikan\u2026 no, Kana, opened its giant mouth and sucked in the surrounding air. Naturally, the nearby monsters couldn\u2019t overcome the suction force and was pulled into Kana\u2019s mouth. Most of the attacks towards Kana dissipated when they hit the light shooting out from Kana\u2019s body, and even the attacks that managed to get through the light couldn\u2019t penetrate Kana\u2019s skin. It seemed flying monsters could be just left to Kana.</p><br/><p>[Guoooooooooo!]</p><br/><p>Finally, Kana shot out a giant pillar of light. Everything in its path was wiped clean, and as surrounding monsters moved to fill up the now empty space, it could clearly be seen that their numbers of thinning.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard the description, but that thing is too overpowered!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, almost won against Kana.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018almost\u2019? I did win!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin fought, El Patiz. Can\u2019t win against Kana.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While we quarreled, Kana leisurely took care of the rest of the monsters. With Kana guarding us, we safely landed on the coast.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband is here!\u201d</p><br/><p>When we got off the plane, the succubi fighting the monsters all turned to face me. I could feel the other girls poking me with narrowed eyes. I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s not my fault!</p><br/><p>\u201cIs everyone off? Walker?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><br/><p>After confirming that everyone had gotten off the plane, Hwaya stored the plane in her inventory. The monsters hurtling towards the plane changed their direction towards us, but were immediately shot down by the succubi\u2019s magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, we\u2019re extremely sorry to say this, but can you participate in the battle? Many kids are lacking in mana, so they can\u2019t handle the monsters properly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m going now!\u201d</p><br/><p>I immediately summoned Sharana and infused her into my body. Although I also summoned Ruyue and Peika, I didn\u2019t infuse them in my weapons. Spirit Aura was only needed against monsters I needed to put in effort to defeat. Against a large number of enemies, I only needed Sharana, and the other elementals were better off in their materialized forms.</p><br/><p>I soared into the air and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cFight me!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You used Provoke! All enemies in the area charge in to kill you!]</p><br/><p>This feeling, I had felt it before. It was probably in the Panan continent. The feeling when all beings in the world were staring at me and attacking me. It was the moment when my heart tightened the most.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u201d</p><br/><p>In one go, I fully released all the charm I had been holding back. At that moment, even I felt an electrifying scent. While I was rather annoyed, my Evil Eyes, strengthened to the extreme by my charm, radiated a powerful golden light and shone down on everything in my sight. In this regard, I couldn\u2019t be happier with my high charm. Furthermore\u2026</p><br/><p>Everything in the world became stone.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy god\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya murmured in a stiff voice. Everyone else also only stared at me speechless. I waved my hand and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I fully released my charm, so you shouldn\u2019t look at me for too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn, right\u2026 but well, it\u2019s too late to try to ignore your charm, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhum\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya, striking at this moment\u2026 I blushed and looked away.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing! All monsters in this area was\u2026 Aaah, as expected of Dear Husband!\u201d</p><br/><p>Other than me, Revival\u2019s members, tamed monsters and the succubi battle units, all else had petrified with nothing spared.</p><br/><p>Rocks rained down on the ocean, making fountains spout up everywhere. Likewise on the earth, loud noises rang out as rocks hailed down.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, can you destroy all the rocks that just fell down?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t want to go in the ocean\u2026 but okay, I got it.]</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, you know what to do, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Leave it to me! Ice Rain!]</p><br/><p>The two elementals each charged to their designated area and started to break the petrified monsters. Then, the others finally snapped out and started to work on breaking the monsters. They didn\u2019t forget to comment on what just happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt this rate, can\u2019t we be done with the Philippines in just a day?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be surprised if I get a Stone Breaker title. I\u2019ve never experienced such boring monster hunting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey you! Make sure you get everything on camera! We have to record Dear Husband\u2019s magnificent glory!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Queen!\u201d</p><br/><p>First, I stole the camera from the succubus taking Licorice\u2019s orders. Then, feeling the presence of monsters in the distance, I calculated the amount of time we had until they came to a threatening range and confined my charm again. The scent that was emanating from me died down noticeably. Wait, didn\u2019t that mean this scent could even be seen visually\u2026!?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even human anymore, Son. Did you eat an air freshener?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut it, Dad.\u201d</p><br/><p>I retorted curtly at the snickering Father, as I held my spear back up. At that moment, Daisy murmured in regret.</p><br/><p>\u201cPetrified monsters\u2026 can\u2019t make undead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t it. Yua also made a vague smile and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, I can\u2019t tame monsters when they\u2019re petrified\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, mm\u2026 right\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I worked my brain helplessly. Then, I finally came up with an answer to solve this crisis.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s find a monster that\u2019s strong enough to withstand my petrification!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill there be one\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Almost as if I used my Evil Eyes again, a somewhat unwelcome silence descended once again. Wanting to shake it off, I shouted energetically.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s do this! I\u2019m sure there will be a monster willing to be Yua\u2019s friend!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow irresponsible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUndead\u2026 my undead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFriend\u2026 will I find one\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>What, you\u2019re unhappy with my performance!? You\u2019re not being honest!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

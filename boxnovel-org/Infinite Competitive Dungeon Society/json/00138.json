The Third Explorer (2)</p><br/><p>I paused at her question, then grabbed her shoulders and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo there really is one? I knew it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyak! Sh, Shin-nim, it\u2019s still day time\u2026 N-Not that I hate it. In fact, you\u2019re free to go ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNevermind that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat!? Did you just consider my okay sign as something petty!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, is there a Dungeon higher than the First Dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta grumbled and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is. Only administrative guild masters like myself or explorers that have gone there know about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are the conditions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore that, are you prepared? That dungeon certainly has higher rewards than all other dungeons, but the price you have to pay is equally high. Shin-nim might even regret going there. Just climbing the First Dungeon might be better. I\u2019m certain. Do you still want to listen?\u201d</p><br/><p>I became quiet at her words. Then, I somewhat realized why she brought it up in the first place. Thus, I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I conquer the First Dungeon, will I be able to defeat the world\u2019s enemy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if I clear the higher dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you can completely clear it\u2026 probably.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen isn\u2019t the answer obvious?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Right. Really, Shin-nim is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, nothing. Nothing at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta shook her heads at my question. The corners of her mouth was curled up to a smile, unlike before. At her extremely pleasant smile, I also smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. If it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll bring you back to the First Dungeon even if I have to threaten the Lord!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll break through it with my strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, then I\u2019ll teach you how to get to \u2018Beyond.\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeyond?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It is somewhere only First Dungeon explorers can hope to reach. Even amongst them, only those with the greatest abilities, potential, and qualifications can enter it. As the reason for its existence is different than the other dungeons, it is called Beyond.\u201d</p><br/><p>First condition. Being a First Dungeon explorer.</p><br/><p>Second condition. Defeating all bosses one versus one.</p><br/><p>Third condition. Obtaining a god\u2019s true name.</p><br/><p>Fourth condition. Being acknowledged by an administrative guild master.</p><br/><p>Fifth condition. Being above Gold rank.</p><br/><p>Sixth condition. Making achievements.</p><br/><p>It was truly a path of blood and iron. However, I had already completed most of them. Loretta telling me about Beyond signified that she acknowledged me, so there was only one left for me to fulfill.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the sixth condition what I think it is? Like the achievements I\u2019ve been making so far?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It hasn\u2019t been revealed how many achievements you need to make, so I can\u2019t tell you when you\u2019ll be able to enter Beyond. As such, Shin-nim has to focus on making achievements. Since you decided to climb Beyond, it\u2019s better to go as soon as possible. Just like its name suggests, Beyond is a dungeon that lies past the First Dungeon. Every time you clear a floor on the First Dungeon, you\u2019ll be able to challenge Beyond. When you clear a floor in Beyond, you\u2019ll return to the First Dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other worlds, I\u2019ll be able to climb more in Beyond the lower my level is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. Of course, since no one has succeeded in conquering the First Dungeon, it\u2019s too early to worry about this, but Shin-nim really gives people hope.\u201d</p><br/><p>For example, if the First Dungeon had 100 floors in total and I became a Beyond explorer after clearing the First Dungeon\u2019s 75th floor, then once I cleared Beyond\u2019s 1st floor, I would have to return to clear the First Dungeon\u2019s 76th floor. Once I cleared it, I would be able to challenge Beyond\u2019s 2nd floor. In that case, when I cleared the 100th floor of the First Dungeon, I would be able to challenge the 26th floor of Beyond. But that would be it. I wouldn\u2019t be able to challenge Beyond\u2019s 27th floor even if I cleared the 26th. I wouldn\u2019t be able to conquer Beyond, being able to only conquer the First Dungeon.</p><br/><p>Even if the First Dungeon didn\u2019t end at the 100th floor, it was clear that becoming a Beyond explorer later was disadvantageous.</p><br/><p>How unreasonable!</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause no one has reached the end of Beyond, no one knows how many floors Beyond has. So don\u2019t worry about it too much and focus on the First Dungeon. If it\u2019s Shin-nim, I believe Shin-nim will be able to enter Beyond before the 70th floor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope that\u2019s the case. Then, see you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Loretta advised me with a big smile, I also answered with a smile. Then, I left for the 51st floor, vowing to myself that I would one day reach beyond the First Dungeon.</p><br/><p>[You became level 52. You obtained 5 bonus stats.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained the qualification to go beyond the First Dungeon.]</p><br/><p>[Would you like to become an explorer of \u2018Beyond\u2019? The moment you accept, you will be removed from the dungeon\u2019s ranking.]</p><br/><p>[Please choose carefully. This place is entirely different than the First Dungeon, and those that pass this threshold may not go back.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>On the 51st Floor Shop, I looked at Loretta. She looked back and smiled sweetly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Shin-nim? You were fast today, too! To think you\u2019d break through the 51st floor, which is full of trolls, in just 5 hours!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 Loretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Shin-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like I got the qualification to go to Beyond.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I must say, Loretta\u2019s surprised expression was extremely cute.</p><br/><p>[You became a Beyond explorer! You can challenge Beyond\u2019s 1st floor. Once cleared, you can challenge the First Dungeon\u2019s 52nd floor and you cannot immediately challenge Beyond\u2019s 2nd floor.]</p><br/><p>[You made an achievement of becoming the fastest to enter Beyond since the dungeon\u2019s founding! You obtained 4 skill points. Current skill points: 8]</p><br/><p>[You became the current Beyond\u2019s third explorer. You are currently ranked 3rd in Beyond. Beyond\u2019s explorer communication channel has been opened.]</p><br/><p>[The residence and resort in your possession has changed their affiliation to Beyond.]</p><br/><p>After listening to the messages in a daze, I looked at Loretta, who was also in a daze.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm\u2026 I don\u2019t know!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta was too cheerful. When I sighed, she became startled and began to contemplate the matter seriously. She then came up with an answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think what Shin-nim did in another world as a Dimensional Mercenary, then defeating the drake that appeared on Earth had significant impact.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose two were acknowledged as great achievements?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! But you really are amazing. Fastest to become a Dimensional Mercenary, fastest to become a Beyond explorer\u2026 If it\u2019s you, you might really do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t flatter me too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu. You don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta rejoiced with her hands together, but I was slightly scared at her eyes that seemed to be looking somewhere far away. Would she tell me if I asked? Or would she tell me to wait again? Suddenly feeling my heart tighten, I turned away. Startled, Loretta grabbed my sleeves.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? I have to go to Beyond now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, right\u2026 You surprised me, geez\u2026 Really. Don\u2019t disappear without saying anything! You have to properly say you\u2019ll be back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta flapped her ears quickly as if she was angry. I was relieved. She was properly looking at me now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEit!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta tried to kiss me habitually, but as I was expecting it this time, I easily dodged to the side. Then\u2026</p><br/><p>[You received Queen Elf\u2019s Blessing. For the next 5 hours, you receive the following effects: You are protected against all low-rank and mid-rank status effects. You can maintain your consciousness for 5 minutes after falling in half-dead state. Your luck increases by 100. All members of the Faerie race will see you favorably.]</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Didn\u2019t I dodge it just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-That\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Loretta dodged my eyes as if something pricked at her conscience, I realized. It seemed these blessings didn\u2019t need to be applied with kisses. Loretta had always used Blessings under the guise of kissing, and when I dodged her this time, she failed to kiss me, but the blessing had gone through.</p><br/><p>Dumbfounded, I murmured.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really kissed me just because you wanted to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I already told you. I\u2019m kissing you because I love you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as she said that, she seemed embarrassed as she tried to cover her face with her ears. Of course, even with her long ears, it wasn\u2019t possible. This person, or rather, this elf\u2026 why was she so cute? Feeling the sense of unease I just felt disappearing, I reached my hand out to pat her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, well, I appreciate it. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t know what\u2019s what. To be honest, my head is already full because of the dungeon and the matter with being a Hero. Sorry. You don\u2019t have to wait for me, so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cS-Stupid. I\u2019m extremely used to waiting! Even if I don\u2019t want to!\u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason, she called me stupid.</p><br/><p>\u201cR-Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally! So don\u2019t worry about something like that, and go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like that, Loretta chased me away. I didn\u2019t understand what just happened.</p><br/><p>Since thinking about it wouldn\u2019t help, I tilted my head.</p><br/><p>In the place where the stairway to the 52nd floor should be, a grey gate had appeared. Without much thought, I jumped into it.</p><br/><p>[Commencing exploration of Beyond\u2019s 1st floor. You cannot stop exploring Beyond whenever you want. To give up and leave, your vitality must hit zero and you must be forced out to your home in the residential area or your world. You need one month to re-commence exploration, and you cannot climb the First Dungeon during this time.]</p><br/><p>\u2018Loretta, before trying to kiss me, you should have told me about this! Though, even if you did, I would have gone anyways\u2026 But this means I won\u2019t be able to go back to Earth until I clear Beyond\u2019s 1st floor!\u2019</p><br/><p>In any case, the first impression of Beyond I had was that it was quite big. Also, its structure was a bit different than the dungeon floors I\u2019ve climbed so far.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it a maze?\u201d</p><br/><p>There were hard brick walls to my left and right. When I tried to attack it with my spear imbued with mana, it didn\u2019t budge in the slightest. In fact, the red bricks absorbed my mana and reflected it back to me. I could read the mana\u2019s movements and avoid the attack, but it was stronger than my original attack. It seemed the walls had strengthened my attack before reflecting it back. I would have to keep this in mind as I went on.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaaang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, I suddenly heard a rather familiar roar. \u2018Strange\u2026 I definitely heard this roar before!\u2019 I tilted my head and walked forward. If I didn\u2019t, nothing would get done.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaaang!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Hm, the sound is closer.\u2019</p><br/><p>The fact that I couldn\u2019t break the walls down stressed me greatly. On the other hand, I thought that this dungeon was more true to its role than the dungeon I\u2019ve climbed until now.</p><br/><p>Slowly, I approached the source of the roar. As I walked, my increased intelligence clearly drew the maze\u2019s map in my head. As I understood the maze\u2019s structure little by little, I understood how far I would need to walk to meet the source of the roar.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaang!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018This\u2026 is a bit different than the other voice.\u2019 I suddenly felt a chill down my back. Feeling uneasy, I immediately took out Gluttony Spear. Then, with one hand on the right wall, I slowly walked forward. I was certain. The source of the roar was up ahead.</p><br/><p>As I thought, when the wall came to an end, a large open area appeared. It was spacious enough for the Flame Drake to lie down.</p><br/><p>There, I found them.</p><br/><p>\u201cOrc Lord?\u201d</p><br/><p>My god, how long had it been!? Orc Lord, it was an Orc Lord! The one that had helped me become a proper dungeon explorer! Glad to see him again, I raised my voice and \u2018they\u2019 looked back at me. Their eyes were bright red.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are\u2026 many Orc Lords?\u201d</p><br/><p>I found the source of the chill I felt. My god, there was a small conference being held here! But let\u2019s think carefully. Orc Lords were bosses from the 5th floor. No matter how fancy their armors were or how much they exuded imposing auras, they shouldn\u2019t be able to win against me, who was level 52\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaang!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaang!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaaaang\u201d</p><br/><p>[Orc Lord used \u2018Warcry\u2019! All orcs are cleansed of negative status effects! All orcs temporarily become super-armored. Their attack power increases by 50%!]</p><br/><p>[Orc Lord used \u2018Warcry\u2019! All orcs are cleansed of negative status effects! All orcs temporarily become super-armored. Their attack power increases by 50%!]</p><br/><p>[Orc Lord used \u2018Warcry\u2019! All orcs are cleansed of negative status effects! All orcs temporarily become super-armored. Their attack power increases by 50%!]</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t help but think, \u2018Don\u2019t tell me. The Orc Lords\u2019 Warcries\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWhenever one uses them, do the others\u2019 attacks go up\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaaang!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Orc Lord used \u2018Warcry\u2019! All orcs are cleansed of negative status effects! All orcs temporarily become super-armored. Their attack power increases by 50%!]</p><br/><p>All the Orc Lords charged towards me. The ones that didn\u2019t use Warcry shouted as they ran.</p><br/><p>Looking at them, I grinned. Then, I turned around and ran.</p><br/><p>It seemed I was underestimating Beyond too much.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>The third explorer referred to Shin becoming Beyond\u2019s third explorer! I bet no one thought he\u2019d immediately go to the higher dungeon! This is what\u2019s called Toika quality! Fast, fast!</p><br/><p>Also, there is something our clumsy Shin missed. I\u2019m sure the readers will be able to pick up on it. ^^</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Second Season (1)</p><br/><p>Rabbit ears, dog ears, wolf ears, cat ears, bears ears. With five beastman children and two cute girls in the house, mother screamed in joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did so many children come from!? Are they yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m only 21, Mom!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnimals ears, how cute! They feel so realistic!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re real, Mom. Don\u2019t try to pull them out!\u201d</p><br/><p>After I returned, I first reported to the guild and Loretta. As I also brought Ren and Lebuik from the dungeon, the house was full. Mother happily went off to cook for the guests, while Yua went to help her.</p><br/><p>Ren, on the other hand, sat in my room depressed. I had to stay and talk to him without being able to eat.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, Crown Prince\u2026 When I saw the enemy that took Father\u2019s body, I felt like my blood was flowing backwards. I should have trusted Crown Prince\u2019s plan. I have no excuses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRookie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you before, right? A warrior has to be cool-headed. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d charge at the world\u2019s enemy with no plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat, Kang Shin has, no right. Kang Shin is far from, being cool-headed. It\u2019s just, Kang Shin\u2019s ability is overwhelming, so no problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I was admonishing Ren, Daisy appeared out of nowhere and refuted me. I wanted to say something, but seeing what was in Daisy\u2019s hands, I became lost for words.</p><br/><p>On one hand, she had a beer can, and on the other, she had a thick sausage. I remembered seeing the sausage before. After seeing that Ren and Lebuik were safe, the children sat around the living room table and ate with Mother, Yua, and Father. Before I came in my room, I remembered being surprised how adaptable they were. If I remembered correctly, the sausage was on the table. The sausage in Daisy\u2019s hand had undoubtedly come from there.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin\u2019s mother, gave me sausage. Kang Shin\u2019s father, gave me beer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m happy you\u2019ve gotten close to my fa\u2026 Why are you here!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I shouted in shock. Why was Daisy on Earth!? She then answered as if I was being dumb.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin used Return, with me too. Barely put Aikan, in my inventory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cS-Sorry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like this place. I stay still, and I get food.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I see\u2026 That\u2019s good\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked like a middle-school student, so it was somewhat strange seeing her drink beer. Though I wanted to say something to her, I held it in. I looked at Ren again and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cRen, it\u2019s time. The second season of thrashing phase!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you say no, your body is shaking from excitement!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m shaking because I\u2019m terrified! Stop saying weird things!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s thrashing phase, Rookie?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a special training I make Ren do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-Training? No, if it\u2019s training, I\u2019ll do it! Ren-nim is my disciple!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLebuik is too soft. Plus, I feel like Lebuik will end up doing some other training, so no.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a face saying, \u2018how did you know?\u2019, Ren took a step back. I was just joking, but this woman\u2026 how scary. On the other hand, Ren tilted his head. With a virgin-like innocence, he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSome other training? What\u2019s that? Lebuik is an excellent warrior. If there\u2019s something I can learn from her, I\u2019d like to learn it. Please, teach this foolish one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cR-R-R-Ren-nim. If that\u2019s what you wish, this Lebuik will\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Lebuik drooling and fiddling with her clothes, I flicked her forehead and shot her down. Then, I took out the crystal bottle containing the world\u2019s power. All eyes became focused on the ball of light floating in the bottle.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince, could this be\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep, it\u2019s your world\u2019s power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cH-How?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Earth\u2019s Hero. I can do at least this much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you take it for yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be absurd. This power belongs to Panan continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren sounded touched. Annoyingly, he was tearing up. I knocked on the table catch his attention and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me explain. I trapped the world\u2019s power in an Elixir bottle. The bottle\u2019s special material is preventing it from leaking out, but it won\u2019t be last forever. The moment it\u2019s taken out, it will probably start to assimilate itself as Earth\u2019s power. Do you want the Panan continent\u2019s power to be absorbed by Earth?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 of course not.\u201d</p><br/><p>I grinned. I of course brought up the topic to prevent that from happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs Earth\u2019s Hero, I can vest this ownerless power to someone. It\u2019s much easier and less time-consuming to transfer an ownerless power than transferring it from one human to another. But as more times passes, this power will start to weaken and it\u2019ll get harder for me transfer it to someone. Now, what should I do with it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to transfer it to an explorer as quickly as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect. And it just so happens that there\u2019s an excellent candidate in front of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLebuik is here too.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stared at Lebuik, who sleeping on the ground with a happy expression. It made me shake my head. That said, I had to acknowledge her courage of risking her life to help Ren, and charging in in the midst of battle to stop Ren who had lost his sanity.</p><br/><p>Although Ren still seemed oblivious, Lebuik\u2019s actions came from her love for Ren. At some point, loyalty seemed to have become love. Regardless, to Lebuik, Ren was more important than Panan continent. On the other hand, even when all hope seemed to be lost, Ren stayed in Panan continent.</p><br/><p>\u201cBetween Ren and Lebuik, I\u2019m going to have to choose Ren.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m foolish. Because of me, both Lebuik and Crown Prince suffered. When I\u2019m watching Crown Prince, I can\u2019t help but think why I can\u2019t be like Crown Prince. Kuhuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>I flicked his forehead strongly. His head was so hard that it made my finger hurt slightly. I held the pain in and told Ren.</p><br/><p>\u201cI already said what you did was foolish. But\u2026 it was understandable. Mm, well, he was your father\u2026 Kuhum. In any case, Ren is different than before, and I know Ren can get stronger. As for your rash personality, it can be fixed through another thrashing phase.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hold Ren in high regard because Ren managed to save eight children from that hell without losing hope. Ren\u2019s full of spirit and hungry for battle. That\u2019s exactly what I want. That\u2019s not something that can be taught. You have to be born with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t take no for an answer. I won\u2019t change my mind anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Can I really not avoid another thrashing phase?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that what you were worried about!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I gave Ren the world\u2019s power. It was simple. I opened the bottle and shoved it in Ren\u2019s mouth. Then, using my power as the Hero, I just had to settle and energize it. Compared to the time and effort it took for a Hero to transfer his own power to someone else, it was extremely simple.</p><br/><p>After obtaining the Hero\u2019s power, Ren rubbed his belly and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cUu, I feel dizzy. I can feel that this power hasn\u2019t settled in. It\u2019s nauseating almost.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be better once you get used to it. Congratulations on becoming a Hero. Quite the pressure, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to fulfill my duties.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, the kids are here now. Don\u2019t go back for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everything Ren wanted to protect was on Earth. Although I couldn\u2019t say it was safe to be on Earth, I was at least sure that it was more safe than the Panan continent, which was dominated by the El Patiz.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing Ren can do alone anyways. If you die and have the world\u2019s power stolen again, that would be disastrous. They said so themselves. That they needed time before an El Patiz that can contain the Hero\u2019s power was born. In other words, one would eventually come to being. I\u2019m not sure how they can reproduce without the world\u2019s power, but that\u2019s what they said. Maybe they\u2019ll fuse or evolve or something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cR-Right\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoing back alone is simply stupid. Or what, did you plan on hiding in the ocean? Who knows if they can still reproduce?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Ren, help me.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said bluntly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deal with the danger Earth is facing in 2 years. After that, I want to save other worlds. Ludia\u2019s Luka continent, Daisy\u2019s Sylon continent, and yours, the Panan continent. All of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what you\u2019re saying, Crown Prince?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. You weren\u2019t thinking of hiding for the rest of your life, were you? Then there would be no meaning to having the Hero\u2019s power.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren\u2019s face was dyed red. He shot up and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible! Do you know how many worlds were ruined and how many worlds are being ruined!? If you did, you wouldn\u2019t say something like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf strong explorers come together, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s possible. People like you, Daisy, and me. So help me, Ren. Help protect Earth. I\u2019ll help you too.\u201d</p><br/><p>I spoke calmly as I stared into his eyes. There was no room for joking. I wanted Ren to reply with seriousness.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Ren\u2019s expression became strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince. Your\u2026 Your guild\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? Revival. It means rebirth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRebirth\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren fell. Seeing the hint of flames that began to burn in his eyes, I smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 try. After all, I owe Crown Prince a debt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Welcome to Revival, Ren.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren joined my guild. I was somewhat curious how Lebuik would react, but I decided not to pursue the thought. When Ren and I shook our hands, Daisy, who was watching from the side, slammed her emptied beer can down.</p><br/><p>\u201cLong, arduous journey. But, I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to save Sylon continent too. Then, you\u2019ll become its Hero. Get ready to feel the pressure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, I welcome it anytime.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, she left the room. Perhaps she just wanted to hear Ren and my conversation. Or perhaps, she wanted to confirm my resolve. I got up. Ren also followed me up and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cU-Um\u2026 Is the thrashing phase starting now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said bluntly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me climb the dungeon first!\u201d</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>The arc title isn\u2019t really that meaningful. I represents the beginning of a new story with business in other dimensions being over with for now, and it also represents Shin being able to climb the dungeon again\u2026 oh, and also Ren\u2019s thrashing phase being resumed. Oops, the last one ended up being emphasized!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Dungeon Explores Can Awaken Too? (4)</p><br/><p>[A Grand Achievement! You defeated the Floor Master, Wraith Queen, alone! Amazing!]</p><br/><p>[You obtained the title, \u2018Wraith Queen Slayer.\u2019 All stats permanently increase by 1. This effect will apply even if the title is not equipped.]</p><br/><p>[You defeated the Wraith Queen alone. You obtained the special reward, \u2018Wraith Queen\u2019s Shirt.\u2019]</p><br/><p>[You obtained 3,000 gold.]</p><br/><p>[Choose your reward.]</p><br/><p>[1. Spirit Mastery Magic Book.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, I obtained another title. Along with the Orc Lord Slayer title, all of my stats were now permanently increased by 2.</p><br/><p>I stood speechless for a while, then pinched my cheeks to wake myself up.</p><br/><p>The first thing I did was to check the Wraith Queen equipment\u2019s set effect. I took off the Orc Lord equipment and put on the Wraith Queen equipment. I wondered if I also needed to equip the whip, but it appeared that wasn\u2019t the case.</p><br/><p>[You equipped the Wraith Queen Set. Your magic and charm increases by 5. When the Wraith Queen Set is equipped, you can use \u2018Vengeful Spirit\u2019s Wail\u2019 once per day.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected\u2026\u201d After staring at the message window with lingering attachment, I shrugged. Then I switched my equipment back to the Orc Lord Set. Vengeful Spirit\u2019s Wail, a skill that changed the entire battlefield by affecting the enemy with confusion and fear status effects. It was undoubtedly a good skill. However, compared to the Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry, it felt too weak.</p><br/><p>Why? Because it was possible that the enemy was immune to confusion or fear, or could use a priest-type cleansing skill. In that case, the skill would be useless. On the other hand, unless there was a monster that canceled the buff, Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry would always be useful.</p><br/><p>I could only use one of the two skills, so I decided to choose the Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry. Although the Wraith Queen was a higher rank Floor Master, her equipment was cloth, inappropriate for a warrior type like me.</p><br/><p>However, its black jacket, white pants, and shirt all had a good texture, making me want to wear them in my daily life.</p><br/><p>Next up was the rewards. 3,000 gold was the normal amount given for defeating the Wraith Queen. What was important was the reward given for defeating it alone.</p><br/><p>[1. Spirit Mastery Magic Book.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAnother magic book? Spirit Mastery, huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>It made sense. Wraiths, the Wraith Queen, and the Soul Tempering Elixir all had to do with souls, so a magic book like this was expected to a certain extent. However, I hoped it would be a skill powerful enough to bring my strength to a new level.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I shouldn\u2019t complain. Magic books are said to be rare after all. Be more respectful, Kang Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed I got greedy after seeing someone vastly stronger than me. I could get stronger. If I try to rush it, it would only work against me. I had to do it my way, slowly and steadily. I vowed to myself once again and put my hand inside the half-transparent window.</p><br/><p>[You obtained the Spirit Mastery skill. Your affinity to souls and spirits increase. The strength of all soul and spirit-related skills increases. As the skill level increases, your affinity with souls and spirits will also increase.]</p><br/><p>In other words, my Deific Manifestation skill would be stronger. I had a partner I could call once a month, Peruta. If Spirit Mastery\u2019s skill level rose, I might be able to summon him more often and for longer durations. When I thought about that, I was finally convinced that Spirit Mastery was a good skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was time to collect the long-awaited quest reward. How would Loretta react? Excited for her reaction, I couldn\u2019t hide my smile.</p><br/><p>[Quest Success!]</p><br/><p>[You conquered the Floor Master Wraith Queen alone. As a feat unseen in 200 years, the Floor Shop owner, Loretta, is in awe. She is regretting her decision to make a bet out of revenge. However, she will still give out her reward. After all, she is an honest shop owner.]</p><br/><p>[You received a system reward. You obtained 1 skill point. You now have 2 spare skill points.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAguhueforkuralo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you say that in human language? It seems I haven\u2019t mastered alien language yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaaah, you really did it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She showed a reaction surpassing my expectation. Just yesterday, she seemed full of doubt, but now that I had really done it, she was spouting out strange words with a soulless expression. After I talked to her a few times, she started crying. How shameful.</p><br/><p>\u201cSob, you\u2019re right, I\u2019m a bad woman who gives quests but hates seeing it be completed. Are you disillusioned?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing new.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhuhuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, Loretta noona?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I called her hesitatingly, she turned toward me instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Can\u2019t you see that I\u2019m crying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 Give me my reward.\u201d</p><br/><p>Like I\u2019d fall for your tricks to skimp out on my reward.</p><br/><p>\u201cHueeeee!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, now. Stop crying and give me my reward.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHUEEEE!\u201d</p><br/><p>It took a long time before I could calm her down. Although her intentions were crystal clear, I had no choice as I had to collect my reward. Only after I made a promise to bring her ramen did she stop crying. It seemed a dungeon explorer from Earth had treated her before.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll really bring me one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSob\u2026 Okay, I\u2019ll trust you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta wiped away her tears, then handed me something.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake it. It\u2019s the best reward I can give you, customer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>After receiving it, I tilted my head. It was a pocket watch. When I opened the lid adorned with fancy jewelry, I saw a clock with only one hand. Just when I was wondering where the hour hand was, I realized the clock did not have any numbers written on it. Instead, in the places where the numbers should be were twelve small holes. The minute hand remained fixed between the 11th hour hole and the 12th hour hole.</p><br/><p>The pocket watch was on a silver chain. Unlike its outer appearance adorned with fancy jewelry, the inside looked antique and rustic. I couldn\u2019t help but be disappointed when I opened it up. It\u2026 didn\u2019t even have a crown.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I get angry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, tsk. You have no eye for valuables. Try reading the item info.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that would change my mind. Let me see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as I sent Loretta looks of doubt, I checked the information of the pocket watch. Immediately afterwards, my eyes seemed to pop up from their sockets.</p><br/><p>[???? (Secret \u2013 Subclass)</p><br/><p>A pocket watch filled with unknown powers. Its beholder will eventually obtain a class befitting it.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Class!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, now you realize what a precious treasure that is!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-Noona, there\u2019s a way to obtain a class?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I first entered the dungeon, I realized that I did not have a class. I expected to get a class like spearman, but even after all this time, I could not get a class. It seemed Ellos and Palludia had received the Knight and Priestess classes, so I couldn\u2019t help but think something was wrong.</p><br/><p>Not too long ago, when father became an ability user, he obtained a cool sounding class called Wave Attacker. Although he complained, saying that a traditional spearman like him should not have such a superhero-like class, I knew he was secretly bragging as he talked about getting bonus stats and few additional skills. My father really was childish.</p><br/><p>In any case, I was the only dungeon explorer I knew that didn\u2019t have a class! I felt bad, as it was like being told I had no ability. If possible, I wanted to at least have Crown Prince of 5F as my class.</p><br/><p>But it was brought up now when I least expected it.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course there is. In the first place, dungeon explorers from other continents who are appointed as knights or ordained as priests already possess classes before entering the dungeon. But customer is different.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I haven\u2019t been appointed a knight or ordained as a priest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNor did you have the qualification.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t have a class?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I see, there was a reason I was treated like an unemployed person. Then, I remembered my father who had the Wave Attacker class, and asked Loretta.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about father?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that \u2018ability\u2019? That\u2019s like a seal engraved directly on one\u2019s soul. It would be a different story if he already had a class, but since he didn\u2019t, of course he would get a class.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 There\u2019s more that you know, right? About the things happening on Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy, that\u2019s a secret, customer.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t think my inquiry on classes would lead to this. Although I always wanted to find the relationship between the dungeon and what was happening on Earth, I didn\u2019t think I would hear it from the Floor Shop owner, Loretta.</p><br/><p>Now that I thought about it, something was strange. Both Edias continent where Ellos came from and Luka continent where Palludia came from were being attacked by invaders, the so-called Demon race. Earth was in a similar situation, having to fight against invaders. This did not seem to be mere coincidence.</p><br/><p>When I thought this far, I could feel my hair stand on end. However, before I had the chance to speak, Loretta placed her hand on my mouth to block it.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember, customer. In the end, I am a shop owner that sells items to customers in need. I am on your side. As long as your willpower stands tall, the dungeon, too, will be of help to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo for now, don\u2019t ask anythi- Kyaa! Why did you lick me!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta screamed as she hurriedly pulled away her hand. I also experienced a strange sensation of licking woman\u2019s hand for the first time.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt tastes weird\u2026 a bit salty, maybe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not salty! Don\u2019t say something like that so casually!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should I say then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, this is fine then, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>At my smiling expression, Loretta\u2019s face reddened. Forgetting all about her anger, she smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Really, what a strange customer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one to talk, Loretta noona.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can just call me Loretta, customer. Noona sounds like you\u2019re emphasizing our age difference.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Don\u2019t call me without a reason. Really.\u201d</p><br/><p>The day I conquered the Wraith Queen, I obtained many things and learned a lot about the situation surrounding me. I felt that I had taken one more step toward becoming a true dungeon explorer.</p><br/><p>The next day, I challenged the 15th Floor Master, Dark Ratman. I died. For a week, I could not enter the dungeon.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Lilith (4)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>[You\u2026 You can really withstand me.]</p><br/><p>I could immediately tell from her voice that she was stupefied. Looking at her, I grinned.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeath Collection.\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately, black mist was released from my body. Lilith was wearing a thin, see-through dress that even a nail, much less a cursed weapon, could tear, but she only watched the weapons pop out of the mist with great interest. Her moist lips slowly opened, and her sweet voice tickled my ears once again.</p><br/><p>[How can you point a weapon towards me?]</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. Reinforcing all weapons.]</p><br/><p>Dortu infused his power into all the weapons coming out of the mist, and in the next instant, they flew towards Lilith faster than bullets. Truly numerous weapons cut through the air only to tear apart one frail woman!</p><br/><p>[You\u2019ll really stab me?]</p><br/><p>She shouted without thinking to dodge. I sneered. I could attack her. No matter how high her charm was compared to mine, with Absolute Soul and Peruta Circuit strengthening my resolve, she could do nothing against my sturdy willpower. No matter how much she pleaded, there was no way\u2026 no way\u2026</p><br/><p>[Huhu, that\u2019s what I thought.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 is this\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>I murmured dumbfoundedly. Anyone would do the same. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing with my eyes.</p><br/><p>[There, there. You\u2019re all too kind.]</p><br/><p>Death Collection\u2019s weapons, created through rage and resentment and existing only to kill their target, were stopping in the air one by one. A few of them even began to spin around Lilith as if to act as her guard.</p><br/><p>Unable to believe what was going on, I murmured.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you\u2026 just charm inanimate objects?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Huhu, smart. I really like you.]</p><br/><p>Lilith sent me an alluring smile. It was as it she had expected my reaction.</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. Protecting Master.]</p><br/><p>Dortu sounded hurried. Immediately afterwards, most of the weapons that popped out of the mist turned the opposite way and began hurling towards me. Dortu gave up controlling them and began to control the few that remained unaffected by Lilith.</p><br/><p>\u201cIiiik, I use this skill for the first time and I\u2019m the one it\u2019s attacking!? The hell?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. Protecting Master\u2019s feelings.]</p><br/><p>Dortu\u2019s power was truly immeasurable. Without me doing anything, Dortu controlled his weapons to counter and destroy the attacking weapons. Once broken, the weapons turned to a tar-like liquid and disappeared into the mist. However, Dortu\u2019s weapons only protected me as they revolved around me. They didn\u2019t think to attack Lilith again.</p><br/><p>It seemed Lilith realized something as she watched the weapons\u2019 movements.</p><br/><p>[Oh, is that your power? Or\u2026 Could there be another elemental that I\u2019m not aware of?]</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you seduce inanimate objects?\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t help but ask. I knew that now wasn\u2019t the time, but it was just too shocking. No matter how high her charm was, charm referred to the external influence one person had towards another. From one living being to another.</p><br/><p>But Lilith had seduced weapons, whose only purpose was to kill their enemy. I couldn\u2019t understand her power at all. Doing so would be equivalent to arguing that a line was a polygon.</p><br/><p>[Honey, do you know what my name means?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYour name?\u201d</p><br/><p>On Earth, Lilith was the first wife of Adam, who rejected him and even God to enter a relationship with a devil.</p><br/><p>Not only was this untrustworthy, but the story has also changed throughout the years. Now, Lilith was generally thought of as a high ranking female devil who was similar to a succubus.</p><br/><p>Lilith spoke.</p><br/><p>[Huhu, Lilith refers to the most charming woman in the world.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s in your world.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Right, this is in my world. Lilith isn\u2019t a name, but a title. A title of honor, given to the most charming woman in the world.]</p><br/><p>She extended her hand towards me and smiled sweetly.</p><br/><p>[Out of the countless Mares in Enesis, I was the most beautiful and charming. Do you know what the word \u201cmost\u201d means amongst devils?]</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes it look like I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Huhu, you really are funny.]</p><br/><p>As I retorted curtly, I inwardly asked Dortu how many equipment he could protect from that damned woman\u2019s influence.</p><br/><p>Dortu replied.</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. Between Master\u2019s spear and armor, one must be abandoned.]</p><br/><p>Immediately, I turned my armor back into a bracelet. When I suddenly became naked with only my underwear, Lilith\u2019s smile instantly became fuller.</p><br/><p>[Now this is nice to see. You changed your mind? Good, come here. We don\u2019t need to fight. We can do more exciting things. Put away your spear too. Huhu\u2026 You have an excellent weapon elsewhere.]</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, you should know why I took my armor off.\u201d</p><br/><p>I snorted and drew Lightning God\u2019s power into Chaotic Spear. Peika hummed cheerfully and increased its power. The enriched power of lightning easily took form, crackling with fiery sparks.</p><br/><p>[Huhu. You say that, but in the end, you won\u2019t be able to escape my charm. I\u2019m Lilith. I have the power to seduce everything in the world. Everything\u2026 except a few women.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Hero that defeated you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Right, the Hero was female. But even she was hesitant to kill me, and in the end, I was captured by Lord and ended up here.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat an idiot, that Hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re right, but she tried her best. Maybe the other warriors all gave their courage to her, because other than her, no one could do anything against me, especially male warriors.]</p><br/><p>Lilith began to snicker. She reached out her hand towards me and spoke.</p><br/><p>[Those guys who were so hell-bent on trying to kill me\u2026 When my hand touched them\u2026]</p><br/><p>Her hand softly wafted through the air. It was as if she was stroking my face, an alluring motion that wanted to make me hers.</p><br/><p>[They happily gave their life for me. Aaah, they were so boring. Really, too boring.]</p><br/><p>\u201cBut didn\u2019t they kill the succubi and incubi under your command to their hearts\u2019 content?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Huhu, that\u2019s because I had to wait a long time since the start of the invasion for the pathway to Elesia to be widened enough. But how did you know about\u2026 Oh, do you perhaps have a Succubus Queen with you?]</p><br/><p>My heart dropped a beat. I didn\u2019t think she would see through me that much. But perhaps, this was a blessing in disguise. Lilith\u2019s expression turned ferocious. It was the first time I saw her with such a face since I met her.</p><br/><p>[You have that despicable brat with you, that pink-haired bitch. So that thing was right. While I lost and stayed trapped in here for countless years, she found herself a new master and went to another world! Hahahahaha!]</p><br/><p>Lilith laughed out loud. Her laughter was full of rage. Soon after she started laughing, she suddenly stopped and spoke as she stared at me.</p><br/><p>[Sweet child, stay with me. Cut off your contract with her. Stay with me here forever. No one can disturb us here.]</p><br/><p>She continued. Her eyes shone like jewels, seducing me.</p><br/><p>[I can give you everything other than freedom. Do you know the ecstasy a woman\u2019s body can give you? If you embrace me, no other woman will be able to satisfy you. Food? Here, I am no different than the Creation God. Anything you want to eat, anything you want to drink, I can make it all. Battle? World\u2019s enemy? None of that\u2019s important. I\u2019m being serious.]</p><br/><p>Her power, her fragrance became stronger. I couldn\u2019t believe she wasn\u2019t at her limit. The power of seduction I believed I warded off came back stronger than ever. There was no room for doubt. This was the real her, the real Lilith.</p><br/><p>[Nothing\u2019s more important than pleasure. Be with me. I can let you taste pleasure incomparable to the girl you took in.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, forever with you\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes, with me for all eternity.]</p><br/><p>Her words made me quiver. She didn\u2019t possess absolute military force or unrelenting magic power. All she had was a terrifying charm. With this power of charm, she could seduce inanimate objects and create miracles.</p><br/><p>Absurd. Too absurd! Sherafina\u2026 Just what was she thinking, trapping her in Beyond\u2019s 35th floor!? She was on a completely different league than Crimson Hell. Crimson Hell could at resist me physically, but Lilith\u2026</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[Kyaaaaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>A horrible shriek rang out in the palace. At the same time, the chains holding Lilith\u2019s chair finally broke off from chaos flames\u2019 continued blaze, and the chair plummeted to the ground.</p><br/><p>Lilith screamed with her hands on her face as she helplessly fell to the ground with her chair. I immediately shot my spear towards her, but the chains on the chair surprisingly came together and blocked my spear.</p><br/><p>For mere chains, they were incredibly tough, stopping my follow up attack and preventing me from further injuring Lilith. In truth, this was also partly because I couldn\u2019t use my full strength as I was trouble moving my body.</p><br/><p>[How\u2026 How\u2026!]</p><br/><p>Lilith staggered up. Her face was covered in blood. She was covering one side of her face with her hand, and I knew very well why.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrimson Hell could resist me physically\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I barely held up my body trembling from her charm and retrieved the spear I shot at her face. At the end of the spear blade was her skewered eye.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you really only have charm. What a letdown.\u201d</p><br/><p>I pulled out her eye and squeezed it. The jewel-like eye exploded, and the power within it began to flow into me.</p><br/><p>[You\u2026 How, you\u2019re a man! You\u2019re a man!]</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, now that you\u2019re one-eyed, you\u2019re not half bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>I smiled sweetly. Because I stole some of her power of charm, Lilith didn\u2019t look so fearsome and lovable anymore.</p><br/><p>In fact, looking at Lilith, whose magic power was leaking out in buckets, my fighting spirit was soaring. What a proper warrior should have was now standing tall.</p><br/><p>[If that\u2019s your wish, I\u2019ll kill you\u2026! I\u2019ll kill you and erase that girl\u2019s existence too!]</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I say it at the start? Fight me.\u201d</p><br/><p>I retorted lightly. When Lilith rolled her foot, her magic power spread out through the entire palace, and the dozens of golden statues that seemed to just be decorations began to move. Her god-like charm could even dominate inanimate objects. These golden statues were here to serve as her loyal soldiers.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat, now let\u2019s have some fun!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wearing nothing but my underwear, I held my spear up and grinned confidently.</p><br/><p>Then, I charged forward.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Is there a bank?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the Floor Shop, stupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if my intelligence stat was 10, I had lived too long as a fool. Even though I increased my intelligence stat, it was still difficult to breach the level I was born with.</p><br/><p>I talked back to my father, not fully understanding what he meant by going to the Floor Shop. In the end, I had to pay with my body. It was true that the body suffered if the mind was stupid.</p><br/><p>A week later, when I could re-enter the dungeon, I did not shout \u2018commence exploration,\u2019 but rather turned back and went to the 2nd Floor Shop.</p><br/><p>Because I was told what I wanted was at the 10th Floor Shop, I had not visited the 1st and 2nd Floor Shops. It was because I felt I would waste my gold if I saw what was on display.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, customer, you can exchange 2,400 won for 1 gold.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c2,400 won!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, customer. The exchange rate changes at 6 A.M. every morning, so I suggest you exchange it now when the rate is high.\u201d</p><br/><p>I gasped in front of the Floor Shop owner, who was a pretty noona.</p><br/><p>2,400 won!</p><br/><p>The first floor\u2019s slimes usually dropped 1 gold for every three killed and the 2nd floor\u2019s honey bees dropped 2 gold at the same rate. Although I had not killed many goblins, they dropped 4 to 5 gold.</p><br/><p>This number was likely to increase exponentially as I went higher into the dungeon. Currently, I possessed 655 gold. Although my mental math wasn\u2019t perfect, I knew I would have well more than 1,000,000 won if I exchanged all that I had.</p><br/><p>1,000,000 won! It was an unimaginable amount for the fifteen-year-old me. Even a single Sin Saimdang[1. Sin Saimdang is the woman on the Korean 50,000 won bill.] would make me tremble, but 1,000,000 won meant twenty Sin Saimdangs!</p><br/><p>I was certain 1,000,000 won would be a large amount for any fifteen year old. It was then that I realized what my father meant by dungeon explorer being the highest-paying job.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stood in awe. Soon, I opened my mouth to ask the shop noona to exchange all the gold I had. Suddenly, I remembered. To obtain Qi, I had to buy a mana cultivation method. To do that, I had to go to the 10th Floor Shop, and I had to buy it\u2026 with gold.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>My shoulders dropped. Then, the shop noona looked at me with worrying eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, customer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No, it\u2019s nothing. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I was conflicted, I swallowed my tears and turned back. Qi! I gave up 1,000,000 won for this thing called qi! However, I remembered my father always talking about the importance of having qi. Thus, I chose to prioritize qi rather than 1,000,000 won.</p><br/><p>Once I obtained qi, I vowed to exchange all the gold I had and eat all the delicious things in the world! With that, I jumped into the 3rd floor.</p><br/><p>Of course, I became paralyzed by the goblins\u2019 darts and was beaten to death again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do, father!? I got kicked out because of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor my son, you really are stupid. You could have just left the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, why didn\u2019t you tell me earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa. When you level up, increase your intelligence stat first, got it? I\u2019ll tell you how to deal with the poisonous darts first\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What my father said was simple. I just had to buy and consume the paralyses recovery potion from the 2nd Floor Shop. With just one, I would become immune to paralysis for a whole hour. Why didn\u2019t I buy it when I went there before!? I regretted not checking what was being sold.</p><br/><p>That day, I made two vows. One was that I would visit the Floor Shop every time I cleared a floor and check what was being sold. The second was that I would increase my intelligence stat when I leveled up.</p><br/><p>As a result, I was able to safely reach the 5th floor. It had only taken me half a year.</p><br/><p>\u201cChwiik! Human!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuman, bigger than us!\u201d</p><br/><p>What appeared on the 5th floor were pig-headed humans speaking human language. According to the message noona that spoke to me from time to time, they were monsters called orcs. Although I felt a sense of closeness to them because of our similarity in size, I was annoyed by their tendency to treat me as food and attack.</p><br/><p>However, I was at a disadvantage when I faced them directly. I had put 15 points into intelligence, and my intelligence was now at 20. Although I had gotten smarter, my other stats were low. Because I did not yet know any other method of raising my status points, I was forced to fight the orcs when my overall spec was below them.</p><br/><p>\u201cChwiik! Human, weak! Weak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s weak!? Agh, I shouldn\u2019t have put everything into intelligence. Agh!\u201d</p><br/><p>I could finally think of it once my intelligence had reached 20. Of course, I was forced out, unable to defeat any of them.</p><br/><p>At this time, I began to learn with my smarter brain and I could finally communicate with others my age. I had stopped talking about dungeons at school after the \u2018Kang Shin\u2019s Dungeon Explorer Incident,\u2019 and after my intelligence reached 20, I came to understand that it wasn\u2019t normal that I could enter dungeons. I also learned it was abnormal to have family spear techniques to learn.</p><br/><p>Realizing that I might end up a loner for the rest of my life, I started to furiously study common sense, and after the 10th time I was kicked out of the 5th floor, I was able to act like a normal human being. There wasn\u2019t much I could do about my huge frame, but I had finally managed to make some friends.</p><br/><p>It was also the first time I learned of the existence of online RPG games.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Shin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this dun\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The word dungeon almost came out my mouth before I swallowed it back down. The RPG game character\u2019s \u2018status\u2019 was too similar to the status I had. That said, I couldn\u2019t show my status to my friends. I could open my inventory and bring out my wooden spear, but I didn\u2019t, as I was afraid the government would come to take me away.</p><br/><p>However, I was now certain. Although the interface was different, there were many things in common, like the inventory, status, and monsters. Thus, I began to learn games with the hope that it would help me in my future dungeon exploration.</p><br/><p>Unlike in RPGs, I couldn\u2019t gain experience and level up no matter how many monsters I killed. All I could get from them were their body parts, gold, skill experience, and the extremely rare equipment. From this, I found my answer.</p><br/><p>If my stats were too low, I had to make do with skills. My attack power got stronger with increased skill levels. It was what I learned from playing games.</p><br/><p>\u201cUraaaaaaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChwiik, mere human!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMere orc!\u201d</p><br/><p>I quarreled with the orcs as I stabbed them with my spear. When I told my father about it, he treated me like a weirdo.</p><br/><p>The mid-rank spear technique that had started out at level 3 had slowly grown as I fought the orcs on the 5th floor. Half a year after I entered the 5th floor, when I had entered my first year of high school, I had finally reached level 10, the master level.</p><br/><p>[You have mastered the Mid-rank Spear Technique! You can strike even more fiercely and sharply with your spear. You can intimidate others whose skill level is lower than yours.]</p><br/><p>[You must possess mana to learn High-rank Spear Technique. You cannot learn the High-rank Spear Technique.]</p><br/><p>Here, mana once again held me down. However, I did not give up. I knew I could gain mana once I reached the 10th floor.</p><br/><p>In truth, I had already realized it. My father was unable to gain mana even after 20 years of being a dungeon explorer. Not long after my intelligence increased, I finally understood what it suggested. However, I did my best to ignore it. I didn\u2019t want to accept the fact that I\u2026 could not obtain mana. Afraid of knowing the truth, I didn\u2019t ask my father.</p><br/><p>The 5th floor was different than the other floors. Unlike the 1st through 4th floors where my level had gone up automatically once I reached the end of the hallway, there was a large door at the end of the 5th floor hallway. When I stood in front of it, the calm voice once again entered my ears.</p><br/><p>[The Floor Master, Orc Lord, is beyond this door. Would you like to enter alone? Or would you like to request a party with players from other dimensions?]</p><br/><p>What was beyond the door was undoubtedly the \u2018boss monster.\u2019 As this was the first time I had faced it, I was extremely excited. I didn\u2019t know what the voice meant by other dimensions, but I found requesting for help without even giving it a try to not be in the spirit of a man\u2019s pride. As such, I slammed the door open.</p><br/><p>\u201cOrc Lord! Fight me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Chwiik.\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside the room were about fifteen orcs, all of whom were glaring at me. Deeper inside was a larger pig-human sitting on a large chair and biting down on a piece of meat. He raised his head and I realized just how big he was.</p><br/><p>He was wearing a thick steel armor and had a glaive leaning next to him. Without mistake, he was the Orc Lord. I let out a light smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I came to the wrong place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I quickly stepped back, the door had closed behind me automatically. The orcs slowly got up one by one as they picked up their weapons.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fudge, those things hurt like hell,\u2019 I whispered as I dropped my head.</p><br/><p>It had been a while since I was kicked out.</p><br/><p>I was beaten to oblivion.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

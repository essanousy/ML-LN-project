Final Wave (5)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Revival\u2019s position on Earth left no room for doubt.</p><br/><p>In the past, Guardian or other government agencies closely monitored whatever actions Revival took, and practically all kinds of mass media flocked to analyze the situation. But now, Revival only needed to say the word to achieve anything they wanted. In fact, the extent to which this was true was reaching a terrifying degree.</p><br/><p>I only realized this while I was taking care of overdue work. Among them, the first thing I had to solve was the dungeon outbreak that would happen in less than two months.</p><br/><p>Thanks to Ciara, we knew that the fourth dungeon outbreak wouldn\u2019t be like any of the past outbreaks. This time, demons from the Luka continent would invade Earth directly.</p><br/><p>Although we wouldn\u2019t be able to stop them completely, knowing what will happen gave us time to prepare against it.</p><br/><p>I first summoned all the free Revival members to the guild house and practiced dimensional magic while I waited. After about ten minutes, the door to the conference room opened and Hwaya sauntered in feebly.</p><br/><p>Last time I heard, she was going through Beyond\u2019s 24th floor. I doubt she died on purpose to make it to the meeting, which meant she cleared the floor in such short period of time! That also explained why she looked so exhausted.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, Ciara was humming around me with a proud boasting look, did you do something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya, didn\u2019t she tell you something more important?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya immediately changed her manner and let out a deep sigh. It was the kind of sigh a middle-aged assistant manager who had little chance for a promotion.</p><br/><p>She spoke with a pitiful face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour blessing didn\u2019t last long. Give me another one. A stronger one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you want to escape from reality, but this isn\u2019t a joking matter\u2026 Come here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I gave her the blessing she wanted, her expression brightened. But it seemed she wasn\u2019t satisfied with just the blessing as she walked into my embrace with open arms.</p><br/><p>Compared to her high level, Hwaya\u2019s constitution was worryingly low. The lightness of her body made me worry about her even more. As if to confirm my thoughts, Hwaya whispered in a slightly dazed tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, I know we\u2019re in a hurry\u2026 but let me stay like this for a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, unlike how you act, your shoulders are reliable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya only had a few people she could act spoiled around, and with how much she supported me emotionally, I was glad I could help her this way. Things were quite comfortable as neither of us talked.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the door opened again.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who walked in at this timing was none other than Walker. Because Hwaya had her face buried between my shoulders, she didn\u2019t know who walked in. As for Walker, he immediately grinned when he saw us.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like I came in at a bad time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up and sit down, Walker.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya grumbled without turning around or getting up. If it was like any other day, it wouldn\u2019t have been weird if she shot a fireball at him. Walker seemed to have known this too as he sat down with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou better take care of her, Kang Shin. When she\u2019s not in front of you, she\u2019s noticeably weak and exhausted. If you abandon her, you\u2019ll go to hell.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t happen. You just worry about Sophie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sophie then walked in through the open door. Not only her, but Yua, Ludia, Ye-Eun, Father and other members walked in together. Yua furrowed her brows the moment she saw Hwaya and me, and Hwaya finally got up while grumbling once more.</p><br/><p>Using my freed hands, I picked displayed the document I looked over with Ciara on a projection.</p><br/><p>\u201cSimply said, I wanted to talk to everyone about the upcoming dungeon outbreak. Everyone should know about Ciara\u2019s foresight ability, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, I explained how the Luka continent might overwrite parts of Earth. Everyone listened in in a daze.</p><br/><p>Overwriting Earth\u2019s lands. It was similar to how Event Dungeons became Field Dungeons when they were left uncleared. Lands that underwent such transformation couldn\u2019t be changed back.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-Wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sophie spoke with an expression that seemed to say that her head hurt.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe outbreak\u2019s scale\u2026 Any predictions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSophie, this might be a bit shocking but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I wonder when it started. Was it when I mastered Peruta Circuit and reforged my body? Or was it when I killed the Beast King? I didn\u2019t know exactly when, but from a certain point, I seemed to gain a bit of an intuition. Furthermore, it was especially strong when it came to matters relating to the world\u2019s power, Heroes, and worlds\u2019 enemies.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t something like Ciara\u2019s foresight ability. I believed it was a natural product of my League increasing. In any case, this intuition of mine was speaking strongly. I relayed the message my intuition was trying to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis will be the final one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFinal one? \u2026 Ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sophie and the others who weren\u2019t sure of the situation turned pale. I then projected the world map. It was result of all the succubi\u2019s countless hours of investigation and analysis.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know how big Luka continent is, nor do we know how big the monsters\u2019 world is. But we did find a rule that the previous \u2018invasions\u2019 followed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDungeons won\u2019t appear where they\u2019ve already appeared before.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, I manipulated the projection. Parts of the world map began to turn red. Watching the map, Ye-Eun asked, tilting her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Event Dungeons appear more than once in Yeongdeungpo District?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe exact location didn\u2019t overlap. It\u2019s the same for other places. But if those two dungeons in Yeongdeungpo became Field Dungeons, they might not swallow all of Yeongdeungpo together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Over 60% of the map was red. I nodded and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose are areas that the Luka continent will overwrite. Monsters and demons will be crawling in these red areas.\u201d</p><br/><p>Up until now, we had destroyed many Event Dungeons. Considering how quickly they came and how uncooperative other ability users were, our accomplishments were truly praiseworthy. But even with that, we had not covered even half of Earth.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is hell\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNone of the other worlds faced something like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia agreed with someone\u2019s remark with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this for a while. Event Dungeons are occurring too quickly on Earth and there are too many of them too. When Luka continent got invaded, demons didn\u2019t move their previous world\u2019s land. They only crossed over to our world themselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPanan continent also didn\u2019t go through anything like this. How can Earth be this unlucky? Though, I have to admit, it\u2019s lucky to have someone like Crown Prince\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren agreed with Ludia. Kain, who came surprisingly, made an audible hurumph.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time something like this has happened\u2026 My world faced something similar. Monsters and their lands crossed over in the middle of densely populated areas. It was quite a tragic scene.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTragic scene?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it, I get it. Don\u2019t listen to him, everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>I tried to interrupt him, but Kain continued resolutely.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s simple. Monsters or objects suddenly appeared where humans were, exactly on top of them. It wasn\u2019t too bad when objects crossed over. If you were one of the unlucky ones who were at that wrong place at the wrong time, you would die, but at least it would be swift. But when monsters crossed over, it was a bit of a pain. Humans becoming chimeras was one thing, but monsters gained superior intellect when they fused with humans, becoming a even scarier threat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSee, I told you not to listen.\u201d</p><br/><p>I mocked Walker who ran out of the conference room with a pale face. \u2026Wait, Walker?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cS-Sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason, Sophie apologized in his place. Seeing her apologetic and embarrassed face, I asked with doubt.</p><br/><p>\u201cSophie, are you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, yeah. He has Couvade syndrome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Silence descended. Ye-Eun was the only one tilting her head, wondering what Couvade syndrome was. After Ludia whispered her an explanation, she became silent. Ludia knowing more about Earth\u2019s knowledge than Ye-Eun was unexpected, but that wasn\u2019t important at the moment.</p><br/><p>Hoping to change the mood, I made a soft remark.</p><br/><p>\u201cC-Congrats.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks. But I couldn\u2019t say it because of everything happening recently\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing her extremely apologetic face, I sighed. I\u2019m sure they were being careful, but I knew things didn\u2019t always go as one planned.</p><br/><p>Hwaya spoke quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is great.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is! Congrats, Sophie. I thought I was going to be the first one. I\u2019m jealous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSays who?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia sneered and Hwaya snorted back. Thanks to them, the awkward atmosphere went away.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know each of our strengths are important\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry. We were careful, we really were\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, you don\u2019t have to feel sorry. \u2026How long has it been?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree months. I\u2019m fine, but Edward is still like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>I closed my eyes and opened them before making an announcement.</p><br/><p>\u201cSophie, rest from now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m fine for now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, rest. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, we can\u2019t overwork you. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll make Walker make up for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Sophie became silent. At that moment, Walker came back in with his head down.</p><br/><p>I spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo excuses?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou better get ready to work your ass off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m at your command\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s also talk about this now. We can\u2019t do anything about what already happened, but everyone should be more careful so as to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, I closed my mouth. Along with Hwaya, all the girls were looking at me with sparkling eyes. As I knew understood exactly what they were thinking, I stealthily changed what I was going to say.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Ren, be careful with Lebuik.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? What is this Couvade syndrome? Lebuik and I have to be careful? Is it a disease contagious to beastmen!?\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed I didn\u2019t need to worry about Lebuik. With a sigh, I clapped to signal this talk was over.</p><br/><p>However, it seemed Kain wanted to keep talking about his damned chimeras, as he looked at me and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid this never happen in Earth?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNever. There were monsters that appeared on Earth without going through Event Dungeons, I don\u2019t know if it was luck, but no monster ever fused with a human. Though, maybe we just never discovered one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think it will be the same this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><br/><p>I shook my head vehemently.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re gathered here. To prevent incidents like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 We have to take such a huge land transmittance into account?\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker spoke unconvinced. Land transmittance, it was the perfect phrase to describe what would happen.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Looks like there will be a mass migration.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sumire added quietly. I nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll contact each country\u2019s Guardian and government. Directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s exactly what I did that day. Along with announcing humanity\u2019s need to evacuate, I revealed the areas of land transmittance.</p><br/><p>By a single sentence from me, a mass migration began the next day.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

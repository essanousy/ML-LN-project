Breakthrough (1)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>After eliminating the Five Kings from Earth, we agreed that we needed to clean up as much of the monsters\u2019 territories as possible as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>However, the explorers we newly appointed and the members of Revival were all busy climbing the dungeon and training to get stronger. I also wanted to focus on just climbing the dungeon if possible.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Guardian and Freedom Wing were all too weak for us to just leave everything to them. Even now, they could barely hold their ground against even the most ordinary monsters. I had to acknowledge their hard work, but the reality was coldhearted. They were simply too weak.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, do you have any orders for us?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, I ended up looking for the succubi. The reason was simple. I wanted them to find the most efficient route for me to take so I can massacre all the monsters. Since I needed to fill up my depleted death energy, it was killing two birds with one stone.</p><br/><p>During my fight against Crimson Hell, I found out how useful death energy was. Since I was running low, it would be stupid of me to not refill it. If I had a lot of death energy left during my fight with Lilith, I felt it would have gone smoother as well.</p><br/><p>Now that it\u2019s gotten more difficult to carry out a massacre in the dungeon, taking care of monsters on Earth was the best method of getting death energy.</p><br/><p>That said, I didn\u2019t look for Licorice as I knew she was busy. I just contacted the information collection team consisting of 30 succubi stationed at the guild house.</p><br/><p>Currently, Licorice, her direct subordinate, the Elder Succubus Mirei, and one other very powerful succubi were in closed-door training. As they were focusing on taking the energy of other succubi to strengthen themselves, I could see that the information collection team\u2019s succubi were weaker.</p><br/><p>I felt sorry seeing faint dark circles underneath the succubi\u2019s eyes. Still, they weren\u2019t humans and thus wouldn\u2019t get dark circles. I knew they were faking them to appeal to me, and I considered their effort cute and gave each of them a warm hug to which the succubi rejoiced unabashedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood work, everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, everyone is working hard. It\u2019s also been a while since I saw Hwaya-nim\u2019s face.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the Elder Succubus Mirei who was in charge of the normal succubi, and it was Hwaya who was in charge of Mirei. With Mirei leaving to train, the succubi had to report to Hwaya directly, but because she was focusing on climbing the dungeon and breaking through Beyond, the succubi\u2019s work seemed to be getting delayed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many succubi are on the frontline?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMost of them returned. Rather than splitting up and hunting separately, we\u2019re focusing all our forces in one place to clear it thoroughly. Only, the succubi\u2019s have lost a lot of their individual power. As you know, our Queen is transforming into an Empress\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Aren\u2019t they the same thing? That\u2019s the first thing I thought, but the succubi chortled and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems our Queen was too embarrassed to tell you herself. She didn\u2019t plan on becoming an Empress, but with Dear Husband obtaining a great power recently\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat power? This?\u201d</p><br/><p>I pointed at my horn and asked. The succubus I was speaking to let out a deep sigh in rapture.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Dear Husband obtained Lilith\u2019s power. Because of it, our Queen has been affected significantly too. Of course, she affected Dear Husband too, but the horn on Dear Husband\u2019s forehead is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, can you tell me about this in more detail?\u201d</p><br/><p>I grabbed the succubus\u2019 shoulders. She quickly cupped her hands over her mouth with a look of \u2018oops\u2019, but considering the side-glances she was giving me, it seemed she planned on leaking this information to me from the beginning. These succubi took after Licorice too much. They were all so sly!</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband has a contract with the Queen, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat contract was originally a regular companion-contract, but when Dear Husband took Lilith\u2019s power, the Queen was affected and the form of the contract changed along with Dear Husband\u2019s appearance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 That kind of makes sense?\u201d</p><br/><p>I did think it was strange that obtaining Lilith\u2019s power gave me a horn. It seemed being contracted to Licorice, a Succubus Queen, had affected me unknowingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuccubi and incubi as species are very skilled in using charm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Mares, they naturally had high charm and were apt in transferring their charm onto others. As this was their innate racial ability, there was no way for humans to match up to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband is a pure human, but you accepted Lilith\u2019s power. Because of the contract, Dear Husband has with the Queen, Dear Husband could adapt to use Lilith\u2019s power more effectively.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean, without my contract with Licorice, I would have taken Lilith\u2019s magic power normally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without my skin turning white, without parts of my hair turning red, and without growing a horn. I thought it was just the power I couldn\u2019t controlling leaking out, but it seemed there was more to it than I initially thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought this change was because I couldn\u2019t fully control Lilith\u2019s power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not. Dear Husband already absorbed several powers that are of equal level, if not slightly lower, than Lilith\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Now that you mention it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Right, I still had room to grow. How could there be not enough space in my body to contain Lilith\u2019s power? I was simply mistaken.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t a leakage of power. What this change did was to make me go beyond the limits of a human, so I could better utilize my charm rather than keeping my charm trapped inside my body and letting it out in clumsy ways.</p><br/><p>It\u2019ll disappear eventually? I was thoroughly mistaken. This horn would be an important weapon to help me control charm.</p><br/><p>\u201cTaking in Lilith\u2019s power served as a trigger to rouse the Queen\u2019s mana residing in Dear Husband\u2019s subconscious, and that resulted in Dear Husband transforming to better utilize a Mare\u2019s ability. So\u2026 Dear Husband is no longer completely human.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Are you saying I became half Mare?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot half, but erm\u2026 about one fifth?\u201d</p><br/><p>I became lost for words. I felt a slight headache, but when I thought about it again, it didn\u2019t seem so important. No matter what the process was, I had gotten stronger and I could now use the power of charm to an unbelievable extent. So what if I became slightly non-human? \u2026 In fact, the way of girls looked at me was even stranger.</p><br/><p>\u201cI get it now. This isn\u2019t me being unable to process Lilith\u2019s power. It\u2019s the opposite. My body changed to use this power most efficiently, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, exactly. So controlling charm should be much more natural for Dear Husband. Though, a little bit of it might leak out because of its sheer power\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I get it, so get away from me a bit!\u201d</p><br/><p>The succubus sighed dejectedly and took a step back. Another succubus stepped in as though she was waiting for the chance.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs we said before, Lilith\u2019s power even affected our Queen. Lilith was a special existence independent from the succubi and the Succubus Queen. When Dear Husband received her power, the Queen was naturally affected by Lilith\u2019s power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo such an exchange occurred when I took in Lilith\u2019s power\u2026 If it\u2019ll help Licorice, I can give her as much as she needs. By the way, is Lilith this Empress you talked about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Lilith is just Lilith. No other title can describe her. There is another word to describe the realm above a Queen. It is Empress.\u201d</p><br/><p>After our fight with the Death King, Licorice took in the mana of dozens of dead succubi and transformed. She then announced she would get stronger by receiving mana from other succubi.</p><br/><p>But that was still within the ability of a Succubus Queen. Just like how a bowl didn\u2019t change shape no matter how much water one poured in, Licorice couldn\u2019t become a different species just by getting more mana.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me Lilith\u2019s power can do something like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Just like how Dear Husband became part-Mare, the Queen has surpassed her limits and obtained the possibility to evolve. By getting mana from all succubi, she\u2019s collecting the mana she needs to evolve.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. So I took in Lilith\u2019s power at a nice timing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, exactly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, Lilith\u2019s Horn should have become part of me as just another form of power. But because of my contract with Licorice, we were both unknowingly affected in a positive way. Truly interesting.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you won\u2019t be able to see her for about half a year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 unfortunate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though I often rejected Licorice\u2019s advances, Licorice was still very important to me. Her cheerful smiles and love supported me emotionally in more ways than she probably thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo in place of the Queen, we\u2019ll service Dear Husband.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah, the reason I came to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuu, you\u2019re no fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>I told the succubi what I came for. When I told them I planned on spending two days to clear regions with many monsters, they all became excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, can you give us a week? We have to see what the most dangerous regions are and also notify Guardian and Freedom Wing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, Dear Husband is going. We\u2019ll have to contact the other girls\u2026 Done!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGirls, bring all the information we have!\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, the room became noisy. They were happy that they had more work to do\u2026 Were they okay?</p><br/><p>With that question in mind, I left. I had to wait a week, which meant I was destined to go back to the dungeon.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

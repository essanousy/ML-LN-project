Third Season (3)</p><br/><p>As Paul might need to spend a long time on Earth, I first brought him to our guild house in Seoul\u2019s Jongno district. Ludia and Shuna immediately recognized Paul, but other than them, no one knew him. As most of Revival\u2019s members happened to be present, Paul introduced himself before he entered the thrashing phase.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Paul Von Cravis. It\u2019s nice to meet you all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Paul bowed politely without a single shred of a crown prince\u2019s dignity. Afterwards, he raised his head, scanned Revival\u2019s members, and let out a startled shout.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re amazing, Kang Shin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you can see through their power? You\u2019re not bad, Paul.\u201d</p><br/><p>Paul seemed excited, as he breathed out with his nose.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all amazing beauties!\u201d</p><br/><p>I increased the thrashing phase duration by two months in my heart and introduced Paul to Revival\u2019s members.</p><br/><p>\u201cPaul is Edias continent\u2019s successor Hero. His continent\u2019s Hero died without officially transferring his power. I happened to retrieve that power, and he\u2019ll be here until I transfer the Hero\u2019s power to him. As you might expect, he won\u2019t be an official member of Revival.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was wondering if we were finally going to get another male member.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to transfer a Hero\u2019s power. It\u2019ll take few months at the very least. Since I have to run around clearing Event Dungeons and monsters, it might even take a year or more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll be seeing each other for a long time. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, ooh! Nice to meet you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya, who was the most social one out of all of us, greeted Paul first. Paul then immediately greeted her back. Hwaya snickered. It was obvious what she was thinking about, but I had to give her credit for not saying it out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuccessor Hero\u2026 Hmm, it\u2019s nice to meet you. It hasn\u2019t been long since I heard about Heroes from my son, but it\u2019s interesting how so many Heroes are gathering here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, isn\u2019t it simple? If Earth falls to ruin, it\u2019ll take a few more worlds with it. So get stronger, Hero\u2019s father.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHohoho. Walker, have you heard of thrashing phase?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone in Revival knew what a Hero was and what happened if he died. I had already told them about it. Since I was the strongest person on Earth, they were surprised but they weren\u2019t scared. Regardless of who the Hero was, many of them already thought it would be hopeless without me. Nothing had changed for them. The fact that I couldn\u2019t deny this way of thinking saddened me.</p><br/><p>However, I didn\u2019t tell them about Ellos. I didn\u2019t want to upset them either. Not to mention, a few of them were sure to stick to me, worried about whether I was hurt.</p><br/><p>I was thankful for their concern, but rather than spoiling myself, I wanted to overcome it with my own strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Kasi\u2026 No, nevermind. Nice to meet you, Paul.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia was most likely misunderstanding what happened, but she seemed to have figured out what happened to Ellos since Paul was here instead of him. She swallowed her words and bowed politely. She could be considerate to others. I was quite proud of her growth.</p><br/><p>Paul also seemed to have realized what Ludia wanted to ask, as he pretended to be calm and greeted her back.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Palludia. You got even prettier. You\u2019re a stunning beauty, really.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t get pretty for you. It was for Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, yeah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>No, I was wrong. She was still savage. I made a bitter smile and turned away. I had to tell Ren something before he left for the dungeon.</p><br/><p>\u201cRen, I have a good news for you. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>I smiled at Ren sweetly. Ren let out dry coughs and took a couple of steps back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really want to hear it, I think.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine even if you don\u2019t. You\u2019ll experience it with your body soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it really was about thrashing phase!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe happy, it\u2019s the third season of thrashing phase!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Ren\u2019s somber expression, Paul seemed to be frightened too. Interestingly, Father was nodding his head in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back safely.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya spoke to me as she gave the rowdy men a look of ridicule. I nodded at her and asked her through the messaging system.</p><br/><p>[What happened with Ciara?]</p><br/><p>[She\u2019s fine. She\u2019s controlling mana by herself right now. She\u2019ll be fine on her own in about two days.]</p><br/><p>What Hwaya had done was truly praiseworthy. I gave Hwaya a thumbs up, and she responded with a victory sign. Ye-Eun noticed us and pouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys talked secretly again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was about Ciara. I explained last time, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I said Ciara\u2019s name, everyone became quiet. They were divided into two groups \u2013 one that hated Ciara because they were present when we first met Ciara and the ones that stayed quiet because they hadn\u2019t met Ciara or didn\u2019t know much about her. Thinking about it now, because I left for the Dimensional Mercenary mission immediately after I brought her, I hadn\u2019t given them a proper explanation.</p><br/><p>In that case, this was a good chance. Since it wasn\u2019t common for Revival\u2019s members to all be present, it was probably best to use this opportunity to explain myself. With a bitter smile, I told them about what situation Ciara was in and why I accepted her into Revival. Most of them were shocked to find out that Ciara had Evil Eyes, and some showed slight dislike at the idea of making her our ally.</p><br/><p>However, the general response was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like her as a person, but we certainly need her ability\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That.</p><br/><p>\u201cWon\u2019t she do something stupid?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI decided to put a succubus on her as a lookout. As you might know, she has absolutely no war potential. Even if something happens, we\u2019ll be able to restrain her, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, did you cure that girl?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was partly thanks to an Elixir, but yes, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible without my power.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father seemed to be thinking about something and soon nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have to worry about her that much. I\u2019m sure you know this, but she\u2019s still young. I think it was wrong of her to hide the information about the raid at the Antelope Canyon, but the environment she grew up in was too isolated. We have to think about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, father.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlus, children are quick to change, especially when they\u2019re in love. As she grows up, Shin will influence her a lot, so we won\u2019t need to worry about her too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, that\u2019s what I\u2019m worried about the most\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Father snickered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder. You gave back that child\u2019s eyes and voice, which even with her amazing power, she couldn\u2019t do anything about. I\u2019m sure it was more than enough to blow away every value she held. I think she\u2019ll have at least one of love or worship for you. What do you think? Which one do you prefer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019d rather take love.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I imagined Ciara creating something like Cult of Kang Shin and acting like its saintess, my face paled. It seemed I wasn\u2019t the only one who imagined this, as some of the others also wore the same face. At that moment, Daisy suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Then, are you reproducing, with her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaisy, you\u2019re banned from using that word from now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Then, copulating?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s banned too!\u201d</p><br/><p>I smacked her hand before she could say anything worse.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, that\u2019s it! Everyone disperse! Ren and Paul, you two follow me to the underground training room!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thrashing phase. It helped to make a new person.</p><br/><p>Thrashing phase. It thrashed a person\u2019s old self away.</p><br/><p>Thrashing phase. It transformed someone into something inhumane.</p><br/><p>\u201cSave me\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t die.\u201d</p><br/><p>I ignored Paul\u2019s plea and smacked his back. Then, I kicked Ren, who was pretending to be dead.</p><br/><p>\u201cRen, you won\u2019t get stronger by lying dead on the ground!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk! Crown Prince\u2026! Just what happened? How can you return as an even bigger monster!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can do it too, Ren!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with a hearty shout, Ren charged at me once more. It seemed he was mad about being kicked. Perfect, that was the response I wanted!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut even if you\u2019re angry, you can\u2019t make such an easy-to-read attack!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAaagggh!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I heard Ren\u2019s cry, it felt like ten-years worth of annoyance within me disappeared. Of course, I didn\u2019t say this out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you, Paul! You kept being beaten up! Aren\u2019t you mad!? Be more aggressive!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to be aggressive when I can\u2019t hit you anyways!? Let me go, I don\u2019t want to be a Hero!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be a Hero? Even if Edias continent loses its hope!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKu\u2026 Kuuuuu!\u201d</p><br/><p>At my words of encouragement, Paul finally picked himself up.</p><br/><p>Good, I didn\u2019t make the wrong choice. Paul was an idiot, but he was more responsible than an average person. Although Heroes had to be strong, it was just as important to have a sense of responsibility. To prevent what happened with Ellos from ever happening again, Edias continent\u2019s new Hero had to be someone like Paul.</p><br/><p>Of course, responsibility alone didn\u2019t solve anything. That was why Paul was going through a thrashing phase.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is hard. I think you don\u2019t have the talent for battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so blunt!\u201d</p><br/><p>After beating Paul up for three hours, I realized that he had no talent for battle. His talent was only about one-nineteenth of Ren\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know, the most important thing for a Hero is to not die.\u201d</p><br/><p>As such, I decided to narrow my focus.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot dying\u2026 Right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Paul nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlus, you\u2019re a crown prince. You won\u2019t need to stand on the front line, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut our Hero always stood on the front line.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because he was a capable warrior that could utilize the world\u2019s power in battle. That\u2019s not you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you keep scratching my pride!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThankfully, you have a bit of talent at defending.\u201d</p><br/><p>For several years, he climbed the dungeon as a tank. No matter how talentless he was, if he held the shield while climbing 50 floors of the First Dungeon, defensive maneuvers should at least be somewhat ingrained in his body. I personally thought he was more suited to defending than attacking too.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t properly grab monsters\u2019 attention and always put Ellos in danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to live. Why would you need to grab aggro? Don\u2019t. Just stay quiet like you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m so pitiful, I\u2019m crying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPaul.\u201d</p><br/><p>I pulled back the wooden spear I was hitting him with. Paul groaned and raised his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t want to be a Hero?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s more convenient for me to transfer the Hero\u2019s power to a random person. This might sound harsh, but I really have nothing to do with Edias continent. In fact, someone I considered to be a friend betrayed me and I had to go through unnecessary hardship. You should be thankful that I\u2019m even handing over the world\u2019s power. Now, with that said, let me ask again. Do you really not want to be a Hero?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 No.\u201d</p><br/><p>He shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Hero we believed would continue to live and lead us died. The friend I trusted the most abandoned our continent when his fianc\u00e9e died. \u2026 Now, there isn\u2019t anyone for me to trust but myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to protect your continent?\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked, and he replied as he gritted his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI do. I\u2019ve been hearing it nonstop ever since I became the crown prince, and I really do want to protect my empire and humanity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me ask you then. Don't you think having to hide is pitiful when it\u2019s to protect your continent?\u201d</p><br/><p>He raised his head. He stared into my eyes, then smacked his own face. He really struck hard. He groaned and spat out a tooth with blood leaking from his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Sorry for acting spoiled. Help me. Help me so that I can survive no matter who or what I\u2019m facing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, let\u2019s put your tooth back in.\u201d</p><br/><p>With holy power, putting a tooth back in was a piece of cake. However, Paul shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine even if I\u2019m missing a tooth\u2026 But let me hold on to it. Whenever I\u2019m thinking like I am today, I\u2019ll take it out and fix my attitude.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, now you have the face of a warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>I grinned and held the wooden spear up again.</p><br/><p>\u201cRen, rest for 30 minutes. I\u2019m going to teach Paul basics of defense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to kill him, tone it down a bit!\u201d</p><br/><p>I ignored Ren and charged at Paul. Paul gritted his teeth and held up his shield, but it was impossible for him to block my attack. At least, not yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter we\u2019re done, you won\u2019t even sweat when you\u2019re blocking an attack of this level! Prepare yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>Paul howled. Then, he held up his shield again and fixed his stance. He was determined and motivated. He now had the mindset of a warrior. Inspired by his determination, I spoke as I pointed my wooden spear at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m also training in something right now, so be careful not to get hit by it and die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Two voices simultaneously rang out. Ren, who was resting on his butt, moved away slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince, I forgot to tell you something. I promised the kids that I\u2019d make dinner\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElfa has been learning how to cook lately. I already messaged her, so you won\u2019t have to worry about making them dinner. Happy, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, haha\u2026 I\u2019m very\u2026 happy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren dropped his head. Paul's face told me that he was seriously contemplating dropping his shield and running away. Of course, there was no way I would let that happen.</p><br/><p>Third season. It seemed like it would be an enjoyable thrashing phase.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

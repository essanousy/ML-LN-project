I Can Hear Your Voice (4)</p><br/><p>She did not cry. Even when her country fell to ruin, even when her continent collapsed, even when her sister was dragged away by the Demon Lord, even when the emperor and empress committed suicide.</p><br/><p>As the crown princess and the last surviving member of the Empire, she stood tall until the end.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll come back to reclaim what is mine!]</p><br/><p>[My lovely Crown Princess, what a shame it is to have you leave. I will await the day I see you again.]</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord whispered to the girl in my embrace with a sly expression, then faced me and said.</p><br/><p>[Savior, Hero. For what reason have you arrived at this fallen world?]</p><br/><p>[Agh, you have a severe case of eighth-grade syndrome. I\u2019m just here to save my friend.]</p><br/><p>[\u2026 The reason I will not kill you now is-]</p><br/><p>[Because you can\u2019t, idiot. I\u2019m leaving. Next time I see you, the first thing I\u2019ll do is punch you in the face. Return!]</p><br/><p>[How arrogant, Human.]</p><br/><p>At my shout, my surroundings shone with a brilliant light and a door appeared in midair. I opened the door and stuck my middle finger out at the Demon Lord who was trying to look cool until the end.</p><br/><p>[If you don\u2019t like it, why don\u2019t you come over to my world!?]</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Again.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was another unpleasant morning. Was it because I only said I\u2019d go easy and really didn\u2019t?</p><br/><p>My entire body felt out of sorts and I had a splitting headache. I sat down cross-legged on my bed and initiated Peruta Circuit. Whenever my body felt out of balance, Peruta told me to use the Peruta Circuit to rebalance it.</p><br/><p>Mana, which circulated with my body as the center, was extremely intense, but at the same time, extremely pure and dynamic in movement. Once I began to circulate it, it moved mostly by itself.</p><br/><p>Circulating the mana inside of me and accepting the outside mana, I spit out the impurities that had accumulated inside of me.</p><br/><p>[Kyaa, cool prince!]</p><br/><p>[The mana is so bright. I\u2019m being sucked in~]</p><br/><p>[Someone hold him!]</p><br/><p>I knocked on my ear a few times and stretched. Today was the weekend, so I headed to the dungeon right after breakfast. It was the day I would challenge the Dark Ratman with just two people. My partner was none other than Shina.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure? You left your party members behind. Plus, it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. We\u2019re only making small progress on the 17th floor. Plus, all the party members are busy today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shina answered as if she had it prepared beforehand. On one hand, she held a round shield, and a longsword on the other. As expected of a party leader, her equipment looked good.</p><br/><p>She would be my tank for today. She was stable and had the sense to dodge the Dark Ratman\u2019s skill. She was the best choice for a partner.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m slightly worried, but I know I\u2019ll be fine with you, oppa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep. Like I said, you just have to delay the Dark Ratman for a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it. Take good care of me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Exchanging messages with her from time to time, we became close enough for her to call me oppa. She was usually mature, but she also knew how to spoil herself and act affectionately. She was overall a very likable girl. Though, of course, she wasn\u2019t a match for my Yua!</p><br/><p>With the boss fight in front of us, she put on her Lightning Resistant Robe. I had my Wraith Queen Set on as well.</p><br/><p>Although Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry was a fantastic skill, even if I could ignore the Dark Ratman\u2019s attack, just a single dark lightning would kill me. As such, it wasn\u2019t particularly useful in the 15th Floor Master fight.</p><br/><p>Wraith Queen Set\u2019s Vengeful Spirit\u2019s Wail had the effect of inflicting confusion and fear on surrounding enemies. With it, I could take care of all the ratmen minions while the Dark Ratman was stupefied.</p><br/><p>Thus, whenever I fought the Dark Ratman, I took off the Orc Lord Set I liked and wore the Wraith Queen Set which I still felt awkward in. I also couldn\u2019t help but shiver at the lightness of this armor set.</p><br/><p>However, Shina seemed to be paying attention to another side of the Wraith Queen Set.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, you look so cool, oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cM-Mm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, it goes well with your handsome face. Like royalty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cR-Royalty\u2026 you\u2019re flattering me too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>With how much I was being called Crown Prince, it would be bad if I confused myself for an actual royalty. With a bitter smile, I held up the Orc Lord\u2019s Glaive.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, you can flatter me after the fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it! Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>We stood side by side and kicked the door open. Inside, there were 40 ratmen and the Dark Ratman. It was the same as always.</p><br/><p>I shouted at the top of my lungs.</p><br/><p>\u201cCOME FIGHT ME!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You used the skill \u2018Provoke\u2019! You gained the attention of nearby enemies!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKigik!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKugagak! Kill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuman male!\u201d</p><br/><p>From above, it would give anyone watching the unpleasant feeling of a bunch of rats running. While I gripped my spear tightly and prepared to use Heroic Strike, I yelled toward Shina.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake care of the Dark Ratman!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dark Ratman was among the ratmen running toward me, and Shina rushed toward it to take the aggro. Sure enough, the Dark Ratman changed target, swiping at her with its claws.</p><br/><p>For some strange reason, the ratmen had low defense compared to their high attack. Their mental defense was even weaker. It was clear to see by how they were so easily provoked by a low-rank skill. Modifying the trajectory of my spear as I went, I included as many ratmen as possible in my attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeroic Strike!\u201d</p><br/><p>Clad in white light, my spear thrust forward and slaughtered about a dozen ratmen in its path. I then wrapped mana around the spear and began to pierce the other ratmen\u2019s throats.</p><br/><p>\u201cKueek!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuman!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>I continually used Provoke, making sure none of them went toward Shina. By piercing the ratmen\u2019s throats one by one, I made sure that they were dead.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyak! It\u2019s using its skill!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVengeful Spirit\u2019s Wail!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kiyaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>Although I wanted to save it since I could only use it once a day, Shina had already been hit by the lightning. She would be able to dodge the follow up attacks if she dodged the initial lightning, but she had no choice but to die if she was hit. Not unless I used Vengeful Spirit\u2019s Wail.</p><br/><p>[You used Vengeful Spirit\u2019s Wail! All enemies have become confused! All enemies have become feared!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKigigik! Human, too many humans!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScary, dark scary!\u201d</p><br/><p>The surroundings had become chaotic. Some of the ratmen began to fight each other, while others fell and trembled in fear. The Dark Ratman had also canceled his skill and was fighting the nearby ratmen with reddened eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have much time. Deal as much damage as you can!\u201d I shouted as I took care of several Ratmen with Tempest. Shina seemed to have recovered from the paralysis thanks to the Lightning Resistant Robe, as she gasped for air and concentrated mana on her sword. Her mana was the same color as her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake this! Hornet Pierce!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKueeek!\u201d</p><br/><p>While Shina was attacking the confused Dark Ratman, I continued to take care of the ratmen minions. With them fighting by themselves or trembling in fear, they were completely defenseless. When I killed the last ratmen, the effect of Vengeful Spirit\u2019s Wail wore off, and the Dark Ratman once again used his skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cKigigik, I will cook you until you\u2019re charred black!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you mean burn, idiot!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Dark Ratman uses Dark Thunder Explosion!]</p><br/><p>It was here! The moment black lightning began to explode out from his body, Shina and I jumped back. Alright, we dodged it!</p><br/><p>\u201cKugagaga!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dark Ratman continuously shot out lighting in madness. Of course, we weren\u2019t just watching from the side. I drank a Mana Potion and prepared my Heroic Strike, while Shina drank a Health Potion.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew, this is hard. You\u2019ve always been fighting like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, well\u2026 It\u2019s coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKugagagak! Humans!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEat this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the Dark Ratman charge toward us the moment his skill ended, I threw my spear forward. When I felt the condensed energy on the spear, I felt an unprecedented feeling of satisfaction. At the same time, I had a feeling that my spear would hit exactly where I aimed it.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKugagagak!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Orc Lord\u2019s Glaive completely pierced the Dark Ratman\u2019s chest, coming out of his back and nailing him to the wall. Blood spurted out from the Dark Ratman\u2019s chest as he collapsed on the ground. He was either dead or was on the verge of dying.</p><br/><p>\u201cA-Amazing. To pierce through a Floor Master\u2019s defense. Ah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShina! Hurry up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Yes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shina and I both charged toward the Dark Ratman. Although he twitched its body, unwilling to die, Shina\u2019s and my attack easily finished him off.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaap! Die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEit!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cK-Kiiii!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the last bloodcurdling shriek of his dying breath, Shina and I high-fived. We had succeeded.</p><br/><p>[You consumed a Thunder Crystal. Your resistance to lightning increases slightly. Your affinity with lightning increases. Your magic increases by 5. It seems taking more will not have any effect.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>I finished consuming Thunder Crystals to their limit much earlier than I anticipated. It was also unexpected that it would increase my magic by 5. As I was checking my status with satisfaction, Shina, who obtained the Dark Ratman\u2019s Leather Boots, looked at me with an apologetic expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it really okay, oppa? I hear the Leather Boots are a rare part.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already have it. I only need two more to complete my set.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA-Amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of them would come from hunting the Dark Ratman alone, so I really only had one more to go. Once I had that one piece\u2026 I would solo the Dark Ratman. I still wasn\u2019t confident, but I had no choice.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood luck, oppa! Although I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re doing, I know oppa can do anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, are you trying to cheer me up? Thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCall me if you ever need me again. I will always be available!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, see you again later.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said my goodbye to Shina who was acting cutesy with sparkling eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright, I\u2019ll obtain the last piece of the Dark Ratman Set by the end of the day. Then, I\u2019ll challenge him solo tomorrow.\u2019 I murmured, trying to ease my anxiety.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Those That Climb the Dungeon (2)</p><br/><p>I decided to return to Korea once Hwaya had already left Windermere for Korea. Of course, it only took me an instant. I called Walker from the dungeon, grabbed him, and shouted Return. That was it.</p><br/><p>\u201cH-Hm? What was that? What did you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a secret of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like that, I was home with Walker. Because I appeared in the living room with a foreigner, my family, who were gathered at the living room, suddenly froze.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, oppa\u2019s back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yua quickly jumped into my embrace. I patted her and gave Walker the glance, \u2018you\u2019re going to be guarding her.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, you were on TV, so I thought you\u2019d come back soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father pointed at the TV. On the screen was a platinum blonde, red-eyed man wearing a mask having an interview with the Windermere Lake as the background. They wanted me to do a quick interview as someone who had a major hand in clearing the Field Dungeon, but I didn\u2019t think the interview would even air in Korea.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa looked really cool!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, although it\u2019s not my real appearance.\u201d</p><br/><p>On TV, people were speculating from Thunder Knight\u2019s appearance that he was a mix between Western and Eastern. Seeing the newscaster clearly speaking about how I could even be Korean from my relationship with Hwaya, I felt slightly irritated.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo who\u2019s that young man?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWalker, this is my family. Introduce yourself, but keep it short.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Walker didn\u2019t know how to speak Korean, he introduced himself in English. However, as my family knew English to a certain extent like most Koreans, they didn\u2019t have too much trouble understanding him. In fact, since father had traveled often around the globe for training, he knew basic conversation level words in many languages.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous these days, so I hired him to be Yua\u2019s bodyguard. Ah, he won\u2019t be living with us or anything like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no bodyguard for your mother?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMother doesn\u2019t go out that much. If you\u2019re in danger, you can always call father or me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu, dear, look at our son ignoring his mother and only taking care of his sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you go out, you can just take me along. Anyways, bodyguard, huh\u2026 How did Walker, who is a dungeon explorer, end up being a bodyguard?\u201d</p><br/><p>I winked at father and told him that I\u2019d explain it later over private dungeon explorer message. Then, I patted Yua, who had calmed down a lot by now, two more times and separated myself from her. Then, I returned Ghostface back to Walker.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go Walker. We have to get you an identity and a place to live.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt sure became easy. Just by being an Awakened, countries will give you an identity. It\u2019s something unthinkable in the past. I still clearly remember people being deported as illegal aliens.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt just goes to show you how dangerous the world is now. Having one more ability user to fight against monsters is more important than petty things like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I was about to leave the house, Yua stopped me. With a radiant smile, she offered a hand to Walker.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t think I need a bodyguard, but take good care of me. I\u2019m Kang Yua.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, right, I\u2019m Edward Walker.\u201d</p><br/><p>They shook hands lightly. After their short greeting, Walker and I left the house. Walker then equipped Ghostface, changing his appearance into a man I had not seen before.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re equal in the contract, so just call me by my name.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou clearly have a collar on my neck, but\u2026 Fine. Kang Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour sister is innocent and kind, unlike you whose insides are black and violent. Are you guys from different parents?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you fall for her, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>His answer shocked me.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, she\u2019s half my age\u2026 It\u2019s not like I\u2019m a pedophile.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHalf!? How old are you!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m 36 this year.\u201d</p><br/><p>How does he look so young\u2026!?</p><br/><p>\u201cBrightman was 37, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been his toy since he was young. Just thinking about it makes me mad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrightman also only looked like he was in his late 20s, but you\u2019re even worse. I thought you were in early to mid 20s for sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Your stare is making me uncomfortable.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you married? Did Brightman not allow you to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t have the opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I see. You just didn\u2019t have the opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat way of talking is extremely unpleasant\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Why? You just didn\u2019t have the opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKu\u2026 I want to kill you, but just thinking about it makes my head hurt\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker half-assed the ability assessment and got a B rank. If he made good use of his equipment and stealth ability, I thought he could even be A+ rank. Of course, there was no reason for him to reveal his true ability in the assessment.</p><br/><p>After obtaining the ability user license, the rest went smoothly. For now, I got a hotel room for him to stay in and paid to rent a house near mine.</p><br/><p>In truth, I even thought about leaving the house and becoming independent. Since monsters would target me just because I was the Hero, my family would be the first ones in danger, as they were close to me. However, I thought back to what Loretta said. That I should wait a little while longer. That I should maintain my daily life until the day comes.</p><br/><p>I knew what the daily life she was talking about meant. It wasn\u2019t just the peace Loretta and I could enjoy together, but also my life on Earth. As such, it was fine for now. When the time came, she would tell me. I knew she was doing what was best for me. Of course\u2026 I would have to answer her too. Uuuu, it was a rather embarrassing, happy, and strange feeling. Now that I thought about it, there was the problem with Ye-Eun too. My head was twice as confused.</p><br/><p>Even while I was contemplating these things, I took care of Walker\u2019s hotel room and house rent. Walker suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must have a lot of money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can exchange gold for it, so I have more than enough for something like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though I\u2019m on the 44th floor, I only get 100 gold for about every three monsters I kill. With that, I don\u2019t have much left over once I spend it on potions and buying and fixing equipment. At least, I don\u2019t have enough leftover to spend it on something like this. Is it different for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on the 44th floor and only 100 gold drops at a time? Ha, so that\u2019s what the Third Dungeon is like.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really have talent for making people mad. You! Kuaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>I enjoyed watching Walker get angry and suffer by himself. Just like that, Walker became my neighbor and Yua got herself a trustworthy bodyguard. Only after I took care of these things could I finally return to the dungeon. Though, the dungeon\u2019s one week period had only ended today.</p><br/><p>I thought about challenging the Grim Reaper by myself again, but remembered Lin\u2019s words from a long time ago about many explorers being stuck on the 40th floor. As such, I thought I should try partying with them. The party I entered with that in mind was someone who looked to be at least 50 years old. Explorers didn\u2019t age as quickly as ordinary people, so it was likely that he was even older.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? I haven\u2019t seen you before. It\u2019s been a while since a newbie came to the 40th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the party leader, other fairly old people greeted me. A few of them looked extremely worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to get wiped out quicker than usual. Shouldn\u2019t we kick him out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that. Newbies have to get experience too. Since we\u2019re going to fail anyways, let\u2019s at least give him some experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t ever succeed anyways. We\u2019ll just rot away here on the 40th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this\u2026 helplessness? An overwhelming sense of defeat permeated the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if we break through, there isn\u2019t much meaning to raising my level anyways. In that case, we might as well help the newbie out a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheer up everyone. The newbie\u2019s going to be dispirited if you keep it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>No, I want to punch your face out first\u2026 I held myself back from saying many things, and gave a short introduction.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Kang shin, an explorer from Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExplorer from Earth?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin? Wait... Kang Shin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA few of our comrades who were stuck on the 40th floor broke through recently after partying with an explorer from Earth called Kang Yungoong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was there too. I died, but it seems they succeeded in the raid after that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s important. I heard recently in the Residential Area. Kang Shin is the Crown Prince from the rumors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince is on the 40th floor\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even they knew the name \u2018Crown Prince.\u2019 With a bitter smile, I continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cI already broke through the 40th floor, so I can say this seriously. If you want to advance past this floor, just do your best to survive. I can\u2019t be responsible for your safety.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also got it. I want to climb higher. I still have my world\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps\u2026 a miracle will also come to me. Although I left my world, I might be allowed to continue climbing\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Spirit returned to a few members. Good, this was enough. If I could light their cooled passion even a little bit, that was enough! I raised my Crimson Gluttony Spear into the air and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe goal is for everyone to break through the 40th floor. Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOooooh!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the reaper was the worst opponent to take on in groups. He mostly used huge area of effect attacks, and when he teleported behind a target he randomly chose, warriors received fatal injuries, and magicians and priests were killed in one hit. His blade waves, scythes being thrown out from his stomach, and black hands shooting out from the entire field were all fatal!</p><br/><p>It was hard to deal with just the reaper, but there were 500 apparitions to worry about. From the start, I told the party members to focus on killing the apparitions, but they still died one by one in the process. By the time all the apparitions were killed, only three other party members remained alive.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, today we lasted a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think we\u2019d actually kill all the apparitions\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWatch out behind you!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Die!]</p><br/><p>The moment the three of them heard my shouting, they rolled on the ground. The reaper\u2019s scythe the swung above their bodies. Immediately afterwards, I stopped the reaper\u2019s movements with Ruyue\u2019s ability. Because of the reaper\u2019s magical defense, Ruyue could only hold him for an instant, but it was still enough time for me to approach and stab him.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Divine Speed followed by White Lightning Consecutive Strikes! From the consecutive spear attacks, a huge hole was pierced in the reaper\u2019s chest. He then escaped Ruyue\u2019s shackles and summoned the black hands while he flew up. However, I already knew how to deal with the black hands.</p><br/><p>I infused Ruyue in my armor, and the black hands froze and shattered the moment they touched me. The others were huddled inside a holy barrier one of the surviving priests created. Confirming that they were safe, I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cPriest-nim, can you drop him from the sky!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO Iloinu, bring down that evil being! Divine Hammer!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaa! You insignificant bugs are annoying me!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>After dropping to the floor from the Divine Hammer, the reaper disappeared and appeared behind my back. I instantly turned around and stabbed his head with my spear. The lightning Spirit Aura from Peika rose up and drew his scream. Although he summoned a black scythe and dropped it on my head, if I was dumb enough to be hit by something like that, I wouldn\u2019t even be alive at the moment. With my spear still in my hands, I used his body as a pivot and spun, dodging the scythe. I then shook the spear more violently and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThunder Bomb!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>Even though my attack succeeded, I instantly backed off. A small scythe popped out of his body and flew through the air. His entire body was a weapon. I couldn\u2019t let my guard down for even a moment. I had to employ the hit-and-run method. Plus, even as I ran, I had to be careful as he had long-ranged attacks. He was truly an irritating boss.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll kill you, Hero!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think so much like me. I want to kill you too.\u201d</p><br/><p>I gave the reaper a cold smile and strengthened the grip on my spear. Then, without a shred of hesitation, I charged towards him. Like I\u2019d die a second time from that guy! Taste the wrath of the week-old grudge!</p><br/><p>[You obtained 37,500 gold.]</p><br/><p>[Rewards will be distributed in order of contribution.]</p><br/><p>[Kang Shin-nim\u2019s contribution is the highest. Choose your reward.]</p><br/><p>[1. Grim Reaper\u2019s Deathscythe</p><br/><p>2. Soul Strengthening Elixir</p><br/><p>3. Upper Mana Potion</p><br/><p>4. Reinforced Battlesword]</p><br/><p>In the end, I managed to kill the reaper without anyone else dying. However, the others were from different parties, and only looked at the reaper with half-happy, half-baffled expressions. I didn\u2019t really care about what they were feeling, so I simply looked at the reward list. Good, it was here. I immediately chose the Soul Strengthening Elixir and swallowed it.</p><br/><p>[You consumed the Soul Strengthening Elixir. Your refined soul becomes strengthened. Your magic and charm increase by 1.]</p><br/><p>A smile bloomed on my face. Good, I was getting stronger. I was advancing slowly, but surely. Being confident in my growth, I clenched my fists.</p><br/><p>I would continue hunting the reaper, grow stronger, advance onward in the dungeon, and continue growing stronger. I would raise my elementals, collect skills, and change my equipment if needed.</p><br/><p>Like that, I would become stronger.</p><br/><p>In order to not kneel in front of the despair these bastards always talked about.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>This one is 7,000 characters too\u2026 Wait, I could take 3,000 characters from the last chapter, 2,000 from this one, and make a chapter\u2026!</p><br/><p>Of course, if I did, the chapter\u2019s flow would be all over the place. So I won\u2019t. I plan on making the next chapter the normal length. Wish me luck everybody!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I didn\u2019t want to move even a single finger, and in truth, I barely had the strength to do so. Then, as Lotte put me down on the ground, Hwaya flew towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2019m okafdsah!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Uwak, Witch! What are you doing!?]</p><br/><p>Attacking me when I don\u2019t have any strength to resist! Even if I wanted to say something, I couldn\u2019t because her lips were completely blocking mine. I only resisted meekly as I made barely audible moaning sounds. Because of the pain and damage from Sacrifice and the fatigue that swept over after knowing that the battle ended, I couldn\u2019t move even though Hwaya wasn\u2019t restraining me strongly.</p><br/><p>Hwaya only let go of me once 30 seconds had passed. After barely mustering enough strength to take a step back, I pointed at my lips an shouted. Because of the huge shock, my legs were shaking.</p><br/><p>\u201c%!#$*$ (What were you doing)!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was too happy\u2026 Sorry, but I\u2019m happy with that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cM-My tongue was twisted.\u201d</p><br/><p>I staggered back with my face entirely reddened. I then bumped into someone. I turned around and saw Duca.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear, how about you do it again with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>I leaped backwards. Duca, who was smacking her lips and approaching me, was then punished by Hecate\u2019s whip. Both Daisy and her master were too reliable.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t scheme on another girl\u2019s man!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I have some fun? Ow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, as I thought, I can be great friends with Daisy. Even the\u2026 god called by her Deific Manifestation is so helpful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya who had acquired a spot next to me nodded her head as she watched in satisfaction. I hoped she\u2019d realize that she was just as scary as Duca.</p><br/><p>Then, without me having to say anything, Lotte quickly flew next to me and protected me. Lotte was the only one who understood me! Of course, I wanted to believe that she just wanted to protect her master and had no ulterior motives.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, how did you kill him? No, how was he even alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like it was a special magic, one that separated his body and soul. If I wasn\u2019t using Agni\u2019s power, I would have been done in too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, so he took out his soul before his body was heavily damaged.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep, and once he restored his body with lava, he could return his soul. Before he could do that, I incinerated his soul with Agni\u2019s power.\u201d</p><br/><p>That damned guy, doing all that when he was on the verge of death\u2026 He was even worse than me! Wait, was I spitting on my own face?</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks Hwaya, you saved us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI got my reward so it\u2019s fine\u2026 If you think it\u2019s not enough, can I get it again? The remaining 4.8 points. This time, from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 Sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>It went by 2.1 points! Uuu, straightforward women were too scary. If I let my guard down even for a second, I felt like I would just fall. The all-knowing expression of Hwaya\u2019s was even more worrisome.</p><br/><p>Seeing me flustered, her grin shone even brighter.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, do you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make an undead now.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like Hwaya was about to say something important, but Daisy, or rather Hecate, interrupted her. Hwaya glared at Hecate.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you going to cooperate!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, child. That child isn\u2019t your man, and I can\u2019t let my poor Daisy be alone forever. You\u2019re still young, so you should give up and find another wonderful man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d</p><br/><p>After ruining the mood, Hecate danced towards the volcanic crater as she whistled. It was then that Ina ran into my arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Ina, was it scary?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ina\u2019s eyes were teary. It seemed she thought I would die. When I looked away from Hwaya to console Ina, Hwaya drooped her shoulders and spoke weakly. She had undoubtedly gave up saying what she was about to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cArgh, I\u2019ll endure it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMommy, thanks for saving Daddy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t save my man, who would? You should stop crying too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. Next time, I\u2019ll get stronger and protect Daddy and Mommy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy will get stronger to protect Ina too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hugging Ina, it felt like my heart that was racing because of Hwaya and Duca was returning to its normal pace. I could finally relax. I patted Ina\u2019s head and pondered.</p><br/><p>Although romantic feelings made my heart pound, they also made me distracted and unfocused. On the other hand, when I was with Yua or Ina, I felt relaxed and was empowered by feelings of wanting to protect them. As I thought, for me right now, family was more important than romance.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Though something felt off, I decided not to pay attention to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, even with his soul gone, he still has such a powerful regenerative ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hecate gave an unreserved praise. When I approached the Lava King\u2019s corpse that had fallen into the lava, his severed head had been mostly regenerated. Even without a soul, his body had a terrifying strength. Even though so much mana had been shaved off and stolen, the mana remaining in his body was absurdly great. It was even absorbing the mana inside the lava pit.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t handle it soon, it will revive as an undead we can\u2019t possibly control. Huhu, it\u2019s great that Daisy called me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it impossible with Daisy\u2019s power?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, child. It\u2019s just that there isn\u2019t enough time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the same thing. Hecate, hurry up. Then, we can go play somewhere! It\u2019s been such a long time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, you want to enjoy women since you can\u2019t get a guy? Behave yourself. Return your body to its owner and go back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duca smacked her lips and gave up on tempting Hecate. I felt like I had caught a glimpse of the depth of the gods\u2019 world, but I tried to ignore it and watched Hecate turn the Lava King into an undead.</p><br/><p>\u201cUung, this guy is really overwhelming. With him out, none of the other undeads can be used.\u201d</p><br/><p>A brilliant light shone from Hecate\u2019s hands. Once all undead monsters went back into her inventory, she started the process of turning the Lava King into an undead.</p><br/><p>All of her mana was sucked into the Lava King and lifted the Lava King\u2019s body sleeping in the volcanic crater. His body slowly became blackish red, a sign that it was evolving into an undead.</p><br/><p>In case something happened, I prepared myself to call Peruta. However, once I became confident that she would finish her work without any mishap, I looked at the other target that was itching for attention. It was, of course, the reward list.</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya finished him off, but I\u2019m the 1st, huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout you, we couldn\u2019t have won.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have won if any one of us was missing. especially you, Hwaya\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, but you were the won who damaged it the most and drove it to the verge of death. All I did was finish him off. Now, hurry up and choose your reward.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhew.\u201d</p><br/><p>In truth, there was only one thing for me to choose. The Lava King\u2019s Egg! As I wanted to give it to Yua, I was a bit worried that it would become tied to me, but thankfully, that wasn\u2019t the case. After putting the egg into my inventory, I made a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith this, my original goal is completed too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you tame it yourself? I know you care about Yua, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After seeing that I had chosen an egg, Hwaya raised an understandable question. I shook my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tame a fourth monster yet. If I put skill points into it, I might regret it later. More importantly, I don\u2019t have any Taming-related skills, so rather than raising a monster from an egg, it\u2019s more appropriate for me to tame an already strong adult monster. On the other hand, Yua\u2019s main class is Tamer, so she can tame many more monsters and have skills that help her tamed monsters get stronger. If Yua raises a powerful monster from its infancy, it\u2019ll grow by leaps and bounds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you say\u2026 Oh, this must be an orb!\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, Hwaya was the second to choose a reward. What she choice was the Lava King\u2019s Eyes, which even I was tempted to get. She leaped in joy, saying that she had found something to replace the orb she had lost. In the next instant, she screamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya! Are you okay!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya suddenly knelt and covered her face. I hurriedly squatted down and asked to be sure.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas it not an orb, but Evil Eyes!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuk, yeah\u2026 My eyes\u2026 What if it looks like a reptile\u2019s now!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRaise your head. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s going to look weird. What should I do\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you take responsibility?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, hurry up! If it\u2019s now, we might be able to turn in back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou promised.\u201d</p><br/><p>I took Hwaya\u2019s hands off her face and her face was revealed. Her eyes were shining in a deeper red than before. Almost like the Evil Eyes I possessed, countless particles of light were gathering in her eyes and forming a strange symbol.</p><br/><p>Beautiful enchanting pupils. They were like Loretta\u2019s with only a different color.</p><br/><p>While I blanked out, Hwaya quickly stole my lips again and spoke with a grin.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo takesies-backsies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 I\u2019m taking it back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, I made it easy for you too. Still, you can\u2019t take it back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou knew it, didn\u2019t you!? That nothing would happen!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 Your Evil Eyes came from the Basilisk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018You fool! The Basilisk is a reptile too!\u2019 I shook my head, realizing my own stupidity.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe both have Evil Eyes now. Isn\u2019t it fateful? Not that I believe in fate or anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like that word either\u2026 but anyways, congratulations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, in that case, Child belongs to my Daisy. She already had Evil Eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hecate walked towards us. Behind her, the reborn Lava King was flying slowly. Although he didn\u2019t give off as much pressure as when he was alive, the pressure was still massive. Without Overlord, I wasn\u2019t confident in beating it one on one.</p><br/><p>\u201cCall it Laki.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You didn\u2019t just shorten Lava King, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaisy\u2019s naming sense\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hecate dodged my gaze. I gave up on interrogating her further and looked at Laki who was flapping her wings in the air. His awe-inspiring majesty reminded me of the time we fought.</p><br/><p>Perhaps because I nearly died several times, the whole fight felt like something that happened years ago. Although not even 10 minutes had passed, I was now looking eye to eye with Laki, who had become our ally.</p><br/><p>I grinned and looked away.</p><br/><p>The clear full moon poured a chilling blue light over us. With all the burns we were suffering, it couldn\u2019t feel more satisfying. Feeling like the moon was blessing us, I spread my arms out. It\u2019s so refreshing\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, Dear, do you know your armor\u2019s full of holes? Are you seducing me? I\u2019ll fall for it gladly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, shit\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>So that\u2019s why it felt chilly!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

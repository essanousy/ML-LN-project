With Your Own Power (2)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>\u201cKang Shin, how is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>I answered half-heartedly and pointed below us where the magic circle had disappeared completely. Realizing that the raging demonic energy had calmed down, the surviving demons began to cast magic even whilst they were confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor now, Greenland, done.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laki slowly descended. Feeling a surging flame energy around Laki\u2019s mouth, Luna made cute noises and flapped her wings to strengthen it. Yua quickly ordered the mantises to fall back. Surprisingly, they were still fighting the demons.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlmost no signs of life left, on the ground\u2026 Finish it in one blow, Laki.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Guooooooo!]</p><br/><p>Laki roared with the intention of frying every demon left on the ground. At the same time, his mouth opened widely.</p><br/><p>Immediately, intense flames that could scorch even death poured down. Demons frantically threw magic at the flames, but there was nothing they could do against a king\u2019s flames.</p><br/><p>One hour later, we happily hopped down on the still heated ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, there\u2019s nothing left alive on the ground.\u201d</p><br/><p>I spoke as I looked around and made a bitter smile. Daisy then rebutted me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave to be, thorough. Demons, possess world\u2019s power. Left alone, they\u2019ll reproduce.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, they aren\u2019t in Greenland.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Is Greenland, small?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s 21 times bigger than Korea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how, did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy asked, but I was surprised in my own way.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, how did I know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t, ask me that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun then hopped in. \u201cMaybe Shin\u2019s ability suddenly increased?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m still growing, but my detection range was only the size of Korea before. There\u2019s no way it suddenly multiplied over 20 times.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s already amazing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, the only thing that was different was the armor I was wearing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, so this armor can multiply my detection range?\u201d</p><br/><p>In any case, I was able to confirm that no demons were left in Greenland. If there was one and I couldn\u2019t detect him, that demon had to be the Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>Daisy then tilted her head and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt gave up, defense?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not! I think\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I shouted in denial. No matter how amazing this armor boosted my detection range, it would be useless as an armor if it lost its defensive power. Ye-Eun then held up her dagger and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, should we test it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Should we?\u201d</p><br/><p>Though I was a bit worried, it was true that I needed to test its defensive capability. I held my arm out with a bit of nervousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. Eit! Kyak!\u201d</p><br/><p>After striking down with full strength, Ye-Eun suddenly screamed as she was shot back. Flustered, I shot forward and grabbed her before she landed.</p><br/><p>However, the force she was under was stronger than I thought. Simply put, even I would be thrown back with her if I wasn\u2019t careful.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI got flung back when I tried to attack. Hiing, that hurt!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Could it be\u2026? I looked down at my arm where Ye-Eun tried to hit. As expected, there wasn\u2019t a crack, much less a scratch. I also didn\u2019t feel anything touch me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like it can reflect attacks too\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, the important part was how much this armor could reflect. At times like this, there was only one person I could rely on! The image of a draconian giving a thumbs up appeared in my head.</p><br/><p>No, now that I thought about it, it wasn\u2019t a thumbs up, it was a middle finger!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat armor, how do you take it, off?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that you mention it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I was completely covered by the armor. There weren\u2019t any holes in the joints either. Though that might sound like perfection in terms of defense, it meant hell when trying to take it off. Of course, considering how comfortable it was, there was no problem wearing it constantly, but that would be too embarrassing!</p><br/><p>At that moment, as though it detected my mana entering a non-combat state, the armor let out a bright light. Starting from the boots, the armor turned into a sticky substance similar to tar and began to crawl up my body.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, Shin, it\u2019s like a slime!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that!\u201d</p><br/><p>My horn then let out a faint light. The tar climbing up my body reacted to the light and was sucked into the horn. Soon, the armor covering my body disappeared completely, and I could feel that it was inside my horn.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, I think I know now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKnow how creepy, the armor is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rather than an armor, it was more like a lump of energy with self-intellect that protected its owner. Being an armor was the most efficient way to do its job. It made sense why Sherafina couldn\u2019t see through it.</p><br/><p>The composition of this armor consisted of the demon\u2019s power which nullified the dungeon\u2019s power, and an immeasurable amount of mana and demonic energy. It even had the original power of Pure Black Desire, and the world\u2019s power Eleine used to possess. In a way, this object was on a completely different dimension than the dungeon.</p><br/><p>Pure Black Desire was an item Lin made using the materials I brought. As Lin desired to escape from the dungeon\u2019s influence, it wasn\u2019t strange that the result of Pure Black Desire\u2019s evolution was this.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t possible to check the information of this object. As Sherafina couldn\u2019t read it, it couldn\u2019t be put into stats or skills.</p><br/><p>Since the stat boost Pure Black Desire gave was gone, under the dungeon\u2019s system, it could be said that I suffered a severe loss. However, I didn\u2019t think so.</p><br/><p>Especially now when the dungeon\u2019s position was unclear, becoming isolated from the dungeon\u2019s influence was a good thing. Even without stat boosts, I knew the terrifying amount of mana it carried, and I knew it was using it to protect me.</p><br/><p>Even if a monster ignoring the dungeon\u2019s power appeared, there would be nothing it could do to lessen this armor\u2019s power. This in itself made me satisfied. Of course, how the armor looked was a different matter!</p><br/><p>With that, we completed our Greenland subjugation. I was used to fighting a king, a duke or whatnot whenever I went to clean up an area, but this time, we were almost all killed.</p><br/><p>Because of the eerie words the duke said, it suddenly dawned on me that I would be meeting the Demon Lord soon. I had to finish what I could in the dungeon as quickly as possible. A strong hunch urged me on.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, this is the result of the evolution?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking at it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin scanned the armor covering my body and said with a smirk.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould I call you Kamen Rider?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpare me.\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t see Leon, who I expected to be with him. Noticing me looking around, Lin mentioned.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeon went to climb the dungeon. Every time he learns something, I\u2019m sending him to the dungeon so he can experience it with his body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 How is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin spoke briefly. He seemed to have thought it wasn\u2019t a good explanation as he added a bit after.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s better than I expected. His character is fantastic too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut of course, he\u2019s lacking compared to you. Still, he\u2019s satisfactory. If you weren\u2019t around, he might have been okay as the Hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cComing from Lin, he must be so good that you want to give him kisses and hugs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Are you doubting my honest evaluation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, isn\u2019t Lin a tsun\u2026 No, nevermind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin glared at me for a moment and snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, come over here. I\u2019ll look at it closely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks. There\u2019s also something I want to request specifically. Can you see if it still has its skills?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSkills? You didn\u2019t extract it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSkills are part of an armor\u2019s power. I didn\u2019t extract it in case it would affect its evolution.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you aren\u2019t so stupid after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>I put my arm out, and Lin lightly struck it with a hammer. Immediately, he gasped and almost let go of his hammer. His strike had been reflected back.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything on purpose!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>After bickering for a bit, Lin began to re-examine my armor. His unique crimson aura seemed to caress my armor. After some time later, Lin let out a faint groan and took his aura back completely.</p><br/><p>\u201cA monster among monsters. That magical tool\u2026 I don\u2019t know whether it was created to be like that, or if it somehow transformed because of the world\u2019s power Eleine put in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you find anything out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. First, all the skills flew out the window.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGod damn!\u201d</p><br/><p>I should have extracted Sacrifice at least! Desire Thorn, which amplified the power of charge type attacks and stole the enemy\u2019s health, and Devourer, which stole the enemy\u2019s health when my HP fell below 10%, were also amazing. But compared to Sacrifice which doubled my attack power, they were lacking. Of course, because my recent battles wouldn\u2019t have ended pretty if I used Sacrifice, it didn\u2019t see much use, but it was still regrettable.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s a new skill I could decipher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should say that first!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRather than a skill, it\u2019s an authority. Extort.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Extort?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe attack reflecting power of this armor is a passive effect of Extort. Its stealing the enemy\u2019s attack to attack them back. It looks like the skills that were in Pure Black Desire had some effect on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExtort\u2026 Now that I think about it, both Devourer and Desire Thorn stole health from the enemy. So they combined and evolved to become this ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>I closed and opened my left hand. Thinking back, I already experienced a portion of Extort\u2019s power when the armor was created. Not only did it devour the remains of the demons, it even extorted the magic circle and made it its own power.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, it even nullified the final suicide explosion the duke tried to do. Extort. It was indeed an ability befitting an armor made by collection of demonic essence.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat thing is connected to you. It\u2019s not an equipment that protects you externally, but something that\u2019s become a part of you. Understand? It may look like an armor now, but it\u2019s absolutely not an armor. Calling that an armor would be an insult to all the armors I\u2019ve made so far.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so too. This isn\u2019t an armor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s also why I called it an authority. Extort can\u2019t be used against something or someone stronger than you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I didn\u2019t think it could reflect the Demon Lord\u2019s final attack or anything either.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin shoved his face towards me. His handsome face was twisted in a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s more dangerous. As you get stronger, Extort will also get stronger. Do you understand why I called it Extort? It\u2019s because I can\u2019t express it in a more detailed way. As long as you have the ability, this authority of yours can steal anything using any method. \u2026 It\u2019s in the realm of a god.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you move your face back first?\u201d</p><br/><p>I grabbed his shoulders and pushed him away.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis armor has the power of a god? Like a true name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the armor. It\u2019s you, Kang Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you before. That\u2019s not an armor, but a part of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin spoke with a grin.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou became a god.\u201d</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:That\u2019s an exaggerated conclusion, he\u2019s not actually a god!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Avarice Devours Everything (6)</p><br/><p>Earlier, he only had one horn. But now, there were two long, thick horns protruding out from his forehead. I didn\u2019t know whether the number of horns was important, but the aura he was emanating was twice as powerful as before. In addition, his skin was now deep red, like an explosive volcano, when he had had dark blue skin before. His veins bulged out on his skin, adding to his already creepy appearance.</p><br/><p>He grew to over 2 meters tall and his body looked like the Hulk\u2019s. With his two bat-like wings and thick scaled tail protruding from his butt, he truly looked like a devil that appeared in myths. Surprisingly, even though he had changed so much, he had not regenerated his arm.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know if that was the reason, but the club he was holding looked stronger and more repugnant. It was red, black, long, thick, and its tip was split into two parts, which swam through the air like water snakes. Patting his wyvern, the middle aged mercenary made a short comment.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s big.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Huu\u2026 You should be honored to see this appearance. It\u2019s my true body that\u2019s rarely shown even in the Demon Realm!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think just one of us can do it. Alright, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFocus on defense. Besides me, no one here can catch up to his speed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Peruta replied to one of the mercenaries words. As if to prove that Peruta was right, Shatuno instantly disappeared from the place he was in and appeared behind a mercenary, swinging his whip down. The mercenary, who possessed a defensive equipment, threw the ring that broke from blocking Shatuno\u2019s attack and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least 300 dexterity! If you\u2019re not confident in dodging his attacks, run!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, he\u2019s not even the Demon Lord. How is an Army Commander so strong\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa, at least he\u2019s the only one left! The reward for this mission will be no joke!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the summoner mercenary\u2019s shout, the mercenaries that were about to open the dungeon gate flinched. If the request\u2019s difficulty was high, the dungeon would naturally give better rewards. No matter how much the Dimensional Mercenaries prioritized their safety, if they weren\u2019t willing to take risk, they wouldn\u2019t have become Dimensional Mercenaries in the first place. They were here because they were willing to throw themselves in danger and take challenges.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the mercenary\u2019s timely shout, other mercenaries that could block Shatuno\u2019s attacks got their fighting spirit back. Then, Peruta took a step forward and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but he\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Are you saying that you want to fight him alone, newbie?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Wait, Hero. I\u2019ll deal with you after I take care of everyone else.]</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I\u2019d wait, Demon Soldier. You become stronger the more you absorb, so I need to deal with you before that happens.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Peruta words, all the mercenaries\u2019 complexions became pale. Everyone, including me, realized. He hadn\u2019t changed from being angered. He had changed from absorbing the energies of the demons that accompanied him! But how did Peruta know?</p><br/><p>The summoner mercenary then said with a curious expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, newbie. Doesn\u2019t that mean you gathered up the demons so he could get stronger?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not. It\u2019s the opposite. I made him weaker.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Despite the contradiction in his words, Peruta had a commanding attitude. Shatuno, who was listening to him, also looked at him with interest.</p><br/><p>[Quite funny, Hero! Me? Weaker? See with your own body how weaker I got!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shatuno\u2019s body once again disappeared from the sky. He appeared in front of me in an instant, and at the same time that his two-part whip flew toward me, his sharp tail drew a diagonal line from below. Damn, I could barely see it! How could he get so fast!?</p><br/><p>However, Peruta was able to see his movements. In truth, if Peruta wasn\u2019t controlling my body, I would not have been able to see his attack at all. He lightly swung the Gluttony Spear, pushing the whip aside and blocking the tail coming from below. Then, with a smile, he kicked the tail with his left foot enveloped in a whirlwind.</p><br/><p>His tail exploded.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaak!]</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon, I\u2019m already aware of all your patterns. Just from your appearance, I can see through your class, choice of weapon, method of attack, potential, and personality!\u201d</p><br/><p>Peruta\u2019s attack did not stop. His spear, feet, or empty hand! With each of his attacks, Shatuno\u2019s body exploded strangely. It even felt like Shatuno\u2019s fake body was stronger!</p><br/><p>Peruta\u2019s blue whirlwind was enveloping my entire body. I realized. Peruta hadn\u2019t used his full power when he fought Shatuno before. The reason he used my skills to take him on was to save his own ability to fight Shatuno\u2019s real body.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnending whirlpool. The ancients called me War God and Heavenly Calamity, because the whirlpool connecting the earth and the heaven was strong enough to destroy the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Every time whirlpools erupted from parts of his body, Shatuno had to grit his teeth and fall back. Eventually, with a scream, he cut off his own tail, which had been half torn to shreds by Peruta\u2019s attacks. The tail was then absorbed into his whip, making the whip transform into a club.</p><br/><p>[What did you do to me!? You think you can kill me, the demon\u2019s Army Commander, Shatuno Gluttony!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cHa.\u201d</p><br/><p>Peruta snorted. He held the Gluttony Spear in one hand and aimed it at Shatuno\u2019s neck, ignoring his club.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome here, Demon Soldier.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>He appeared. Damn, even though I was confident in my senses, I couldn\u2019t completely grasp his movements. I could only see that he had appeared to my left and swung his club. I couldn\u2019t read the exact timing or the trajectory.</p><br/><p>However, Peruta easily dodged his attack and sent a blue whirlwind forward, destroying his body. When I saw Shatuno\u2019s exploding flesh, I finally understood.</p><br/><p>[Dear god\u2026 When you used Gale Track, you already\u2026!]</p><br/><p>[As expected of my disciple. 99 points. I took a point off since you didn\u2019t realize it at the time that I used the skill.]</p><br/><p>Peruta retorted in a voice only I could hear, and leisurely continued to destroy Shatuno\u2019s body. He took a step back and stomped the ground strongly. His simple movements had a massive impact.</p><br/><p>In a 10 meter radius around him, the earth transformed into lava and shot up. To the mercenaries watching Peruta and Shatuno\u2019s battle, it was like a bolt of lightning from the clear sky, and they scrambled to dodge the lava. However, Shatuno was no longer concerned with anyone else. He was solely focused on Peruta.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll show you\u2026 the power of the Demon Army Commander!]</p><br/><p>The lava took the form of a giant serpent. Shatuno lightly waved his hand, and the serpent dropped lava in its surrounding as it charged toward us. Plus, it wasn\u2019t any slower than Shatuno himself.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Shatuno stomped the ground again, and the ground that Peruta was standing on collapsed. I realized that Shatuno had been hiding his ability to transform earth.</p><br/><p>However, I had full confidence in Peruta\u2019s victory. Peruta was right. He had weakened Shatuno. During his initial fight, he had realized Shatuno\u2019s special power. The moment he used Gale Track, Shatuno had no chance of victory.</p><br/><p>[Kuhak!]</p><br/><p>As expected, after jumping back to avoid the ground that had become lava, Peruta lightly sent a Tempest forward, blowing Shatuno\u2019s remaining arm away. Shatuno\u2019s weapon fell on the ground, turning the ground it touched into lava. Of course, the lava serpent that had been flying in the sky lost its power and fell, turning the ground more into a mess. When others saw the battlefield later, they would really wonder what the hell happened.</p><br/><p>Shatuno seemed to have noticed something was wrong with his body too, as he glared at us with trembling eyes.</p><br/><p>[Y-You\u2026 What did you do to my body!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I hit the demons up with Gale Track, I did a little trick.\u201d</p><br/><p>Peruta answered with a grin. Right. When Shatuno used his strange melting power, Peruta realized he could use that power to absorb others. I didn\u2019t know until he told me, but Peruta had ample experience in fighting against demons and was able to recognize his special power with just that.</p><br/><p>As such, after learning about Gale Track from me, he immediately went into action. He used his mana to put some sort of device into the demons before sending them flying. He then forced Shatuno into a situation where he had to absorb them. This was the result. Shatuno devoured his subordinates on his own accord, becoming Peruta\u2019s toy.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou might be sensitive to any changes to your body, but you probably didn\u2019t expect that bombs would have been planted in your food. Can you feel it now?\u201d</p><br/><p>[You think such a crude game can kill me!?]</p><br/><p>Shatuno shouted in rage and did something completely unexpected. He began to detonate the mana bombs planted in the demons he absorbed! Explosions erupted from his body.</p><br/><p>[I am the Demon Army\u2019s Commander Shatuno Gluttony! I can regenerate as long as I have more to eat! I am invincible! Under His Highness, the Demon Lord, I rule above all!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThe moment you\u2019re under someone, you can\u2019t call yourself a ruler, Demon Soldier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Peruta responded coldly. Then, he thrust his spear. Shatuno\u2019s wing, which was trying to avoid Peruta and attack other mercenaries, was torn to shreds.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as there\u2019s even a single being above you, you are only an underling.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shatuno didn\u2019t stop. He believed he could turn the tide of battle as long as he devoured someone. Disregarding Peruta\u2019s words, he continued. When Peruta\u2019s spear was pointed the other way, one of Shatuno\u2019s horns was torn off, falling on the ground. Shatuno screamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cFoolish. You cannot aim for the position of God that way. A true ruler has none above him and walks a path that no one can block.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t underestimate\u2026 the power of an Army Commander!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you can stand on this land alone and hold up the heavens! That\u2019s when you can call yourself a ruler!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shatuno had somehow turned himself even redder and bigger, but the moment Peruta thrust out his spear, his body blew up without much resistance. Shatuno coughed out deep blue blood and collapsed. It happened quickly and overwhelmingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Peruta twisted the corner of his mouth and threw the Gluttony Spear. The spear struck Shatuno\u2019s forehead, splitting his head in half and penetrating the ground. Even if he was the Army\u2019s Commander, he could not survive with his heart in pieces and brain cut in half. Without even letting out death throes, Shatuno died.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is the path I once walked, and the path my disciple will walk. Remember it.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t think he can hear you anymore.]</p><br/><p>[Haha, you\u2019re right.]</p><br/><p>Peruta waved his hand lightly, and the Gluttony Spear flew back to his hand. Shatuno\u2019s corpse also flew toward him slowly. His arm, weapon, severed wing, and horn. Peruta was collecting them carefully. Watching the scene, the other mercenaries swallowed their saliva.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, newbie. Are you going to eat that by yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are portions for you guys too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The severed wing that was flying toward Peruta changed its direction and landed in front of the mercenaries. Looking at the mercenaries\u2019 blank expressions, Peruta spoke with a wink.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe rest is for my disciple. Young kids have to eat a lot to grow. Since you guys are the seniors, you should yield.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDisciple, you say. Did you call your master, newbie\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk. Since I can complete the mission thanks to you, I\u2019ll listen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, without him, we would\u2019ve either died or failed the request\u2026 Alright, gather up. Let\u2019s split this thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>While the mercenaries were dividing the wing equally, Peruta learned how to operate the inventory from me and stored Shatuno\u2019s corpse in it. Then, it was the turn to store its arm, tail, and weapon, which probably ate many of his subordinates. Mm, would this count as an actual weapon? Since he used it as a one, it should, right?</p><br/><p>[Peruta, can you touch that weapon with my spear?]</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? Like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Peruta was a bit surprised at my sudden request, he immediately did so. Then, the Gluttony Spear radiated a brilliant red light and absorbed the club.</p><br/><p>[Crimson Gluttony Spear absorbed \u2018Symbol of Gluttony (Epic)\u2019. Growth: 54%]</p><br/><p>[Oooh, so this weapon can grow by absorbing other weapons! There are still blacksmiths left that can craft such weapons?]</p><br/><p>[Kuk, only 7% from eating an Epic-grade weapon\u2026 What kind of a weapon is this thing trying to become?]</p><br/><p>[Haha, it probably won\u2019t meet your expectations. Growth type weapons have rather poor efficiency. But when it reaches its peak one day, it will become a divine artifact that most God-grade can\u2019t even compare. I don\u2019t know who made it, but this person must be your close friend. Treat him well.]</p><br/><p>At Peruta words, the image of Lin appeared in my mind. Although handsome, he was frowning and smoking a cigarette. He was also cursing at the fact that I already became a Dimensional Mercenary. No, that\u2019s\u2026</p><br/><p>[Peruta, it seems all the danger is gone now.]</p><br/><p>[Right. Besides the bountiful miasma in an area a day-long away from here, there\u2019s no danger.]</p><br/><p>With Peruta\u2019s words, I felt assured. While I was at it, I asked him.</p><br/><p>[Peruta, can you find out if there\u2019s a spy among them?]</p><br/><p>[Hahaha, I\u2019m not omnipotent. But since you have to worry about a spy, this must be quite a difficult mission.]</p><br/><p>[To tell you the truth, we have to go into that area with bountiful miasma and rescue someone.]</p><br/><p>[Hm? You want to save someone from that pit? Hoh\u2026 be careful.]</p><br/><p>[Yes.]</p><br/><p>[With your temperament, I probably don\u2019t need to worry much\u2026 but still, be careful. Don\u2019t believe anyone.]</p><br/><p>[Haha, so that\u2019s the conclusion.]</p><br/><p>After giving me tips on Peruta Circuit, Peruta left. I quickly drank a potion worth 50,000 gold that restored both mana and health.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, newbie. Is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s not here now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026 Good. I was slightly scared. Damn, where did you find a skill like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that idiot\u2019s at it again. Why are you digging at other\u2019s business secrets? Are you a newbie?\u201d</p><br/><p>The summoner mercenary smacked the man asking for my Deific Manifestation skill. As he was the strongest mercenary out of the 8 that remained, the man didn\u2019t say anything after being hit. With a smirk, I called the only person I could trust, Ludia. Then, I sighed and fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>When I got back up, thinking I sat on something, it was the headless corpse of Syrmia Bamirtuno.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, right\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She undoubtedly could have run away during battle. However, she seemed to have really liked Ludia, as she continued to fight the Army Commander until the end. Although I couldn\u2019t encourage her love, it was true that Ludia could survive thanks to her. Out of respect for her, I decided to put her corpse together.</p><br/><p>As for the other mercenaries, they were gathering up the dead mercenaries, knights and magicians and burning them. They seemed to be taking their equipped items, but since the mission was more important than the people that were already dead, I didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Then, after 5 minutes of searching, I found her head. Putting it together with her body, I called Peika.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, leave the equipment and burn her body.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Okay!]</p><br/><p>Sorry, Bamirtuno-ssi, but I\u2019m an explorer too\u2026 After Peika cleanly burned Bamirtuno\u2019s body with her elemental power, her equipment shone. Oh, the hoverboard was there too, but\u2026</p><br/><p>The hoverboard began to greedily devour Bamirtuno\u2019s equipment.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, am I seeing things?\u201d</p><br/><p>[No, that child must have been hungry because she was just born.]</p><br/><p>Child? Born? While Peika was answering nonchalantly, the hoverboard continued to devour Bamirtuno\u2019s weapon. I mean, if it was eating something, shouldn\u2019t it be getting bigger? Why is it getting smaller instead? Its silvery grey color became darker. After devouring all the equipment Bamirtuno left behind, it became a black, metallic elliptical ball.</p><br/><p>Just in case, I took out an arrow from my inventory and tried poking it, but it did not budge in the slightest. Instead, I felt a strange sensation. It was incredibly familiar, and touched the deepest part of my soul. This\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this an elemental!? Plus, this feeling\u2026 It feels like it\u2019s connected to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yep. I think this child was influenced and created by my elemental power. In the process, master obviously got connected\u2026 but because it\u2019s still a child and it became full, it felt into deep slumber. Master should sing a lullaby.]</p><br/><p>Peika, if I sing a lullaby, it will only fall deeper into sleep. To wake it, we\u2019ll at least need a bugle horn\u2026</p><br/><p>[No! It was just born, so it needs time to grow! Master has to sing a lullaby, so it can sleep well!]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, so that\u2019s what you meant?\u201d</p><br/><p>For the next few minutes, I hugged the metallic egg and sang a lullaby, making Ludia who came back stare at me with strange eyes. I didn\u2019t know how to feel as a few of the mercenaries listening to me also fell asleep. I didn\u2019t sing so you guys could sleep!</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>I\u2019m crazy, really.

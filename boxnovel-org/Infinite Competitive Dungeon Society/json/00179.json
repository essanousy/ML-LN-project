The Power of the Hero (3)</p><br/><p>The moment I heard the message, I froze and found it hard to breathe. I couldn\u2019t believe my ears. What? Retrieve his ability? How was that possible? Why was this the first time I was hearing it? Or, did I need to meet certain conditions to make it happen?</p><br/><p>However, my questions weren\u2019t important. What was important was that I could take away Luca Bruno\u2019s ability. It didn\u2019t even take me a second to come to a decision. I nodded my head. Immediately, mana began to leave Luca Bruno\u2019s body. He let out a painful scream.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Did the pain come later?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026 That person, he\u2019s getting paler!\u201d</p><br/><p>The mana that left Luca Bruno was absorbed by the white ball of light, which then flew into my hand. I stared at it as if I was enchanted. Another message then rang out.</p><br/><p>[A suitable candidate for the ability is nearby. Would you like to bestow the ability?]</p><br/><p>Without having to ask, I already knew who the candidate was. It was almost\u2026 instinctual. I stared at the ball of light, then faced Yua who was looking at me intently. She called me, as if she knew what I was about to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYua, do you still want to\u2026 become a dungeon explorer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yua immediately shouted aloud.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to help Oppa by Oppa\u2019s side! I don\u2019t to sit back and wait anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult, think about it, Yua. I want to protect your peaceful daily life. To be honest, I don\u2019t want to ask you this, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, please\u2026 I want to be by Oppa\u2019s side. Please!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Yua\u2019s fervent eyes, I finished what I was saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 It wouldn\u2019t be bad for you to have the strength to protect yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa!\u201d</p><br/><p>She jumped into my embrace. I had to try hard to make sure she wasn\u2019t hurt by my armor, and I managed to succeed. Walker made a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too soft on your sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWrong, idiot. That\u2019s not it. She\u2019s my everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>I lifted the ball of light into the air. Then, I warned Yua for the last time.</p><br/><p>\u201cKnow this, Yua. It\u2019s going to be a lot harder than you thought. Once you get this ability, there\u2019s no turning back. You\u2019ll be standing in place of another ability user, fighting terrifying monsters and climbing the dungeon. Your life will be at risk and you might receive grave injuries. Will you still do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Oppa is already doing it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c.. Yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I want to do it too. I\u2019m tired of waiting for Oppa to come back, while I just sit and study.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say it just in case, but you brother and sister aren\u2019t normal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut it, Walker.\u201d</p><br/><p>I pursed my lips and rebuked Walker. Then, I let the ball of light in my hand touch Yua\u2019s forehead. The ball of light smoothly went inside her, as if it belonged to her.</p><br/><p>The boundless mana Luca Bruno had changed its property and began to completely transform Yua\u2019s body. It seemed Yua couldn\u2019t bear the shock as she fainted. I held her in my arms carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to take Yua back home before I leave for Britain\u2026 Walker, do you want to come with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker looked at me with a slightly surprised expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin\u2026 You\u2019re changing, bit by bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing. I will. I want to see Brightman\u2019s end with my own eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I retrieved the abilities of the other members of Heroes of Shadow (HoS). After doing it once, I got the knack for it, so it was easy to take them away. It seemed the condition was how much they opposed me, the Hero, and how faithful they were to the original mission of ability user's, monster extermination. As they easily crossed the former standard, it was extremely easy to retrieve their abilities.</p><br/><p>It was annoying to keep the small abilities, so I waved my hand and the balls of light flew away. They were most likely going back to Ciara.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t absorb them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne ability for one person. Didn\u2019t you learn when you were young, Walker? One pudding for one person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think abilities are like puddings\u2026? Plus, Brightman always took my puddings, that son of a bitch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><br/><p>I laughed and remarked.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go get your pudding back.\u201d</p><br/><p>I left Yua in the house to sleep, and talked to the Revival members about making Yua become an explorer. They were shocked to hear that I could take away abilities from ability users, but no one disagreed with me wanting to make Yua into an explorer. The biggest reason was that I already gave her an ability. She had a powerful ability and was undoubtedly on our side. There was no reason not to let her become an explorer.</p><br/><p>Kuhum, I promised to talk to them about letting people become dungeon explorers, but we never said anything about giving abilities! Of course, since it was an impulsive action, I couldn\u2019t say anything even if they were mad.</p><br/><p>I left Father to guard Yua and Mother.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen Yua wakes up, make her into a First Dungeon explorer, Father.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I got it. I agreed to it, but\u2026 was it what Yua wanted?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Um\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 If that\u2019s what Yua wanted, it\u2019s fine. I was worried about her being too attached to you, so I wanted to prevent her from being an explorer or an ability user\u2026 But if it\u2019s to the extent that she obtained an ability and wanted to become an explorer, it seems I won\u2019t be able to see her boyfriend for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Father. Even if she can\u2019t date anyone, I\u2019ll live with her for the rest of my life!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScrew off, Son.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother patted the sleeping Yua and looked at me with a grumpy expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, anything for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, to be honest\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not suitable with any ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother sulked and hit me, but it didn\u2019t hurt at all. I laughed and did my best to protect her hands as she hit me.</p><br/><p>I thanked Father again and left the house. First, I went back to the dungeon and joined Daisy. Then, I called Lotte.</p><br/><p>\u201cLotte, come.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Understood, Hero.]</p><br/><p>Lotte was in the resort area training, but considering she immediately responded to my call, it seemed she had finished her training. When I met up with her, I finally understood what she meant by training.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Hero. This is the result of my training. No one will be able to stop me now. I can be with Hero no matter where Hero goes.\u201d</p><br/><p>In front of Walker, Daisy, and me was not a wyvern, but a young lady. She had long black hair, large black eyes, and a tanned brown skin.</p><br/><p>Her eyes had a sense of wildness than reason, while her fingernails were dyed black and curled outward. Lotte was in a human form. Not to mention, her explosive breasts and plentiful butt exuded a feminine charm.</p><br/><p>I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you naked!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it not obvious? I never wore anything in front of Hero. It would be rude of me to hide myself in front of the person I served. Is Hero doubting my royalty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, so wear some clothes! No, go back to your wyvern form! Sorry, but we\u2019re not going into any dungeons today. We have to fly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I have to make other people ride on me again\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lotte frowned and asked in a low tone. She had a charming husky voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019ll make up for it later. If it\u2019s something within my power, anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, I\u2019ll remember it, Hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lotte closed her eyes. By the time she opened her eyes back up, she had gone back to her wyvern form. I jumped on her back with the others, then called Plene.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Plene.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can go too? Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re going to need your power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhehe, I\u2019ll do my best!\u201d</p><br/><p>Plene jumped on me excitedly. Lotte flapped her wings as if it displeased her, while Walker\u2019s expression stiffened. It seemed he was slightly afraid of Lotte. On the other hand, Daisy was stroking Lotte\u2019s back slowly. Then, she murmured.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill he\u2026 If she dies, I want corpse. I\u2019ll bring her back as cool child.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t kill her! She won\u2019t die either!\u201d</p><br/><p>I initially planned on going to Britain, but after Walker told me Brightman was currently in America, I changed my destination.</p><br/><p>After realizing what happened, HoS seemed to have influenced other countries to talk as if I was a criminal, but it wasn\u2019t that effective. There was already a precedent of Guardian trying to groundlessly condemn Revival and we had turned it around beautifully.</p><br/><p>Although they were using mass media all over the world to scheme against us, they were either ignored or criticized. I felt like I knew why.</p><br/><p>\u201cCiara.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust be quiet and accept her help this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. She knows I can\u2019t refuse either. I won\u2019t say she owes me a debt, but she\u2019s mistaken if she thinks I\u2019ll forgive her with this.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hero, there are five fighter jets coming this way.]</p><br/><p>\u201cShoot it down. I don\u2019t care if the pilots die.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Understood.]</p><br/><p>Lotte\u2019s black flames covered the air. To provoke Dark Wing, the Queen of the Sky, one had to at least be on the same level as the Flame Drake. Seeing the fighter jets crashing down helplessly, Daisy tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cFascinating monster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose aren\u2019t monsters. They\u2019re fighter jets, a vehicle made by human technology to fly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWeapon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, something like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShape. Hard to put mana into. With weapon like that, mana won\u2019t advance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, my world originally didn\u2019t have many ability users.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lotte accelerated. In less than 30 minutes, we arrived at Boston, where Brightman\u2019s company headquarters was located. I couldn\u2019t help but ask Walker.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is a British company\u2019s headquarters in America?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s just how it is. It\u2019s easier to do business across the world here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrightman\u2019s in there, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious? There\u2019s a landing zone on the roof and a helicopter waiting 24/7. It\u2019s a new model that can travel back to Britain in just 2 hours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s staying in America for his business\u2026? I\u2019m surprised he can even leave Britain now that Hwaya isn\u2019t there anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it was initially, but Britain seems to think that it is now \u2018safe.\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>Not that it was my business, but they sure sent their minds away to a vacation on Andromeda Galaxy!</p><br/><p>Lotte flapped her wings and came to a stop. Now that we were right in front of it, I could see just how big the building was. I was too lazy to even count how many floors it had. It was the tallest and largest building in the area. Beyond the windows, I could see people in the middle of work staring at us with widened eyes. I smiled at them and waved by hand. Then, I asked Plene.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you make everyone in that building leave? Also, make them and others in the area stay away from the building.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy! Lalala~!\u201d</p><br/><p>Plene\u2019s mana amplified her voice. The effect was immediate. People working mindlessly suddenly stopped as if they were possessed and began to leave. It was happening in every floor of the building.</p><br/><p>At the same time, a man on the highest floor stood up abruptly after seeing us. Silver hair pushed back using pomade and the appearance of someone in his 20\u2019s. It was none other than Brightman. I met his eyes and smirked. Walker, on the other hand, was distracted by something else.</p><br/><p>\u201cOooh, a mass exodus.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I looked down along with him, I saw a countless number of people leaving the building through the door. With the unexpected number of businessmen leaving the company, the murmur of the city people even reached us in the air. However, regardless of what the people were talking about, the employee's\u2019 mass exodus continued. Brightman, who realized what was going on slightly late, shouted at us. I can\u2019t hear you, you son of a bitch.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlmost everyone\u2019s out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrightman\u2019s glaring at us, Kang Shin. He looks like he\u2019s ready to charge at you at any moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, I like courageous people. But\u2026 I hate people that scheme behind people\u2019s backs.\u201d</p><br/><p>I summoned Peika and Sharana. I leisurely took out a highest-grade Mana Potion and popped open the cork. I put the potion in my mouth and materialized Peika.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done! Only that annoying man is left in the building!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, thanks, Plene.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhehehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>I lightly patted Plene and drank the Mana Potion. Then, I ordered Peika and Sharana, who were yawning like they were bored.</p><br/><p>\u201cSink this building.\u201d</p><br/><p>In less than a minute, the building collapsed.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Ah, how refreshing. I wanted to take care of these guys for so long, now I can finally do it.</p><br/><p>Yua joins the ranks of explorers! As many people guessed, although Yua had no talent for using her body, she was talented in charming! A cute and powerful SS ranker has joined the guild! Now, how would the girls treat their potential sister-in-law!? How would Yua react to meeting her oppa\u2019s daughter!?</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>For those wondering, I changed how I translated Daisy\u2019s speech so that it reflects her choppy-style.</p><br/><p>Also, Korea to Boston is about 11400 km. Speed of sound is about 1200km/hr. Lotte\u2019s 30 minute cut is Mach 20 speed\u2026 spooky.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

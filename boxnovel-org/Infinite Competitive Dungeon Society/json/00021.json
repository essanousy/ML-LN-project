Fall's New Students (3)</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, why are you taking something like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fight ended. I, of course, had the highest contribution. Because three people died, there were only seven rewards to choose from. From them, what I chose was the \u2018Thunder Crystal.\u2019</p><br/><p>On the outside, it looked just like a transparent crystal, but black sparks filled in the inside, making it look like a plasma globe. The moment I laid my eyes on it, I was sure it was a medicine just like the Compressing Elixirs or the Soul Tempering Elixir. However, it seemed Shina thought I refused the good reward.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to hunt a lot of Dark Ratman, so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes? So there was a reason why you hunted the 5th Floor Master for 3 years?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mm\u2026 there was, but at the same time, there wasn\u2019t. I debated whether to explain to her or not. In the end, I nodded my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYep. You know about it, right? That Floor Masters drop items that increase stats.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do, but I heard the chances are low and that there are limits to how much you can consume them. I even heard that they weren\u2019t guaranteed to raise your stats, so I didn\u2019t think anyone would challenge the Floor Masters for them. Not to mention, Floor Masters are dangerous. If you die, you wouldn\u2019t be able to enter the dungeon for a week.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMuscle, Bone, and Skin Compressing Elixirs all have pretty high drop rates, though you have to meet certain conditions to consume them. What\u2019s important is how high your contribution is. If they really don\u2019t drop, you can always lower the number of people in the party.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, it\u2019s not that they don\u2019t work sometimes. It\u2019s just that after the first one, you have to consume several of them to have the same effect. Whoever told you must have been confused. Ah, of course, there is a limit. Each stat can only go up by 10 at most.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing my words, Shina gasped. Staring at me, she asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould Shin-nim have\u2026 for all the Floor Masters\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only the 5th and 10th Floor Master, but yeah, I consumed all the stat increasing elixirs to the limit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected, my eyes weren\u2019t wrong\u2026 Unni\u2019s too\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnni?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-It\u2019s nothing, Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shina shook her head, then said with a sigh, \u201cFighting the Floor Master dozens of times\u2026 I don\u2019t have the confidence. I can\u2019t even imagine doing it. The week where I can\u2019t enter the dungeon after dying is\u2026 like hell. I know how strong you are, but to think you could take the risk to continually challenge the Floor Master. Huhu, in that way, your strength makes sense. It\u2019s not just the body\u2019s strength, but the mind\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re praising me too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>All explorers had reasons to enter the dungeon. Although slightly different than others, it was the same for father. Because the dungeon was the source of income for our family, he could not be careless.</p><br/><p>Although he put himself at risk to obtain mana, once he awakened, he never challenged the Floor Master again. Explorers from other continents were under even more dire circumstances, and thus could not act carelessly. Of course, there were still those who acted arrogantly and caused their parties to be annihilated.</p><br/><p>In any case, I was in a much better situation compared to them. Although a crisis struck the world I lived in, the situation was not that serious yet. Well, I wondered what would happen at first, but the situation never came down to threatening my family.</p><br/><p>That was why I could be bold in exploring the dungeon. That was why I could slowly and leisurely seek to get stronger.</p><br/><p>I was just lucky. That was what I thought. If Earth was in a desperate situation like Luka or Edias continent, I would not have been able to spend several months just to fight the same boss. I would not have had the chance to even find out I could increase my stats through grinding the boss. After all, I would have known a mana cultivation method if Earth was like the other continents.</p><br/><p>Regardless, it seemed hard to convince this girl staring at me with eyes full of admiration. As such, I kept my silence. Shina seemed to be drawing her own conclusions.</p><br/><p>Anyway, I successfully defeated the Dark Ratman and obtained the qualification to advance to the 16th floor.</p><br/><p>[You consumed a Thunder Crystal. Your resistance to lightning increases slightly. Your affinity with lightning increases.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Haa?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Thunder Crystal I swallowed expecting a stat increase gave a result that was both hard and not hard to accept. Even if my affinity with lightning increased, it did not matter since I was not a magician.</p><br/><p>I did like the increased resistance to lightning. Since consumable item effects seemed to stack up to ten times, my resistance to lightning could increase nine more times. When that happened, I would not need to worry so much about lightning magic.</p><br/><p>\u2018What a shame.\u2019</p><br/><p>Compared to the sweet fruit the 5th and 10th Floor Masters gave, the Thunder Crystal felt disappointing. It seemed I could only look forward to the Dark Ratman Set and the Dark Ratman Slayer title. I didn\u2019t know whether to be happy about having a shorter grind or sad about not having the chance to increase my stats.</p><br/><p>With a sigh, I stood in front of the stair to the 16th floor. I could not repeat the same mistake forever.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a serious expression, I opened the friend window. Including Shina, I had only friended three people. I looked for Palludia\u2019s name. It was there. She was inside the dungeon.</p><br/><p>I clicked on her name and sent her a message.</p><br/><p>\u201cPalludia, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, Palludia, for not replying to your messages before. I was in a dangerous situation, so I meant to contact you later, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Who is this?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Kang Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t know anyone with that name.]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2026 sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re sorry about. Like I said, I don\u2019t know an orc like you.]</p><br/><p>\u2018You do remember! Also, I\u2019m not an orc!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew, I was wrong. Forgive me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s what you have to say after ignoring me for so long? That\u2019s it?]</p><br/><p>\u2018What else would I do?\u2019 I felt the urge to complain, but I calmed myself down by thinking of Yua\u2019s smiling face. Yep, I calmed down right away.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, if there\u2019s anything you want me to do, tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hmph, like you could heal my wounded pride. Don\u2019t be stupid.]</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like that. A chance like this doesn\u2019t come often.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You don\u2019t sound sorry at all! Do you know how much I\u2026 uk.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? What?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t ask!]</p><br/><p>Palludia. She was like a medical book. I couldn\u2019t understand her from start to end.</p><br/><p>[\u2026 You\u2019ll do anything?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s within my ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Fine, you cowardly Orc.]</p><br/><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026]</p><br/><p>Palludia was silent for a moment. Just when I was wondering if she was fed up and about to delete me from her friend list, she sent me a message.</p><br/><p>[Hurry up.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Climb up quickly! To the 25th Floor Master!]</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m saying I\u2019ll wait for you! So hurry to the 25th floor! We can defeat the Floor Master together!]</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, let\u2019s make that 30th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hey!]</p><br/><p>It would take me several months to grind in the 15th and 20th floor. However, Palludia seemed uninterested by my offer.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll give you three months, so you better reach the 25th floor by then! Otherwise, I won\u2019t meet you ever again!]</p><br/><p>\u201cH-Hey!\u201d</p><br/><p>[No buts!]</p><br/><p>With that the message ended. I tried to contact her again but she did not respond. This girl, did she even know what floor I was on? And what did she mean she wouldn\u2019t meet with me again? Wasn\u2019t the last time we saw each other almost four years ago?</p><br/><p>I was speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cThree months? That\u2019s impossible. What an unreasonable girl\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I murmured to myself and sighed. Although she called me Orc, I knew she considered me to be her friend. Because I knew I was in the wrong, I wanted to make up for it, but that did not mean I would ruin my pace for it. If she didn\u2019t want to see me, then she wouldn\u2019t. I made my resolve.</p><br/><p>However, Loretta from the 15th Floor Shop smiled at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cCustomer, you had a girlfriend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s just a friend. Can you stop smiling like that? It\u2019s creepy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou made fun of me before, customer, so it\u2019s only fair that I do the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be absurd. Besides, Palludia is really just a friend. One that easily gets angry, treats me like an orc, is short, and has a small chest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your friend? That sounds more like a mortal enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta made a rare serious expression and advised me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should sever all ties with her immediately. From what I see, she\u2019ll do something perverted to customer. Like kidnapping you and using you as a sex slave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>I gave Loretta the coldest look I made in my entire life.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD-Don\u2019t look at me like that! I just happened to read a novel like that recently!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, your eyes got colder! My heart\u2019s going to freeze, please look away!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta spent the next 10 seconds unfreezing herself, then took something out from her pocket as I was heading up to the 16th floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cCustomer, here\u2019s a special offer from the Floor Shop!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to sell me something again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis here is a very special item. It\u2019s a ticket that ignores the once a day limit for battling the Floor Master and allows one to challenge it again! It\u2019s the \u2018Floor Master Battle Voucher!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you had something like that, why didn\u2019t you tell me sooner!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s being sold at the cheap price of 3,000 gold!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c6 million won!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I almost passed out from the shock. I understood why she only told me about it now. Each time I defeated the Wraith Queen alone, I got 3,000 gold. The Dark Ratman gave 5,000 gold, from which I only received 500. I would be losing 2,500 gold every time I used it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy expensive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut customer, isn\u2019t it enticing? In truth, I\u2019m selling it at the manufacture cost because no one has bought any in the past 300 years. They aren\u2019t normally this cheap!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s so unpopular that no one bought any in 300 years, can\u2019t you make it cheaper?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta didn\u2019t seem to flinch at my reasonable claim.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to at least take the manufacture cost! Customer, I\u2019m already being generous with my offer. Not to mention, this isn\u2019t something anyone can buy. Ah, by the way, you can only use up to two per day. So, in total, you would be able to fight the Floor Master three times a day!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Loretta\u2019s sincere eyes, I knew she wasn\u2019t lying. It was true that I had a lot of gold stockpiled. But if I continued to buy those things to fight the Dark Ratman, I would eventually dry.</p><br/><p>That said, if I used them, I would be able to finish grinding the 15th and 20th Floor Masters and reach the 25th floor in 3 months. I was certain. Setting my promise with Palludia aside, just the prospect of quickening my growth tempted me. In that case\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! So you\u2019ll buy them!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy them after I reach the 20th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAww.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta made a disappointed expression. I smiled and waved my hand at her. Then, I continued on my way to the 16th floor. Three months, huh. I wonder why she was so bent on meeting me in three months.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, Palludia, I\u2019ll see you then. Don\u2019t be too surprised after seeing my changed appearance.\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

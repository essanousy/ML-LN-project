The Third Taming (4)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Chapter 213. The Third Taming (4)</p><br/><p>On Earth, some countries were ruined by monsters, and many uninhabited islands were crawling with monsters. I remembered seeing a news report saying that 30% of small islands had been taken over by monsters.</p><br/><p>The reason humans could continue to live normally was all thanks to Guardian and Freedom Wing, who always had at least 50% of their forces devoted to stopping the monsters\u2019 further encroachment into human territory. This was the reason Guardian and Freedom Wing could continue to exist even while they were being used by people of authority, being doubted of their capabilities, and receiving bad press.</p><br/><p>As agencies that protected humanity, this was the Guardian and Freedom Wing\u2019s founding goal.</p><br/><p>However, even they could not deploy troops to reclaim lands taken over by monsters. As I said before, they just didn\u2019t have enough manpower.</p><br/><p>Everyday, monsters of unpredictable strength appeared in completely unexpected places. From what I knew, only Ciara could predict their appearance. However, even Ciara could only cover an area about the size of an average city. In the end, it was Guardian and Freedom Wing that protected humanity from unforeseen deaths. As this task took most of their forces, they had no choice but to leave monsters\u2019 territories alone no matter how dangerous they were.</p><br/><p>In territories controlled by monsters, their rate of appearance sharply rose. It was the same as how monsters continually spawned in Field Dungeons. At first, I thought the monsters were reproducing, but this wasn\u2019t the case.</p><br/><p>Reproduction meant the birth of new lives. For the invading monsters who didn\u2019t have a world\u2019s power, this was impossible. Plus, not even monsters could give birth to already grown monsters. The fact that no baby monsters had been found strongly rejected the possibility that they were reproducing. In that case, there was only one possibility left \u2013 the pathway.</p><br/><p>I conjectured that when the number of certain monsters in a set area increased, the pathway would widen and allow more of their kind to pass through. This made sense especially since I knew that being invaded by two worlds accelerated the speed of invasion.</p><br/><p>In any case, it was true that territories seized by monsters spawned more monsters. Currently, the number of monsters in these territories was shocking. Philippines, Madagascar, Republic of South Africa, and Dominican Republic were already ruined. Germany, Britain, America, Korea, and other countries had also lost much of their land to monsters. Although everyone wanted to reclaim their land, no one could put it into action.</p><br/><p>Now that I thought about it, Joshua Brightman who tried to create a separate independent organization just to go against Revival was really shameless. He should have just kept doing his job properly. Of course, since he now had to live the rest of his life eating porridge and medicine, I couldn\u2019t say much more.</p><br/><p>In any case, this was where the succubi army stepped in. As they weren\u2019t restrained to the dungeon, though they almost died of old age as virgins. they were able to keep their original strengths and even shared battle experience and skill proficiency with each other.</p><br/><p>212 succubi had magic power on par with SS rankers, while Mirei\u2019s strength was somewhere between SS+ rank and SSS rank, and Licorice\u2019s strength was SSS+ rank. It wouldn\u2019t be an overstatement to say that they could easily stomp any force on Earth.</p><br/><p>To be frank, if the members of Revival fought against them without me, the result was clear. Unless about five other members received gods\u2019 true names, they would undoubtedly lose.</p><br/><p>Though the succubi couldn't climb the dungeon, there was no need to let them sit around and do nothing. Plus, Licorice said that the mana and vitality succubi needed to live could be stolen from monsters. Thus, this \u2018subjugation\u2019 would be vital for their survival.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you don\u2019t need to worry, we won\u2019t do it with anyone other than Dear Husb\u2014 kyak!\u201d</p><br/><p>I smacked Licorice\u2019s head and shut her up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, you already said you had a special magic for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, your method of showing affection is too violent\u2026 sob.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked around at the succubi in the mansion and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe prepared robes for all of you. Honestly, the way you\u2019re currently dressed is too lewd.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband prepared clothes for us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWoooow!\u201d</p><br/><p>All 182 succubi cheered. As they were incredibly loud, I considered using Frozen Roar, but since they had already become my allies, I knew I couldn\u2019t freeze them. On the other hand, Licorice and other succubi that weren\u2019t chosen to be part of the battle squad became depressed. You were lying when you said you shared emotions, weren\u2019t you?</p><br/><p>\u201cLicorice, don\u2019t look so sad. There\u2019s one for you too. It\u2019s our guild robe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuild robe?\u201d</p><br/><p>Right, the clothes I had prepared for them were Revival\u2019s guild robes. Revival\u2019s guild emblem, suggested by vice-guild master Hwaya and agreed upon by majority of others, was embroidered on them. By giving almost all the monster materials I had to the best blacksmith I knew, about 300 of them had been made. To be honest, when I first commissioned for them to be made, I was worried whether they would all find owners\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Thanks, Lin. I\u2019ll remember to buy you a drink later.\u2019</p><br/><p>I gave everyone their robes as I lightly pushed aside Lin cursing under his breath in my head. The succubi examined the robes and cheered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey all have magic imbued in them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, they\u2019re skin-tight! Just the way we like it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGolden embroidery on black, they\u2019re gorgeous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s this on the back? There\u2019s a streak of lightning enveloping a spear!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 the guild emblem.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I felt that the guild emblem only represented me, I voted against it, but Hwaya pushed for it seriously. According to her, I was the one currently representing Revival. After getting a confirmation that the guild emblem would change later, I agreed to it. Truthfully, even if I didn\u2019t agree, as a majority of guild members agreed, it would have been pushed through.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, I don\u2019t like that it\u2019s not very revealing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat age are you from? In this day and age, rather than showing skin, clothes that accentuate bodily curves are the best!\u201d</p><br/><p>The succubi merrily chatted and put on their robes immediately. As they could just wear it on top of their leather clothes which could barely be considered clothes, it was quite simple. The result was 182 women wearing elegant black robes.</p><br/><p>When they were wearing the leather clothes unique to succubi, I didn\u2019t know where to place my eyes. Now that they were all wearing the same robe, they looked like an elite force. Although the robes openly showed their bodily curves, as expected of clothes Lin made, they exuded the aura of nobility and elegance rather than vulgarity.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the somewhat embarrassing lightning spear emblem on their back was conspicuous. It would be impossible for anyone to not think of me when they saw it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s split you guys up. Each unit will have 30 succubi, and with one more in Unit 1 and Unit 2, there will be 6 units.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unit 1 and Unit 2 had 31 succubi, while Unit 3 through Unit 6 had 30. Once the units were formed, the next part was simple. It was choosing where to deploy them. Of the places seized by monsters, there were some where not even 30 SS rankers could guarantee their safety. As such, I limited their first mission to territories that weren\u2019t in any countries.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be striking islands, coastal areas, and uninhabited islands. Of these, uninhabited islands are practically monster haven, so remember that. After that, we\u2019ll move deeper into land.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201cYes, Dear Husband!\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>With two hundred succubi yelling out \u2018Dear Husband\u2019, even I couldn\u2019t help but shudder. However, as it was decided that I would give the command for their first mission, I held in my desire to run away and assigned the six units to different areas. There were hundreds of thousands of uninhabited islands on Earth. Although the number would halve when the isolated ones were taken out, there were still a considerable amount of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t rush it. Safety comes first. Got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201cYes, Dear Husband!\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>Please, stop that\u2026!</p><br/><p>The succubi could all use magic. Of course, they were most proficient in charm magic and transformation magic. When used together, no matter how advanced modern technology became, it became nearly impossible to track them. In other words, they didn\u2019t need to hold back.</p><br/><p>They immediately set off to chase away the monsters claiming Earth\u2019s territories and to obtain mana and vitality to eat. Once they left, the mansion became quiet, and the guild members all went back to their usual work.</p><br/><p>With over thirty succubi residing in the mansion, Ilayda and Sumire also no longer needed to stay in the mansion. When I first arrived with the succubi, Ilayda silently watched on with a surprised expression. It was only after they left that she finally spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuild Master is really amazing. So many of them, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed she was misunderstood something. As she got more confused</p><br/><p>no matter how much I explained the circumstance, I gave up halfway through.</p><br/><p>With all the succubi assigned to their duties, there was nothing more I needed to do other than wait for their periodic report.</p><br/><p>With Revival taking in the succubus clan, humans obtained the chance to chase away the monsters. Although I had done it without much thinking, I still considered the possibility that this resulted in something much greater.</p><br/><p>Of course, I would only find out later. As I had done what I could, I returned to the dungeon without regrets.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, I feel a bit uncomfortable hunting succubi. Do you mind if I stay out, Dear Husband?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, that\u2019s probably for the best. As long as she isn\u2019t stronger than you, I won\u2019t have any problem defeating her anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Licorice found out I was going to hunt the Succubus Queen, she backed off with an awkward smile. I led her to the guild house in the Residential Area and challenged the Succubus Queen alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a charming human. It\u2019s been awhile since I got to enjoy myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she was undoubtedly a Floor Master, the Succubus Queen that appeared alone in front of me was noticeably weaker than Licorice. Though it was something I realized only after meeting Licorice and her clan members, the dungeon\u2019s succubi were lacking in charm, strength, and vitality compared to Licorice\u2019s clan. The Succubus Queen was no different.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome closer, play with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s play!\u201d</p><br/><p>I pretended to fall for the Succubus Queen\u2019s charm as I ran toward her. The moment she spread out her arms and seemed to use some skill, I struck her with Heroic Strike. As the atmosphere and strength she was giving off were completely different from Licorice, I had no hesitation in doing so.</p><br/><p>\u201cCritical Hit!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, Kuhuk\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLightning Spear Storm!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHere\u2019s an extra! Wind King\u2019s Rage!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You\u2019re not a man!? Kyaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I struck the Succubus Queen with Wind King\u2019s Rage about four times, she helplessly scattered into particles of light. In just 2 minutes, the Floor Master battle had ended.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu, good fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>I wiped away the non-existing sweat and murmured, as I thought why Succubus Queen's purposely revealed openings trying to use charms that didn\u2019t work. At that moment, messages rang out in my ear. It was truly a pleasant sound.</p><br/><p>[Amazing! You are the first in the First Dungeon\u2019s history to succeed in soloing the Succubus Queen on the first try! The dungeon will remember you as a great explorer.

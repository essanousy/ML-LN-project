The Last Member (6)</p><br/><p>Loretta and I entered the castle without hesitation. As I somewhat understood where he was, I led Loretta and walked through the castle\u2019s hall, feeling his boundless mana in the surroundings.</p><br/><p>Mm, this is\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has two true names, huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I murmured, Loretta tilted her head curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo? That\u2019s impossible. Kain\u2026 Kain Zerahard only has one true name.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, he has two. He either hid one, or he must have obtained one afterwards.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m surprised you found out.]</p><br/><p>After his voice rang out in the communication channel, a wall in the hallway rose up like a curtain. Almost like a hidden room from the movies, beyond the wall was a small room.</p><br/><p>Kain Zerahar greeted us, half lying on a giant sofa that seemed to serve as his bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When he saw me, he opened his mouth, then closed it soon after. I took this time to examine him closer.</p><br/><p>The first thing I noticed was his clothes. Translucent silk-like clothing covered his body, shining with all sorts of colors. The tiny bit of skin he showed on his neck showed how pale he was.</p><br/><p>He had a long and slender neckline, and he was beautiful enough to be considered a woman. I thought Lin was pretty, but Kain Zerahard even surpassed Lin. Left alone for a long time, his hair was longer than an average girl\u2019s and that seemed to add to his charm. I finally opened my mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow handsome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, you\u2019re handsome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Almost as if he was copying me, Kain Zerahard commented on my appearance at the same time. Realizing that we talked over each other, we both closed our mouth. An awkward silence descended.</p><br/><p>\u2026 I began to doubt whether Loretta judged people based on their appearance.</p><br/><p>Soon, he eyed Loretta and spoke briefly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was it. It must have been centuries from the last time they saw each other! Of course, I wasn\u2019t generous enough to happily watch Loretta talk to her first love, and since Hwaya must be fighting one of the kings even now, I moved the conversation forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy comrade\u2026 A precious person of mine is in a life-or-death situation where a single second is important. Please, your power can save her. We need Odin\u2019s Gungnir.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you want me to use Gungnir?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. If you want something in return, I would be happy to anything as long as it\u2019s within my ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as I spoke, I knew in the corner of my mind that he wouldn\u2019t accept this request. He had lived in a secret room of his castle for centuries while hiding having a god\u2019s true name. I felt like I knew what this meant.</p><br/><p>Even so, I came to see him because I had a card in hand. In the process of coming to meet him, I became certain of its usefulness.</p><br/><p>\u201cI refuse. There\u2019s nothing I want.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, he replied instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Everything I want disappeared long ago, and there\u2019s no way to turn back time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018As I thought.\u2019 I murmured inwardly. As I had heard about him from Loretta and others, I knew what he meant.</p><br/><p>He was the last survivor of his world. In other words, he abandoned his dying world and escaped with the world\u2019s power. It had to have been hundreds of years ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should know what I mean. What do you think I\u2019m doing right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hiding.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, I\u2019m hiding.\u201d</p><br/><p>When was the last time he moved his body? He raised his long and thin fingers.</p><br/><p>\u201cI lost everything I had to protect and escaped cursing everything. As I have no right to live, I\u2019m simply waiting for death to come take my life. Unfortunately, my boundless mana won\u2019t allow me to die easily, so I\u2019ve been waiting for a long time. Perhaps, I\u2019ll have to wait eternally.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to change your mind\u2026 but you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta spoke out. Her voice was filled with faint anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you see me, Kain? Do you see what all administrative guilds are doing? If you help, we can save countless others who are in the same position as you. Even just a little bit would have been fine. The dungeon always cheered you on, and everyone supported you. But you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Loretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat don\u2019t I understand!? I experienced the same things you have! Everything I wanted to protect! Everyone I wanted to protect! I lost everything that supported me! Parents, siblings, friends, comrades! My world and all lives living in it! You\u2019re telling me I still don\u2019t understand!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI lost the woman I love, the one person I cared for more than the entire world.\u201d</p><br/><p>At his calm tone, Loretta retorted in a frighteningly quiet voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, if there was one thing I didn\u2019t understand, it was the feeling of losing a lover. Is that why you taught it to me? How kind of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make Heroes of other worlds face the same reality I did. That\u2019s why I accepted Lord\u2019s offer and helped create the dungeon. I create pathways to countless worlds being attacked by worlds\u2019 enemies and helped explorers walk the right path. At first, you were one of them, Kain.\u201d</p><br/><p>All explorers were indebted to the dungeon. There was no doubt about it. By entering the dungeon, we obtained the power to resist our enemies, and we grew stronger by relying on the dungeon\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>But Kain holed up in Beyond\u2019s Residential Are with the power he received. Simply put, he had washed his mouth clean after being treated. Even after hundreds of years, he was the strongest explorer. If he joined an administrative guild or worked as a Dimensional Mercenary during this time, he could have saved many worlds from ruin.</p><br/><p>Still.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not obligated to do anything, Loretta. No one can force someone to do something\u2026 Even if Loretta did in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I was the one who disappointed myself. Because I believed in him, I received more shock when I realized the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Through Kain, Loretta learned that excessive trust only led to her getting hurt.</p><br/><p>\u2026 How she acted in an inexplicably exaggerated manner around me and how she told me to escape if things got hard surely had something to do with her trauma from this incident. Because she didn\u2019t want to be hurt, she had lowered her expectations.</p><br/><p>To be honest, it was quite absurd. This weakness and softness shouldn\u2019t have been the charm she felt from me.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Loretta, there\u2019s something us guys have to talk about.\u201d</p><br/><p>I spoke out before she became more emotional. Not only Loretta, but Kain Zerahard also widened his eyes. It seemed he didn\u2019t expect me to do this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else I need to hear. I just wanted to see what you were going to say. If you know my circumstance, you should know I only have one answer for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKain, help Shin-nim! You should be able to do this much! It\u2019s not like you\u2019ll suffer a loss\u2026 Ubub!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I blocked Loretta\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, thank you for helping me get here. You did what you needed to. From now, I\u2019ll be fine on my own. I can convince him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cS-Shin-nim\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta made a funny expression like she couldn\u2019t understand what I was thinking. Although her flapping ears were adorable, as I wasn\u2019t in the best place to show her my affection, I simply nodded my head for now.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Y-Yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, Loretta nodded with a flushed face.</p><br/><p>\u201cT-Then I\u2019ll see you later. I\u2019ll go back for now! Kain, Sikatra says hi! Make sure you help Shin-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta then turned around and left as she frantically fanned her reddened face. Seeing her leave quietly, Kain muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing you should be thankful about. I love her and she loves me. That\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You\u2019re right.\u201d</p><br/><p>After murmuring in agreement, he spoke up with a stiff voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I still refuse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can say that\u2019ll convince me. Leave me be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it the feeling of loss that\u2019s controlling you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it might have been for the first two hundred years, but it\u2019s been a long time since I got over that.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing him, I took a quick breath. Then, I quickly added.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s the feeling of helplessness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kain\u2019s eyes widened slightly. It wasn\u2019t a laughable situation, but I couldn\u2019t help but grin slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you ready to talk to me now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a rookie who just entered Beyond\u2026 You know about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to brag, but I\u2019m about to enter Beyond\u2019s 31st floor. I\u2019m on the First Dungeon\u2019s 81st floor too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though I was the one who said it, I felt proud. I had come this far. So many things had happened on the way, and thankfully, I had grasped onto many things without letting them go.</p><br/><p>It seemed I wasn\u2019t the only one who thought this way, as Kain spoke dumbfoundedly.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You already surpassed me in Beyond. In such a short time too\u2026 Are you really human?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doubting it recently, but I was indeed a human when I was born.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTalent\u2026 Is this what they call talent? How ridiculous. In my long life, this is the first time I\u2019ve seen someone like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>I smiled at his murmuring.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, compared to the years you\u2019ve lived, mine must feel as light as a feather. But Kain, ah, I can call you Kain, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have the qualifications.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKain, my feather is a bit big. Perhaps, it\u2019s so big that even you won\u2019t be able to see it in its full.\u201d</p><br/><p>My Evil Eyes were shining on their own. Depending on their user\u2019s mood, Evil Eyes sometimes activated on their own. That was one of the flaws of Evil Eyes, but it didn\u2019t matter as Kain was not so weak as to be affected by my Evil Eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk, Kain, as quickly as possible if possible. I promise to give you something I can give, so lend me your power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething you can give\u2026 you say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow I can be so certain even after realizing the same thing you have. That\u2019s what I can give you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sorry, but I can\u2019t guarantee anything. I\u2019m just doing my best.</p><br/><p>Kain also saw through my little bluff, but surprisingly, he broke out in a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can see why Loretta fell for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He got up. His hair fluttered, and even after hundreds of years, his silk clothes covered his body softly and tightly. After standing on his feet perfectly, he took a light breath and infused life into his body.</p><br/><p>Then, he stared at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hear it then. No one can bother us here, so rest easy and show me your everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><br/><p>And that\u2019s what I did.</p><br/><p>With that, Kain joined Revival.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

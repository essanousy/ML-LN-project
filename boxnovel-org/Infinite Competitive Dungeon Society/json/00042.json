Event Dungeon (5)</p><br/><p>About an hour after we entered the dungeon, I made everyone stop. I sensed something strong, and there was more than one of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel something. It might be the boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm\u2026 Ah, there really is. One, two\u2026 there\u2019s three.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, let me use detection magic\u2026. Kyaaak!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Because I forgot to say they were hidden underground, I ended up hearing a soprano scream. Just like father said, three spiders suddenly appeared from underground, and I quickly pulled the party back. Each spider was about 3 meters tall. Spiders this big, where did I see them before? Ah, that\u2019s right, Harry Potter!</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mastiford seemed to have received huge shock from the spider\u2019s visual as she kept on screaming. As if it had been annoyed by all the screaming, one of the giant spiders shot a stream of white spider web like a bullet, aimed at Mastiford. Minami then stepped forward and help her shield up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>Boom! The sound of a cannon shell colliding with metal rang out. Such destructive power for a mere spider web! I looked back, worried about Minami\u2019s status. Thankfully, although she looked a little pale, she was fine. It seemed she didn\u2019t say she was good at defense for nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m fine, so take care of the spiders!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it!\u201d</p><br/><p>I clenched my fists and charged at one of the giant spiders in front of me. Father was also shooting out shockwaves at the other giant spiders, handling two at the same time. As I could not do long-range attacks with Spirit Aura yet, I could only fight one spider at a time.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat this!\u201d</p><br/><p>I kicked the ground and approached a giant spider. Before it could tilt its body and dodge, I plunged my lightning clad gauntlet in the hole where it had shot spider webs earlier. When I let the lightning flow, the giant spider trembled and shrieked.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEat another one!\u201d</p><br/><p>Left hand this time! Right hand again! When I consecutively punched with my fists, it tried to use its two front legs to strike down at me. Although they were fast, I could easily dodge them as I had seen the legs\u2019 initial movement. The two legs only hit empty air and dug into the ground with an explosive sound.</p><br/><p>Immediately afterwards, I threw a right cross at one of its front legs. Clang! A sound like I had hit a metallic pillar rang out. I had to clench my teeth to endure the recoil, but I obtained the result I wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cKiyaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn opening!\u201d</p><br/><p>When it screamed and raised its body half way up, I instantly ducked and jumped under it. I then pushed it with my lightning clad fists, making it fall on its back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving behind Minami\u2019s awestruck shout, I leaped up and landed on its belly. Although it struggled and tried to attack me with its legs, it was in vain. I held its carapace on one hand and rained my other hand down like a hammer.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie! You! Spider! Bastard! Stop! Shooting! Out! Webs!\u201d</p><br/><p>Every time I struck down with my fist strengthened with mana and lightning, the spider twitched. It let out a bloodcurdling scream and struggled every time it was hit, but his reaction lessened as time went on.</p><br/><p>Eventually, my fist succeeded in penetrating its belly. With my hand inside it, I let as much lightning flow out as possible.</p><br/><p>Pzzzzzt!</p><br/><p>\u201cKi\u2014!\u201d</p><br/><p>The giant spider let out a short scream, then became calm as it dropped its eight legs on the ground. After confirming that it was dead, I dropped back down. It was then that I heard a message in my ear.</p><br/><p>[You mastered Mid-rank Martial Arts! Attacks that make use of your body will be quicker and stronger. It can intimidate enemies possessing lower proficiency skills.]</p><br/><p>That was considered martial arts? I was just punching it! When I was about to rebuke the message in my mind, more shocking messages flowed in.</p><br/><p>[You satisfied the condition and learned High-rank Martial Arts skill. Your body becomes even tougher. It becomes easier to use highly complex skills, and your attacks will be effective against enemies stronger than you.]</p><br/><p>[You satisfied the condition and learned \u2018Thunder Beast\u2019 skill. Thunder Beast is a combat-type special active skill that comes from possessing high-rank martial arts and a lightning ability.]</p><br/><p>[Thunder Beast is a dangerous technique that attacks the enemy by exploding the user\u2019s superb physical ability and the power of lightning. This technique puts a burden on its user\u2019s body, so using it without high constitution may hurt the user instead. With its huge magic consumption, your magic stat must be high as well. It uses 1 percent of total mana per 1 second it is active. Using it for a long period of time may have negative effects on the user\u2019s constitution. It uses 1 percent of HP and MP per second when used inside the dungeon.]</p><br/><p>My eyes became wide. Obtaining high-rank martial arts was somewhat expected, but the Thunder Beast skill was something I would never have imagined. It was like a surprise present. I knew what skills like it were called.</p><br/><p>Compound skill. It was when two or more skills combined to create a stronger skill, or when achieving a certain level created a new skill by combining two or more skills. In my case, Thunder Beast was the result of my high-rank martial arts skill and lightning ability, or more specifically, lightning elemental Peika\u2019s Spirit Aura, combining. Although I had heard of it before, I never thought it would happen to me. I remembered Ellos complaining about wanting to get a compound skill\u2026</p><br/><p>The skill itself had an immense drawback befitting of its strong-sounding name. Using 1 percent of my mana every 1 second meant that I could only use it for 100 seconds at most. Not to mention, it said it also put a burden on my body. I could easily see how much burden it would be by looking at its HP consumption in the dungeon. Although it would undoubtedly be strong, I could feel how dangerous it was.</p><br/><p>There was a reason for the difference in consumption inside and outside of the dungeon.</p><br/><p>Outside of the dungeon, it was impossible to check one\u2019s HP and MP. Both HP and MP were values that only applied in the dungeon. They were safety mechanisms there to prevent dungeon explorers from dying. When the HP hit 0, the explorer would be kicked out of the dungeon. Likewise, MP was the safety mechanism on the explorer\u2019s mana.</p><br/><p>No one explained this difference to me. As I explored the dungeon, I naturally learned the difference on my own.</p><br/><p>In truth, there was not a big difference in my ability inside or outside the dungeon. It was just that I could not check my HP and MP outside the dungeon. That was just how it was.</p><br/><p>Although Thunder Beast seemed to be a dangerous skill, the fact that I could use a powerful skill without my spear made me happy. I thanked my good fortune. With this, I really did not need to use a spear outside the dungeon.</p><br/><p>When I finished going over all the messages I received, Mastiford had finally snapped out of it.</p><br/><p>When I was about to say something to her, father\u2019s shockwave glazed a spider and hit the ground. It was then that I realized father was dealing with two spiders at once. Uwak, he\u2019s going to scold me later!</p><br/><p>\u201cYeon Hwawoo, Miss, I need help!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA-Ah! Sorry, Ajusshi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Mastiford\u2019s flames could not instantly burn up the giant spider. Plus, the two remaining spiders teamed up, as one attacked with its legs and the other attacked from the back by shooting out its webs.</p><br/><p>In the end, Minami stood forward and blocked the spider\u2019s web bullets as father and I dealt with the spider fighting with its legs. Mastifold then managed to burn them up with yellow flames she created with few seconds of concentrating her energy. I thought it was a decent teamplay.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince we burned them up, we won\u2019t know if they had Bluestones.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t want to look through spider corpses! That one too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMastiford-ssi, that one\u2019s mine. Don\u2019t burn it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>I leisurely picked apart the giant spider\u2019s corpse, and found a fist-size Bluestone near its head. As it was the first Bluestone I found, I was especially attached to it. \u2018So this Is the reason why so many ability users gritted their teeth to fight monsters?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, it\u2019s huge! With that size, it should easily go for 40 million.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c40 million won? This thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>That was equivalent to about 20,000 gold. The giant spider was certainly strong, but that was still the amount I got from two Floor Masters. I was suddenly disillusioned by the job called dungeon explorer. But Minami still had more to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s 40 million yen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wait, then taking 100 yen as 900 won, that\u2019s\u2026 360 million won!?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so surprised? It\u2019s an elite monster even amongst A-rank monsters. Not only are their numbers small, Bluestones don\u2019t always drop. Since we\u2019re fighting with our life on the line, it\u2019s only appropriate. In fact, isn\u2019t it too small?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should take this spider corpse too. I\u2019ve never seen a spider this big, and its carapace is only broken around its belly. It should go for as much as the Bluestone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c7, 720 million won\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026 Maybe I should work as an ability user on the side.\u2019 Realizing just how much money ability users made, I fiddled around with the Bluestone in my hand. However, as father was also eyeing the Bluestone with sparkling eyes, I left the detailed scrutiny to a later time. For now, I stored the Bluestone into my inventory along with the spider\u2019s corpse.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this mine? Or do we have to split it somehow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Yeon Hwawoo-ssi killed it alone, it\u2019s yours. We didn\u2019t help you in any way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Mm.\u201d</p><br/><p>It still felt weird to take it all by myself. I could focus on the one because father was handling the other two, and the two girls then helped take care of the other two.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can give 10 percent to each. As a chippu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeon Hwawoo-ssi, that\u2019s Japanese.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm\u2026 as a tip[1. In English] then.\u201d</p><br/><p>How picky from a Japanese. Tip was in English and Mastiford didn\u2019t say anything!</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, that wasn\u2019t the boss just now, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. The Event Dungeons collapse when the boss dies. Uuu, with elite monsters like them, the boss monster would be\u2026 uuuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mastiford murmuring to herself with a frown was rather cute. But I just ignored it and walked forward. Of course, father\u2019s eyes were still fixed on me. I won\u2019t give it to you no matter how much you glare at me, father! Be happy with the 10 percent!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

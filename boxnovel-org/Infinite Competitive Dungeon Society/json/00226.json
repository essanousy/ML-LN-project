Overlord (6)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Chapter 226. Overlord (6)</p><br/><p>[Lava King\u2019s Army\u2019s Knight Commander, \u2018Lava Heart\u2019, has appeared! Before defeating him, it is impossible to defeat the Lava King. Note that there will be no tomorrow if you do not win. I pray for you victory!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, message noona.\u201d</p><br/><p>I murmured in response to the message that rang in my ear. The giant knight I could not contain in my sight glared down at me and shouted.</p><br/><p>[How foolish, Hero. You dare to challenge the king with such meager power?]</p><br/><p>\u201cShut it, Giant.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words caused the earth to rumble. I thought my eardrums would rupture. He was extremely hot, and the burning flames making up his body caused the earth to melt, sinking his feet into the ground. If I wasn\u2019t wearing the Felixes\u2019 Chaotic Cape, even I wouldn\u2019t be able to overcome this heat.</p><br/><p>[Since you awoke the king, you must be prepared to face the punishment!]</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for waking up a sleeping guy. I\u2019ll put him to sleep again as an apology. For eternity.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You!]</p><br/><p>The spear he held descended towards my head like a bolt of lightning. Although it seemed to be a simple attack, a terrifying pressure of mana strangled me. Haha, even with this much power, he wasn\u2019t the king. I could only smile bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLotte, you can dodge it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I will!]</p><br/><p>Lotte replied confidently as she flapped her wings. The black flames that ignited along her wings set the mana restraining us aflame. In the next moment, she escaped from the trajectory of the spear and charged towards his thighs. Feeling the wind and lightning energy from the final gblow gathered at the tip of my spear, I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, Sharana! Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Leave it to me!]</p><br/><p>[Got it!]</p><br/><p>The two elementals shouted back in reply. They weren\u2019t just controlling the energy. They were harmonizing it with the Heroic Strike I was preparing. If the intimacy between us had not reached the peak, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible even in my dreams.</p><br/><p>[Is the thing you\u2019re holding a toothpick? How funny. You dare to attack me with just a frail weapon!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll change your mind once your thigh bursts from being poked at by this toothpick!\u201d</p><br/><p>The final blow of Wind King\u2019s Rage added with a Heroic Strike I was focusing all my mana to make! The wind and lightning energy danced as if to match my breathing. Peika and Sharana\u2019s power heightened. Everything was becoming one with me.</p><br/><p>[Hero, I will erase you and raise the curtain to the end of this world!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKnow your place, grunt! Also, die!\u201d</p><br/><p>As I opened my eyes widely, I focused on the one point I would thrust at. The giant\u2019s leg, covered by his armor of lava, grew closer. Although he was simply trying to kick me, a highly dense mana emitted a powerful pressure enough to crush me to death.</p><br/><p>However, I would not lose. I couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat this! Sacrifice! Desire Thorn!\u201d</p><br/><p>I directly used my trump card skills and thrust out. In that instant, everything that was pressuring me disappeared. The enormous energy gathered at my spear tip had sucked in the nearby mana and freed me. Feeling that power, I gulped down a mouthful of saliva. If this attack couldn\u2019t deliver a fatal blow\u2026! Although Desire Thorn would restore my health, I wouldn\u2019t be able to avoid the pain!</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t worry about the consequence and attack, Hero!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>With Lotte\u2019s trustworthy words, I threw away my hesitation and thrust my spear towards his oncoming thigh. In that instant, a tremendous pain swept over me. From the pain well beyond what I had imagined, I staggered. Although the damage would never be enough to outright kill me, the inflicted pain was a different story. To hold on to my spear, I used all my strength to control myself. Thankfully, the pain seemed to have ravaged the giant as well.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>The moment my spear attack reached its destination, the giant\u2019s enormous scream rumbled the earth once more. His leg burst completely, sending lava towards me. Although thorns extending out from the spear tip absorbed most of it and restored my health, a great amount of lava still shot towards me.</p><br/><p>Even as I wreathed in pain, I spread my cape out and wrapped it with mana. Even if I was fine, if Lotte was hit by that attack, she would undoubtedly melt! However, Lotte was not hit by even a single drop of lava. Even though her body should have felt heavy as a result of my skill, she had gotten away with an incredible acceleration. Her extremely quick movements even made me falter.</p><br/><p>\u201cLotte!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Recover, Hero! I already said you should leave all the dodging to me!]</p><br/><p>Lotte was too cool!</p><br/><p>I followed her advice and hurriedly gulped down a potion. My health which even Desire Thorn couldn\u2019t fully restore seemed to be slowly going back up. When I looked back, the giant\u2019s detonated leg sat on the ground melting the entire earth.</p><br/><p>I wanted to believe that his flames weren\u2019t EX ranked, but the destructive power was one that I had never seen before. If it was Hwaya, could she surpass this power? I couldn\u2019t be sure.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaa! You little insect!]</p><br/><p>Soon, the giant, who was staggering after losing his leg, surprisingly shrunk, creating a new leg and standing tall. Although he had gotten shorter by about ten meters, he had returned to a perfect human form.</p><br/><p>I was confident that I had dealt a critical damage, but he didn\u2019t even seem to be on the verge of death. It seemed I would need to fight him for a long time. For the first time in a while, I recalled the Orc Lord, the one that I had fought when I was level 5.</p><br/><p>[Pay the price for harming this indestructible knight!]</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you were indestructible, I wouldn\u2019t be able to harm you, you idiot!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Die!]</p><br/><p>The giant screamed and swung his spear. With how big the spear was, I could only hear the sound of it cutting through the earth after I saw it flying with my eyes. Lotte dodged this attack with an almost godlike maneuver. Even I couldn\u2019t be confident of dodging the previous attack unless I used Divine Speed.</p><br/><p>[Hero, I\u2019m charging again!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, go ahead!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, someone was approaching me with a cold freezing energy. I thought it was Ina at first, but it turned out to be Ruyue.</p><br/><p>[Shin, let\u2019s go together!]</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, you deal with the army. I\u2019ll deal with him alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>[But Shin is in danger! That guy is too strong!]</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t take care of the army now, we\u2019ll be in greater danger later. Ruyue, please.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Un! Okay!]</p><br/><p>Ruyue fell back obediently. Immediately afterwards, another spear attack flew towards me. Although his spear had stayed the same size unlike his body, as he had gotten weaker, the pressure I was facing was lesser than before. Lotte could also dodge his attacks easier. I shot bolts of lightning from my spear as I shouted in the guild communication channel.</p><br/><p>[Everyone, focus on eliminating the lava army! I\u2019ll handle this giant! Again, focus on eliminating the Destroyers and Sweepers!]</p><br/><p>[We\u2019ll leave it to you, Son!]</p><br/><p>[If you die, I\u2019ll kill you!]</p><br/><p>[Good luck, Guild Master.]</p><br/><p>Go fight instead of cheering me on! Even as I complained in a muffled voice, I smiled and held up my spear. However, on the other hand, I thought that I couldn\u2019t win like this. I had used Wind King\u2019s Rage and had even used Desire Thorn and Sacrifice. Even so, the giant seemed completely fine other than that he had gotten shorter.</p><br/><p>I was confident I would be able to crush him if I used Overlord, but I recalled what message noona said. I would have to face the Lava King after this giant. As I couldn\u2019t use Sky God\u2019s Rage, the only method I had left was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s try it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I activated the Succubus Queen\u2019s Tattoo. Immediately, my mana rose to double its maximum amount. If this wasn\u2019t enough, I would have to absorb the crystal ball Licorice gave me, but if possible, I wanted to save it until I faced the Lava King. I wanted to end this fight with just the doubled mana!</p><br/><p>[I acknowledge that you have many mysterious power contained in that tiny body. Still, you are weak!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, you only know how to talk with that huge body!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fresh lava began to flow along his spear. Lava dripped down in all directions as a thick aura shot towards me as if to pierce straight through. I cursed inwardly and dodged the attack by relying on Lotte. Then, I immediately threw the Chaotic Spear tempered with Heroic Strike.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaak!]</p><br/><p>Having penetrated the giant\u2019s lower abdomen, the Chaotic Spear flew back into my hand with lava scattering everywhere. Once the giant filled in the hold in his abdomen, he had shrunk by another meter. I was beginning to see a way to defeat him!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll soon reach my height, haha!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yooooou! Lava Havoc!]</p><br/><p>Shit, I provoked him too much! He seemed to have gotten annoyed as he struck his spear in the ground along with a fierce cry. Lotte quickly soared up.</p><br/><p>[Tell everyone to run! Staying on the ground is dangerous!]</p><br/><p>[Damn, everyone! Dodge! Don\u2019t stay on the ground!]</p><br/><p>Soon after, the entire volcanic region flipped upside down. Scarlet lava erupted from everywhere. The power of this lava was so strong that even many of the SSS+ ranked Destroyers melted down.</p><br/><p>Screams rang out from several places. No! Could there have been a casualty!? I wanted to look around, but the giant didn\u2019t give me the chance to do so.</p><br/><p>[His main target is us! Hero, prepare yourself!]</p><br/><p>[You puny arrogant human, you shall pay the price for your sins!]</p><br/><p>A cone of lava erupted from right below me. I gasped and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cLotte, quickly, transform!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Got it!]</p><br/><p>Lotte immediately transformed into her human form. I then instantly held her in my arms and shot up using Sharana\u2019s power. Although I had flew up hundreds of meters in an instant, the jet of lava was chasing after me. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, even the giant\u2019s spear flew towards me from the side. I used Divine Speed and flew up even more quickly. Only then did I barely escape the lava.</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re fast like a rat!]</p><br/><p>The giant, Lava Heart, gritted his teeth and thrashed his spear about in the air to vent his anger. Meanwhile, I hurriedly confirmed the guild members\u2019 safety.</p><br/><p>[Is everyone safe!?]</p><br/><p>[Two members couldn\u2019t dodge in time, but they\u2019re alive. With Elixirs, they\u2019ll be fine! But some of the Succubi\u2026!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>While Hwaya gave a report on the situation, a wind-splitting scream rang out. Not far away, an immense mana was going berserk. Without a doubt, it belonged to Licorice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLicorice!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, I must kill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t stop her. I couldn\u2019t ask her to focus on killing the Destroyers in this situation. Not to mention, while the Lava Heart\u2019s attack had harmed us greatly, it had caused even greater harm to the lava army. Even if Licorice joined me, it would be fine.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even before the words had left my mouth, Licorice was consecutively drawing giant magic circles in the air. She glared fiercely as a strange scent flowed out from her body. I knew instinctively. That was the scent of blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cO resentment of fragrant flowers, Branding of Rose! Become blind from beauty and forever wander in the prison of dreams, Sweet Nightmare!\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice\u2019s mana condensed to the point it was visible with bare eyes as it enshrouded the Lava Heart\u2019s giant body. At that instant, his body shrunk rapidly. He was now only 20 meters tall, half of what he was only a moment ago. It was an unbelievable change!</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaak! Succubus Queen! A mere microbe dares to seduce me!? Kuaaaak!]</p><br/><p>Sweet Nightmare was the Floor Master skill I got from the First Dungeon\u2019s Succubus Queen! When used against a target with lower charm than the user, it stole half of the target\u2019s health and afflicted him with the \u2018critical charm\u2019 status effect! That giant possessed an overwhelmingly giant body and league of existence. I suspected that its charm might be higher than mine and didn\u2019t gamble, but Licorice had used this skill without hesitation and had succeeded!</p><br/><p>She was a Succubus Queen whose charm doubled against those of opposite sex, but to think she would come out victorious against such an opponent! Although I couldn\u2019t fully accept it, she soon resolved my doubt herself.</p><br/><p>[Kuhuk, a mere succubus\u2026!]</p><br/><p>\u201cMy clan\u2019s \u2018Blood Vengeance\u2019 only just started! Dear Husband, attack him now! The branding will restrain him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it! Lotte, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Understood!]</p><br/><p>Blood Vengeance. It seemed it was her clan\u2019s special ability, one that increased her power when members of her clan died! In that case, if I killed members of her clan when I first met her\u2026! Just thinking about it made my hair stand. Message noona\u2019s warning was surely justified!</p><br/><p>I gulped down a mouthful of saliva and charged towards the Lava Heart with Lotte who had returned to her wyvern form. Thanks to Licorice\u2019s secret skill, he was no longer as overbearing!</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaak! A mere human and succubus will never make me kneel! Lava Lance!]</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, continue charging!\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice shouted in a splitting voice and threw another magic circle. I could feel that she had expended her full strength, as the enormous magic circle drawn in the air flashed and shot through the air, erasing everything in its path.</p><br/><p>However, the moment the magic circle passed through me, I felt my strength surging. The giant spear of lava flying towards me didn\u2019t seem so scary anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood\u2026 I\u2019ll pour all the mana I have left!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hero, I will fly at full speed!]</p><br/><p>Lotte roared and flapped her wings more fiercely. A spear made of boiling lava descended towards us. However, before we were swallowed by the lava, the magic circle Licorice shot out clashed with it. Although it couldn\u2019t erase the spear, the lava was blocked by the magic circle and became unable to advance. Although cracks were appearing on the magic circle with uneasy sounds, the time it was buying me was more than enough!</p><br/><p>\u201cSacrifice! I will end this now!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am the indestructible knight, Lava Heart! The one who will offer the power of the Hero to the king shall be none other than\u2014]</p><br/><p>Before he could finish, the bullet like Chaotic Spear I launched pierced into his chest. Peika and Sharan both shouted as they fully released their elemental power, and I also poured all my mana into the attack. At the same time, I pushed Absolute Soul\u2019s power to its limit!</p><br/><p>\u201cJust die, you bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI will achieve our Blood Vengeance!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Mere microbes dare\u2026 Kuaaaak!]</p><br/><p>Licorice squeezed out her mana to its last drop, shooting an arrow into his mouth. The moment he flinched, I detonated the mana I doubled from the tip of my spear. Now was the time to finish him!</p><br/><p>[Kuuuuuuuk!]</p><br/><p>His scream caused the earth to fissure. Just the mana behind his scream caused great damage to everyone in the battlefield. It was truly made me shiver.</p><br/><p>However, that was only its death throe. I could feel it. Licorice\u2019s magic had weakened it by a level, and the spear attack I poured all my mana into had taken his life. At the same time his life came to an end, I could feel his lofty league crumbling down!</p><br/><p>[You\u2026 The king shall punish you! All of you! None will survive!]</p><br/><p>Even after losing his life, he cursed us. It was truly a colossal curse that had even taken form. Using his flickering flame of life as sacrifice, he was casting a death curse.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou coward! As if I\u2019d let you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t look down on Absolute Soul\u2019s power! I jumped up from Lotte\u2019s back and charged towards the ball of mana he vomited out. Before his eyes closed from death, I could see him making a final smile. What he had just done was undoubtedly to force me to make this move!</p><br/><p>Immediately afterwards, at the same time the Lava Heart completely died, his curse directly slammed into me. Then, a concise message rang out.</p><br/><p>[The power of Absolute Soul completely cancels the curse.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I had succeeded by a hair\u2019s breadth. Although I was fine, anyone else hit by the curse would have faced a dreadful fate. This self-proclaimed knight had no honor!</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, no! You can\u2019t face that curse alone\u2026 Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice flew towards me in a hurry. After seeing that I was completely fine, a look of confusion emerged on her face. When I smiled silently, she asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you fine after being hit by that thing? That was the essence of a curse containing that guy\u2019s last-remaining compressed life force\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the power of Absolute Soul. What, aren\u2019t you happy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m happy\u2026 Hic, I\u2019m glad, Dear Husband.\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice broke out into tears. Now that Lava Heart died, she could finally express her sorrow from the dead succubi. I smiled bitterly, embracing her and comforting her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry Licorice. Because of me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Dear Husband. I never thought it was possible to protect Dear Husband\u2019s world without losing anyone\u2026 Hic.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other girls would surely be okay with what I was doing. I silently comforted the crying Licorice. Then, I felt a sudden sense of emptiness. Wait\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cL-Lotte!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Lava Heart\u2019s lifeless body of lava containing nothing but boundless mana was falling down on Lotte! I called her hurriedly, but she stayed still facing the lava without thinking to dodge it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLotte!\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t lose her like this! When I was about to use Shadow Blink to go save her, a refreshing fanfare rang out in my ear.</p><br/><p>[Congratulations! After meeting extremely rare conditions, Dark Wing Lotte evolves into a higher species!]</p><br/>\n</div>"}

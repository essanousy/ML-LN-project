Overlord (3)</p><br/><p>\u201cLala~ Lalala~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, I think we\u2019re done with the monsters in this area.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere really aren\u2019t many\u2026 Plene, it\u2019s fine now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn!\u201d</p><br/><p>Plene, who was entertaining our ears and leading the monsters to their deaths, immediately stopped singing at my request. I sent out my elementals to shatter the petrified monsters as I looked around the area. Far in the distance, I could see a volcano shooting up into sky. Bulusan Volcano. As expected, it had grown to the point its original appearance was unrecognizable.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, can you feel it? The breath of the fierce beast that\u2019s hiding its presence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, now that we\u2019re this close, I can feel it clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis might be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lotte, who was listening to our conversation, spoke out with a bit of hesitation. I turned to face her and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you recognize it, Lotte?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave I not explained to Hero about them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep it short and simple. There no humans in the world I came from. Only existences that humans call monsters lived there. Of the five major countries, there was a country centered around a volcano with its king commanding a powerful army.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lotte slowly nodded her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t notice their special characteristic from any of the monsters we\u2019ve seen so I didn\u2019t say anything, but now that we\u2019ve come this close, I can feel their auras. Even among us monsters, we wondered how the monsters in the army he commanded were so strong. Today, I have the feeling I\u2019ll find out why\u2026 It\u2019s making me rather anxious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I heard about them too! Larva Immoral Leg, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lava Immortal Legion, idiot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI lived in an island so I don\u2019t know these things!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that she mentioned it, Plene also came from the same world as Lotte. Seeing Plene yelling at Lotte, I patted her head and calmed her down.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlene\u2019s doing fine, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is why idiots are too easy to handle\u2026 Anyways, Hero, if the king is really here, even Hero\u2019s guild members might not be safe. It\u2019ll be best for only a selected few of them to fight him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we get rid of this king, we only have to deal with four others? That sounds like a deal to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be nice if that were the case\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lotte still looked uneasy. With how confident she usually was and this being the first time she was showing this side of her, even I began to worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cLosing the world\u2019s power and being connected to Earth\u2026 It was certainly the five kings that commanded us. But I always thought that there was someone above them. I don\u2019t know why and I can\u2019t remember who it was, but I know someone was there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not too surprising. When there is huge gap between the leagues of two beings, it\u2019s possible that the being of lower league can\u2019t recognize the being of higher league even if they were facing each other directly. Even if the being of lower league recognized the being of higher league, he\u2019ll forget once he turns around. These powerful existences can cause mental pressure just by being in someone\u2019s memories. That\u2019s why beings of lower league forget about them, to protect their minds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve heard that.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied to Licorice\u2019s explanation with a bitter smile and loosened my body by stretching. This unknown leader was most likely the world\u2019s enemy, but the one I had to worry about currently was the one waiting for us in the volcano.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe already took care of the other areas. Once we clean up the Bulusan Volcano, we\u2019ll be done with the Philippines.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful, Dear Husband. The dungeon\u2019s power might not work on this guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a plan even if that\u2019s the case. Don\u2019t worry, we got this.\u201d</p><br/><p>After giving an encouraging talk, I opened the guild communication channel and reported.</p><br/><p>[We\u2019re done. How about you guys?]</p><br/><p>[We\u2019re almost done too!]</p><br/><p>[Just wait a bit, friend!]</p><br/><p>[Already? Your Evil Eyes are too overpowered. Hold on, we\u2019re finishing up too.]</p><br/><p>[Almost done. Meki, doing work.]</p><br/><p>[We encountered an SSS+ rank giant monster. Kang Yungoong is holding it back. If you\u2019re done, come help us, Kang Shin.]</p><br/><p>It seemed Walker was having trouble as he gave a serious report. I immediately gave Lotte a glance. Even as she grumbled, she returned to her wyvern form, and Plene, Licorice and I immediately jumped on her back.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go take care of the SSS+ rank first.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I can feel its aura. I\u2019ll hurry!]</p><br/><p>Lotte flapped her wings once, soaring up so quickly that the surrounding scenery seemed to warp. In just two minutes, we saw the giant monster Walker mentioned.</p><br/><p>It was indeed a giant monster, as a 20 meter tall giant was wreaking havoc with its giant sword. A peculiarity was that its entire body was made of fire. No, that\u2019s\u2026 lava? The moment Lotte caught sight of the giant, she growled.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s as I thought, Hero. It\u2019s him! The king is in the Philippines!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the Lava Immortal Legion?\u201d</p><br/><p>[To be exact, it\u2019s the Lava Immortal Legion\u2019s Destroyer, a soldier in the forefront of their assaults.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSoldier? Not a commander, but a solider?\u201d</p><br/><p>As if to say yes, Lotte accelerated. She really was ruthless. I immediately took out my Chaotic Spear. Although chaos flame was the strongest attribute I could wield, even the powerful chaos flame had a flaw. It was that it wasn\u2019t that effective against the fire attribute. So, for now\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone hold on! Lotte, accelerate!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Leave it to me!]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, this isn\u2019t bad, Dear Husband!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrab onto Lotte, not me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The ones fighting the Destroyer realized I had come and looked up at me. Although the Destroyer also found out, the vibration from the spear attack Father shot out caused a chunk of lava to fall off its leg.</p><br/><p>[Grrrrrruaaaa!]</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, Sharana!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un!]</p><br/><p>Above my spear, a whirlpool of ice raged. In just 0.5 seconds, it would reach the enemy. Carrying the ice energy strengthened by absorbing the wind Lotte raised, the Chaotic Spear shot through the air. The tip of the spear was shining in white.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat this!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>The moment Lotte crossed its body, the spear I thrust directly struck its shoulder. Lava and ice collided, causing steam to rise, while its shoulder burning in orange flames froze, melted, then fell off its body. In other words, I had cut off its arm.</p><br/><p>[Guaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, I could have defeated it by myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe honest and thank me, Kang Yungoong!\u201d</p><br/><p>[They absorb flames and regenerate themselves. Make sure you don\u2019t use any flames! Quick, destroy the arm that fell off!]</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dozens of ice spears appeared in the air and rained down on the giant\u2019s arm on the ground. In an instant, the arm completely melted away, and the enraged giant roared and swung its giant sword towards me with its remaining arm. Its sword burning with lava instantly elongated, breaking past Lotte\u2019s speed and attacking me. However\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI said your opponent is me!\u201d</p><br/><p>A sharp shockwave shot out from the tip of father\u2019s spear and struck the giant\u2019s body. Meanwhile, Lotte turned around to face the giant and charged towards it again. While the giant flinched from father\u2019s attack, I stabbed my spear inside its chest.</p><br/><p>[Grrruaaaa!]</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, everyone, use ice magic!\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice held Plene and shouted as she flew off from Lotte\u2019s back. The succubi all launched ice spheres into the air, while Licorice created an overwhelmingly bigger chunk of ice.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, go first!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it!\u201d</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve been waiting! I raised Ruyue\u2019s power to the peak and a freezing energy that seemed to freeze even its creator began to emanate from the Chaotic Spear. The giant roared and held up its giant lava sword, while father and Walker also charged towards the giant.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a spirited shout, I charged. The giant\u2019s giant sword instantly swept over me, but I ignored it and continued forward. Its terrifying heat immediately engulfed me.</p><br/><p>[Kugagagaga!]</p><br/><p>\u201cSon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t overreact, old man!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kugaga\u2026ga?]</p><br/><p>The giant stopped its mad laughter and tilted its head. It was to be expected. After all, it should be able to feel its flames subsiding.</p><br/><p>Felixes\u2019 Chaotic Cape fluttered and let out a radiant light. The giant\u2019s flames were certainly above the realm of SSS rank, making it impossible to absorb them. However, it was still possible to nullify them!</p><br/><p>I soon popped out of the giant sword and stabbed my spear covered in ice aura in its face. It was a Heroic Strike!</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did this become Revival\u2019s official chant!? Can we not use such a threatening chant!?\u201d</p><br/><p>After the giant made a thundering roar in pain, the succubi\u2019s ice magic descended.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe crime of trying to harm Dear Husband, pay for it with your life!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAttack! Freeze him!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuoooooo!]</p><br/><p>The earth trembled and the lava giant kneeled with its upper body frozen. Without hesitation, I shot an aura wave containing a compressed snowstorm and exploded its head.</p><br/><p>Having lost the control center, the lava forming the giant\u2019s body fell and scattered. The succubi then shot out ice arrows and thoroughly destroyed the lava. There was no longer any sign that the lava giant had existed. After confirming that its presence disappeared, I took back the spear I was still aiming towards it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDone.\u201d</p><br/><p>[As expected of Hero\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! Amazing, Dear Husband!\u201d</p><br/><p>I sighed and murmured, while Lotte murmured in amazement. I would have liked the succubi to express themselves like Lotte, but it seemed they were deeply touched as they were all running towards me. I immediately looked for Licorice.</p><br/><p>\u201cLicorice, do something about them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband is so cool!\u201d</p><br/><p>[She\u2019s their leader!]</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, they share their emotions!\u201d</p><br/><p>Could there be anyone more able yet tiring!?</p><br/><p>After restraining the succubi, I smacked Licorice\u2019s head and shared the information Lotte told me with father and Walker. After listening to Lotte\u2019s explanation, even father made a slightly tired expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean there are a lot more of these guys?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. The fact that they\u2019re here means that the king\u2019s army has moved. They will start their advance soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAdvance? Invading the enemy\u2019s territory and gathering up an army. It\u2019s a rather human method.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look down on them because they\u2019re monsters.</p><br/><p>Lotte, who was back in her human form, retorted mockingly at Walker.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re a race that can use their heads like humans. If you look down on them, you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I know that. I\u2019ve met intelligent monsters in the dungeon too.\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked Lotte to return to her wyvern form. It was time to meet up with the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe know their identity, so we don\u2019t need to hesitate. We\u2019re going to go defeat this king. All of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou say that, but I bet you\u2019re going to take the last hit again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow else would I act like a guild master?\u201d</p><br/><p>I rebutted Walker while he and father got on Lotte\u2019s back. The succubi also turned into bats and flew up.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019re meeting up.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Shin, a scary giant monster appeared! Hiing, my shadows aren\u2019t working well!]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Let\u2019s go help the others first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when I was trying to act cool\u2026 Ye-Eun, you did this on purpose!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

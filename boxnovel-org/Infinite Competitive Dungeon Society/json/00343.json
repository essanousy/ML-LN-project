Demon Lord (6)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>No one had the time nor the ease of mind to say a word.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, every single demon under the mirror\u2019s light disappeared into dust. In just an instant, ten percent of the continent had been annihilated.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026 That took a toll.\u201d</p><br/><p>I summoned Sharana and calmed the blowing sandstorm. Absorbing the demons\u2019 mana, I replenished my own. As I swallowed an entire dragon whole, I wouldn\u2019t need to worry about running out of mana, but it was still good to replenish my mana when I could.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing hundreds of thousands of demons dying in the blink of an eye, Plene clapped in excitement. I couldn\u2019t tell whether she was innocent or ignorant.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Shin, is there anything for me to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Plene looked around the empty field and tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour power is very important. You can draw out the demons that are hiding.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true but\u2026 I\u2019m weak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Plene replied with a sullen face. While she was strong in her own way, she was the weak one compared to Lotte or Licorice. She simply wasn\u2019t a competition starting from her mana pool.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, your ability is just as important as Lotte\u2019s or Licorice\u2019s. It\u2019s exactly what I need now too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill I be able to do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can if I help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Plene widened her eyes. I placed a hand on Plene\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cSing, Plene. Just think about bringing all demons here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cU, Un! I\u2019ll try! I feel like I can do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>As she had an obedient personality, she immediately began to sing when I ordered her. At that moment, my horns shone with a fierce light. Plene continued to sing as though she was oblivious. Meanwhile, her song was spreading out faster and wider.</p><br/><p>It took less than ten minutes for a change to occur.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cM-Moon\u2026 Giant moon\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>I could hear the voices of demons from far, far away. Soon, I could see a sandstorm blowing in the horizon.</p><br/><p>Demons specializing in movement techniques were the first to enter my sight, while demons that could fly were the next to shoot towards us in lightning speed.</p><br/><p>However, what they faced was nothing but the end.</p><br/><p>The ones that managed to let out a scream were the powerful ones that could resist my charm. But most others simply turned to dust the moment they came under the effect of the mirror. Even with other demons dying in front of them, demons continued to flock towards us like how moths flocked to a flame. They were already unable to think clearly.</p><br/><p>As she continued to sing, Plene widened her eyes as though she couldn\u2019t believe what she was seeing. When she looked at me disbelievingly, I gave her a smile and gestured her to go on. The golden light my horns were emitting were getting stronger and stronger.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m letting you borrow my charm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLalala~!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Amazing!\u2019 She seemed to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t worry about anything and continue singing. It shouldn\u2019t take longer than an hour.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLalalala~!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018This much is a piece of cake!\u2019 She seemed to say. It was my one-sided interpretation, but that was probably okay.</p><br/><p>As time passed, more and more demons flocked towards us before turning to dust. Consequently, a large amount of mana began to fill the area. I continued to absorb them as I enlarged the size of the mirror.</p><br/><p>Eventually, the mirror became too big to be captured in my sight, and the amplified power of my eyes seemed to turn even the flow of air slow.</p><br/><p>Of course, as Plene\u2019s song wasn\u2019t targeted by my Evil Eyes, I didn\u2019t need to worry about the song spreading slower. Plene\u2019s song spread out as if to cover the entire continent. It would have been nice to close my eyes and appreciate her beautiful voice, but sadly, I had to keep my eyes open to use the Evil Eyes\u2019 power. With a smirk, I added more power to the mirror.</p><br/><p>\u201cDortu, let\u2019s wrap it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. Understood.]</p><br/><p>The giant mirror rumbled. A crack ran down its center, and the mirror began to split. Uncountably many mirror fragments were created, which then quickly flew to their position as though to form a constellation.</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Plene, who finished singing, looked up at the sparkling mirror fragments in awe. I spoke as I nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t look that way to the demons.\u201d</p><br/><p>A giant mirror might look better on the surface, but many smaller mirrors were actually better for spreading the Evil Eyes\u2019 power.</p><br/><p>In just a few minutes, the galaxy of mirror fragments killed the continent\u2019s remaining demons.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell done, Plene. We\u2019re done now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRelly? Hehe, that\u2019s great! I wish my charm would grow too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will in the future. Anyways, let\u2019s take care of one last thing and go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Plene tilted her head adorably, but I only made a small smile in reply.</p><br/><p>However, not long afterwards, a man appeared in the air. A demon with a long horn. The magic power in his body was undoubtedly of the highest class.</p><br/><p>Just like the Army Commander I faced on Earth, this demon was most likely the strongest demon in this continent apart from the Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>He gritted his teeth, and I made a sly smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so mad. You were just weaker than me, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, I immediately set out when I heard the news from the Demon Lord\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you see, that giant mirror didn\u2019t just carry my Evil Eyes\u2019 power.\u201d </p><br/><p>Magic power began to surge from the demon\u2019s body. He spread open his bat-like wings and shouted furiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat giant mirror, it was a magic circle to trick me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t just you. It was just a little illusion magic to prevent you and other demons who could withstand my Evil Eyes from finding me.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I broke the giant mirror, the illusion magic naturally disappeared. I assumed there would be at least five demons who survived, but it seemed the enraged demon in front of me was the only one who could withstand my Evil Eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cCausing a mess here won\u2019t change anything! Earth will be conquered!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut did you know that all the demons that came to Earth have been wiped out?\u201d</p><br/><p>I waved my hand in the air. The mirror fragments filling up the sky moved along the path of my hand.</p><br/><p>It was as if I was drawing the night sky, almost like a god.</p><br/><p>Seeing that, I spoke in a leisure way.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just you and the Demon Lord now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You devil\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh please.\u201d</p><br/><p>I snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys were the ones who came after us first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think we\u2019re different!? No! Just because we had our world\u2019s power taken away, you called us invaders!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you started to look for other worlds after conquering Luka continent. Luka continent\u2019s world power\u2026 It didn\u2019t disappear, right? The Demon Lord still has it, doesn\u2019t he? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going to deny it, when I know new demons have been born.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t answer. I shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut still, I\u2019ll admit that you guys were the same in the beginning. But you got a twisted start. I\u2019ll correct it now, so something like that won\u2019t happen again. Of course, you\u2019ll still die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArrogant\u2026! You\u2019ll correct it? That\u2019s what the Demon Lord seeks to do! To claim everything and correct the twisted worlds! You speak just like the Demon Lord!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Demon Lord is wrong, and I\u2019m different than him.\u201d</p><br/><p>I retorted coldly. Comparing me with the Demon Lord? Absurd.</p><br/><p>This demon was ignorant. Of course, being ignorant wasn\u2019t a sin. He might not have had the chance to find out. It wasn\u2019t right to fault him for that.</p><br/><p>However, it also wasn\u2019t deserving of praise. As I didn\u2019t plan on explaining everything to him, I prepared myself to hear his final words.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t the Demon Lord have a weakness or something? You know, don\u2019t villains betray their leaders when they\u2019re about to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKill me. I will curse you with all my power! You will carry a curse that not even the Demon Lord can shake off! You will never succeed! This nightmare that reigns over us will continue infinitely without end!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he shouted at the top of his lungs, blood was pouring down from his orifices. It seemed he really was casting some sort of a curse. However, I simply snorted at the grotesque sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry to tell you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I pointed my index finger towards him. The mirror fragments all shot towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m immune to curses.\u201d</p><br/><p>He widened his eyes. In the next moment, he was swallowed by the flood of metal.</p><br/><p>Just a few seconds later, the mirror fragments returned to their position following the flickering of my finger. Nothing remained in the demon\u2019s place, and only the small number of bloodied fragments served as a proof that he ever lived.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Plene. Let\u2019s go back. We\u2019re done now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWooow, you\u2019re amazing, Shin! So cool!\u201d</p><br/><p>Plene\u2019s sparkly eyes lit up even more. I patted her head, as I told myself to not let Ina see such a sight.</p><br/><p>When I returned to Earth, everything was still the way it was. Truthfully, I was worried that another fifty percent of humanity might have been wiped out, but thankfully, it was just my imagination.</p><br/><p>That said, it seemed the monster continent really attacked. I could tell what happened when I saw the golden spear in Kain\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust a light exercise.\u201d</p><br/><p>If he had to take out a god\u2019s power, it had to be an intense exercise. It seemed Kain liked to act aloof. Thinking he wasn\u2019t a bad person, I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it over?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep. Earth will meet its own outcome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kain spoke in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo start now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before I noticed, other guild members flew over. No one was in the dungeon.</p><br/><p>Hwaya, Daisy, Lebuik, Father, Ye-Eun, Ren, Ludia, Shuna, Ina, Yua, Sumire, Walker, Michel, Ilayda\u2026 Other than Sophie, who couldn\u2019t participate in fights because of her pregnancy, Leon, who was given an important task, and Licorice and Lotte who were helping Leon, everyone was present.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood work everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>I started off in a casual tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, everything will end. Celebration can wait until it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You\u2019re not taking everyone, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun asked carefully. I nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t break the Demon Lord\u2019s dungeon, so only me and three others will go in. Magicians whose magic power is lower than the Demon Lord won\u2019t be effective against him, so I\u2019ll take those who can fight in close range. First, Father.\u201d</p><br/><p>Including the Demon Lord, demons had a higher affinity to magical combat than physical combat. Hwaya and Ina were catastrophic to other demons, but their power shouldn\u2019t be effective against the Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>Hearing my words, Father raised his spear happily.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re respecting your father.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only father who\u2019d think that way when being taken to such a dangerous place. Next, Ye-Eun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun had a god\u2019s true name. I couldn\u2019t leave her out. Fighting the Demon Lord. In front of such dangerous task, Ye-Eun\u2019s eyes only reflected enthusiasm. She couldn\u2019t be more reliable.</p><br/><p>\u201cFinally, Sumire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Shin-nim! I\u2019ll do my best!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sumire shouted valiantly. Kain looked at me as though he couldn\u2019t understand what I was thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one too many. I don\u2019t think that dungeon will allow more than three people to go in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI put my hands on it before. When those chains come off, the gap in the dungeon will widen slightly. It\u2019ll be enough for four people to go in. Though, you won\u2019t be able to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, what a shame. I would have liked to see his face.\u201d</p><br/><p>I smiled at Kain\u2019s leisurely reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have something to do too. I\u2019ll leave it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, next\u2026</p><br/><p>I looked up at the sky. It was time. The chains binding the dungeon blew off, and the darkness trapped within began to fill up the sky.</p><br/><p>The sky turned black.</p><br/><p>Under the artificial sky without a single stream of light, the dungeon opened its mouth as though to swallow more challengers.</p><br/><p>From inside, I could still hear the screams of despair and smell the scent of blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, are you ready?\u201d</p><br/><p>Holding a three meter long spear, Father turned towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I retorted lightly. I needlessly inspected my equipment.</p><br/><p>Steel was covering my body as always. In my hand was the platinum spear that could pierce through anything, one that wouldn\u2019t lose to a god\u2019s divine armament.</p><br/><p>Also.</p><br/><p>\u201cSharana, Ruyue, Peika, Dortu.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m ready, Master!]</p><br/><p>[Me too, me too! I\u2019m ready to show off my power!]</p><br/><p>[Huhu, with Master\u2019s power, such a boring dungeon will be a piece of cake.]</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. Following Master\u2019s command.]</p><br/><p>With them by my side, I wasn\u2019t afraid of anything. Thinking that to myself, I gave them a confident smile. They also answered with a bright smile.</p><br/><p>I can do it.</p><br/><p>An abundant confidence filled me up.</p><br/><p>I pointed my spear at the entrance of the dungeon.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going in!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

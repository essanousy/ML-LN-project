Avarice Devours Everything (7)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Chapter 120. Avarice Devours Everything (7)</p><br/><p>After fighting the Demon Army\u2019s elites, we had lost many people. Including me, there were 9 Dimensional Mercenaries left, but 21 knights had died and 7 of the surviving ones had received grave injuries preventing them from continuing. There were also only 4 magicians left. With 12 knights, 4 magicians, Bellode, and Ludia, there were 27 people left. If there was anything to be relieved about, it was that most of the knights and magicians were First Dungeon explorers.</p><br/><p>That said, we still had a chance. In fact, with the Army Commander defeated, we would be able to rescue Shina before the Demon Army could reorganize themselves. As such, there was still some fighting spirit left in everyone.</p><br/><p>However, the fact that the Demon Lord couldn\u2019t move got on my mind. Could he really not move? In that case, couldn\u2019t we kill him with our strength? Was the Demon Lord really heavily injured from the Hero?</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no choice but to go on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia nodded her head at my words. Right, we had no other choice but to go on. Even though we knew there was a spy within the knights or the magicians, we couldn\u2019t say we would separate, as that would only split up our strengths. As I could at least trust the Dimensional Mercenaries, I wanted to complete the mission with their cooperation. However, it wouldn\u2019t be so easy.</p><br/><p>Something had to be done. I couldn\u2019t ignore Peruta\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Ludia, we can\u2019t just keep going like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Didn\u2019t you just say it was okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just want to get an insurance. Will you hear me out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yeah?\u201d</p><br/><p>Around dinner time, Bellode\u2019s words made us tense up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll arrive soon. They must be planning on staying here for the night. They set up a temporary camp and are resting. Tonight\u2019s our chance\u2026 We won\u2019t be able to stop clashing. We will make a feint operation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sounds interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>One team to sneak into their camp and save Shina and the explorers that turned into stone. One team to attack from the front and draw attention to themselves. There was also a team to pretend to be sneaky to disperse the demons\u2019 suspicions.</p><br/><p>Bellode, me, the summoner, and a magician from Shina\u2019s team, who had the ability to detect her party members\u2019 locations, joined the rescue team. Three knights, two magicians, and two mercenaries joined the secondary covert team, and the rest joined the frontal assault team.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon bastards, we\u2019ve come to take your heads!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon Soldiers, stop running away like cowards and come fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>Burning the monsters on guard magnificently, we set our plan into motion. The magician first cast stealth magic on all of the covert teams.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful. Although the magic erases your presence, smell, and appearance, if demons and monsters lay their eyes on you, they will soon discover you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you mean we have to kill them quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>I pushed back my hair and nodded. For the record, the metallic egg was in Fairy Garden with Ruyue. For some reason, it wouldn\u2019t go into my inventory!</p><br/><p>It could be because it was alive, but at first, when it didn\u2019t go into the inventory, I was afraid I might need to hold onto it the entire time. Thankfully, Ruyue was able to take it to Fairy Garden. Although Peika said it was better for me to hold onto it, I couldn\u2019t do so in the middle of such a dangerous operation, so I left it to Ruyue\u2019s care.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be starting now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The secondary covert team went in a bit earlier than us, the main covert team. Soon, we also sneaked in. Dozens of tents and monsters passed by us. Putting our trust in the magician\u2019s ability, we walked forward. The magician in question was on Bellode\u2019s back. She was continuously detecting Shina\u2019s location and whispering her position to Bellode. However, her cheeks were red. Was she flirting in the middle of the operation!?</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you feel the Demon Lord\u2019s presence?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the center-most area. He\u2019s tightly guarded too, but even in all the ruckus, he\u2019s not moving.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Shina?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that the explorers that turned to stone didn\u2019t need to be placed near the Demon Lord. Although there are quite a lot of personnel on guard, we should be able to save them without much trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen we\u2019re escaping, we can let them ride on my wyvern. But there\u2019s still one problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>The summoner spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a way to turn them back from stone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can think about that later. We have to save them first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bellode save with a stiff voice. The summoner seemed to be convinced by the urgency in his voice as he shrugged.</p><br/><p>Although I had a plan in mind, I didn\u2019t say anything. If things didn\u2019t work out, I would feel bad. After finishing our discussion, we quickly walked forward. Although my clothes were uncomfortable, I endured it and followed behind Bellode.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuman\u2026 smell?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen is the Army Commander-nim coming back?\u201d</p><br/><p>More and more monsters and demons were in the pathway. My body shook from the tension during battle. Although we could kill these guys as we advanced\u2026 For now, I had to hold myself back as saving Shina was our priority. Of course, fights did break out from time to time.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u2019</p><br/><p>When we met demons or monsters in narrows pathways, we had to hastily take care of them and move on. The summoner was of great help, as his main class was archer. He consecutively shot out arrows with bountiful aura, which killed the demons quickly. It seemed to be a skill of his. It was truly quick and precise.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like the other teams are doing well.\u201d</p><br/><p>We heard explosions and screams from parts of the military camp. Hoping for the other team\u2019s safety, we hastened our steps. Soon, we reached the tent where Shina and the other explorers were imprisoned. As expected, there were dozens of demons guarding the place. It seemed they planned to use them as hostages in their fight against the empire.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs we planned, I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cK-Kuhum\u2026 Gladly.\u201d</p><br/><p>I walked up confidently. My appearance changed with each step. My white skin turned into black, tough and muscled skin, while horns shot out from my head and my hair was dyed black. Seeing me walk up so confidently, the demons became flustered.</p><br/><p>\u201cA-Army Commander-nim!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArmy Commander-nim, do you need something? We haven\u2019t received any word that you\u2019d be visiting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? I definitely sent a message.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026! We haven\u2019t heard that you\u2019ve come back yet. Did you bring the crown princess back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat bitch hid. We\u2019ll need to use the hostages more aggressively.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArmy Commander-nim, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I reached out and grabbed the head of the demon that talked back to me.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Do you want to taste the honor of becoming my blood and flesh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No, sir!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, Shatuno, am the absolute ruler under His Highness, the Demon Lord. You dare to talk back to me? You\u2019ve gotten bolder!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, sir!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must have heard that we have intruders! I will take care of the hostages from now. You guys focus on guarding His Highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d</p><br/><p>The demons all bowed and disappeared beyond the pathway. I snorted and thought.</p><br/><p>\u2018This skill, it can even alter my way of talking!\u2019</p><br/><p>It said I would absolutely not get discovered, but to think it would have such effect! I thought I could call my plan a success if I could just trick them for this one moment, but I didn\u2019t think it would work so well. God bless Zeus!</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought that damned demon came back to life.\u201d</p><br/><p>After confirming that the demons\u2019 presence disappeared completely, I returned to my allies. Giving them a grin, I went back to the appearance I had before. Right. I had been using Sky God\u2019s Play.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, the next part worries me a bit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>At my question, Bellode couldn\u2019t continue and shut his mouth. However, his eyes clearly showed unhappiness. As it was none of my business, I ignored it and entered the tent with them.</p><br/><p>She was there. Shina, who had been petrified, was there! Happily yelling inwardly, I urged everyone on.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of time. We\u2019re going to confirm that everyone\u2019s here and escape!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight! Eight people, including Shina-nim. They\u2019re all here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey will notice us leaving, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just keep going! It won\u2019t be possible to secretly leave with them anyways! Hurry up and put them on!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although we tricked the demons away, it won\u2019t be long until they found out. The summoner summoned his wyvern and fixed the petrified explorers on. As they were alive, they wouldn\u2019t enter the inventory.</p><br/><p>As such, we had to sweat to get them out of here. It would be nice if I could just use Return and bring them to Earth with me, but as they belonged to the Luka continent, that wasn\u2019t possible. It was quite irritating.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 in my dream, I remembered that I returned to Earth with Ludia. How did my dream self do that\u2026?</p><br/><p>While we were putting the petrified explorers on the wyvern, the magician calmly shot up a flare. It tore the tent and rose up high into the sky, signifying that we had successfully rescued the explorers.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet on! You too, newbie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming even if you don\u2019t urge me!\u201d</p><br/><p>I held Shina in my embrace and got on the wyvern last. The wyvern breathed out fire, burning everything in its path as it flapped its huge wings.</p><br/><p>\u201cWvyern!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA wyvern appeared inside the camp!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, there were intruders here too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Uproar began to ring out from all sides. We could see demons running toward us, holding their weapons or tails.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, they took the hostages!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShoot them down!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFools, be careful when you shoot!\u2019</p><br/><p>The wyvern soared into the sky. However, the wyvern was hit by two of the demons\u2019 magic attacks, causing it to scream.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose sons of bitches!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown princess! The crown princess is on it!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed they were focusing on us more than we thought. In an instant, dozens of demons flocked toward us, confusing us. The summoner took out his bow, while the magician shot magic and Bellode shot aura blades with his sword. Even so, it was not enough to deal with all the demons.</p><br/><p>\u201cWyvern, quicker!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, they put up a barrier of mana! It\u2019s going to take time to break through it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to buy time\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The summoner could not help, as he was busy putting in mana into his wyvern to break through the barrier. The magician was also focused on breaking the barrier. Damn, a magical device like this wasn\u2019t there when we sneaked in!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like a barrier that you can activate once you know there are intruders. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s out of our expectations, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too strong! Demons usually don\u2019t cast barriers like this\u2026 At this rate, we\u2019ll be shot down!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu, damned spies. I have to take care of this too?\u201d</p><br/><p>I sighed and took out Gluttony Spear from my inventory. Then, I looked at Shina in my embrace and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cSummon Caduceus. Sky God\u2019s Rage!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You summoned Caduceus. All physical abilities have been enhanced. Two snakes have opened their eyes. You may only use the power of one of them.]</p><br/><p>[Sky God\u2019s Rage has been imbued into the weapon in your hand. You can deliver a single powerful blow, or distribute the power in multiple attacks.]</p><br/><p>In my hand not holding the spear, particles of light began to gather. Like a snake crawling up a tree, two rays of light crawled up my arm in a spiral and a pair of wings grew on my back. At the same time, the Gluttony Spear let out a radiant light and transformed to a golden lightning bolt. My allies looking at me opened their eyes widely.</p><br/><p>\u201cNewbie, you\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you tell anyone, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>With words that even I found arrogant, I tightened my grip on the lightning bolt and thrust it towards the barrier blocking us.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>\u201cAgain!\u201d</p><br/><p>CRACK!</p><br/><p>With just two hits, an explosive crack rang out. With a satisfied smile, I shot out the lightning bolt again. The sound I was expecting was released. The sound of hundreds of windows shattering rang out. Seeing the demons\u2019 shocked faces below satisfied me even more.</p><br/><p>\u201cWvyern, go!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Guaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, why is he listening to her\u2026 him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let them escape!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone report to the Demon Lord-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCapture the other intruders!\u201d</p><br/><p>While still sending magic toward us, demons were scattering. I shot my lightning bolt, which still had some power remaining, at them. Although I wanted to throw the spear, retrieving it would be difficult, so I simply sent the lightning energy in my spear flying. A few of the demons turned into ash and disappeared. At the same time, the energy imbued by Sky God\u2019s Rage had completely disappeared from the spear. Feeling refreshed, I put the spear back into my inventory.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s run now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sure are scary\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The wyvern soared through the sky. Although many of the Demon Army\u2019s monsters flew in the sky, the others were more than capable of dealing with them. After all, they were all First Dungeon explorers that were at least level 70.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the other teams? Have you tried messaging them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo of the Dimensional Mercenaries escaped to the dungeon. Four knights and two magicians died. The rest managed to escape the camp.\u201d</p><br/><p>The summoner replied, looking more relaxed as he controlled his wyvern. The wyvern continued to breathe out fire at the flying monsters. No matter how I thought about it, his wyvern was unusually strong.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, I stretched my neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe petrified people are all tied well, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOther than the princess in your hand, then yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Then should we do it now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d With that, I stretched my neck again. Then, I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You used Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry! All party members are cleansed of negative status effects. All party members\u2019 attack power increases by 50 percent for the duration. All party members become super-armored, unfazed by enemy attacks.]</p><br/><p>Startled by my shouting, the wyvern screamed and flapped its wings violently. The others were also surprised by my shouting and turned my way to say something, only to get shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm? Mmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shina, who was in my arms, regained her normal complexion. Not only her, but all the petrified explorers tied to the wyvern snapped out of their status effects.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What did you\u2026 No, nevermind. Excuse me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhuhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if I told you guys, there\u2019s nothing you can do.\u2019 I murmured inwardly. The petrification was a type of status effect. It could be canceled with Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry. I was now fully ready to agree that Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry was the world\u2019s most cheaty skill.</p><br/><p>Smiling brightly, I checked Shina\u2019s state. She was still wearing the armor she wore during the battle. With her eyes open, she was looking at me with surprised eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cShina, are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Unni? You came to save me? Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shina\u2019s eyes opened widely. Then, looking at me, who was taking Ludia\u2019s appearance, she laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo unni really\u2026 Huhu. Thanks, unni.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was lost for words at her incredibly beautiful smile. Drawn by her smile, I also smiled. Shina\u2019s next action was like flowing water.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd\u2026 good bye.\u201d</p><br/><p>She took out a sword. The sword\u2019s body, the sword\u2019s guard, and the sword\u2019s pommel were all emanating an eerie black aura. Then, she stabbed it in my stomach.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>1. I wonder if there are any readers who didn\u2019t realize that Shin was disguising himself as Ludia. Probably not, right? With all the hints I gave\u2026</p><br/><p>2. It seems like not a lot of people thought Shina was a traitor. Someone actually guessed it from what Peruta said in the last chapter. I got frightened and replied mysteriously. I don\u2019t know if it worked\u2026</p><br/><p>By the way, there were many hints. Like the emperor telling him not to trust anyone besides Ludia and Bellode; the fact that Shina, who should\u2019ve been faster than Ludia, stood still and got petrified while Ludia escaped (though Ludia thought that it was because she was just faster T.T); or as the last chapter said, Peruta telling Shin not to trust anyone\u2026</p><br/><p>Stupid Shina, you got tricked\u2026 does she still look like your sister\u2026?</p><br/><p>Now, why was Shin taking Ludia\u2019s appearance!? Why did he hold Shina in his embrace, fully knowing that something was wrong with Shina? Did he want to embrace a girl even if it cost him his life!? The answer will come out in the next chapter.</p><br/><p>PS \u2013 Shin\u2019s cape has the effect of blocking ambush attacks three times per day. It will be explained in the beginning of next chapter, but he cannot use his equipment skills when he\u2019s using Sky God\u2019s Play, so that\u2019s why he couldn\u2019t block her attack. Of course, even if he could use the effect, the difference in the equipment\u2019s power wouldn\u2019t make that possible.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Sure, give me longer chapters Toika, I love it\u2026 (tears)</p><br/><p>On the other hand, if Shin\u2019s changed to Ludia, can he feel the\u2026 you know\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

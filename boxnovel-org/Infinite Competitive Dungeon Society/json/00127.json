Team Revival (1)</p><br/><p>My first impression of Antelope Canyon was as such.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this the Grand Canyon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, think about Windermere Lake. They say higher ranked dungeons go through greater terraforming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s majestic\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? Aren\u2019t all canyons this big?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Antelope Canyon was known for its narrow passageways, formed by the erosion of sandstone, and the beam of light that shined down from above.</p><br/><p>However, the current Antelope Canyon was wide enough to play a game of soccer, and its beautiful passageway had taken a strange formation. It wouldn\u2019t be weird if a golem popped out of it. Furthermore, it was incredibly large. I couldn\u2019t tell where the canyon ended. Though, perhaps the fact that it was currnetly night had something to do with it.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, who are they?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya Mastifor and Thunder Knight. They\u2019re famous. They\u2019re the ones who cleared Britain\u2019s Field Dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot even America can ignore them. I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d come here though.\u201d</p><br/><p>A few ability users were grouped in front of a car at the entrance of the canyon. I could clearly hear their whispers. It was the power of 300,000 gold.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are two more girls though. They\u2019re both wearing masks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThunder Knight\u2019s wearing a mask too. They\u2019re probably his friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not alone? I\u2019m getting more curious as to who he is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey could be Flame Witch\u2019s subordinate. There is a rumor that Thunder Knight only appeared at Windermere because he was the Flame Witch\u2019s subordinate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, I\u2019ll go burn those idiots.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust let them talk. We don\u2019t need to care about weaklings like them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unhappy with the ability users whispering to themselves, Hwaya created flames on her palm, but I calmed her down. I was looking for something else. A few months had passed since the Field Dungeon had been created. Just like at Graveyard Over the Lake, there were several buildings above the canyon, ruining its natural scenery. I suspected that the person waiting for me was in one of those buildings.</p><br/><p>As expected, not long after we arrived, a voice rang out in my head.</p><br/><p>[You came. I\u2019m happy. If it\u2019s okay, can we meet right away?]</p><br/><p>It was the voice of a young and frail girl. I remembered from her letter that she could use telepathy. However, I didn\u2019t know how to respond to her.</p><br/><p>[If it\u2019s okay, nod your head once.]</p><br/><p>I nodded my head. She answered immediately.</p><br/><p>[Come inside your lodging. Room 1301, I\u2019ll be waiting there.]</p><br/><p>With that, the telepathy cut off. I led my companions looking at me curiously to the lodging, while I gave them an explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been contacted by a telepathy. You guys didn\u2019t hear anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it like the messaging system between dungeon explorers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit different. The messages ring in my ear, but this one rings in my head.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUk, that doesn\u2019t sound comfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no elevator in the building. In other words, we had to climb the stairs to the 13th floor. Since Ludia refused to unlink our arms, it was a bit uncomfortable, but Hwaya, who was wearing a long dress unsuitable for climbing stairs, seemed more irritated.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, I don\u2019t like this girl\u2026! Telling my friend to come and go as she wants, and even making me climb these stairs\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, can you let go? It\u2019s hard to walk up the stairs like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFour blind spots, seventeen points\u2026 If I install traps here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When I realized, Ye-Eun was analyzing the building and murmuring like some bomb expert. \u2018Damn, I want to pretend not to know these people!\u2019 Feeling the people\u2019s gazes piercing me every floor we went to, I blamed the heavens.</p><br/><p>When we arrived on the 13th floor, it was extremely quiet, unlike the floors we passed through. There was no one walking around, and the hallway even looked different. Hwaya tilted her head and looked back at the stairs to the 12th floor. Then, she clapped once with a bright expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a barrier. Anti-recognition barrier. A kind of conditional barrier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but can you explain it in a language I can understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a barrier that prevents people that don\u2019t know about the 13th floor from reaching the 13th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was truly a simple, yet extraordinary, barrier. Ye-Eun and I were only slightly surprised, but Ludia looked shocked as she asked Hwaya.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a high-rank magic is being used like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHigh-rank? It\u2019s not that hard in the modern magic system.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuk\u2026.!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without my knowledge, Ludia\u2019s losses were increasing. With a bitter smile, I knocked on room 1301 with them.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s open, Hero-nim. Come in.]</p><br/><p>Why was she using telepathy when we were within audible range? I opened the door. A large living room and, beyond the window, the Antelope Canyon transformed into a large canyon caught our eyes. We also saw several wyverns flying through the night sky and the ability users fighting against them.</p><br/><p>At the same time, we saw a little girl sitting on a chair.</p><br/><p>[Nice to meet you, Hero-nim and Hero-nim\u2019s companions.]</p><br/><p>The girl got up and bowed respectfully.</p><br/><p>[I am Ciara Kenex. You can call me Ciara.]</p><br/><p>With her introduction, I could immediately tell why she couldn\u2019t move her body easily. I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a kid\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m 12 years old this year. I\u2019m just a bit of a late bloomer.]</p><br/><p>\u201cA 12 year old is still a kid, you know\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun murmured in shock. Ludia and Hwaya also had surprised expressions. As for me, I noticed something else the moment I saw her.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Can you not see?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I was born blind. At first, I couldn\u2019t hear or talk, but thankfully, my ears opened up as I grew.]</p><br/><p>Even as she greeted us, she had her eyes closed. I asked because of it, but I didn\u2019t think I would actually be correct. Was that why she was talking to us in telepathy? Thankfully, we could all hear her through telepathy. She could likely see us through an ability similar to her telepathy.</p><br/><p>As for her appearance, she was quite cute. It was a bit different than Koreans\u2019 black hair, but her charming black hair reached her waist in curls. With her small frame and white skin, she really looked like a doll.</p><br/><p>Hwaya made a look of pity at Ciara\u2019s words, but soon erased it. She likely thought it was rude. As if to erase the thought from her mind, Hwaya asked quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, since you called Shin here, can you tell us why Shin is the Hero? I\u2019m quite curious too.\u201d</p><br/><p>I already explained to Hwaya and Ye-Eun in the plane. Although they made fun of me at first, Ludia got mad and told them about her continent. After that, Hwaya and Ye-Eun were more worried than me. I knew how annoying and dangerous being a Hero was, but it seemed like someone else\u2019s problem until they began to make a big deal about it. As a result, even I felt a bit odd.</p><br/><p>[Hero-nim, are they\u2026?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, you can trust them. Also, don\u2019t call me Hero-nim. Call me Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Understood, Shin-nim. Then, I\u2019ll start from the beginning. From the moment I first awakened. It was 3 years ago...]</p><br/><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya immediately interrupted her.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo Moon only happened a year and two months ago. 3 years? That\u2019s impossible!\u201d</p><br/><p>[But I awakened 3 years ago.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun and I, who understood what she meant a bit late, were also shocked. What was she saying? She awakened before Two Moon? 2 years at that! Although Hwaya wanted to say something, I reached out and stopped her. I believed Ciara would explain.</p><br/><p>She also said she awakened from a premonition-like dream. She had come of age, and was standing next to me. There were also countless other people and giant enemies. In her dream, she taught people when and in what size monsters would appear, and how strong they would be. Resistance against the monsters were centered around her.</p><br/><p>[Perhaps because my ability is still lacking, but its range is only wide enough to cover a city.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an amazing ability, especially in this day and age, where even satellites are being shot down by monsters\u2019 attacks. If your ability can really grow to how it was in your dream\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hero-nim was the strongest and most radiant among them.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to flatter me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[After that dream, I became more sensitive to human presence. I could feel their hostility towards me, how strong they were, how much potential they had\u2026 Of course, before Two Moon, there were no monsters in this world and no ability users, so it wasn\u2019t that useful.]</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t it. The day after she awakened her ability, she once again dreamt several hundred dreams.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Wait. Several hundred?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes. In my dreams, I saw countless particles of light. There were countless number of oddities.]</p><br/><p>\u201cCountless oddities\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>[The dream continued. For 2 years, I saw and experienced hundreds of thousands of abilities. Worlds and environments other than Earth. They fought each other, demons, invaders, alien insects, bugs that lived in the mind, monsters that lived in electromagnetic waves, orcs with countless mutations, fallen group of dragons that lost their intelligence and others.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>No, I think I understood. The problem was that I understood. If she was telling the truth, it would be truly absurd.</p><br/><p>[One day, around early evening, I fell asleep. I had a dream, and I met someone who gave me a portion of power.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThe world\u2019s power?\u201d</p><br/><p>I said blankly. Damn, I felt like I understood. Although it sucked, I think I knew.</p><br/><p>[Our world\u2019s power is especially large. He kept saying inexplicable things like the World of Origin or the World of End.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t know. He could be the embodiment of the worlds, or perhaps just Earth. All I know is that he was worried about the monsters stealing this world\u2019s power and worried that people of Earth wouldn\u2019t have the power to resist them.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[So he separated the world\u2019s power into two. The smaller power, which was still necessary to maintain this world, was given to Hero-nim. The bigger power, which was more pure, was given to me. Of course, it was too big for me to bear it alone.]</p><br/><p>After hearing until there, I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 created the ability users?\u201d</p><br/><p>She answered.</p><br/><p>[Yes, Hero-nim.]</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Huu, one secret has been revealed.</p><br/><p>Right, Ciara was young! (Bang!)</p><br/><p>I\u2019m kidding, of course. I\u2019m sure everyone understands that the secret I mentioned wasn\u2019t about that. In any case, with this, I hope no one asks if Ciara is a heroine\u2026</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the start of a new chapter. Once the talk with Ciara is over, you\u2019ll see Shin and his companions shining within wyverns and new ability users.</p><br/><p>I got a lot of criticisms about the girls\u2019 relationships last chapter and also a lot of encouragements. I think everyone said it because they\u2019re fond of the story and its characters.</p><br/><p>As I said before, not everyone can be happy. There were good advices here and there, of course! Regardless\u2026 the story will take the direction I think is best.</p><br/><p>If there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t like, that\u2019s unfortunate, but I hope you can continue to enjoy this novel. If there\u2019s one thing I can promise you, it\u2019s that I will be happy if you can continue with this lacking author.</p><br/><p>Then, see you tomorrow!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

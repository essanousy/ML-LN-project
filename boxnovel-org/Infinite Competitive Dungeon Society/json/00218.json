(4)</p><br/><p>When I came back to the guild house after finally freeing myself from Loretta, I met Hwaya who looked unusually happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin! Listen, I became a Dimensional Mercenary!\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing her, I checked and saw that she had become a First Dungeon Gold rank explorer. Before I climbed up to the 65th floor, I had heard that she was near the end of the 79th floor. Before I noticed, she had broken become a Platinum rank in the Second Dungeon and had advanced to the First Dungeon.</p><br/><p>If she became a Dimensional Mercenary, it meant she had obtained the magic she lacked, Dimensional Travel. In other words, she had defeated the 50th Floor Master Wendigo alone. Of course, it wasn\u2019t surprising as Hwaya should have been the ice-wielding Wendigo\u2019s natural enemy. In fact, it might have been killed the moment the fight began.</p><br/><p>In any case, after reporting to me, Hwaya shouted energetically.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go take on a Dimensional Mercenary mission! With just us two~!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Dimensional Travel still has over a month long cooldown.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you do something about that with your skill points and will?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk.\u201d</p><br/><p>She clicked her tongue openly. Then, she suddenly tilted her head as she stared at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, did you change somehow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I just obtained a new skill. A pretty good one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, for that to be true, you look more than a little stronger\u2026 Hmph, I\u2019ll surpass you when I obtain a god\u2019s true name. Got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya really was sensitive to mana. Seeing Hwaya clenching her fists, I replied with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I hope you do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuu, that way of talking\u2026 Whatever, join me for a drink. You won\u2019t refuse this too, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t have a cooldown time.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed I wouldn\u2019t be able to enter the dungeon again today. As I followed Hwaya who led me forward excitedly, I made a bitter smile. Well, I could just rest today and work harder tomorrow!</p><br/><p>The next day, around noon, I messaged Lebuik.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 H-H-How what?]</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing from your reaction, it looks like Ren took my advice.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t want to think this, but perhaps Ren really was an idiot. No, perhaps he was Ren because he was an idiot!</p><br/><p>With a smirk, I interrogated Lebuik.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>[H-H-How can I tell anyone that! Not\u2026 Not that anything happened.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Not believing my ears, I asked again.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Y-Yeah. We just slept in each other\u2019s arms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You want me to believe that?\u201d</p><br/><p>[What else was I supposed to do!? I was already frozen from nervousness! In fact, I deserve praise for being able to be with Ren-nim for that long without fainting!]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Can a grown-up woman and man just sleep together in bed without doing anything? Well, I guess if they were tired\u2026 No, even so\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cJust when I gave you the perfect opportunity\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Rather than that, I\u2019m more worried that Ren-nim slept so peacefully\u2026 He must not see me as a woman\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cGeez, that doesn\u2019t matter. You should just...\u201d</p><br/><p>[Can I tell the other girls what you just said?]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, please save me. I\u2019m trying to help Lebuik here! Also, I\u2019m different from Ren!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, that\u2019s what you get for speaking as if it\u2019s easy. But still, thanks\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cEhew, good luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not knowing what to say, I hung up. Regardless of what happened, with this, she should have gotten closer to Ren. I predicted that Ren would start visiting Lebuik\u2019s bedroom more often. Then, one day\u2026</p><br/><p>Although I would need to wait longer until the day I ate banquet noodles came, the current situation wasn\u2019t so bad. With that thought, I went back to the dungeon.</p><br/><p>The 66th floor surprisingly had bats once again. I could easily predict what monsters I would face. Though I couldn\u2019t confirm my suspicion as the 66th floor only had bats, I knew someone who could tell me the answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cYep, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s the incubus.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d</p><br/><p>After reaching the 66th Floor Shop in just one hour and a half, I could get a confirmation from Loretta. Filling up 10 floors with just bats and Mares, isn\u2019t that being too cheap? Kuhum, I mean, it\u2019s true that just sending out succubi is unfair.</p><br/><p>\u201cResistance against charming is very important. It\u2019s something both male and female explorers need to possess.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. I\u2019ve been seeing the charm stat in a new light recently, but still\u2026 incubi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhuhuhu, you want to know what happens to female explorers charmed by incubi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>I blocked my ears, and Loretta made a cute smile and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey only get their life force and mana drained to death. For the record, it\u2019s the same for male explorers who get charmed by succubi. Shin-nim just never got to experience it. The dungeon is a place to help explorers grow, not a place to toy with their hearts and body. Are you perhaps disappointed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy friends are climbing the First Dungeon too. My sister and daugh\u2026 Ina included!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Hohoho, aren\u2019t you glad I let you know before you started worrying profusely?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta made an awkward smile and looked away. Though I gave her a glare, it was true that I considered joining the girls if needed. Relieved, I left for Beyond.</p><br/><p>Beyond\u2019s 16th floor had the Dullahans\u2026 Right, Dullahans, plural.</p><br/><p>[Human, fight me one on one with honor!]</p><br/><p>[Are you a knight? Fight me!]</p><br/><p>With over a hundred so-called knights asking for \u2018fair\u2019 fights, I gave up on fighting fairly immediately. Since I knew I would face Dullahans, I already had a plan in mind. Resolved to stay on the 16th floor for a long time, I initiated my plan \u2013 setting things on fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaaaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>After enveloping my Chaotic Spear with a whirlpool of chaos flames, I shot it forward. Of course, just once wasn\u2019t enough. With everything that happened, I had over 110,000 mana. I swept through the entire floor by pouring in mana to create chaos flames.</p><br/><p>[Kak!]</p><br/><p>[These flames!]</p><br/><p>[Outburst!]</p><br/><p>Hit by the chaos flames, the Dullahans panicked. They didn\u2019t even think to charge through the wall of flames, as they tried to attack me with their skills.</p><br/><p>However, the rock shards created by Outburst became tiny fragments as they burned up when they passed through the chaos flame wall. By the time they hit me, they were no different than ant bites.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>A strange scene entered my eyes, and I shook. The floor\u2019s special property! I\u2019d been looking down on the 16th floor\u2019s special property! On the 15th floor, monsters split when they hit the walls, and even the Dragon Zombie\u2019s bone spears multiplied and shot out. The 16th floor\u2019s, on the other hand, fused everything that hit it. For example, the rock shards that fell to the ground after hitting me returned to floor and restored the hollowed walls.</p><br/><p>The reason I used the term \u2018fuse\u2019 instead of \u2018absorb\u2019 was because even the chaos flames I shot out fused with the floor. The entire floor became hotter and was dyed in a more reddish-black color. If every magic and techniques I used transformed the floor\u2019s environment, it was possible for me to be hurt by my own attacks.</p><br/><p>That said, I was thankful that I found out about this now rather than when I used a different attack. Although chaos flames burned indefinitely, they could never hurt the me, their creator.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaak! Painful!]</p><br/><p>[Extinguish this flame! If you\u2019re a knight, fight me fair and square!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t say that when there\u2019s over a hundred of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though I didn\u2019t do anything, the floor affected by chaos flames caused the Dullahans to writhe in pain until they died.</p><br/><p>It seemed that they realized that the chaos flames would disappear if I died, as they charged at me. However, I had no fear for the Dullahans without Outburst. I simply fought them altogether with Lightning Spear Storm and used Heroic Strikes with chaos flames to finish them off.</p><br/><p>[He\u2019s strong! Attack with Outburst!]</p><br/><p>[But if we do, the walls will fuse again\u2026!]</p><br/><p>[Knights don\u2019t fear death! Knights only fear cowardly defeats!]</p><br/><p>It seemed the walls\u2019 fusion property didn\u2019t activate randomly. In the first place, everything was designed to give the monsters an advantage. The fusion took place when the Dullahans used Outburst. I understood that through their conversation, and seeing the thousands of rock shards caused by the Dullahans that didn\u2019t fear death, I created specially large chaos flames without hesitation.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaak!]</p><br/><p>[Coward!]</p><br/><p>[I might die here, but I didn\u2019t lose!]</p><br/><p>To be honest, it was stupid.</p><br/><p>Regardless, because chaos flames spread across the whole floor, I broke through Beyond\u2019s 16th floor by simply running for 5 hours, all the while thinking that this might be a new record.</p><br/><p>After leaving Beyond, I drank the 10 gold worth Fatigue Recovery Juice as I always did and headed to the guild house. Surprisingly, Yua was there as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYua, shouldn\u2019t you be at school?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, it\u2019s 9 P.M.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>I checked the clock, and it really was 9. With how much time I\u2019ve been spending in the dungeon, I seemed to have lost my sense of time. With a bitter smile, I patted Yua who approached me.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t Oppa going into Beyond? What happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, well, I got lucky, so I finished it quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa really is amazing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nice! I raised Yua\u2019s respect for me naturally!</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, I became Gold rank today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlready!?\u201d</p><br/><p>She defeated the Wendigo!? Of course, Yua must have grown stronger, but the Wendigo\u2019s freezing energy shouldn\u2019t have been so easy to deal with\u2026 In shock, I examined Yua from head to toe. Yua then spoke with a hint of embarrassment.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Oppa. I\u2019m not hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Floor Shop owner treated me kindly and sold me equipment to deal with the freezing energy for a cheap price. Our guild is really amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta must have done something in the background\u2026 Since I didn\u2019t want to ruin Yua\u2019s good mood, I chose to stay silent.</p><br/><p>However, I soon noticed Yua staring at me intently, almost as if she wanted to ask something of me, but was hesitating.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 Oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything you want, tell me. For you, I can even pluck the moon.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was truly confident in being able to do so. Although it would be difficult to pluck both moons, Earth\u2019s original moon should be possible if I use all my power\u2026! However, Yua laughed and shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy with just looking at the moon. We don\u2019t have anywhere to put it anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInstead\u2026 You see, I want to tame monsters other than mantises. I know I can get stronger than way\u2026 If Oppa is busy, it\u2019s fine, but when you have time\u2026 can you go with me to monster territories on Earth?\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied without a shred of hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, Oppa\u2019s been planning on taking care of a few monster territories. How\u2019s a week later?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? I love you, Oppa!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like that, the reclaiming of the Philippines began.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>I know many people don\u2019t like Yua, but it\u2019s necessary for the story so please bear with it. This author has put in too much personal taste for this character, so I can only apologize. But still\u2026</p><br/><p>Yua\u2019s cute!</p><br/><p>Yua\u2019s cute!!</p><br/><p>Yua\u2019s cute!!!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

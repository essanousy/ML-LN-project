Crimson Roar (4)</p><br/><p>\u201cI can see why no one has cleared it solo on their first try\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I smirked. Just look at that, there must be at least 500 of them. While climbing the dungeon, if there was one thing I understood, it was that no matter how many opponents I was up against, there was a limit to the number of attacks I would have to defend against. The only difference was how many times I would have to repeat defending, attacking, defending, attacking. Furthermore, I had just run past a pathway full of monsters like them. Besides the scythe holding reaper, there was nothing that could make me nervous.</p><br/><p>I swung my spear once and fixed my grip on it. Then, I pointed it forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You used Provoke. All enemies will attack you with strong hostility!]</p><br/><p>[Suppress the living. Give pain to the explorer who ridicules death!]</p><br/><p>[Kikikiki!]</p><br/><p>[Kill him, kill him!]</p><br/><p>[Take his soul and possess his body!]</p><br/><p>The monsters rushed toward me like a tsunami. After taking in a deep breath, I patted Ruyue\u2019s back. It was the signal telling her to run.</p><br/><p>[Auuu, pat me more.]</p><br/><p>\u201cLater. For now, run!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Auuuuuuuu!]</p><br/><p>Ruyue kicked off the ground. First, I needed to lower their numbers in one go. I raised my spear and thrust forward, using Elemental Tempest. After the skill had reached mid-rank, more elementals began to gather, truly making me look like I was wielding a storm.</p><br/><p>[Wheeeeee!]</p><br/><p>[Spin spin~~~!]</p><br/><p>[Kuhaha, I\u2019ve been waiting for this moment!]</p><br/><p>Ignoring the elementals\u2019 voices, I shot it forward. In an instant, my Elemental Tempest swept through over a hundred apparitions, mostly consisting of the ghost knights that had been standing in the front. I took out a high-rank Mana Potion and put it in my mouth. Then, I held the spear like a baseball bat.</p><br/><p>\u201cElemental Blade!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Whee, roller coaster!]</p><br/><p>[Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go!]</p><br/><p>[Eh? W-Wait! Not this one!]</p><br/><p>[Wheeee!]</p><br/><p>The moment I yelled out, my spear blade extended to 6 meters and began to radiate rainbow light. I swung the spear at the incoming apparitions. With most of the ghost knights swept away in the Elemental Tempest, the comparatively weaker ghosts and specters couldn\u2019t withstand the elemental explosions and fell.</p><br/><p>B-B-Boom!</p><br/><p>[Kuk!]</p><br/><p>[You, Elementalist!]</p><br/><p>[Die, die apparitions!]</p><br/><p>[Ueeeek, I\u2019m never getting on this one again!]</p><br/><p>[Whee!]</p><br/><p>The ghosts\u2019 death throes rang out along with elementals\u2019 cheers. However, in an instant, the apparitions split through the middle and something swept over me. When Ruyue quickly dodged, the ground behind me was marked with deep furrows as an explosive sound rang out.</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t uselessly die. I may need you all for other purposes.]</p><br/><p>[Kyak! The reaper cometh!]</p><br/><p>[The Grim Reaper has drawn his scythe.]</p><br/><p>He would need them for other purposes\u2026? The reaper swung his huge death scythe, sending a blade wave forward. I dodged his attack, but did not attack him, as I was worried about what he said. Instead, I used Tempest to attack the apparitions again.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaak!]</p><br/><p>[That bastard is shooting out storms!]</p><br/><p>[Tsk, if that\u2019s what you want, then\u2026!]</p><br/><p>As I thought! As if to fold space, the reaper\u2019s body flew toward me stealthily and smoothly. His movements were unusual, as if I was watching an old horror movie. Regardless, the result was terrifying. A large scythe big enough to cover my entire view flew as if to cut off my head. I clenched my teeth and poured out a vast amount of mana into the spear where Peika was infuse, raising it up and blocking the Grim Reaper\u2019s scythe.</p><br/><p>[Strong!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Something popped out from his stomach. Frightened, I hurriedly jumped and dodged it. Puk! When I heard the sound and looked back at the position I was in, I saw a small scythe. Shooting out a scythe from your stomach, what the hell are your internal organs made out of!? Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t have the time to dwell on such thoughts. He had shot out another blade wave. Dodging his attack again, I attacked the nearby ghosts with Thunder Arrow.</p><br/><p>[Ek, he must think we are easy prey!]</p><br/><p>[Show him it\u2019s not true!]</p><br/><p>[I said, you guys stay still!]</p><br/><p>[We\u2019re still going to die! Sob, why must I worry about dying even after dying?]</p><br/><p>When the apparitions flew towards me, the reaper stopped throwing his blade waves. As I thought, he didn\u2019t want the apparitions to die! Using Tempests, I took care of the apparitions. Then\u2026</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaaa! Feel death! Death Roar!]</p><br/><p>[Grim Reaper uses Death Roar! The attack power of all undead is doubled. The defense of all living beings is halved!]</p><br/><p>[You resisted the status effect. The status effect has been nullified.]</p><br/><p>Good, I was getting my money\u2019s worth from the item! Confirming that the reaper\u2019s skill had not affected me, I raised my head. Excited about having their attack power doubled, the ghost knights were charging at me in a line. Facing them, I screamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cKiaaaaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You used Vengeful Spirit\u2019s Wail. Most enemies become confused and feared!]</p><br/><p>Eh? Although I hadn\u2019t expected much, most of the ghost knights charging my way fell and began to fight each other. Why? This skill used to only work on weak monsters with low intelligence\u2026 Then, I remembered something. Magic, charm, and intelligence were important in protecting my mind. In that case, they most likely helped in my mental attacks as well! Although I thought it was likely, I couldn\u2019t brood over it for very long. The reaper was swinging his scythe in front of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, you\u2019re fast!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I shall take your head!]</p><br/><p>From the reaper\u2019s deep voice, I felt a chilling sense of danger. Hugging Ruyue, I immediately used Talaria and flew into the air. Before I fully flew up, something had ripped my boots. Looking down, I couldn\u2019t help but shiver at the horrifying sight. Countless black hands had come out of the ground, trying to grab onto me. This was dangerous. If I was caught, they looked like they would drag me into the end of hell. The damage I\u2019d take aside, it looked intimidating.</p><br/><p>[Yay! Shin hugged me!]</p><br/><p>[Master is feeling heavy, so hurry up and dematerialize!]</p><br/><p>Ruyue dematerialized and sat on my head. Gritting my teeth, I shouted at the reaper.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch, you said you\u2019d take my head!\u201d</p><br/><p>[The one that gets tricked is the idiot.]</p><br/><p>The reaper appeared in front of me again, but with Talaria, I did not lose to him in speed. Dodging his scythe just barely by falling back, I activated Divine Speed, poured white light into my Black Earthen Spear, and threw it at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuk!]</p><br/><p>I never missed my attack after using Divine Speed! After being hit by my Heroic Strike, the reaper flew back with his eyes opened wide. Seeing the Black Earthen Spear that transformed into white lightning sending the reaper\u2019s large body flying dozens of meters, I clenched my fists and began to sweep through the apparitions again.</p><br/><p>[You bastard, are you treating us like dust!?]</p><br/><p>[Make that bastard regret it!]</p><br/><p>[But I feel like we\u2019ll regret it more!]</p><br/><p>[\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, come back and help me clean them up!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Okay!]</p><br/><p>Although I wanted to quickly take care of the trash mobs and focus on the reaper, he flew towards me before I could even kill a hundred ghosts. He took out the Black Earthen Spear stuck in his chest, then violently snapped it in half in front of me. Although the blade grew dull occasionally, the spear handle had never once broken, but he had done it!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch! Do you know how precious that is!?]</p><br/><p>[Kuha!]</p><br/><p>Without offering me any excuses, he shot blade waves toward me again. If I were hit by that ominous black pulsation, I didn\u2019t think it would end with just receiving damage.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dodging his attack, I took out the Silver Spear and aimed it at him. I saw the two halves of my Black Earthen Spear falling. Was that repairable? It should be, right? The water in my eyes was sweat, not tears! I didn\u2019t think I threw it for no reason either. Even so, I decided to utterly destroy that bastard. I raised my spear, and aimed it at him.</p><br/><p>Then I dropped to the ground abruptly. It was truly a sudden drop.</p><br/><p>[How did you know!?]</p><br/><p>Above me, the reaper\u2019s shout rang out. I raised my head and confirmed that he was standing in the place I was just in. Damn, just how many skills did he have!?</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell you, you bast\u2026 ut!\u201d</p><br/><p>Again! When I quickly flew away, the trajectory of the reaper\u2019s large black scythe cut through the air. I felt goosebumps on my back. I truly couldn\u2019t sense anything!</p><br/><p>[How can you dodge my attacks!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s instinct, bitch!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gritting my teeth, I extended my spear blade using Elemental Blade and slashed at him. It seemed he was specialized for attacks, but had a weaker defense compared to normal Floor Masters, as my Elemental Blade dealt noticeable damage to him. I continued pushing at him to prevent him from teleporting to my back again. Elemental power constantly exploded and annoyed him. The worn-down cloth he was wearing began to tear slowly. The reaper screamed.</p><br/><p>[Kiaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Is it that attack again!? Black hands shot out from my surroundings toward me. Flying into the air, I looked at the black hands that had covered half of the entire ground, and murmured with an astonished face.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrazy\u2026 Just how much mana does that bastard have!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Die!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKik.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I thought, if I stayed here dumbfounded, he would appear behind me again. As I had already seen him do it twice, I recognized when he would use that move and how he would strike his scythe. Lightly moving to the side, I dodged his scythe. Although his face was empty under his hood, I could sense his astonishment as black light fluctuated. I then grabbed his scythe, which had remained in the position he had struck down in.</p><br/><p>\u201cDark Thunder Explosion!\u201d</p><br/><p>I considered using White Lightning Consecutive Strike, but that skill was most effective when my feet were on the ground. Not to mention, I was running low on mana. The Mana Potion\u2019s cooldown time had not ended yet either. As such, I chose to use Dark Thunder Explosion.</p><br/><p>Although I was on the lookout for scythes flying out of its stomach, but after being hit by Dark Thunder Explosion\u2019s initial lightning bolt, he had become paralyzed and was unable to attack. Heh. The corners of my mouth went up in a smile.</p><br/><p>In the air, a festival of lightning occurred.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>Along with the reaper\u2019s scream, the black hands that had sprouted up from the ground trembled and elongated, but I, their target, was already in the air with the reaper. This. How was I supposed to defeat him without Talaria? It seemed I would need to do some research for a while.</p><br/><p>While I was thinking rather leisurely, the reaper danced in the air, continuously being struck by black lightning bolts. This skill also seemed stronger than the first time I used it. Even though it didn\u2019t use my mana, it had grown stronger according to my magic stat. Did the skills work with a different principle? It could also be because the ability of my contracted lightning elemental, Peika, increased.</p><br/><p>When the explosion ended, I poured mana into my Silver Spear and swung it at him. After being hit, the Grim Reaper helplessly flew through the air. The black hands on the ground had already disappeared. I landed along with him and took care of the leftover ghosts. Although I allowed myself to be hit by their soul arrows while I was fighting the reaper, I couldn\u2019t let a boulder be pierced by raindrops.</p><br/><p>[Kukuku\u2026 I acknowledge you.]</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Just die.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cooldown time ended and I could drink a Mana Potion again. Putting a Mana Potion worth 15 million won in my mouth, I lowered my body. Ruyue materialized on her own and let me ride on her back. Compared to when he first appeared, the reaper was tattered. He raised his scythe.</p><br/><p>Then, he slashed the ghosts that had survived until now.</p><br/><p>[Grim Reaper uses \u2018Soul Eater\u2019! He recovers 1% HP and MP for each soul he cuts with his scythe!]</p><br/><p>[Kii, I\u2019m finally free!]</p><br/><p>[My long journey has finally come to an end.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, that\u2019s what it was.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I diligently killed the ghosts, there were still about 200 ghosts left. I started killing the ghosts before the reaper could cut them, but he had almost fully recovered.</p><br/><p>[Kuhuhu, despair, Hero. Despair suits you more than hope.]</p><br/><p>\u201cTempest!\u201d</p><br/><p>[No matter how much you struggle, you cannot defeat me.]</p><br/><p>\u201cElemental Blade!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You!?]</p><br/><p>While the reaper was blabbering on about something, I managed to take care of all the ghosts. I looked around the field, but could not spot any ghosts or specters. At the same time, however, Talaria had ended, meaning I could not fly into the air anymore. The reaper seemed to have realized this, as he swung his scythe and sneered.</p><br/><p>[You can\u2019t run like a rat anymore.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t recover anymore either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Spinning my spear, I reviewed his skills one by one. Blade wave, shooting small scythes out of his stomach, suddenly appearing behind me and swinging his scythe, and the black hands that shot up from the ground. Although I could block the first three, how was I supposed to block the black hands? After thinking for a bit, I made my decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just have to endure it with Dragon Skin.\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s his cheaty skill that was at fault! It wasn\u2019t my fault! I\u2019d think of a solution after I beat him once, so it was fine! Making rather disappointing excuses to myself, I stepped forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

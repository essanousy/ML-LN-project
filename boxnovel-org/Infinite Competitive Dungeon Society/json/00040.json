Event Dungeon (3)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>As if she had been waiting for my question, Loretta nodded her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Gates are certainly marked according to Earth\u2019s standard for ability users. An \u2018A\u2019 marked dungeon would mean A-rank ability users could take care of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it really is as I thought. I\u2019m curious how you know about it, but I won\u2019t ask for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you do, I\u2019m unable to give you an answer. But I can tell you this, Shin-nim. That place is a dungeon, yet not a dungeon. If something goes wrong\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Loretta\u2019s worried expression, I nodded my head with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s dangerous, but I have confidence. I have strong reinforcements as well. Thanks for worrying about me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa, I still have misgivings\u2026 but it\u2019s not like I can go with you, huu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMore importantly, there\u2019s something I want to buy. Do you sell masks? Something that can completely hide my appearance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do. A mask that prevents others from reading your information and even slightly changes your height, build, and hair. It\u2019s called \u2018Otus\u2019 Secret.\u2019 Today, this amazing magical item is only 50,000 gold!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c50,000!\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s over 100 million won! Well\u2026 it\u2019s probably going to come in handy from now on. There was a huge merit to being able to act as an ability user while hiding my face. Whenever an Event Raid occurred, it would let me participate without revealing my identity. That way, I could act without reserve.</p><br/><p>I bought the mask with tearful eyes. I messaged father while I was at it. We of course had each other on our friend lists.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, buy Otus\u2019 Secret from the Floor Shop.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hm? What\u2019s that?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a mask. Are you going to reveal your face?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Mm, I was going to tell you later, but I registered as an ability user today.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou act too quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>I remembered the talk father had with Walker not long ago. Although I thought he was rather calm about it, it seemed he fell for Walker\u2019s provocation. He was my father, but he really was simple.</p><br/><p>[My ability has grown quite a bit too now. I can\u2019t stay hidden forever, so I registered as an ability user and ignored the requests from Guardian and Freedom Wing. Huhu, I\u2019m an A-rank ability user now!]</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations on getting A-rank, but you could have registered with your identity hidden, father.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was true. Many rogues who did not want to join Guardian or Freedom Wing disguised themselves when they registered as ability users. What was important for ability users were their abilities, not their faces.</p><br/><p>That said, compared to Guardian, who were officially recognized by the government, or the worldwide organization Freedom Wing, who had their own independent system, rogues were a lot less trustworthy. They were also unable to enjoy the benefits other ability users had such as tax cuts, memberships to government facilities, or free entrance to certain public and private facilities.</p><br/><p>Simply put, they were things I didn\u2019t care about.</p><br/><p>[Eh? Really? Well, it\u2019s too late for that.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu. Well, I\u2019m only going to be fighting barehanded tomorrow. Also, don\u2019t make it obvious that we are father and son.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Shouldn\u2019t you take this opportunity to register as well?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI will. With my mask on. I\u2019m still not confident in my ability, so I don\u2019t plan on revealing myself so openly.\u201d</p><br/><p>[A man shouldn\u2019t be so spineless.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s being cautious.\u201d</p><br/><p>[My stupid son has grown so much\u2026]</p><br/><p>Thinking that my father\u2019s intelligence stat couldn\u2019t be that high, I purchased Otus\u2019 Secret. It was a black, metallic mask that covered my forehead, eyes, and even my nasal bridge completely. However, I felt that it wasn\u2019t perfect.</p><br/><p>\u201cWon\u2019t I get discovered? It doesn\u2019t hide my mouth or jaw line.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, it changes your build. Try wearing it first, Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I equipped the mask and imagined myself getting slimmer, my body really did get slimmer. Plus, my height, which had reduced to 190cm with all the Bone Compressing Elixirs I consumed, reduced further to about 185cm. My hair then became a little longer and was dyed grey. My appearance really did change according to my imagination.</p><br/><p>Loretta who was watching from the side suddenly laughed. I didn\u2019t like the way her eyes curved to a crescent shape.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, is that Shin-nim\u2019s ideal form?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUk!? N-No! I only dyed my hair grey so my identity wouldn\u2019t get revealed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I believe you. Wow, how cool. I might fall in love with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking in monotone!\u201d</p><br/><p>I had to admit Loretta got me there. Just as I vowed to get my revenge one day and took my mask off, someone shot me a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we not doing any more raids today?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Ren, who was quietly watching Loretta make fun of me. After two weeks of fighting the Lizard Knight 3 times every day, Ren charged at the Lizard Knight\u2019s tail much less than when we began. I had also collected all of the Lizard Knight set, and only needed a few more Muscle Strengthening Elixirs.</p><br/><p>By the way, the Lizard Knight Set was a plate armor set with much better effects than the leather armor. It raised strength and constitution by 10 points, and allowed me to use \u2018Dragon Skin\u2019, the ultimate defense skill that reduced incoming physical and magical damage by 90 percent.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was not completely effective against attacks from enemies that exceeded a certain level. In addition, it reduced my movement speed by 50 percent. However, it was still an amazing skill. Becoming tougher meant that my attacks became stronger as well. I stored this skill on the 4 o\u2019clock position of the pocket watch.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, I like that the gauntlet is metal. I didn\u2019t really like the leather glove.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Crown Prince. I asked if we were done for the day?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not, Ren. We still have one more raid to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, my back hurts though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, we both know you\u2019re going to go wild once the raid begins.\u201d</p><br/><p>After making Ren shut up, I checked myself out one last time. Metal armor and mask. Although they weren\u2019t really a good combination, it didn\u2019t matter. I was exploring the dungeon, not going on a fashion show.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, wish me luck so that I can come back safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 If it\u2019s Shin-nim, I believe you can crawl up from even the deepest depths of hell.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa, can\u2019t you just say \u2018come back safely\u2019? You don\u2019t have to exaggerate so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuk! Come back safely. I won\u2019t forgive you if you come back hurt! There, happy!?\u201d</p><br/><p>If you say that in an angry tone, it doesn\u2019t sound sincere!</p><br/><p>The next day, I decided to leave early in the morning. I equipped Otus\u2019 Secret and wore the most formal attire I owned, the Wraith Queen Set. When I looked at myself in the mirror, I had to admit that I looked great. Although I was thankful that I had grown slimmer by consuming Compressing Elixirs, I wished I had become a bit slimmer, just like how I looked right now. Until I was 16, I had enough muscles for orcs to call me big brother. As such, I always yearned to become slimmer.</p><br/><p>When I went out to the living room, Yua, who was drinking milk, found me and tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, why are you wearing a mask?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, oppa is going to go register as an ability user today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yua\u2019s eyes sparkled at my words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen can I brag about oppa to my friends?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Mm\u2026 As you can see from the mask I\u2019m wearing, I\u2019m registering under a fake name. Sorry, but can you wait a bit longer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEi\u2026 Okay. I wanted to brag about oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>Watching Yua murmuring with lingering attachment, I patted her head. She quickly cheered up and saw me off. If she knew that I was going to clear a dungeon that appeared on Earth, she would be crying and trying her best to prevent me from going. For that reason, I didn\u2019t tell her anything about it.</p><br/><p>As I walked on the sidewalk, I could feel the gazes of people passing by. With the rather fancy Wraith Queen Set, the metallic mask that covered my eyes and nose, and grey hair, I couldn\u2019t blame them for looking at me like I was crazy. Kuk, it was painful. Why did I sign up for this!? I had to hurry to New Moon Agency. It was where people registered as ability users and received ability user-related jobs.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeon Hwawoo-nim, you\u2019re here to register as an ability user? With the mask?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, just like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFollow me. You\u2019ll have to show us your ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>The employee led me to a room with all sorts of random things. I saw a large boulder, thousands of bean-like things scattered on the ground, and weapons like swords and spears.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you need a tool to use your ability, do tell us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked Peika to infuse herself into my glove.</p><br/><p>When lightning began to flicker from my hand wearing the scale glove, the employee became startled and jumped back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-Is it lightning? Nature-type abilities are rare\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026 Hap!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since there was a good target in front of me, I shot my fist flickering with sparks toward the large boulder. Although I wasn\u2019t using Heroic Strike, I had grown familiar with focusing my strength into one point. I could thus maximize my fist\u2019s destructive power. As expected, the boulder turned to dust and collapsed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 I\u2019ll have to measure the value in detail, but it seems to be at least B+. To get such a high rating on your first assessment, amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>No, not B+! Father will make fun of me. Please, give me an A! Damn, if I knew this would happen, I would have used a spear!</p><br/><p>Even though I happily replied to the employee, I was feeling grim on the inside as I walked out of the assessment room. The employee who had left for a while then came back with the data extrapolating my mana and strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe results are out. Just looking at mana, Yeon Hwawoo-nim would be at B+ rank. However, taking into account the ability\u2019s uniqueness, suitability to the user\u2019s body, and control, it comes out to A rank. A-rank ability users are only about 12 percent of ability users worldwide. Yeon Hwawoo-nim is beginning from that starting line. The New Moon Agency is happy to have come across someone with such a strong potential. If you\u2019d like to join the Guardian, under the government\u2019s direct supervision, then\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019d like to get my license now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, follow me. After taking a picture, you just need to pay for the license application fee.\u201d</p><br/><p>Carrying the license with my masked face on it, I left the New Moon Agency. When I looked at the time, it was nearing 1 P.M. In about an hour, I would enter the Event Dungeon\u2026 I felt my body tensing up from nervousness, but I somewhat enjoyed it. The dungeon was nice, but martial artists really shone when they trained themselves in a pit of danger!</p><br/><p>At around 1:50, I was sitting in a caf\u00e9 near the shopping mall, sipping on an ice coffee. With the Lizard Knight set I put on along with Otus\u2019 Secret, the gazes I was receiving were no joke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn ability user, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is there a fully armed ability user sitting here drinking coffee?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, it\u2019s that thing. The Gate.\u201d</p><br/><p>The entrances to the Event Dungeons were officially called Gates. Feeling goosebumps at people\u2019s deductive ability, I silently drank my coffee.</p><br/><p>Sitting across from me was my father, happily sipping on a caramel macchiato, wearing thick leather armor and with a thick silver spear sitting by his side. Every time his Adam\u2019s Apple moved, his muscles bulged in an unsightly manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm? What\u2019s wrong, Yeon Hwawoo!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why were the two of us the first two arrive? Because we couldn\u2019t act like father and son, the current situation felt incredibly awkward. I just wanted to quickly go into the dungeon. Why was this happening? Let me enter the Event Dungeon! I\u2019ll go in alone if I have to! I just want to fight!</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, so\u2026 I mean, young man, why did you make such a dangerous decision?\u201d</p><br/><p>Father could have texted me at any time, but it seemed he wanted to ask me face-to-face.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy master and father told me that martial artists grew by fighting with their lives on the line.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHo, what a splendid father you have. I\u2019d love to meet him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father praised himself shamelessly, and retorted with a but.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut when a real situation of life or death arrives, it isn\u2019t easy to move words into action. I\u2019m curious how you so easily made your mind to go to the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying I accepted Mastiford\u2019s request without thinking much about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father\u2019s eyes seemed a little deeper. Ah, they were the same eyes he had when he began to lead my 10 year old self onto the path of a dungeon explorer. In other words, I couldn\u2019t trust him right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew the Event Dungeon\u2019s difficulty and had trustworthy comrades to help me. Furthermore, Yeongdeungpo is close to where I live, so not only would it have been unwise to back out in this situation, it also would have not been honorable as a martial artist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRather than make-say, I want to hear the real reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>He found me out in an instant. With a shrug, I replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven now, all ability users are fighting against monsters with their lives at risk. Although their goals are likely money, they are undoubtedly getting stronger in blood battles. I\u2019m different. I\u2019m getting stronger leisurely in the dungeon where my limbs would grow back when they are cut, where I would not die even if I were killed. If I kept advancing in the same way, although I would become stronger, I felt that I would lack the ferocity required of a warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fact that others were advancing without me was unbearable. I also need ferocity. Otherwise, when the time comes where I need to put my life on the line, I might become a coward who would try to run to safety. I don\u2019t mean to throw my life away, but I don\u2019t want to miss a chance to get stronger just because it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Is that it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was the truth. The dungeon was certainly exciting and thrilling. It was full of danger, and it hurt incredibly when enemies stabbed me with a knife. The pleasure I felt from breathing a living monster\u2019s breath, exchanging blows with our lives on the line, and finally plunging my spear into its heart was real.</p><br/><p>At the same time, it was fake. I knew I would not lose my life even if I died in the dungeon. I acted knowing that I would always have another chance. Of course, if monsters did not start appearing on Earth, this would have been fine.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t the case now. The moon had become two, and the world became a place where it wouldn\u2019t be weird for a monster to pop out at any time. Event Dungeons had appeared as well. Let\u2019s say a situation arrived where I had to face monsters on Earth. If I fought with the same mindset as the one I had in the dungeon, if I fought without knowing the ferocity of my life being at risk, a knife would pierce my heart in a moment of carelessness and that would be it.</p><br/><p>Could there be anything more foolish? I did not want to become such a pathetic warrior. I did not want to become a warrior from a game where losing my life was an acceptable outcome. Although it could become a way of getting stronger, I could not let it become a mindset for battle.</p><br/><p>Life was not in easy mode where I could try again and again. It was always in hell mode.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly in this way do I think I can truly become strong. Become\u2026 the strongest. Fath\u2026 Kang Yungoong-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was father\u2019s name[1. Yungoong means \u2018hero\u2019], which was rather embarrassing to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I like your honesty! Too bad, I\u2019ll be the one to hold the title of strongest!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you kid. That will be me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m not kidding. It\u2019ll be me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMMM!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMMMM!\u201d</p><br/><p>We began to glare at each other. At the same time father grabbed his spear, lightning began to flicker from my hand. When a fight was about to break out to determine who was superior, we were interrupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, you guys get along pretty well.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

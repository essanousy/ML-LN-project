The Power of the Hero (1)</p><br/><p>Chapter 177. The Power of the Hero (1)</p><br/><p>Fighting the Twin-headed Ogre ten times a day was honestly just too easy. Now that I thought about it, fighting the Floor Master three times a day had been nothing at all. It didn\u2019t even take 20 minutes to kill the Twin-headed Ogre, so fighting it three times would only take an hour. As I was now, I would be fine even if I continuously fought for 10 hours.</p><br/><p>Plus, even though the Twin-headed Ogre was strong and fast, it was a normal ground-based monster that couldn\u2019t even use magic. After I fought it a couple of times, I had memorized its movement and attack patterns and became able to defeat it in 10 minutes.</p><br/><p>I had an incredibly high strength stat, which was even further amplified by Zeus\u2019 power and Ogre\u2019s tattoo. I also had Mad Typhoon, which showed greater strength than what was possible with my stats. Although it would be hard for me to block a Demon Army Commander\u2019s regenerative ability like Peruta did, it was still extremely easy for me to deal a blow that surpassed a mere ogre\u2019s regenerative ability. It was what greatly helped to shorten the time I spent fighting the Twin-headed Ogre.</p><br/><p>After I left the Floor Master room, I was drinking a Fatigue Recovery Juice worth 100 gold when Loretta spoke with a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, you should know that there are explorers who go in as full 10-man parties and fight the Twin-headed Ogre for 3 hours. If someone saw you, they\u2019d think the dungeon was made to be climbed alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for me to care about them. I only have to care about people stronger than me. I don\u2019t have the time to turn back and feel proud seeing people weaker than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta slightly sulked at my cut-throat response.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Shin-nim ever collapses from working too hard, know that Shin-nim\u2019s precious things will be missing when Shin-nim wakes up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t collapse in front of Loretta so don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>I retorted with a grin, and Loretta made a scared expression. She looked like she was about to cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cA-Are you still angry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it. It\u2019s just that guys like to\u2026 Uh, no, nevermind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it!? That sounds like some extremely valuable information! Please continue, now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNever. Not even over my dead body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I had no plans to say anything. I finally got her to stop, because if I had said anything, she would've gone on about the \"marrying\" thing. I stuck my tongue out at Loretta and headed toward the Floor Master room again. But from the happy expression I saw before I turned around, it seemed Loretta was making her own assumptions and being happy.</p><br/><p>Perhaps in her head, she had already planned out our wedding. However, my prediction was immediately proven to be wrong. Loretta\u2019s thoughts were leaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cEhehe, then we\u2019ll name our seventh kid this\u2026 I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be just as cute as Shin-nim, uhuhuhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amazed at Loretta\u2019s ability to surpass my expectations every time, I shook my head. Then, I opened the door to the Floor Master room.</p><br/><p>\u201cFight me! Twin-headed Ogre!\u201d</p><br/><p>Like I said before, it didn\u2019t take long for me to defeat the Twin-headed Ogre. I defeated it four times in one hour. In other words, after two and a half hours, I had nothing more to do for the day. Including the time for rest, four hours was more than enough.</p><br/><p>Since I had to grind the boss 80 to 100 times on average, I would be forced to a leisurely lifestyle for a while. Although I grew impatient thinking about the 2 year time period I had, since I knew being impatient wouldn\u2019t change anything, I thought about how to spend the time more efficiently.</p><br/><p>First, I decided to talk to Yua, who was still sulking.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, I failed at every attempt to appease her. I spent the remaining time sparring with Father or teaching Sumire spearmanship.</p><br/><p>With the exception of Walker, who had to guard Yua for about a third of his day since school had just restarted, when they weren't climbing the dungeon, most Revival members were socializing in the guild house. This made it extremely convenient for me to see and teach Sumire.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a shield on one hand and a spear on the other, Sumire charged toward me. Although she was attacking and defending rather sensibly, I still skillfully dodged her attack and lightly attacked her shin which her shield wasn\u2019t covering.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour lower body\u2019s guard is lacking!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, guide me more, Shin-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnytime!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I responded, Sumire clenched her teeth and thrust her spear toward me. Her basic battle tactic was to defend with her shield and attack with her spear. It was appropriate if she wanted to act as a tank who drew the enemies\u2019 aggro while also acting as a damage dealer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe tip of your spear is shaking because you\u2019re too focused on your shield!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk! I\u2019ll fix it!\u201d</p><br/><p>I did my best to point out her mistakes and to help her hone her spear. When I attacked Sumire\u2019s opening, she would be hit, but by the time she got back up, the opening was gone. Seeing her grow, I couldn\u2019t help but be excited as a teacher. As a result, I ended up overdoing it slightly, but Sumire happily accepted it. Perhaps this was how Father felt when he was teaching me. Regardless, I was happy that my guild was full of such talented people.</p><br/><p>After we sparred for two hours, Sumire bowed, drenched in sweat.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your lesson, Shin-nim! My Spear Technique reached mid-rank level 5!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou're progressing well. You\u2019ll be able to use it in real battles soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I\u2019m lacking, it\u2019s thanks to Shin-nim\u2019s enthusiastic teaching that I'm improving so much! I\u2019m extremely happy to serve Shin-nim as my master!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re doing well. You have talent and you\u2019re putting in an effort. I\u2019m happy to have Sumire as my first disciple too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>No, don\u2019t look at me with those sparkling eyes of respect! It\u2019s ticklish! I scratched my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go wash ourselves off and eat something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Shin-nim! I\u2019ll prepare the food!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I went upstairs after a refreshing shower, I unexpectedly saw Daisy there. Although there wasn\u2019t anyone to prepare food, Daisy was sitting alone at the table with her head down. She was in her uniform, but her beret was on the side, while her chain whip was wrapped around her arm like an accessory. I was surprised that the whip could be worn in so many ways.</p><br/><p>She must have felt my presence as she turned toward me. Her head was still drooped on the table. She flashed her red eyes ominously and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlood sugar\u2026 low. Need food.\u201d</p><br/><p>She said it in a cool way, but the content was anything but cool. It even made her outer appearance look worse.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere were you until now\u2026? Well, that aside, just what did you eat for the past 73 years?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPreserved food\u2026 in inventory. Tasteless. I ate here, threw away all preserved food. My stomach wants tasty food.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh hey, that last sentence was grammatically correct! \u2026 You\u2019ll have to wait a bit for the food. Eat this for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>I took out a chocolate bar from my inventory and gave it to her. Daisy's eye's flashed and she grabbed it. After peeling the wrapper, she took a big bite.</p><br/><p>[Yummy!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to use your Evil Eyes to tell everyone around you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wait, wasn\u2019t this the first time she shouted something!? She wasted such an important scene on a chocolate bar!? I wanted her to shout in a more emotional event\u2026 I felt slightly betrayed. Then, seeing Daisy put her hands out like asking for another, I flicked her forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a proper meal soon. You know Sumire, right? She\u2019s a genius in various ways, but she\u2019s especially talented in housework. You can look forward to her food.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm\u2026 For yummy food, I can\u2026 wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy took her hands back and nibbled on the chocolate bar she had left. Although it was good that she had calmed down, I still didn\u2019t know why she was here.</p><br/><p>If I remembered correctly, after eating the melting tuna, she disappeared and was nowhere to be seen. Four days had passed since then, so that meant she had come back after four days.</p><br/><p>Just when I was about to ask, Daisy opened her mouth as if she just remembered.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeyond\u2026 12th floor. Broke through, thanks to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>So she went straight into Beyond that day! It was a rather quick decision, contrary to the slow and lax attitude she was showing now. I nodded my head with admiration.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was quick. Good job.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour children, very strong. Pookie, Iana, Loro, especially strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with those cute names\u2026 I don\u2019t know which monsters you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFlame\u2026 Drake and, Iron\u2026 Boar, Evil Rhinoceros. Beetle Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood job shortening their names to such cute ones!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFighting together, I\u2019m happy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing her elated expression, I lost the heart to say anything. I simply made a sour smile and patted her head. Then, remembering that I patted her without thinking, I pulled my hand back. However, Daisy didn\u2019t seem to mind. In fact, she looked at me curiously when I took my hand off.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, mind. Continue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, sorry. That was rude of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was really friendly. Was it because I was another Beyond explorer? No, that\u2019s probably not it\u2026 Just when I was thinking about the reason, Daisy spoke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, surrounded by, pretty girls. Clearly showing feelings, but you\u2019re virgin. With you, I feel safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dissing me, right!? You\u2019re openly dissing me! Wait, so you were actually listening to us properly!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt like I had my back stabbed thoroughly. I was so sad that I wanted to cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cReliable. More than other girls, feel safer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let your guard down, I\u2019m a man too! Plus, other girls? What girls are threatening your chastity!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWorld is\u2026 wide.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make that distant expression! You\u2019re scaring me!\u201d</p><br/><p>I unwillingly came to find out that pretty girls were sought after by both men and women. I really did not need to know that at all\u2026</p><br/><p>In any case, Sumire, Daisy, and I, a rather unusual combination, enjoyed a lunch together. Then, when I was about to start my training after getting some rest, I got a message that broke the peaceful atmosphere. It was from Walker, who was protecting Yua on her way back from school.</p><br/><p>[Come back to Earth now, Kang Shin! Your sister got done in by Luca Bruno\u2019s ability! I\u2019m running back with her in my arms, but\u2026 In any case, come now!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming immediately!\u201d</p><br/><p>People that got on my nerves even by doing nothing seemed to have gotten tired of living, as they pulled on my hair and opened the gate to Hell.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>You\u2019ve waited a long time! It\u2019s time to go take care of the people making you itchy just by existing! Walker, you were put on this duty for this very moment! Well\u2026 Good job Walker! You stopped the reader\u2019s rage!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It is highly recommended to return immediately. This place is currently extremely dangerous!]</p><br/><p>After happily listening to the messages flowing in, I let out a long sigh. I was able to make the best case scenario come true. Even as I readied Caduceus, I was worried that the El Patiz would avoid it somehow, but my worry was unfounded. Everything worked out perfectly.</p><br/><p>Of course, even if things didn\u2019t work out as I intended, I was at least confident that I wouldn\u2019t have my brain eaten by the El Patiz. It was because of Absolute Soul.</p><br/><p>When I came to the Panan continent, I thought about how to defend myself against the El Patiz. A bug that eats one\u2019s brain and takes over one\u2019s body. How cruel was that?</p><br/><p>I wanted a skill that would protect my brain from an unexpected sneak attack. Since even the Panan continent\u2019s Hero was taken over by the El Patiz, I knew that my identity as a Hero wouldn\u2019t protect me from them. Saving my friend was important, but my life was even more important. Absolute Soul. That was the skill I tried to create that day in the forest.</p><br/><p>But as I was synthesizing the skill, I felt something was lacking. Heavy Armor Mastery, Soul Guard, and Death Counter. They were all excellent defensive skills, and I knew the resulting skill would protect my mind and body perfectly. However, I felt that I needed something else. After all, these damned bugs had even consumed a Hero. In the end, I synthesized the skill only after I obtained Mana Absorption.</p><br/><p>Mana Absorption\u2019s effect was simple. Whenever I attacked with a melee weapon, or whenever an enemy attacked me with a melee or magical attack, I would absorb the enemy\u2019s mana. That is, whenever I came in contact with mana, I would absorb a portion of it. As the skill level increased, the amount that I absorbed would increase. As I was always lacking in mana, it was a truly wonderful skill to have.</p><br/><p>I focused on the fact that this skill could steal the enemy\u2019s mana. Humans generally did not have mana at birth, and even if they did, it would be an extremely low amount. Other races, however, were different. The more dissimilar they were to humans, the more mana they would possess. It wasn\u2019t wrong to say that the El Patiz were giant lumps of mana. They were afraid of the Mana Eater for the same reason. The Mana Eater\u2019s existence itself ate away at the El Patiz\u2019s life.</p><br/><p>For that reason, I added Mana Absorption to the skill I wanted to create. The resulting skill was Absolute Soul. It raised the soul\u2019s league, allowing me to resist those of higher level. It perfectly protected my body and soul.</p><br/><p>[Your soul is complete and pure. Such a lofty soul affects you both internally and externally. Positive effects are added to all of your actions. Your attacks become stronger, and your defense against all types of physical, magical, and mental attacks increases greatly.]</p><br/><p>[Nothing can invade your body and mind. You become immune to all mental status effects, and you are unaffected by all corrosion, parasite, possession, control, and mutations. As curses cannot affect you, you cannot be reborn as an undead when you die.]</p><br/><p>[Your soul absorbs mana that nears you and prevents it from functioning properly. It is the same even when you approach the enemy. Physical attacks, and physical and magical defense absorb a fixed amount of mana.]</p><br/><p>[Whenever the skill level increases, the skill\u2019s effect increases.]</p><br/><p>When I first read the skill description, I almost fainted because of how good it was. Soon, I began to see the skill\u2019s potential, a potential to destroy the world\u2019s enemy of Panan continent.</p><br/><p>I immediately began to scheme. I first had to ensure my safety, then Ren, Lebuik, and the children\u2019s safety. I had to come up with a way to make the El Patiz with the Hero\u2019s power to come into my brain.</p><br/><p>At first, I wanted to make use of the bug acting as Uruto. I intentionally put him on Lotte\u2019s back and acted as if I was exhausted. Then, at the critical moment, I used Sky God\u2019s Play and escaped. I was surprised that there were two bugs that could take the Hero\u2019s power, but it didn\u2019t matter since I was able to destroy one of them. Once there was only one bug that could do so, the bug inside Panan continent\u2019s Hero had to face me.</p><br/><p>My plan\u2019s chance of success had risen greatly.</p><br/><p>After that, I freely used Sky God\u2019s Play and decimated the monsters. It was a simple psychological trick. From the beginning, I used a powerful skill to protect myself from the bug. By showing that I couldn\u2019t use that skill anymore, I let the El Patiz lower their guard. In other words, I hid the potential existence of a skill like Absolute Soul with Sky God\u2019s Play.</p><br/><p>Even if I didn\u2019t use Sky God\u2019s Play and used something like my physical ability to defense against the first bug, the El Patiz might have been more cautious. However, I left a strong impact with Sky God\u2019s Play and showed that the ability was no longer usable. With that, they would think that I didn\u2019t have any other methods. Presumably, that was why they acted without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Although it was rather simple, in the heat of battle, it was hard to consider something like it. Feints easily tricked people, especially a double-layered feint. As I acted proud when I used Sky God\u2019s Play and acted like I was troubled when it ended, the enemy had fallen for it even more.</p><br/><p>Although the El Patiz didn\u2019t try to eat my brain on the spot, that was still within my expectation. It didn\u2019t matter if it did or didn\u2019t try to eat my brain. As long as it entered the range of Caduceus, that was enough.</p><br/><p>After I obtained Absolute Soul, I thought of using the backlash from Caduceus to my benefit.</p><br/><p>Caduceus was the scepter representing Hermes. There were two snakes coiling around it \u2013 one that represented death or plague, and one representing healing and regeneration. Although there were other theories, the Caduceus snakes I had at least represented those meanings.</p><br/><p>Caduceus had two abilities. First came from the black snake. As one could see from how it was used in the Luka continent, its use was offensive. When someone with a lower level or league damaged me, I could return the damage completely. If our levels were the same, the damage done would simply disappear as if it never happened. However, it had an equally great flaw. When used against an enemy stronger than me, the damage done to the enemy would be transferred to me.</p><br/><p>As enemies stronger than me generally had higher leagues, using the black snake against them was not a good idea. On the other hand, there really wasn\u2019t a reason to use them against those weaker than me. After all, I had numerous ways of dealing with weak enemies. As such, it really only came into use that one time against Shina in the Luka continent.</p><br/><p>This time, however, I used Caduceus\u2019 flaw to my advantage. The damage received by the enemy included the mind\u2019s corrosion by the El Patiz. Although I wasn\u2019t 100% certain, message noona confirmed it when I asked her. Even though she didn\u2019t answer me most of the time, she was quick to do so whenever I was in a Dimensional Mercenary mission.</p><br/><p>In any case, Caduceus\u2019 power forcefully overwrote the damage done to Panan continent\u2019s Hero to myself. As I had become completely immune to corrosions, I could destroy the El Patiz the moment it entered my brain. I was worried that it would escape, so I was perfectly prepared to use Sky God\u2019s Rage. However, everything turned out perfectly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu, kuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>First, I pulled out the claymore in my stomach. Then, along with the Hero\u2019s corpse, I put it inside my inventory. Blood spurted out of my stomach, and I could feel the strength leaving my body. With no other choice, I took out the Elixir Ludia gave me and drank it. I immediately recovered completely, and the gaping wound on my stomach sealed up as if it never existed. Plus, the Elixir was extremely tasty. It was sweet and refreshing, but hard to describe more in detail. I had never had something like it.</p><br/><p>I then realized that the Elixir bottle had a very fancy design. When I was observing it with interest, someone finally spoke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 What happened!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe died!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Hero\u2019s power\u2026 The Hero\u2019s power was taken! I can tell! Our blessing was taken back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there another that can hold the Hero\u2019s power?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re all gone. We have to wait for another\u2019s birth!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, kill him! Seize what belongs to us!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed they had finally come to a conclusion. The monsters, humans, and beastmen being controlled by the El Patiz all glared at me. However, I leisurely stuffed the Hero\u2019s power in the crystal bottle in my hand and sealed it. Then, I turned around and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cRen, Lebuik! We\u2019re done here. Let\u2019s go back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRen-nim fainted!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSlap him awake! Return to the dungeon before they come!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about you!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>For destroying the world\u2019s enemy, all skill levels had increased by 1. Return was now level 9. While I put 16 skill points into it, I answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go back to Earth with the children.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You mastered Return! Up to ten times a day, you can teleport to set locations with nine other people. You can set up to ten teleport locations, but they cannot be in other dimensions.]</p><br/><p>Perfect. The skill effect practically doubled! I smiled and shot up to the sky. After seeing Lebuik wake Ren up and return to the dungeon, I flew to the ocean while cutting down the monsters in my path.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop him! Retrieve the Hero\u2019s power!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReclaim the prosperity of El Patiz!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHail El Patiz!\u201d</p><br/><p>How noisy. While many monsters fell to the ground as stones, many of them also only became slightly weakened as they continued to charge toward me. They really were desperate.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve stolen our hope!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou evil Hero!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you say that considering what you did to this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you be able to say that after your world lost its power!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Do I look like a fool? Eat Crimson Roar, you bugs!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the very moment, I was undoubtedly at the center of the world! The world became dyed in crimson flames. In it, only I could breathe freely.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaang!]</p><br/><p>[Capture him!]</p><br/><p>[Get him before he enters the dungeon!]</p><br/><p>[The ocean! He\u2019s going in the ocean!]</p><br/><p>Crimson Roar bought more time than I expected. By the time the El Patiz found a way to see through the flames, I had the ocean surface right in front of me. Now that I was here, there was no need to hesitate.</p><br/><p>[No!]</p><br/><p>[Nooooooo!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>I dove in. With Talaria allowing me to maneuver myself freely, I went in deeper and deeper. When I looked back, the monsters, humans, and beastmen that had thrown their bodies to stop me were spurting out blood and disintegrating. Although I was somewhat skeptical, they really were incompatible with ocean water.</p><br/><p>I left the screams of despair behind and found the Crystal Lair deep inside the ocean. It wasn\u2019t hard to find with Aikan sitting on the ocean floor. The Crystal Lair was sitting on Aikan\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Daisy caught sight of me, and realizing what was inside the crystal bottle on me, she messaged me with a dumbfounded face.</p><br/><p>[You really\u2026 did it.]</p><br/><p>[Sorry, but don\u2019t fall for me.]</p><br/><p>[Stupid.]</p><br/><p>I landed on Aikan\u2019s back and entered the Crystal Lair. The children all jumped in my embrace with frowns. The rabbit-eared girl Elfa was crying as if she washed up face with tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cHiing, I thought oppa was going to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, where\u2019s Ren oppa?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the knight noona?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid they die? Ren oppa died? Uwaaaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down, guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>I held them and calmed them down.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re both alive and kicking. Though\u2026 Ren is probably a bit depressed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Ren entered the dungeon, I saw his drooped lion ears. Deific Manifestation and Ogre Power was most likely his trump card, but it had been defeated easily. Although he was powerful, his enemy wasn\u2019t one that he could defeat with raw physical power.</p><br/><p>That said, I was still surprised by his strength and felt great potential in him.</p><br/><p>Although his overzealous personality would need some fixing, Ren had the talent and will to become much stronger. He also had a clear goal \u2013 to protect the children and to defeat the El Patiz controlling the Panan continent.</p><br/><p>His will was deserving of respect, and I conveniently had an ownerless Hero\u2019s power, which I didn\u2019t mind giving to someone who would help me when needed. This power belonged to the Panan continent. What I was thinking of doing with it was undoubtedly the correct choice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll get myself a new guild member, too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExpression, wicked.\u201d</p><br/><p>I responded to Daisy\u2019s murmur with a smile. The crying children looked at Daisy and me curiously. I waved my hand to tell them it was nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go to oppa\u2019s home. We can meet up with Ren and Lebuik there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa\u2019s home? We don\u2019t have to be underwater?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. We\u2019ll be away from here for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>The day you return to this continent, I hope you will be excellent warriors.</p><br/><p>I whispered in an inaudible voice and used Return. The destination was my home on Earth. Panan continent\u2019s Dimensional Mercenary mission had ended.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

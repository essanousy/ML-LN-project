Those That Climb the Dungeon (3)</p><br/><p>I succeeded in evolving my Crown Prince title to the Crown Prince of 40F. The rumor that the Crown Prince had appeared on the 40th floor began to spread among other continents\u2019 explorers, and my party instantly filled up whenever I created a party. As I hunted the reaper three times every day, I was allowing up to 27 explorers to advance to the 41st floor every day. Of course, this was only in the case that everyone did their jobs and managed to survive. In reality, the number of people that advanced was less than half of that number.</p><br/><p>From what I saw, there were about 1,500 people that were stuck on the 40th floor without being able to advance. In other words, after about a hundred days, most of the explorers would have advanced. However, after two weeks, my party stopped being filled up completely.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re content as it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>An old magician who left his party behind to join mine told me after the raid ended.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve stayed like this for dozens of years. Imagine if you were in their shoes and you were suddenly given the opportunity to grow. Some will be happy, of course. Some might even tear up and thank you\u2026 But there will also be a considerable amount of people that become scared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause the weight on their shoulders would get heavier. The stronger you get, the more responsibility you have to bear. Plus, if you become stronger not by your own strength, but by borrowing someone else\u2019s, you will hit another wall. They don\u2019t want to see others looking at them with expectations, then becoming disappointed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Swallowing the Soul Strengthening Elixir, I listened to the old man silently. Since I never had to bear the heavy weights they were carrying, I didn\u2019t have the right to say anything.</p><br/><p>Getting stuck, breaking through, getting stuck, stuck, stuck. After repeating it for dozens of years, how much did they suffer?</p><br/><p>As First Dungeon explorers, which only the most talented people were chosen to become, they undoubtedly received countless looks of envy, jealousy, and expectations. Near the end of their lives, when they realized they would only remain as mediocre warriors, how much shame would they have felt? Not to mention, for dozens of years, they would have only survived without improving\u2026 Would any passion or courage remain in their hearts? Would they be willing to challenge themselves again? Would they, who understood failure and defeat, be able to endure the expectations they would receive?</p><br/><p>I asked the old man.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the reason you came to defeat the reaper with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that even a question?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old magician answered with a grin.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m an explorer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve failed a countless number of times, and countless numbers of people, who placed their expectations on me, turned their backs and left. I also just spent my days like the others. I\u2019ve already climbed 40 floors, I\u2019ve done well. Telling myself such excuses, I continued to lie to myself. But then you came. It was then that I snapped out of it. If I didn\u2019t take on the challenge now, I realized I might never get another opportunity. Even if I might end up kneeling somewhere, I want to see what lies beyond this place. I want to let the blood in this old body boil.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old magician shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already experienced it for dozens of years! Even if I fail again, I wouldn\u2019t be losing anything! I\u2019m happy, I\u2019m extremely happy that I can finally get out of this floor! Even if I can\u2019t advance beyond the 41st floor! Even if it might only be an old man\u2019s bravado! I will go on. Because this heart is the only thing that proves that I am an explorer of the First Dungeon! So? Did that answer your question?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>I smiled brightly as I answered. His words pierced deep into my heart, and I couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can definitely climb higher. I guarantee it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa! If Crown Prince is saying that, I will believe it! Hahahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>He laughed wholeheartedly, then he left my party and disappeared.</p><br/><p>I had taken a jab when I had least expected it. But I wasn\u2019t displeased in the slightest. In fact, he had fanned my burning heart. Talking with the old magician, I was once again able to think about what a dungeon explorer was.</p><br/><p>However, when I left the Floor Master room, I saw Lin with his usual unenthused expression. But, eh? Something about him seemed...</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Lin? Are you evolving?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not evolving, but I\u2019m being promoted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin did not have his usual cigarette as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, and it\u2019s as Guild Master\u2019s substitute\u2026 What a headache. This is all your fault.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuild Master\u2019s substitute? What about Loretta?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I said that, Lin shot me a glare. His fiery eyes were really burning. How cool. I wondered if I could get a skill like that\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what a huge mess has happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t. Explain please.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKu, for the first time in several hundreds of years, noonim made a request to the Lord personally. To take down the 4,187 puppets in charge of the Floor Shops and to replace them with Fairy Garden and other administrative guild\u2019s members.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know Loretta was in charge of 4,187 Floor Shops with her puppets. It must have been tough. While I was trying to digest what I just heard, Lin was continuing his talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord has to listen to noonim\u2019s request. She\u2019s done an incredible amount of work for the First Dungeon\u2019s explorers, and she contributed a lot of other administrative duties\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta did, huh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe also put in several additional clauses, but what she wants is obvious\u2026 She wants to focus on supporting you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Not with a puppet, but with her real body. She wants to exclusively be your supporter. Even though she\u2019s Fairy Garden\u2019s guild master\u2026 Well, you are a Hero and the most famous rookie in the dungeon. Plus, since humans have short lifespans, Lord had to accept at least this much. The problem is, I\u2019m the one who has to work more because of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was wondering why Lin was complimenting me, but he was lashing out instead. Hearing what Lin said about Loretta wanting to support me with her real body, I thought back to her recent confession. To spend her daily life with me, she had made such a move. I couldn\u2019t help but be amazed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, let me ask something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin spoke as he stared at me fixedly.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Did you do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD-Do what!? No, I didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo something did happen. I doubt you made the first move, so it was noonim? Haa, how bold of her. She must have gotten impatient\u2026 So? What happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin, this was what you wanted to ask from the start, right?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and answer. What happened? Did you do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything! I-It\u2019s on hold!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin looked at me with a dumbfounded expression, then spat on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou hopeless bastard\u2026 Do you even have \u2018it\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I answered with a serious expression, Lin simply sighed. Then, he finally took out a cigarette and asked with a more serious voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make noonim cry. She\u2019s more frail and pure than you\u2019d think. I warned you, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 got it. I got it, so stop glaring at me like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, I said what I wanted to, so I\u2019m leaving. Good luck further on. Don\u2019t die and don\u2019t fall. From what I can see, you\u2019re one of the few with potential in this entire dungeon, so don\u2019t lose your spirit no matter who you\u2019re up against. Got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Thanks, Lin. Good luck too, being the guild master substitute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArgh\u2026 Yeah. I\u2019m off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin faded away. I stared fixedly at the place he was standing, then turned away. I could still hunt the reaper one more time. The grind wasn\u2019t over yet. However, someone interrupted me. It was Ye-Eun.</p><br/><p>[I broke through the 20th floor!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting faster and faster. Did you do it solo?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yeah! This guy tries to act cool, but he\u2019s super weak. After being beaten up, he used something called Dragon Skin and kept slamming the ground with his spear, but he couldn\u2019t do anything when I just stayed glued to the ceiling.]</p><br/><p>So you could do that! No, ordinary explorers wouldn\u2019t be able to stay on the ceiling on for that long! As I thought, Ye-Eun had a natural talent as an assassin. Thinking that she might actually catch up to me, I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you tried using Deific Manifestation?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Y-Yeah.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Why is your voice shaking?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Scary. Deific Manifestation is scary.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy!? What\u2019s scary!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[It hurts. Training is too hard.]</p><br/><p>She was talking in short phrases like a kid. It must have been really difficult\u2026 Even while I was feeling troubled, I tried to act calm.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must have met a good teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>[She\u2019s a vicious woman. Shin, save me. I want to see you so much.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can see each other soon. Once you clear up to the 25th floor, we can go out for a drink.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Really? Okay, I\u2019ll try my best! I\u2019ll hurry!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, good luck. Ah, what magic did you get on the 10th floor? Did you also get Spirit Mastery?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I thought Spirit Mastery was prepared for my Elementalist abilities, the solo clear rewards seemed to be fixed. From the rewards Ren told me about and with Ye-Eun also getting Deific Manifestation on the 5th floor, I was pretty sure of it. However, what Ye-Eun said next surprised me.</p><br/><p>[Ah, I got something called Shadowsword Mastery. It\u2019s super fun! If I hold my dagger and attack, my shadow attacks one more time! Or I can add my shadow\u2019s power to me directly and hit harder! It\u2019s super good!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, that\u2019s so cool!\u201d</p><br/><p>So the 10th floor reward was different! It was the perfect skill for Ye-Eun who was focused on attacking. Even while I was writhing in jealousy, I tried to act cool and congratulated her.</p><br/><p>[Shin, what floor are you in now?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m grinding on the 40th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Then I\u2019ll catch up soon!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see. If you look down on the dungeon, you\u2019ll regret it. Be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I, I don\u2019t look down on it. I really don\u2019t. Uk, I\u2019ll get scolded again. Master will scold me.]</p><br/><p>\u201cJust who did you summon\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even I felt slight fear at Ye-Eun\u2019s master that I had not met yet.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes: N/A</p><br/>\n</div>"}

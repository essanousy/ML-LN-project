The Rondo of Scarlet Flame and Silver Ice (3)</p><br/><p>After slurping down the noodles in my mouth, I scanned her. She was short, perhaps about 130 centimeters tall. Her face and build were small. She had long silver hair that flowed down to her waist and shined like transparent ice. Her skin was milky white, while her eyes were rosy pink. Silver hair and red eyes. I murmured as I held up my spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs she not human\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s albinism, idiot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya put down the bowl of ramen she was holding and said as she knocked me on my head. Damn, it\u2019s not like I knew everything!</p><br/><p>I remembered with what Hwaya said. Albinism. It was the condition where one\u2019s skin or hair appeared white due to lack of melanin. I knew about it too. Even though I knew, I\u2019ve only seen it once in a lion in Africa!</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you France\u2019s SS ranker?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya asked. I also suspected that she was a ranker. Although she looked young, the overwhelming mana she possessed easily matched an SS ranker\u2019s mana and even neared Hwaya\u2019s and mine. It was also the reason I thought she wasn\u2019t human. Really!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 Illina.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHi. I\u2019m Hwaya Mastiford.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Hwaya wave her hand, the girl did the same. Then, she replied with her small pink lips. I couldn\u2019t help but notice her refined doll-like features.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you\u2026 eating that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want some, too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You\u2019ll give it to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya smiled and called her over.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome here. No matter how much mana you have, it\u2019s better to be warm than cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was told not to go near people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go near people?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. They would die if I did.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDie? Who?\u201d</p><br/><p>While Hwaya was tilting her head curiously, I asked, feeling relieved.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Russia\u2019s SS ranker, right?\"</p><br/><p>She nodded very candidly.</p><br/><p>\u201cUn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, Shin! Didn\u2019t the prime minister say that Russia\u2019s SS ranker was male!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, now that I think about it, I don\u2019t think he said it clearly. I just kind of assumed. Plus, if she\u2019s alone, she fits the description of Russia\u2019s SS ranker perfectly. If you want to be sure, take off your choker.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya took off her choker like I suggested. Then, she gestured for us to talk. I asked her again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do people die when you go near them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause\u2026 everyone becomes like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Illina waved her hand. Then, ice crystals formed like fluttering flowers. The space her hand touched all turned into ice, which stayed afloat in the air.</p><br/><p>I looked back at Hwaya. She nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, that was Russian.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c*Slurp*, so Russia\u2019s SS ranker has an ice ability\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t control it\u2026? *sip*\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond Master, I heard, *slurp*, kids who awaken abilities, *nom*\u2026 have trouble controlling their abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>The others each slurped noodles or sipped on the soup as they murmured. I wish they\u2019d choose between eating or talking. In any case, it seemed the prime minister had lied. Even so, how could they be so relaxed in front of such a powerful ability user!? I glared at them, then faced Illina again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that because you can\u2019t control it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. Because Illina can\u2019t control it, everyone said to stay away.\u201d</p><br/><p>So that was why\u2026 From a while ago, she kept her distance without approaching us. However, she wasn\u2019t moving away either. In fact, as we conversed, she was getting closer to the pot surrounded by chaos flames. It was then that I realized three weeks had passed since she came here.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you eat until now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGolems.\u201d</p><br/><p>Golems\u2026 In other words, ice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBats\u2026 and rats\u2026 and armors.\u201d</p><br/><p>In other words, ice. Ei!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was probably thanks to your mana, but I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re still alive. Come on, eat. We have lots.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if I go\u2026 you\u2019ll die\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one here is weak enough to die from something like that. Don\u2019t worry and come over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom and Dad also said they wouldn\u2019t die, but they did. The Ajusshi from TV also died. The oppa that said I was pretty also died. The Ajusshi who was mad at me died, and the people that came in here also died after saying they wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>I became lost for words. She was staring intently at the pot, almost as if what she said had nothing to do with her. But that couldn\u2019t be the case. There wasn\u2019t anyone who would feel nothing after killing their parents.</p><br/><p>But I understood why the Russian government wanted me to kill her. How could they control a girl who lost her parents because she couldn\u2019t control her powers? Plus, the people that entered this dungeon must have been S ranked at the very least, and they died too\u2026 She turned around, leaving me behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cBye.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><br/><p>I shouted instinctively, feeling that I had to stop her. I was confident that she wouldn\u2019t be able to hurt Hwaya or me, but from the way she was acting, it didn\u2019t look like she\u2019d touch us easily. When I thought about the reason Illina recklessly came into the dungeon, I became more certain.</p><br/><p>Before she walked away, I hurriedly summoned Ruyue. As soon as Ruyue saw her, she exclaimed in surprise.</p><br/><p>[Wow! She\u2019s colder than Shin!]</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, give this to her. Make sure that it doesn\u2019t get colder. Can you do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yeah! I can do it now!]</p><br/><p>I took out a bowl, putting some ramen noodles in it along with chopsticks. Ruyue made it float with her power and carried it to Illina. Seeing the bowl float toward her, Illina widened her eyes and accepted it. Then, she became even more surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 won\u2019t freeze\u2026! It\u2019s hot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, my friend helped me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>With her eyes still opened widely, she picked up the chopsticks. After struggling with it for a bit, she frowned and muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHold on, I\u2019ll get you a fork.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fork was also delivered with Ruyue\u2019s power. After eating ramen for the first time, Illina stuck out her tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpicy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, was it too spicy for a kid?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a kid!\u201d</p><br/><p>A small ice appeared above her tongue. Then, it became dew. So this was how she was drinking water! Although she did it effortlessly, it was nonetheless an amazing skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpicy. It\u2019s spicy\u2026 but it\u2019s hot. I couldn\u2019t eat anything hot after Mom died\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWarm\u2026 Delicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 *Sniffle*\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, the ramen is too spicy! It\u2019s making me cry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Father, if you\u2019re going cry, do it quietly like Ludia and Sumire! Don\u2019t make dumb excuses!</p><br/><p>Illina then finished the ramen I gave her and even drank the entire soup. Looking at her reddened face, it was obvious that it was an expression of \u2018I finished it because it was hot, but I can\u2019t handle the spiciness.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want ice cream?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like ice cream. It\u2019s too cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want caramel, then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn.\u201d</p><br/><p>While I delivered caramel to her with Ruyue, the party members were all watching this strange exchange. They were eating ramen while crying silently or wiping their eyes. Hwaya made an indiscernible expression and messaged me.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s like you\u2019re taming her!]</p><br/><p>[\u2026 I can\u2019t deny that.]</p><br/><p>Illina finished the caramel as well. Her expression had become much more relaxed thanks to the caramel\u2019s sweetness. At least, that was how it looked. Now was my chance.</p><br/><p>I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIllina, why did you come here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ajusshi from TV told me that people wouldn't die if I came here. I came in because I didn\u2019t want to kill people\u2026 but other people entered and died.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat son of a bitch.\u201d</p><br/><p>I still didn\u2019t have the full picture. However, I somewhat understood. Illina caused many casualties, including her parents. The Russian government probably wanted to exploit her even if they had to make sacrifices. After all, any sacrifice was acceptable in front of the SS ranker title.</p><br/><p>Of course, the sacrifices they had to make ended up being too big for them to handle. In the end, they decided to throw her away. \u2018Luckily,\u2019 an SS ranked gate had conveniently appeared. They probably hoped that she\u2019d die on her own.</p><br/><p>What I couldn\u2019t understand was why Guardian sent a team of ability users to conquer the dungeon. Did they try to exploit the Russian government\u2019s plan?</p><br/><p>No, wait.</p><br/><p>\u201cIllina, when did you come in here?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cA month and a half ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was about 3 weeks prior to when Guardian\u2019s team entered. I see, if they couldn\u2019t hear from her for three weeks, it made sense that they thought she was dead! However, that would mean Illina didn\u2019t eat properly for a month and a half. So an SS ranker\u2019s magic power was this powerful! Illina\u2019s seemed to be especially special.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, we\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, I was thinking the same thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>After answering Hwaya, I looked at Illina. She also looked at me. Her indescribably mystical rose-pink eyes seemed to be sucking me in.</p><br/><p>\u201cIllina, if you want\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>While I was still talking, she suddenly bowed. I began to feel uneasy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks to you, I had some pasta for the first time in a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t really pasta, but if you want, Illina, we can make you more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKind people and good people\u2026 I don\u2019t want to freeze people like them anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait. We won\u2019t freeze even if you touch us! I can touch you directly! Plus, I have a friend that can control fire and heat\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place is dangerous. You should run away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, Illina!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBye.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, she quickly disappeared. I couldn\u2019t feel her presence anymore. The only thing left was the bowl that had fallen to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, she just did a dine and dash\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, your ability to cloud the issue sometimes surprises me, but now isn\u2019t the time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya looked even angrier than me. She gritted her teeth and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cRussia, those arrogant bastards! They didn\u2019t call me, the greatest fire ability user, to control an ice ability user!? They\u2019ll pay for this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the one clouding the issue!?\u201d</p><br/><p>We argued for a while, forgetting about the matter with Illina. However, there was one thing we agreed on. It was that Guild Revival\u2019s tenth member had just been decided.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

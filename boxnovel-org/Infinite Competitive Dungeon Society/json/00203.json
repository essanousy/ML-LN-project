Second Season (6)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Chapter 203. Second Season (6)</p><br/><p>Four days after the thrashing phase began, with Ren finally reaching the 60th floor, I decided to fight the 60th Floor Master with him. Since I had to grind the Floor Master anyway, if I brought Ren in, I could save Party Member Scarecrows and train Ren at the same time. It was killing two birds with one stone! Of course, I didn\u2019t forget to tell Ren about \u2018Ten Times a Day, You Monster\u2026\u2019 and help him buy them.</p><br/><p>Though Ren was a bit lacking in qualifications, it seemed that staying as the last explorer in his world while protecting children earned him some favors. More importantly, as he had become a Hero, he could buy \u2018Ten Times a Day, You Monster\u2026\u2019 more easily.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Why didn\u2019t you change this thing\u2019s name yet!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get bad luck if you change the name of a finalized product!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true! Though the product is still relatively new, so it might be okay\u2026 But Eleine said I can\u2019t change its name even if I died! She said something about it being a revolutionary name that was hard to come by\u2026 I wonder, is there a special language spirit in it? But it\u2019s rare for there to be a language spirit I don\u2019t know of\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wait, did Loretta not realize the euphemism behind this name!? This small yet not so small difference between Eleine and Loretta\u2026 It almost made me cry. Seeing Loretta tilting her head, I lightly patted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, I\u2019m happy that Loretta is Loretta. Don\u2019t change\u2026 At least, don\u2019t change when I\u2019m not watching.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What!? Even if you say something so sweet, I won\u2019t give you anything! Ehehe\u2026 Here, here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though that was what she said, she flapped her ears as if to fly away and picked up items like potions, entrance tickets, and Party Member Scarecrows and put them in my hands. I was worried she might be fired from her administrative guild master position at this rate. Or maybe, Loretta wanted that to happen.</p><br/><p>Then, when I was organizing the handful of items I got from Loretta with mixed feelings, Ren asked me.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince, there\u2019s something I want to ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it, Ren?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you help me understand what\u2019s so strange about this \u2018Ten Times a Day, You Monster\u2026\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>I paused with my hand still in my inventory and fell silent. Ren\u2019s ears perked up, seeming to say, \u2018I\u2019m listening, Teacher!\u2019 Looking at his innocent face, I spoke seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s not something to brag about, Ren. It\u2019s really not! I mean, it\u2019s not something people who understand can brag about either, but\u2026 Damn it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cC-Calm down, Crown Prince! Uwuuuuuk!\u2019</p><br/><p>With Ren with me, the already quick Floor Master battles ended even quicker. We each just had to hit it once or twice and it was over. After using Frozen Roar to increase our abilities for 5 minutes, we defeated the Floor Master twice. Although it would\u2019ve been nice if we could use Ren\u2019s Golden Lion\u2019s Roar, he said it was only usable when he was using Deific Manifestation. Considering how powerful the skill was, it was understandable.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is my ancestor, the Golden Lion. It really is an honor. Though, I never understood why he came to me instead of my Father who was the Hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, ancestor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to the legend, he was blessed by the gods and had the ability to transform into a Golden Lion in battle. With the body of a beast and rationality of a human, he ruled over the continent as the strongest warrior. My unsightly display was because I couldn\u2019t accept his power completely. It\u2019s really quite embarrassing.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I didn\u2019t know how to respond, I simply nodded and urged him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s continue with our fun thrashing time so Ren can wield his power better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince is\u2026 evil! But sorry, I have to go make food for the kids.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Right! Ren wasn\u2019t alone. Along with Lebuik, he had to take care of the livelihoods of seven children. I nodded feeling awkward.</p><br/><p>\u201cG-Go ahead. I\u2019ll see you later then, Ren.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to come also? I\u2019m going crazy because Elfa keeps crying, saying that she wants to see Crown Prince. She won\u2019t stop talking about Crown Prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, later. I\u2019ll bring presents.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, okay. I\u2019ll tell Elfa that Crown Prince will come by within 4 days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Wait, Ren!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren left the dungeon before I could stop him. Damn, he got me. Now that things turned out like this, Elfa would hate me if I didn\u2019t come visit within 4 days. After telling myself that I\u2019d reward Ren with thrashing full of love, I headed back to the guild house.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIna.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I entered the guild house, Ina ran into my embrace. Although she could fly if she wanted, she still liked to run as it was a habit from before she got her ability. Since she likely ran into her parents\u2019 arms when they were alive, it made sense.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you were working hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn! I worked hard and became Gold rank!\u201d</p><br/><p>In other words, she had broken through the 50th floor. I knew she was climbing fast, but I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be this fast. I also realized that the freezing energy she was giving off had gotten stronger. I softly stroked Ina\u2019s white hair and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like Ina\u2019s going to catch up to Daddy soon. Good job, it must have been hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot at all. It was fun! I can handle ice better now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right. All of Ina\u2019s abilities received support from the dungeon\u2019s system. It wouldn\u2019t be wrong to say that Ina received the most benefits from the dungeon\u2019s skill system. If she continued to work hard, she would be able to come in contact with ordinary people without fear of hurting them. Right, she just had to put in a bit more effort.</p><br/><p>Thinking about the day she would become independent, I hugged Ina tightly and rubbed my cheek against hers.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for working hard, Ina.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. Thank you too, Daddy.\u201d</p><br/><p>With us treating each other like real father and daughter, I felt like she had really become my daughter. Even though that wasn\u2019t possible, it was as if I was putting myself under a hypnosis.</p><br/><p>In truth, I was a bit surprised at first when Ina called me Daddy, but now, I didn\u2019t think it was so bad. Ina had gone through many hardships and had lost many things dear to her. If I had something she wanted, I was more than happy to give it to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try harder. I\u2019ll get stronger and protect Daddy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Is that what Mommy said?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. Ina and Mommy will protect Daddy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya, this girl, is she planning on making me a princess? I swore revenge and told Ina.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push yourself. Daddy will be sad if Ina gets hurt. Got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. Mommy, Ina, and Daddy can then be happy together!\u201d</p><br/><p>Though her words made me happy, Hwaya and I weren\u2019t real husband and wife, and I had to make Ina realize it one day. Thinking about how she\u2019d react, a sigh naturally came out. Of course, this was a matter for the far future. Since it was unclear whether our future was secure, it would be too overzealous on my part to be worrying about this at the moment. As such, I simply held Ina tighter without any words.</p><br/><p>Then, I handed Ina off to Hwaya and went back into the guild house with a final look. Ren would arrive soon. I had to prepare myself to beat\u2026 to train him.</p><br/><p>Just like that, a week had passed since the start of the thrashing phase.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wide open!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, I knew you\u2019d attack there!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPurposefully showing an opening and drawing in your opponent is an excellent tactic, but don\u2019t forget, there are people who can easily see through something so basic!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t lose! Kuaaaang!\u201d</p><br/><p>An important element in a fight between two people was seeing a few moves ahead of the opponent. If one could predict how the other person would move, it became much easier to achieve victory. Of course, even if one could read the other person, if he was lacking in speed and power to deal a fatal blow, it was useless.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>My wooden spear hit Ren\u2019s vital point, causing him to fall. As he had gone through a thrashing phase before, he could control himself to a certain extent. However, once his beast-like instinct showed signs of appearing, it was easy to provoke him and cause it to explode. I sighed. Then, just as I reached my hand out to help Ren up, I realized that there were people watching us.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s everyone doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? We\u2019re watching you fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeating him\u2026 to death? If he dies, tell me. Golden Lion, good undead material.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t die!\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how much Ren respected Daisy, it seemed he didn\u2019t want to work under her as a undead. Ren gritted his teeth and took up his stance again.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, Crown Prince!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re so worked up, it\u2019s going to end quicker than the last round.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you that\u2019s false!\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, after that, Ren ended up being knocked down in just 35 seconds. Other than little problems like this, the thrashing phase was progressing smoothly.</p><br/><p>However, not everything could work out so well and there were things that had to be taken care of no matter how painful it was. Around the time the 60th Floor Master grinding was ending, Hwaya gave the suggestion.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time to let everyone know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout the dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd about us and the danger, Earth is facing. It\u2019s time. Our guild is in the right position.\u201d</p><br/><p>At her words, I remembered something from what felt like a long time ago. When we first spoke, she said she wanted to create an organization of dungeon explorers to solve the danger Earth was facing. The organization she talked about then wasn\u2019t too different from Revival. If there was, it was who the guild master was. Interestingly enough, I did say that I\u2019d accept her offer if I became the organization\u2019s leader.</p><br/><p>\u201cRevival\u2019s members are all strong. As we are now, we won\u2019t lose to any external influence, be it Freedom Wing, Guardian, or countries. More importantly, we can\u2019t let people continue to do stupid things. The world could potentially end, and there are way too many people wasting military strength and fattening up monsters\u2019 bellies for short-term profits.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. We only have 23 months left too.\u201d</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t new. I had considered the matter long before Hwaya mentioned it. However, there were too many obstacles to do so at the moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill they believe us? It seems a bit absurd.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the world is going through is already absurd. What we\u2019re about to add isn\u2019t going to make it any more absurd.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have a good point.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s power behind the words of the strong. Of course, there\u2019s responsibility behind it as well. And you, you are the world\u2019s strongest. The Untouchable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop, that makes me cringe.\u201d</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t something only Hwaya and I could talk about. We immediately gathered everyone at the guild house and carefully discussed the details. Once we revealed the existence of the dungeon, the biggest problem would be appointing the explorer. There would undoubtedly be millions of people wanting to become explorers. Among them would undoubtedly be powerful influential people.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to set a requirement. It\u2019ll be near impossible to control every single explorer. What we need is a large number of powerful explorers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, let\u2019s not make all new explorers join Revival. Revival is a select group of the most powerful elites. The requirement to be an explorer will first be one\u2019s brains, then one\u2019s strength and potential for growth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. Our goal has to be increasing the number of explorers. At least for this part, we have to make sure to use Soul Contracts to control them. We can\u2019t let them waste explorer appointments on people that don\u2019t meet the requirements.\u201d</p><br/><p>For now, we decided to ban non-ability users from becoming explorers. Of course, it was still entirely possible that there might be ordinary people with extraordinary talent. I was like that initially. However, the chance of too small. It was overwhelmingly better to appoint someone with an ability. That way, they would surely become stronger and increase the number of explorers.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe contract we\u2019re going to make people sign is also important.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to give up what we need to give up. We can\u2019t force them to throw away their lives when the world\u2019s enemy comes, and we can\u2019t force them to climb the dungeon 12 hours a day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can just choose ability users that are already actively fighting monsters. People\u2019s personalities don\u2019t change that easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone like France\u2019s Laz Michel, huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll only require two things. First, purposefully not climbing the dungeon will be prohibited. Second, the explorers they appoint will have to be approved by us. Just this will increase the number of explorers on Earth and help us reach our goals.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEdward, if that\u2019s the case, it\u2019ll be better to put it details numbers for the first clause. We need to make sure that people don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re controlling them while making sure that they don\u2019t neglect their duties as dungeon explorers.\u201d</p><br/><p>While everyone was busy climbing the dungeon and training, they still made time to help with the contract and discuss how to tell the world about it. Yua was extremely happy that she was included in this talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t become an explorer, I would have never known about such an important talk. Ehehe, I\u2019m happy I can be of help, Oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always helpful, Yua.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHold it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia quickly put her hands between Yua and me. How dare she misunderstand the love between an Oppa and his younger sister!</p><br/><p>Anyhow, the contract went through several revisions and discussions before it was finalized. Meanwhile, I finished grinding the 60th Floor Master with 15 point increase to both magic and charm; killed the Thunder Power Knight, Beyond\u2019s Floor Master that was the combination of the Dark Ratman and Lizard Knight; as if that wasn\u2019t enough, I broke through the First Dungeon\u2019s 61st floor, Beyond\u2019s 11th floor, 62nd, 12th, 63rd, and 13th. This all happened in just 2 weeks.</p><br/><p>By the time I began climbing the First Dungeon\u2019s 64th floor, the contract was finished. As Revival\u2019s master and explorer of the First Dungeon and Beyond, I stood in front of the whole world.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe only have 2 years left. We have to protect Earth. We can\u2019t waste our time on useless things!\u201d</p><br/><p>The days when people scrambled to stop the onslaught of sudden monsters was long over. It was now time for us to make our appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re confident in your strength as an ability user, knock on Revival\u2019s doors at any time. The dungeon will help you become an excellent warrior that can sweep through the monsters and dungeons invading our world!\u201d</p><br/><p>Starting from now, humanity will strike back. All ability users will sweep away monsters invading Earth from a different perspective. The war between humanity and monsters, the second season had only just begun.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

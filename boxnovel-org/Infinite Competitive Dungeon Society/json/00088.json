S-ranker Yeon Hwawoo (5)</p><br/><p>[You equipped the Dullahan Set. Your strength and constitution increase by 17. When the Dullahan Set is equipped, you can use \u2018Outburst\u2019 once per day.]</p><br/><p>[Your brain is strengthened to its peak. Your intelligence and magic increase by 3. It seems consuming more of this item will have no further effect.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHu, it\u2019s over\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I wondered why, but it felt like I had finished grinding in only a day. In reality, it had taken a little over a month to do so. Although I almost died a few times in the process, I managed to complete the grind without dying a single time. The sense of accomplishment made my confidence rise. More importantly, I got rid of my habit of trying to take out Floor Master skills whenever something happened.</p><br/><p>My mental protection was much better as well. I still thought my intelligence update was slow, but I would not make the same shameful mistake again as I did at the MT.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad the set equipment skill is Outburst. In the worst case scenario, it could have been Sudden Rise\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s creepy.]</p><br/><p>[Scary!]</p><br/><p>Peika and Ruyue shouted in disgust at my monologue. Someone on the floor getting beaten suddenly getting up. It was indeed something from a horror movie. I patted Peika and Ruyue while laughing, and saved Outburst in the 7 o\u2019clock position. Even though I shouldn\u2019t rely too much on Floor Master skills, they were undoubtedly part of my strength. With these incredibly strong skills in my arsenal, I couldn\u2019t be unhappy.</p><br/><p>There were now 7 skills stored in Collector\u2019s Pocket Watch. Looking at the gems in the clock positions, I smiled. Tomorrow was the day I would go to Britain\u2019s Windermere. It was great that I could finish grinding the 35th floor before then. Starting from now, it was time to get to the 40th floor before Hwaya came to pick me up on a plane!</p><br/><p>Just when I was about to step on the staircase to the 36th floor, Ellos contacted me.</p><br/><p>[Shin! We broke through the 30th floor yesterday.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 That\u2019s really fast! It hasn\u2019t even been three months yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You see, we got more party members. It would have been nice to stick to just the three of us, but we realized we shouldn\u2019t be so adamant about it.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I learned a lot from you that day. The party members we added were explorers who had stayed on the 25th floor for years without being able to advance. Even if they couldn\u2019t break through the 25th floor, they had survived against the invaders during that time. Together, we challenged the Giant Ghoul, and though it\u2019s a bit embarrassing, we imitated you and managed to break through. We did get wiped out once on our way to the 30th floor, but we still managed to get here pretty fast. And\u2026 I\u2019m still surprised, but we managed to beat the 30th floor\u2019s Skeleton Knight without losing any party members. We were together with a pretty amazing explorer though.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing explorer?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yeah. It was a young man named Ren. We only had seven people including him, but he complained about something not dropping and didn\u2019t want to wait for more. I almost thought he was you, with how calm he was.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren! You finished grinding the 25th floor and were already on the 30th floor!?</p><br/><p>[He was really amazing. He still couldn\u2019t be compared to you, but his planning, movements, and claymore techniques were truly excellent. We were really shocked when he pushed the Skeleton Knight back in a one on one fight. Fighting against a Floor Master alone\u2026 I didn\u2019t think there was another explorer who could do it other than you, Shin.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yeah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Thanks to him, we cleared the 30th floor in one go, and for helping my continent\u2019s explorers grow, his Highness allowed me to meet our continent\u2019s Hero. He even taught me a little. It was all thanks to you, Shin.]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s the result of your effort. I wouldn\u2019t say it was because of me. I\u2019m only taking care of myself, but you\u2019re also leading five other comrades. Ellos, you should be proud.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Thanks, Shin. One day, I hope I can stand by your side again.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t tell him that I had already finished grinding the 35th floor and was about to head to the 36th floor. However, the moment my conversation with Ellos ended, Palludia called me as well, almost as if they had planned it out together. Surprisingly, the content was the same as well.</p><br/><p>[I broke through the 30th floor! Without even a single party member dying! Kang Shin, where are you now?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI broke through the 35th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Oh, I see\u2026 well, it doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t care at all, I was just asking.]</p><br/><p>Although she sounded extremely disappointed, I didn\u2019t point it out and she didn\u2019t yield.</p><br/><p>[Anyways! Don\u2019t forget, you said you\u2019d come over this week with food from Earth!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I\u2019ll bring lots. You said you broke through without losing a single party member? That\u2019s great. Good work.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ah, mm. If you leave it to Palludia Gren Ehuir-nim, it\u2019s a piece of cake! \u2026 Though a slightly annoying guy helped us.]</p><br/><p>I suddenly felt a sense of uneasiness.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that person\u2019s name perhaps\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ren. He said his name was Ren. He was really tall, very muscular, and had messy blonde hair. He couldn\u2019t talk while facing me. He kept blushing, so it was annoying.]</p><br/><p>Ren\u2026! You couldn\u2019t look at Ludia because she was too pretty!</p><br/><p>[Apparently, he\u2019s been helping explorers advance since the 25th floor. I hear people are calling him the Golden Lion of 30F.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very interesting nickname.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the 25th floor and 30th floor, I beat the bosses solo, so I didn\u2019t really meet any other explorers. Although the 25th and 30th floor has less explorers than the lower floors, there were still quite a lot of people stuck there. As a result of Ren carrying them through in my place, he had received an excellent nickname!</p><br/><p>I made up my mind to call Ren \u2018Golden Lion\u2019 the next time I saw him. Thanking Ludia inwardly for letting me know this good piece of info, I ended the conversation. Then I received another message. When I checked who it came from, it was unexpectedly Ye-Eun.</p><br/><p>[Shin, I\u2019m not getting this compressing elixir thing.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>I tilted my head. Three weeks had passed since Ye-Eun became an explorer. Considering her abilities, she was rather slow. I was wondering why she was only just now contacting me, but it seemed there was a problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you defeat it solo?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ah, yeah, I did the first time and got a Deific Manifestation Magic Book. It said it was going to call someone. I got scared so I haven\u2019t tried it out yet.]</p><br/><p>\u201cTry it soon. Whoever gets summoned might be helpful. So, you didn\u2019t clear it solo after that?\u201d</p><br/><p>[No. I cleared it in a 10-man party, but it didn\u2019t come out. I tried again with 8 people just in case, but it didn\u2019t drop anything again.]</p><br/><p>\u201cReally\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Then I tried with 5 people, then 2, but it still didn\u2019t drop.]</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I didn\u2019t think Shin would lie to me, so I kept trying for two weeks after that, constantly changing the number of people in the party, but the compressing elixir never came out. The Floor Shop owner said he didn\u2019t know anything about it.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Her trust in me was\u2026 heavy\u2026!</p><br/><p>[But I had fun! Orc Lord was an interesting guy! The people in my party weren\u2019t scared of me either\u2026 hehe, I\u2019m having fun lately!]</p><br/><p>Fighting the Orc Lord was fun? She really had an innate talent for this. With a bitter smile that couldn\u2019t reach her, I spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask someone I know why the compressing elixirs won\u2019t drop. Just wait a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Okay.]</p><br/><p>I paused my conversation with her and thought for a while. Why didn\u2019t the compressing elixirs drop? What was the problem? As I couldn\u2019t think of any reason, I went and asked Lin. Lin was in the middle of inscribing something onto a gem radiating golden light. It seemed he was close to finishing the mental protection item I asked for. At this rate, wouldn\u2019t I break through the 40th floor first? No, it was good to have more than one way to protect myself from mental attacks. If possible, I should try to get as many skills and items that helped\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I distracting you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy concentration won\u2019t be shaken by just talking with you, so feel free.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright\u2026 Lin, you see, I made a friend of mine from Earth into a dungeon explorer. She\u2019s an A-rank Awakened from what I can tell.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer contribution should have been high enough, but compressing elixirs never appear on her reward list for defeating the Orc Lord. Do you know why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably not just the compressing elixir. She probably isn\u2019t getting boss set items either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin said casually. I instinctively understood.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a problem with her? Like having an ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? So you already know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what about me? I awakened my ability, but I could still obtain elixirs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou got your ability after you became a dungeon explorer. Not to mention, your ability is the type that grows along with your level and training. Of course your accomplishments would be acknowledged normally.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean my friend\u2019s accomplishments won\u2019t be acknowledged normally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Think about it. What do you think determines what comes up on reward lists from defeating bosses?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin asked me as he put the powder he shaved off from the gem into a separate bowl. After thinking about it for a bit, I answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t better items come out if you defeat the boss in a more technical and overwhelming way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re only partially right. You\u2019re missing one important thing. It\u2019s compared to your true ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean, because my friend\u2019s strength is above the standard, her accomplishments can\u2019t be assessed properly even if she defeats the Orc Lord overwhelmingly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. Looks like you\u2019re starting to use your head.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 Compared to other explorers, my stats are also above the standard from compressing and strengthening elixirs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re within the dungeon\u2019s scope, so you\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>In other words, things I gained from the dungeon\u2019s system didn\u2019t act as a minus when calculating my accomplishments. On the other hand, Ye-Eun, who became a dungeon explorer after already having an A-rank strength, had strength that went above the dungeon\u2019s standard. Since she defeated the Orc Lord with such strength, she could not get the appropriate reward from the Orc Lord. It was similar to how my superior strength lowered the reward of the B-rank Event Raid. It made sense.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe says she got the Deific Manifestation Magic Book and the title.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose are fixed rewards\u2026 Do I need to explain more?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. What floor does she need to get to before she can get proper rewards from the dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really care how strong your world\u2019s A-rank is. What rank are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cS-rank.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, taking into account how strong she would get from level-up stat bonuses and titles, probably\u2026 50th floor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh no, say goodbye to Skin Strengthening Elixirs, Ye-Eun. It was a good thing I didn\u2019t tell her about them. With a bitter smile, I told Ye-Eun what I\u2019d just heard. Ye-Eun seemed rather fine with it.</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s great! So I can just keep going up while defeating things alone, right?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, but don\u2019t skimp out on opportunities to grow your ability. Stealth and\u2026 what was it?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Dagger technique! I got two wooden daggers when I entered the dungeon. I like it, since it\u2019s a lot cleaner than fighting with my hands.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I see. Anyways, make sure you level those skills up. You\u2019re going to regret it later otherwise.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Thanks for worrying. See you later!]</p><br/><p>\u201cDeific Manifestation. Don\u2019t forget to try it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Okay! I\u2019ll catch up to you soon, so don\u2019t go too fast, okay?]</p><br/><p>With that, Ye-Eun ended our call. Sorry, Ye-Eun, I can\u2019t do that. There\u2019s a bet on the line..</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, Kang Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin was still digging at the gem as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat friend, she\u2019s a girl, right?\u201d[1. Pronouns are gender-neutral most of the time. Although he said \u2018she\u2019 in the translation, he hasn\u2019t actually revealed Ye-Eun\u2019s gender.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? A girl. Heh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin made an evil smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I felt it was weird that a Hero didn\u2019t have a girl or two. Kuku, noonim might end up only staring at the roof again, kukuku.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just friends, so don\u2019t misunderstand. And don\u2019t talk like there\u2019s something between Loretta and me. \u2026 Again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? You\u2019re curious? You\u2019re curious, eh? Maybe noonim has a chance this time. Ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2019m not curious at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 Yep, I wasn\u2019t curious. Nope, not in the slightest. I only asked just because. And since that was the case, I stepped on the 36th floor staircase with a totally fine expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat guy, he\u2019s quite agitated\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I only missed my step, ahuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt this rate, your vitality will hit zero from hitting the steps before you even make it to the 36th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>I, I\u2019m going to break through the 40th floor today! For sure!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

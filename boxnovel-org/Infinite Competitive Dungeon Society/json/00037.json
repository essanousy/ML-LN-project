Scale Knife</p><br/><p>6. 1,500 Gold]</p><br/><p>Looking at the list of rewards, I became speechless. Could it get any worse!?</p><br/><p>Although I got unlucky from time to time, today was too much. Was it because of Ren\u2019s stupid move in the middle? Because I was interested in what \u2018medicine\u2019 the Lizard Knight would drop, I couldn\u2019t help but be disappointed. In the end, I grabbed the Lizard Knight\u2019s Silver Spear.</p><br/><p>I\u2019d been meaning to replace my Orc Lord\u2019s Glaive. I couldn\u2019t keep tormenting it. It was time to use a spear that matched my level.</p><br/><p>Silver Spear was certainly a good spear. It was made out of some silver-colored metal and was very hard. Although it wasn\u2019t as long as the one Lizard Knight used, it was still about 3 meters long and had a very good thickness to it.</p><br/><p>The blade on the spearhead seemed long enough to be used for slashing, and the tip of especially sharp. I loved it. Whether in function or look, it satisfied me completely.</p><br/><p>Unlike with the Orc Lord\u2019s Glaive, the moment I held the Silver Spear, a message popped up.</p><br/><p>[By equipping the Lizard Knight\u2019s Silver Spear, your strength and dexterity increase by 2. The Lizard Knight Master title grants another 3 strength and dexterity.]</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. It was about time that weapons had effects like this! With a satisfied smile, I looked around at my party members.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t a happy atmosphere like I expected. Usually, when I defeated the Floor Master, everyone was happy no matter how big of a loss we suffered. However, the party members seemed to be angry. They were also all glaring at Ren.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople died because Ren-nim did unnecessary things!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour contribution points must have been cut too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince-nim was doing perfectly fine on his own! Because of Ren-nim\u2019s charge, Crown Prince-nim had to cancel his skill!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa, this is why you can\u2019t party with people from Panan continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry. It\u2019s all my fault. I have no excuse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, so that was it. I smirked. Dungeon explorers were people too. Most of them did nothing to contribute in the raid, and they must have felt bothered by it on the inside. It was a case of inferiority complex.</p><br/><p>In that situation, however, someone who was worse than them appeared: Ren. Although he was eager and passionate, his actions almost led to the party being wiped.</p><br/><p>These people just wanted to gain self-satisfaction by confirming that there was someone who was worse than them. They were telling themselves that they were better than that person. That they had more qualification.</p><br/><p>It was truly laughable.</p><br/><p>What really surprised me was Ren. Unlike the fiery temperament he showed in battle, he fully acknowledged his faults and was bowing his head in apology. Although it wasn\u2019t particularly commendable, most people in his place lashed out rather than apologize. He left a favorable impression on me. Since I also thought differently, I decided to cut in.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry. I should have told everyone about Lizard Knight\u2019s skill. Because of my hubris that I could stop it easily, I forgot. It\u2019s my fault. I apologize.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No! Crown Prince-nim did fantastic given the circumstances!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! We could only beat the Lizard Knight thanks to Crown Prince-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRen-nim, you realize Crown Prince-nim is trying to cover for your mistakes, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk\u2026 I apologize, your highness Crown Prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not a crown prince. Don\u2019t naturally treat me like royalty!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thanks to me, the party members that were scolding Ren calmed down and left with their rewards. Even though Ren made the great contribution of almost cutting the Lizard Knight\u2019s tail, because of a crucial mistake that led party members to their death, his final contribution was the lowest. As such, he held a Middle Potion and wore a melancholic expression. Middle Potion\u2026 I had only grabbed that thing once\u2026</p><br/><p>Ren clenched the hand with the Middle Potion and murmured as he trembled.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, whenever I enter a battle, I\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can think calmly in normal situations, but you become hotheaded in battle, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren looked at me with blank eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to challenge even though you know the taste of losing. You want to surpass those stronger than you. Because you don\u2019t want to lose, you do your best, or even bluff. Even when you end up becoming a mess and feel self-loathing, you can\u2019t stop yourself from doing it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-That\u2019s right! How did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was once like that. Answering him with that, I smiled at Ren. Excited, Ren jumped at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cH-How can I fix it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s even simpler. Do you want to fix it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! I\u2019m the Panan continent\u2019s only hope. Whether it\u2019s for those that died or for Sir Lebuik who chose me to become the dungeon explorer rather than other talented young men, I have to get stronger!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. I like your determination. I think I can be of help.\u201d</p><br/><p>I wanted one too, hehe. With all the new abilities I\u2019d gathered, I wanted to organize them. Although fighting against monsters was nice, beating up\u2026 I mean, sparring with someone strong was also good. I nodded my head in satisfaction and took out the Silver Spear I just got.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, fight with me first. You\u2019ll find your answer then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOoooh! Thank you, thank you! Crown Prince really is different!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot really. You won\u2019t thank me for long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I will thank you from the bottom of my heart!\u201d</p><br/><p>You really won\u2019t. Even as I murmured that, I smiled kindly. Just like that, I obtained a sturdy sandb\u2026 I mean, sparring partner.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren, who was collapsed on the ground, blurted out with malice. He was still alive, surprisingly. Sipping on Loretta\u2019s Fatigue Recovery Juice, I answered him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you, you won\u2019t thank me for long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d really kill me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout killing intent in your spear, how can you expect your enemy to bring out his all?\u201d</p><br/><p>I plugged a Fatigue Recovery Juice in Ren\u2019s mouth as well. Ren began to immediately suck it down.</p><br/><p>Loretta, who was watching me blankly from the side, asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cCustomer, you know you can\u2019t dispose corpses at my shop, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not dead yet, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren coughed out the juice he was drinking. It was a joke\u2026 but Ren seemed to have thought otherwise. I crouched down next to Ren.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo? Do you feel better after the spar?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were attacking me with a do-or-die attitude just now, but you\u2019re not now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m all out of energy.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was panting like he was about to die. However, his eyes were blazing even now. I liked it. He was just like me.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying, once you get your energy back, you\u2019ll come at me again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I really can\u2019t do anything about my competitive instinct.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019ll get fixed soon. Give it a month.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a rather specific number.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how long it took for father to fix my bad habits.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a refreshing smile, I answered Ren as I reminisced about the old days. It was when I was 14 years old. I had just dominated the friendly match competition against other martial arts clans\u2019 heirs and was feeling overly self-confident. I believed there was no one I couldn\u2019t defeat. It was also the time when I pestered father to quickly let me become a dungeon explorer.</p><br/><p>I still remembered it clearly. Father laughed, and staring into the sky, murmured, \u2018so it\u2019s that time for you too.\u2019</p><br/><p>That afternoon, I sparred with father. He beat me up into oblivion. Really. From head to toe, the only place where his wooden spear didn\u2019t hit were my testicles. Feeling spiteful, I challenged him again and again, like a moth to a flame. Father didn\u2019t go easy just because I was his son and really beat me up. He really was childish in that respect.</p><br/><p>That continued for a month.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd during that one month, I learned not to charge at the enemy directly, but to take my time and analyze the opponent. I learned how to wait for an opening to strike, and learned that it was always better to go for a gap in defense than to fight head on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cApparently, people from my lineage always had a phase where our strength went over our heads. During this period, whoever our teacher was had to beat us to discipline us. Because the teachers thrashed us so much, we called it the thrashing phase.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I first heard father talk about the thrashing phase, I felt it made great sense. However, Loretta who was listening from the side seemed to disagree.</p><br/><p>\u201cCustomer\u2019s father really is stupid. I didn\u2019t think there could be a stupider person than customer in the world\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike father like son\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRen, if you\u2019ve recovered enough to spout nonsense, you should be ready to go for a second round. Ah, we\u2019re going on another Lizard Knight raid in an hour too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Raid? How?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren tilted his head and asked. I was about to ask why he was asking such a stupid question, but realized that Ren did not know about the battle vouchers. When I looked at Loretta, she answered Ren\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cCustomer, do you wish to fight the Lizard Knight again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-There\u2019s a way to do that? Of course I do! I\u2019m Panan\u2019s Ren. If I don\u2019t get my revenge on the Lizard Knight, I will not be me anymore! I can only get stronger if I overcome him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about it, Loretta? He seems to have the qualifications you were talking about.\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what I liked about him in the first place. His fiery nature that was unlike other dungeon explorers. Of course, if I didn\u2019t think he had talent, I would have just thought he was stupid.</p><br/><p>When I asked Loretta with a wink, Loretta flushed her cheeks and dodged my gaze. Eh? Did I do something wrong just now?</p><br/><p>\u201cK-Kuhum. Fine. Although he doesn\u2019t quite meet my standards, since cus\u2026 since Shin-nim is with him, I\u2019ll sell it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSell? Sell what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren tilted his head and asked with a na\u00efve expression. Loretta beamed as she took out a handful of battle vouchers. Then, as usual, she said her sales line.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Floor Master Battle Voucher! Allowing you to overcome the limit of once per day fight and rechallenge the Floor Master! If you buy it now, you can get them for 4,000 gold each! Just 4,000 gold each, customer!\u201d</p><br/><p>You scammer!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

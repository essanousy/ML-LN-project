I Can Hear Your Voice (6)</p><br/><p>[Wow, a lightning elemental!]</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen one!]</p><br/><p>[How beautiful. She stole my heart.]</p><br/><p>[Heart\u2026 Thief?]</p><br/><p>[Ah, she\u2019s an Elementalist\u2019s contracted elemental!]</p><br/><p>I could hear the chatter of elementals all around me. Their radiant souls were lighting up the world in a way I had never seen before. The noble scenery charmed me completely, leaving me speechless.</p><br/><p>This all happened in the instant when I became aware of myself as an Elementalist. Although the elementals\u2019 wavelengths did not match mine, just knowing how many elementals there were in the world filled me with an indescribable emotion.</p><br/><p>[Master doesn\u2019t need to look at other elementals. Master has me.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, how reliable. But aren\u2019t you still weak?\u201d</p><br/><p>[T-That\u2019s\u2026 I\u2019ll get stronger soon!]</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t help but smile at the sight of Peika standing on my shoulder and declaring her intentions with her folding fan held high. I knew that Peika was a strong elemental and that she would continue to get stronger. She was a unique elemental with self-awareness and a name. She also had secrets I was unaware of. However, Peika right now was still weak.</p><br/><p>All elementals were like that. They were existences that grew stronger by continued communication with their contracted master. No elemental was strong from the moment it formed a contract. Well, there were, of course, exceptions.</p><br/><p>In general, by spending time together, the souls of the elemental and the Elementalist became similar, thus making the elemental stronger. The speed and the limit of growth, which differed for each elemental, determined the strength of an elemental. However, they all started at the same starting line.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get along, Peika.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Leave it to me! I am the lightning elemental Peika!]</p><br/><p>As I was enjoying my talk with my lovely partner, I suddenly recalled what I had planned for today.</p><br/><p>\u2018One last part.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Dark Ratman solo. I trembled slightly. Today\u2019s circumstance was a lot different than yesterday\u2019s. Let alone the Dark Ratman, I felt like I could defeat even the 25th Floor Master alone. With Peika\u2019s strength and Elemental Control\u2026!</p><br/><p>[Kang Shin-nim\u2019s contribution is the highest. Choose your reward.]</p><br/><p>[1. Dark Ratman\u2019s Leather Vest</p><br/><p>2. Middle Potion</p><br/><p>3. Dark Ratman\u2019s Leather Fedora</p><br/><p>4. 600 Gold</p><br/><p>5. Dark Ratman\u2019s Leather Glove.]</p><br/><p>There! I clenched my fists. If the equipment part I wanted did not drop, I would have had to fight the boss again. Thankfully, bringing four other people did the trick. Choosing the Dark Ratman\u2019s Leather Glove, I smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, Crown Prince-nim already picked an item, but there are still two set items left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince-nim is truly unparalleled in boss fights.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an Elementalist. They are people the likes of us can\u2019t begin to comprehend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come I\u2019ve never heard of Crown Prince-nim being an Elementalist?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe must have been hiding it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Like I said, Elementalists are people we can\u2019t comprehend.\u201d</p><br/><p>As my party members were writing a novel of their own, I confirmed the six Dark Ratman set equipment. Because weapons did not count towards the set, I never chose the Dark Ratman\u2019s Claw. The Wraith Queen Set had six parts to it, but it seemed the Dark Ratman Set would have seven.</p><br/><p>What I had now was the Dark Ratman\u2019s Leather Fedora, Dark Ratman\u2019s Leather Vest, Dark Ratman\u2019s Leather Belt, Dark Ratman\u2019s Leather Glove, Dark Ratman\u2019s Leather Pants, and finally, Dark Ratman\u2019s Leather Boots. Since it was unlikely that a shirt would be made out of leather, I suspected the last one would be a leather jacket. I was about to find out.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood work everyone. I\u2019ll be leaving now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Crown Prince-nim! As expected of a Hero!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn Elementalist, I\u2019m so jealous. I hope to see you on the 20th floor too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018That probably won\u2019t happen. By the time you\u2019re on the 17th floor, I\u2019ll have long since left the 20th floor.\u2019 Of course, I didn\u2019t let my thought escape my mouth. Wishing them good luck, I left the boss room. On the other side was Loretta, who I was seeing for the first time today.</p><br/><p>\u201cC-Customer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, on your shoulder\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh? She could see Peika? Although Elementalists could let others see their elementals, I had not done so. This could only mean that she was an Elementalist whose wavelength matched Peika, or\u2026</p><br/><p>[Faerie race! It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen a member of the Faerie race!]</p><br/><p>Peika shouted in surprise when she saw Loretta. With my guess having been confirmed, I nodded my head. The Faerie race, a mystical race that was represented by the well-known elves, fairies, hobgoblins, and dwarves. Although elementals could be considered true faeries, they were different from elves or dwarves who had settled down on the material world.</p><br/><p>Members of the Human race could not wield mana, or the select few that could had to learn it through their own efforts. However, members of the Faerie race were born with the ability to wield mana. Although they had their shortcomings, in terms of their magical abilities they were unparalleled.</p><br/><p>Of them, the Elves had the greatest affinity with mana and elementals. Whether they could form contracts with them or not, they were born with Elemental Eyes, which allowed them to see elementals.</p><br/><p>It seemed Loretta was a Faerie, and an elf at that. I imagined that an elf would have long, pointy ears, but since she said her form was a puppet she created, she must have hidden her racial features.</p><br/><p>But how could she see elementals with through her puppet? Ah, I see. It was an ability rooted in the mind, not the body.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Wait, how did I know all this? Was it part of the knowledge ingrained into me when I became an Elementalist?</p><br/><p>\u201cCustomer, you became an Elementalist! Wow, that was unexpected!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 doesn\u2019t sound like a compliment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean, a few years ago, you were muscle-brained and muscle-bodied! If anybody said you would become an Elementalist\u2026 a hellhound passing by would laugh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be in a place where a hellhound is randomly passing by anyways!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You, did you ridicule Master?]</p><br/><p>When Peika glared at Loretta and asked, Loretta shook her head with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cElemental-nim, customer and I share a special relationship. We were just having a friendly conversation.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hmph, I don\u2019t like you. Not to mention, you\u2019re hiding in a puppet.]</p><br/><p>With a humph, Peika snorted and turned away. As I gently rubbed Peika\u2019s head, I talked to Loretta.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back. It shouldn\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta seemed to have understood what I meant as a faint smile flickered around her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood luck. I\u2019ll pray for your safety.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>I inspected my Wraith Queen Set one last time and made sure I had all sorts of potions ready on my body. Finally, I patted Peika on the head.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m not a child!]</p><br/><p>Although Peika shouted and puffed out her cheeks, she did not refuse my patting. How cute. I already knew what she thought with the connection we shared.</p><br/><p>I stood in front of the door I just closed. With my spear in hand, I kicked it open.</p><br/><p>\u201cKugaga! Human, a human!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTasty looking human!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll turn you all into rat meat steaks!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You used the skill, Provoke! You draw nearby enemies toward you!]</p><br/><p>\u2018Not that I\u2019d eat it.\u2019 Thinking rather useless things, I charged forward, paving forth a way with my spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, I\u2019ll leave it to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Got it!]</p><br/><p>As I swung my spear amongst the sea of ratmen, Peika calmly flew up. Then, as if to make fun of the ratmen attempting to block her way, she leisurely flew past them and towards the Dark Ratman.</p><br/><p>Although the rattled Dark Ratman tried to attack her, she was a lightning elemental. As a wind elemental was swift, as a water elemental was soft, as an earth elemental was sturdy, and as fire elemental was hot, she, as a lightning elemental, was fast and sharp.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle fly, kugagak, I\u2019ll crush you!\u201d</p><br/><p>[F-Fly? You dare compare this noble lightning elemental to a fly!? I\u2019ll kill you!]</p><br/><p>I could feel mana draining out of me. Peika had taken it to manifest her elemental lightning. Although the Dark Ratman had its black lightning, it seemed the elemental lightning attack worked, as it let out a pain-filled shriek. Good. It seemed I could leave the Dark Ratman to her.</p><br/><p>Feeling an infinite trust in my elemental, I drank a Lowest-grade Mana Potion, and focused again on the ratmen in front of me. I continued to use Provoke to draw them near me, then used Vengeful Spirit\u2019s Wail.</p><br/><p>\u201cKiyaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You used Vengeful Spirit\u2019s Wail. All enemies within its area become confused and feared!]</p><br/><p>The gathered ratmen made vacuous expressions and began to roll around on the floor or attack each other. It was now! I raised my spear up high.</p><br/><p>\u201cElementals!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Prince is calling!]</p><br/><p>[What do we do? What do we do?]</p><br/><p>[Ugly rats, ew.]</p><br/><p>\u201cCome to my spear! Together, we\u2019ll exterminate those ugly rats!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Whoo, I\u2019m first!]</p><br/><p>[Whee~]</p><br/><p>What I prepared was Tempest. At my calling, the nearby elementals let out small lights as if to assert their existences and flew toward my spear. Along with Peruta Circuit\u2019s flow of mana, a spiral current formed around my spear and the elementals naturally began spinning along the current.</p><br/><p>[Fun! It looks fun!]</p><br/><p>[Me too, me too!]</p><br/><p>[Put me in too!]</p><br/><p>No matter how faint the lights were, when they gathered together in mass, the spear was radiating with bright light. If Heroic Strike shone with a pure-white radiance, then the countless elementals on my spear shone it with a festival-like rainbow.</p><br/><p>In front of such beautiful sight, I almost forgot to attack. However, I soon remembered what situation I was in due to the elementals slowly draining my mana.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere I go, Tem-\u201d</p><br/><p>No, this was different from the Tempest Peruta had taught me. My technique as a spearman and strength as an Elementalist. It was a technique that embodied my identity.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere I go, Elemental Tempest!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

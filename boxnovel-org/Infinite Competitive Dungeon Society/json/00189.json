Absolute Soul (1)</p><br/><p>Before we left the forest, Ren reminded the children.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust close your eyes, and we\u2019ll take care of everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRen oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Oppa gets hurt, I\u2019ll hate you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung, protect Ren!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not so weak that I need someone\u2019s protection.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys, get on Lotte first.\u201d</p><br/><p>I made the children switch to Lotte. She was, of course, back in her wyvern form. Ren and Lebuik also got on her back. To protect them, I flew up using Sharana\u2019s power and Talaria. Lotte flapped her wings and complained.</p><br/><p>[I hate having people other than Hero ride me\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for making you do this all the time, Lotte.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hero must pay the price for hurting this Dark Wing Lotte\u2019s pride. Be prepared, Hero.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll do anything you want if it\u2019s within my power.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuhum\u2026 Then I\u2019ll let it slide this time.]</p><br/><p>I patted Lotte\u2019s head and appeased her. The children stayed still watching Lotte and I talk, but Ren and Lebuik strangely looked at Lotte\u2019s body jealously.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish I had a wyvern like this too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe really was a wyvern\u2026 I\u2019ve never seen such a large and powerful wyvern before. I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s the frail looking woman from before\u2026 Do Crown Prince\u2019s pets and elementals all have female human forms?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know.. Maybe, it\u2019s the will of the universe.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied with a shrug. Then, I transformed my choker into its spear form. We would soon leave the forest. Knowing that this was the last chance to catch us, the hungry forest monsters were closing in on us from all sides.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, get ready! We\u2019re going to leave the forest with a final bang! Ruyue!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Freezing Air!]</p><br/><p>The energy emitted by the materialized Ruyue froze everything in our vicinity. At the same time, I shot out the energy gathered at the tip of my spear. Monsters that tried to make us their food became frozen food themselves. Then, unable to withstand the aura I shot out, they shattered along with dozens of trees behind them. Morning sunlight shone down from above. We were now out of the forest.</p><br/><p>At the same time, countless number of monsters in the air caught sight of us. They were the monsters being controlled by the brain worms. It was hard to describe just how many there were. They probably could not even be counted by the thousands. The sky was practically filled with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are too many of them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it!\u201d</p><br/><p>I soared up and activated my Evil Eyes. With the sheer number of them, my eyes began to hurt and mana continuously drained. However, the result was more than I imagined. Almost 80 percent of the aerial army petrified and fell. It was almost as if there was a meteor shower going on. I finally began to understand why Evil Eye holders were so feared.</p><br/><p>The Evil Eyes of Petrification were specialized for fighting large armies. It was a weapon of mass murder capable of decimating all who could not withstand its power! My Evil Eyes continued to shine, and the enemy forces continued to dwindle.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, Shin oppa is so cool\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to marry Shin oppa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to learn how to do that, Hyung! Teach me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-Teach me too!\u201d</p><br/><p>I cleaned up some of the monsters that survived because they were blind and charged through the air. Lotte followed me with a speed that wouldn\u2019t lose out in the slightest and killed the approaching monsters with her black flames.</p><br/><p>A short while later, the monsters\u2019 movements became strange. Behind one large flying monster, dozens of smaller monsters lined up like train compartments. I somewhat understood their intentions. After realizing that looking at my eyes would petrify them, they hid themselves behind a scapegoat. It was something humans would think of, not monsters.</p><br/><p>[Kiaaaaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>[Kugaaaaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>They screamed joyfully thinking that they found the solution. I smirked and shot out a whirlpool from my spear. The monster in the front, which had already turned to stone, were covering the dozens of monsters behind it. However, the whirlpool easily tore through the petrified monster. The monsters hiding behind it immediately turned to stone and fell.</p><br/><p>Just like that, thousands of monsters died once again. If I were a character in a RPG game, my level would have risen explosively.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis rocky mountain is too tall! When will we see the Forest of Tranquility?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForest of Tranquility is located at the highest region of Panan continent! Naturally, this mountain range is also the highest!\u201d</p><br/><p>Still, we couldn\u2019t see the peak after flying for 5 minutes. That was just too high! I heard that Earth\u2019s mountains were still growing. I was afraid they\u2019d become like Panan continent\u2019s mountains.</p><br/><p>[Kiaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>The higher we went, the more violently the monsters attacked. It was undoubtedly because they knew they would not be able to touch us once we reached the Forest of Tranquility. Hundreds of monsters were turning into stone every second, but more and more monsters flocked from god knows where. Perhaps, they wanted to kill us by drowning us in stone!</p><br/><p>I clicked my tongue and took out a Mana Potion. I put the potion in my mouth and called elementals to my spear.</p><br/><p>[Ah, a different world!]</p><br/><p>[Ek, bugs!]</p><br/><p>[We\u2019re scolding bugs today?]</p><br/><p>[There are so many!]</p><br/><p>[Prince-nim became even cooler!]</p><br/><p>[Spin spin~]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that technique is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo many elementals\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mad Typhoon\u2019s powerful rotational force seemed to have excited the elementals, as they shone even brighter than usual. I heightened the rotational force and led the elementals. Petrifying the monsters coming to stop it, I very slightly pulled back the spear enveloped by the elemental whirlpool.</p><br/><p>\u201cElemental\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA-Amazing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tempest!\u201d</p><br/><p>A gale of elementals stormed through the air. Meanwhile, I gulped down the Mana Potion in my mouth. Looking at the gaping hole in the sky, I smiled with satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s hurry! Hold on tightly, guys! Lotte, full speed!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Understood, Hero!]</p><br/><p>After sweeping away a large number of enemies with Elemental Tempest, I cleaned up the rest with my Evil Eyes. We were then able to climb to the peak without much trouble. After about 5 minutes, we finally entered the Forest of Tranquility.</p><br/><p>The inside of the forest was extremely beautiful. Countless beautiful flowers and tall trees filled the lush forest. Even in this world, where everything was being controlled by the brain worms, this place maintained its natural beauty. However, just like its name suggested, it was unnaturally quiet. There were no signs of animals. It was as if we were the only ones breathing in this place.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough, cough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The highland\u2019s thin oxygen level made it hard for the children to breathe. Even the ones who had mana found breathing difficult.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to breathe. I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUse the mana breathing method, Elfa. You learned it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn, Daddy taught me.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were many different mana cultivation methods, but the most common were mana breathing methods, which took in mana by a special method of breathing. Ren used this method as well as the children that followed him. The children seemed to have remembered about the mana breathing method after I mentioned it, as they all started to use it. I patted their heads and looked around.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can there be such a lush forest so high?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is something only God knows. But as Crown Prince can probably feel, mana is bountiful in this area. If the greenery here sprouted with the power of mana, it\u2019s understandable.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was right. Using common sense from Earth to evaluate Panan continent was foolish. In fact, it wouldn\u2019t be long until Earth\u2019s common sense would change.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hurry. You said we can\u2019t stay here for more than a day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, no one could stay here for over a day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys, it might be tiring, but endure it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay since Shin oppa is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElfa\u2026 You seem to like Crown Prince more than me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t make that face like you were just thrown away by your wife, Ren! I almost called the police! Be thankful there are no police here!</p><br/><p>However, not long afterwards, I tilted my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cRen, you might feel wronged, but can you not glare at me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not looking at Crown Prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it Lebuik then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I be looking at you? I\u2019m too busy inscribing Ren-nim\u2019s visage in my retina.\u201d</p><br/><p>She sure talked well for someone who abandoned Ren\u2026 I guess, she proved her love for him by coming back.</p><br/><p>Then who was it? I looked at the children sitting on top of Ruyue and tilted my head. A few of them also tilted their heads after seeing me. They really were too cute.</p><br/><p>Soon after, however, they began to writhe in pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 breathe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElfa?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHyung, I can\u2019t either\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDemi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren and I became flustered and checked on the children. They looked like they were suffocating. I expanded my mana outwards and scanned the children. Then, I realized that the children\u2019s mana\u2026 were leaving them.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn\u2026 Ren, mana is leaving everyone\u2019s bodies!\u201d</p><br/><p>I quickly circulated Peruta Circuit at its limit. The mana leaving my body flowed backwards and back into me, but the others couldn\u2019t do the same thing with their mana breathing method. Damn, Ren, Lebuik, and I would be fine, but if the children\u2019s mana all left\u2026!</p><br/><p>Then, the forest shook violently.</p><br/><p>[Arrogant human! You dare disturb my meal!]</p><br/><p>\u201cRen, didn\u2019t you say it was fine to stay for a day!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe last person who crossed this forest did it 130 years ago! The forest\u2019s grim reaper must have changed his mind!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOr, maybe he doesn\u2019t like it that Rookie took back his mana. He said Rookie disturbed his meal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you say that so calmly!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lebuik pointed at the two large eyes staring at us from beyond the dense trees.</p><br/><p>\u201cI got feared, so actually, it\u2019s hard to even talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a shocking message rang out to everyone.</p><br/><p>[An Event Raid has broken out! SSS+-rank 50-man, \u2018Mana Eater.\u2019 Because you were at the location of the raid boss, you will be forced to participate!]</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Shin\u2019s first SSS rank Event Raid! Can he do it!?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

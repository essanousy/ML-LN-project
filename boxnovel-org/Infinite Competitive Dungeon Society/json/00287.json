The Last Member (4)</p><br/><p>Chapter 287. The Last Member (4)</p><br/><p>The 75th Floor Master, Vampire Lord, had a tricky ability. Though he was too weak and died before he could properly utilize his ability, I was different. Even with the same ability, I could show far stronger effects.</p><br/><p>The Mistification skill I got from defeating him could be an excellent skill to some, but that didn\u2019t apply to me. The skill I was talking about was his unique skill, Blood Curse.</p><br/><p>Blood Curse was an extremely simple skill. It was similar to Deathblood Ring\u2019s deathblood effect, but its effect was stronger.</p><br/><p>It would use my health and splatter my blood onto him. Once the blood entered his body through his wound, its effect would activate. No matter how strong or weak the enemy was, it would decrease all of his stats and make him fall into massive hemorrhage status effect. As it wasn\u2019t a normal hemorrhage, but one made from curse and magic, the only way he could break out of it was to kill me. In a way, it was similar to chaos flames.</p><br/><p>[Kuk!]</p><br/><p>After looking around for a while, he suddenly screamed. At the same time, a vast amount of blood shot out from the wounds Nandi created. It didn\u2019t end with just a single explosion, as blood continued to shoot out like it was recycling itself like a fountain. Blood Curse was working perfectly.</p><br/><p>[Cough! What is this\u2026!?]</p><br/><p>Sorry, but I\u2019m not done yet. I smiled mischievously and activated the next move. It was Crimson Roar.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaak!]</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right! That\u2019s the scream I wanted to hear! The Beast King couldn\u2019t withstand the fierce flames in his body and jumped in his spot.</p><br/><p>[You, you\u2019re inside of me!]</p><br/><p>Where? I murmured inwardly and smiled mockingly. The Beast King continued to jump around to get me off of him, but I was in a place he could never reach with such movements.</p><br/><p>I was flowing through his blood.</p><br/><p>[Where are you Hero!? Where!?]</p><br/><p>Who in the right mind would tell you? You\u2019re the one who set up this trap for me too! I swam through his blood stream and searched for my destination. Suddenly, he stopped jumping around and stood still.</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Is this that ray\u2019s ability?]</p><br/><p>I flinched. Although the World Trickery skill I had wasn\u2019t stolen from the Hermit King, its name and effect was the same one he had.</p><br/><p>After murmuring those words, the Beast King snickered as he bled profusely.</p><br/><p>[Foolish. He called himself king, but if his ability was invincible, we wouldn\u2019t have been called the Five Kings! You want to use that lowly fish\u2019s ability to defeat me?]</p><br/><p>He shouted.</p><br/><p>[Since you entered my body on your own, stay and become my nutrient!]</p><br/><p>Immediately, his body began to boil. The first thing I noticed was that a strong acid began to flow in his blood. Almost like how someone with a cold would heat up to drive away the virus from his body, the Beast King\u2019s body was changing to remove me.</p><br/><p>[Did you think I would be defenseless, Hero!? I was expecting more from you, what a shame! Or will you try to change your body back!?]</p><br/><p>His internal temperature skyrocketed, and an acidic mana that attacked all foreign substance began to fill up his body. It seemed he had to pay a price for this technique, as with increased blood flow, he began to hemorrhage even more.</p><br/><p>[Kuhahahaha! Truly funny! To think the Hero would be such a coward! Who would have thought you were more like the Hermit King than the Lava King!?]</p><br/><p>If the Hermit King transformed himself into a tiny monster and entered the Beast King\u2019s body, he would have burned up by now from the temperature or melted from the acid. I was also struggling to withstand these two forces.</p><br/><p>[Cough!]</p><br/><p>At that moment, the Beast King suddenly coughed. It seemed Blood Curse was still working. Of course, Crimson Roar frying up his insides must have hurt too. No matter how big he was, he couldn\u2019t be fine after all that happened. I had to thank Nandi for letting my Blood Curse have such great effect.</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Not dead yet.]</p><br/><p>He murmured.</p><br/><p>[He\u2019s not dead yet. He\u2019s still inside me.]</p><br/><p>I grinned. He realized it too late. I had finally arrived at his heart. Specifically, I was inside his heart.</p><br/><p>[This isn\u2019t the ray\u2019s ability.]</p><br/><p>In that instant, I detonated the power of Sky God\u2019s Rage and drew out Lightning God\u2019s power to the limit. My surrounding became dyed in gold. The Beast King let out a horrifying scream.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaaaaaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>I then canceled my transformation and looked around as I landed on the bottom of his heart. Lightning God\u2019s power and Zeus\u2019 power had mixed together and was destroying the Beast King\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>This was probably not enough. I held up my Chaotic Spear and struck down with my remaining mana. I couldn\u2019t help but marvel at how big the Beast King\u2019s heart was, as it had more than enough space to fit my body.</p><br/><p>[Kuhaaa! H-How!? How did you survive?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, how?\u201d</p><br/><p>For the first time after I entered his body, I spoke. At this point, I was confident in my victory.</p><br/><p>\u201cI became your blood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sky God\u2019s Play was qualitatively different than World Trickery. Of course, World Trickery surpassed Sky God\u2019s Play in its ability to hide my presence. That was how I could carry out this plan. Combining Sky God\u2019s Play and World Trickery had formed a perfect skill.</p><br/><p>World Trickery allowed me to transform into any monsters I defeated, and Sky God\u2019s Play let me transform into whatever I\u2019ve seen. The difference between the two was huge.</p><br/><p>In Greek mythology, Zeus had once transformed into a golden shower to impregnate a woman trapped in a prison. The transformation power he used was available to me too under the name Sky God\u2019s Play. With it, I could transform myself into liquid or even a single drop of blood. The Beast King\u2019s response was within my expectations.</p><br/><p>There was no way he would burn his own blood or melt himself with his own acid. While he raised his internal temperature and spread his acid, I leisurely swam through his blood stream. The only thing I had to worry about was making sure I wouldn\u2019t leave his body through the wounds he was bleeding from.</p><br/><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t this work on the Demon Lord too?\u201d</p><br/><p>After thinking about it for a bit, I shook my head. I felt like I wouldn\u2019t be able to trick him. The fact that he had a world\u2019s power was the biggest reason. Even if World Trickery hid my presence, there had to be a limit to pretending to be someone else\u2019s blood. Just like how I noticed Hermit King\u2019s presence at the end, the Demon Lord was sure to be capable of doing so.</p><br/><p>[Kuk, kuaaaaak! I, I should have listened to him!]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? And what did he say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Really, he was taking too long to die. I converted the remaining mana in my body into lightning and pushed it into my spear. Peruta Circuit roiled, and my spear immediately penetrated his heart, releasing lightning.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>Damned guy, couldn\u2019t he have said more before he died? In the end, the lightning from the spear burst his heart, and that was the end of the Beast King.</p><br/><p>\u201cKu, I better focus, or I\u2019ll get swept away again.\u201d</p><br/><p>I had to directly face the flood of blood pouring from his heart. Setting aside how dirty it was, did I have to travel through his blood again to get out? No, since he died, was his blood even flowing?</p><br/><p>In any case, I had to get out and join up with the rest of the party as quickly as possible. It hasn\u2019t been too long, so there should be no problem. I just had to quickly\u2026 quickly\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>I blinked. My body felt strange. Don\u2019t tell me his acid was affecting me now? Or if that wasn\u2019t it, did he leave a curse before he died?</p><br/><p>The Beast King\u2019s blood drenching me was boiling. Not only that, but the large amount of his blood I had no choice but to drink was boiling inside my stomach. It was almost as if he was roaring out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this dangerous?\u201d</p><br/><p>An alarm went off in my head. Did I cancel my transformation too early? No, if I didn\u2019t, I would have had to wait dozens of minutes slowly releasing lightning. I needed to get out of here as quickly as possible, and even if I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t feel like it was a mistake to untransform as I initially planned.</p><br/><p>Besides, didn\u2019t his blood drench me after he died? Just what was going on?</p><br/><p>All I knew was that this situation wasn\u2019t something I could control. I couldn\u2019t believe how helpless I felt without Sherafina\u2019s messages telling me about my status.</p><br/><p>\u2018Snap out of it, Kang Shin. You can\u2019t rely on the dungeon forever.\u2019</p><br/><p>In the worst case, I just needed to use Overlord. That power was enough to get me through most situations. Not to mention, the Beast King was dead, so there was no one who could cause me harm. Even when the Hermit King died, I received his ability in exchange for his soul, and when the Lava King died\u2026 Wait.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Wow.\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t help but speak even in this situation. I hadn\u2019t noticed because I was too focused on myself, but now that I looked, the Beast King\u2019s insides were letting out a bright golden light. He was certainly dead. This wasn\u2019t done by him.</p><br/><p>It was done by me.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, it was then.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I obtained the Hermit King\u2019s power, I had taken his power for my own. I still wasn\u2019t sure, but perhaps when Peruta Circuit reforged my body, it may have taken this part of my memory and incorporated it to my instincts. Right, I knew instinctively that there was a better way to do it. Just like how the Lava King, Hermit King, and the Beast King had developed unique ways of defending themselves, my body had also developed a way to grow stronger!</p><br/><p>If I were under the effect of the dungeon\u2019s system, Sherafina would have surely told me about the method herself. But now that I was on my own, my body was looking for this method by itself. Its efficiency was incomparable to having it spoonfed to my body.</p><br/><p>Peruta Circuit\u2019s spin became fiercer. My body was burning up, and it felt like Peruta Circuit\u2019s mana circuit was trying to burst out of my body. A whirlpool rose up around my body and began to slowly absorb the golden particles of light. The Beast King\u2019s body slowly transformed into golden particles of light and began to slowly flow into me. The spinning whirlpool began to turn golden and created even fiercer rotational force.</p><br/><p>\u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\u201d</p><br/><p>I shouted, unable to withstand the power filling up my body. With my shout, the process accelerated. The Beast King\u2019s body completely transformed into mana and flowed into me, and I held my mind tightly to not waste a single drop of it.</p><br/><p>Sorry, Daisy, it looks like you won\u2019t get the Beast King\u2019s corpse\u2026 Hopefully you\u2019ll get the King of the Dead!</p><br/><p>Some time later, I slowly opened my eyes. With how much mana flowed into me, I couldn\u2019t turn them all into mine, but this wasn\u2019t the first time I experienced receiving such a massive amount of mana. Just like before, I stockpiled the unprocessed mana in a corner of my body.</p><br/><p>I looked around. I was still in the jungle.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe corpse really disappeared.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was dumbfounded. Such a huge corpse that disappeared without leaving a trace. Now, he was inside me. I could feel it. Interestingly, the result of me entering his body was him entering mine.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026 Sadly, it looks like I\u2019m missing one of his abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Beast King used his incomparably powerful body and his powerful acid as his main weapons. Additionally, he could add powerful physical force to his roars. I had received all of his abilities other than his acid ability. I could tell how to use them like they were mine to begin with.</p><br/><p>Most importantly, even though my stats were still being restrained, I could tell how much stronger my bones, muscles, and skin have gotten. I grinned and smacked my body a few times.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard there\u2019s a hole to fly through even when the sky crumbles. To think Peruta Circuit would bring such a result.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps, it wasn\u2019t just Peruta Circuit brining about these changes. After all, Peruta had never told me about any of this.</p><br/><p>It was entirely possible that another power was using Peruta Circuit as a medium to act\u2026 No, I was probably overthinking it. In any case, I could think about this later. What I was sure about was that starting with Radiance, I was slowly strengthening myself with powers that no one could take away. Knowing that was enough.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, now if I hide his mana completely\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I calmed the boiling Beast King\u2019s mana. Then, the surrounding space began to distort. The Event Dungeon was disappearing, having lost its power to maintain itself. What filled my sight instead was Bordeaux\u2019s sky. Coincidentally, I faced Licorice as soon as I left the Event Dungeon.</p><br/><p>When she saw me, she hugged me with a happy face.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, I knew you would be safe! Dear Husbaaaand!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Licorice, I knew I would be safe too.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt relieved and joked. Thankfully, everything seemed okay. Ciara had worried for nothing. Although the Beast King was troubling, I could kill him without much problem, and now that I had joined up with the rest, we could go kill the King of the Dead and the last remaining king together\u2026</p><br/><p>At that moment, Licorice tilted her head and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Hwaya? Why didn\u2019t she come out with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What?\u201d</p><br/><p>I froze.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

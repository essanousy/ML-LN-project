If I hadn't of made such an unreasonable request\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, rather, it\u2019s good that you did. We can fight them before they\u2019re fully prepared to take us on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Yua had a large army, to the SSS+ rank Destroyers, mantises were nothing more than easily flammable bugs. They felt short in rank and were disadvantaged in attributes. Although Yua wanted to stay, saying that this expedition was planned partly because of her, when Father stepped in and gave her a stern talk, she had no choice but to go back to the guild house.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m sorry that I couldn\u2019t help more\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Yua will get stronger, you can help me then. For now\u2026 just pray for Oppa\u2019s victory!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time I replied to Yua, I shot my spear forward and blew up the Destroyer\u2019s head. The lava that its head was composed of jumped up at me as if to melt my head, but with Flame Sucker\u2019s power, it dissipated without having achieved any damage.</p><br/><p>[Un\u2026! Oppa, good luck!]</p><br/><p>\u201cFor now, that\u2019s enough!\u201d</p><br/><p>I could really feel myself brimming with energy! My younger sister was an angel who always thought about me and cared for me. For her, I had to go back safely! I looked for the next target and charged. I charged, and charged again.</p><br/><p>[Uooooooo!]</p><br/><p>The Destroyers\u2019 earthshaking roar rumbled in my ear. The heat from the lava also made my sight hazy. Thundering sounds rang out from all sides, as the magic of the succubi and the aura attacks of the other guild members cut through the air and faced the Destroyers.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat this and die!\u201d</p><br/><p>I drew on Peika\u2019s power to the limit, shooting down several Destroyers and absorbing as much mana as I could. Although I had to make contact with the enemies to do so, as long as I fought in close-range, Absolute Soul could absorb about the same amount of mana as I used in my attack.</p><br/><p>Considering the fact that I was also using Peruta Circuit, my mana didn\u2019t have a chance to go down. Of course, now that I had Ruyue materialized and fighting by herself, that wasn\u2019t the case.</p><br/><p>[Hero!]</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeed up!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Understood!]</p><br/><p>Few of those in the guild could fight and come out victorious against a Destroyer in a one on one fight. So, as to lessen the danger they would face, I had to defeat as many as I could. With Wind King\u2019s Rage, even if I didn\u2019t kill them in one blow, I could at least neutralize them! I used Provoke to draw the enemies toward me once again as I charged through the air with Lotte.</p><br/><p>[Crown Prince, if you push yourself too much and get hurt, it\u2019ll be the end! My father also\u2026]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m not pushing myself, don\u2019t worry!]</p><br/><p>All this time, I had worked hard to get stronger for this moment! Compared to climbing the dungeon day and night, challenging my limits in Beyond, and fighting the Floor Masters ten times a day, this much was nothing!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lotte\u2019s wings wrapped around one of the scarlet flames flying toward us and returned it. Although it couldn\u2019t damage the Destroyers, it could at least help stop its movements. Immediately afterwards, we charged towards a Destroyer and hammered it with a spear wrapped in a whirlpool of lightning.</p><br/><p>[Guaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>\u201cLotte, how many have we killed so far?\u201d</p><br/><p>[178!]</p><br/><p>Lotte and I had already bathed in the Destroyer\u2019s flames. Although I wasn\u2019t hurt thanks to Flame Sucker, which nullified flames, Lotte\u2019s body was already fairly burned. However, Lotte didn\u2019t stop and continued to charge. Her injuries soon caught my attention.</p><br/><p>[Hero! Don\u2019t think about useless things and attack, burns like these only take me a day to recover from!]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Alright. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wind King\u2019s Rage did not end unless I stopped it. In other words, I could continuously deal wind, lightning, and charge damage. Thanks to the Giant Wolf\u2019s Tattoo, I could also deal an additional 50% in damage.</p><br/><p>One thing that was somewhat regretful was that 60% bonus damage to charge type skills disappeared when I upgraded my armor to the Pure Black Desire. Instead, I had gotten Desire Thorn, which could steal the life force of others. This, however, was limited to once per day. In any case, I didn\u2019t have the time to be listing out regretful things. Right now, I had to focus on using the abilities I had to kill the Destroyers in one blow.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuaaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if Wind King\u2019s Rage could be continued indefinitely, as it was a charge type skill, I had to keep charging for it to stay in effect. In other words, Lotte also had to charge without stopping.</p><br/><p>I opened my eyes widely and continuously thrust out with my spear. If I let my guard down even for a second, I would be charging into a Destroyer unprepared. I had to maintain my focus. If I had no experience fighting such battles, if I had not had those battles in the Luka continent and the Panan continent, maintaining a skill like this would have been unimaginable.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[Guaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Master, I can feel the presence of a powerful existence!]</p><br/><p>Sharana, who was infused into my body, reported to me as we killed the 26th destroyer. Even as I continued to charge, I looked up and scanned the horizon. There, I saw a line of monsters marching, swinging whips made of lava.</p><br/><p>[They\u2019re here! The Sweepers!]</p><br/><p>\u201cCleaners?\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know what they were trying to clean, but it was inevitable that I would have to fight them. I had to eliminate the Destroyers before that! I grit my teeth and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cLotte, charge! We can\u2019t end this with just Wind King\u2019s Rage!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Gryaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>Lotte roared and flapped her wings in response. The spear I shot out towards the Destroyers gathered wind and lightning and tore them to shreds.</p><br/><p>[Master, the wind energy is getting stronger! I can still control it, but I\u2019m not sure if Master will be fine in the center of it all!]</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s the same for me, Master. But since Master can even wield a God\u2019s lightning, I think it will be okay!]</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, I\u2019ll be fine! This much is nothing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, with just a single misstep, the wind and lightning gathered at the tip of my spear could easily explode and cause me to let go of my spear. However, my clan\u2019s unique technique, which Heroic Strike was derived from, already required learning how to control such chaotic destructive power. Otherwise, it would have been impossible to squeeze out every ounce of power in my body to focus it in one point. The more I thought about it, the more I came to understand that my ancestors trained in rather perverted methods. Of course, since I was benefiting from that, I wasn\u2019t complaining!</p><br/><p>\u201cIce Age!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the distance, someone shouted. In an instant, a bone-chilling freezing energy reached where Lotte and I were located. I glanced toward the direction the freezing energy came from and saw Ina who was destroying dozens of Destroyers with lotus-like ice. Her truly incredible destructive power was fitting that of an SSS ranker.</p><br/><p>It seemed Ina had exerted a great amount effort to use that skill as she staggered. Although I wanted to go give her a hug, I couldn\u2019t do so at the moment. I grit my teeth and continued to charge. Once I had taken care of everything, I would hug her as much as I wanted!</p><br/><p>\u201cUoooooo!\u201d</p><br/><p>[They\u2019re coming!]</p><br/><p>As the succubi battle units and the other members were all doing fantastic, over half of the Destroyers had fallen. Before I noticed, the atmosphere of the battlefield had changed, and the Sweepers were charging closer.</p><br/><p>[Their whips are dangerous! They\u2019re hotter than the Destroyers\u2019 swords and have the ability to elongate!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like much!\u201d</p><br/><p>I shouted spiritedly on purpose and drove Lotte towards them. If the Wind King\u2019s Rage at peak power could not penetrate them, nothing could!</p><br/><p>[A living human!]</p><br/><p>[We love humans. They\u2019re delicious!]</p><br/><p>[Human flesh is so tender, it just melts in your mouth!]</p><br/><p>When they noticed me, they sent their whips flying towards me as they blabbered incomprehensible things. I pushed the oncoming whips away with the wind energy around my spear and charged towards them.</p><br/><p>\u201cTaste this delicious human flesh!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuhuk!]</p><br/><p>When I stabbed the Sweeper with my spear powered by Wind King\u2019s Rage, its powerful rotational power drilled a huge hole through the Sweeper\u2019s chest. The Sweepers that witnessed their kin\u2019s death widened their eyes and swung their whips, but I continued to charge forward without paying them any mind.</p><br/><p>Even if I were hit by the whips, with my cape\u2019s ability to nullify flames, I barely received any damage. Not to mention, unlike Daisy\u2019s whip, their whips\u2019 movements were completely readable. There was no way I would be afraid of attacks I could read!</p><br/><p>[Kugyagyak!]</p><br/><p>[Human\u2026 Human, Human!!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys are pretty tender yourselves!\u201d</p><br/><p>After fighting a few of them, I could instantly tell their special characteristics. They certainly possessed flames more powerful than the Destroyer\u2019s, but their constitution was weaker and hence had weaker defense! For me, they were much easier to deal with.</p><br/><p>\u201cLotte, dodge!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Understood!]</p><br/><p>Lotte\u2019s movements continued to get faster. Now that I thought about it, her abilities seemed to have doubled since the first time we met. She had also gotten bigger and more lustrous. This change could be easily seen by the fact that she was charging through SSS+ rank monsters when she was only an S+ rank monster at first.</p><br/><p>[Hero, there are more coming!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI know! Keep charging!\u201d</p><br/><p>I gripped the spear in my hands tighter. With a bold smile, I concentrated my energy into my spear. One\u2019s martial path had to be honed through real combat. Charging forward with my life on the line, through infinite repetitions, I was coming to better understand the profoundness behind thrusting.</p><br/><p>The moment I mastered the high-rank Spear Technique, I thought I saw the end of manaless spearmanship. However, I was only 21. There was no way I could have mastered a lofty martial path in just 13 years. Now I understood that. At the same time, I understood that the skill system wasn\u2019t perfect, and that simply relying on skill levels was the same as drawing a line to my limit.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, normal spearmanship couldn\u2019t be the same as spearmanship while riding. The spear technique I displayed on Lotte\u2019s back was certainly not the same as when I was on my own. The more I became attuned to Lotte, the more I read her movements and modified my own, my spear attacks would display greater prowess as it matched the limits of her speed!</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>After thrusting out again, the leftover force of the attack exploded the shoulder of a Sweeper standing next to the intended target. I immediately swung my spear to the side and struck his whip away. Lotte, who seemed to have read my mind, changed her trajectory and charged towards that Sweeper. Then, with a simple attack, I was able to take its life.</p><br/><p>As time went on, my attacks were becoming more destructive, though it still contained the same amount of power as before. It meant that my spearmanship was advancing in a realm where mana didn\u2019t matter. I couldn\u2019t help but smile knowing what was happening.</p><br/><p>Becoming stronger was this enjoyable! No matter how much at risk my life was, no matter how many enemies I had to face!</p><br/><p>\u201cGood\u2026 Good!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hero, were you hit by a status effect!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m immune you mental status effects! Lotte, speed up!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hero!?]</p><br/><p>Wind King\u2019s Rage didn\u2019t stop. Until all the wind and lightning in the world gathered to the tip of my spear, my charge would not stop!</p><br/><p>[Guoooooo!]</p><br/><p>Just when I was thinking that, something blocked our advance. Although we tried to charge right through, my spear couldn\u2019t penetrate it! I controlled the energy trying to run berserk, as I reluctantly took my stance for the final blow. I raised my head. I wanted to know just what my spear couldn\u2019t penetrate.</p><br/><p>A giant over dozens of meters tall was glaring down at me. It wore a thick armor of fire and held a spear of fire that somewhat made me desire it.</p><br/><p>I asked Lotte.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the Lava King?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Sorry Hero, but no.]</p><br/><p>After hearing that, I sighed in relief. Not using Overlord the moment I saw him was truly a heaven\u2019s fortune.</p><br/><p>It was the start of a middle boss battle.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

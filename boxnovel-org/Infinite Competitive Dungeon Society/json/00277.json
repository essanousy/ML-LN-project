Third Season (2)</p><br/><p>To be honest, I didn\u2019t want to stay in the Edias continent any longer. I wanted to finish what I needed to and quickly go back.</p><br/><p>I told Paul that the Hero had lost his power and transferred the world\u2019s power to Ellos. If I announced it publicly, it would only have served lowered their morale. It was best to not tell anyone, but I felt like I needed to tell Paul.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it really was like that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to what happened, Paul wore an uncharacteristic solemn expression. I held him by his collar and shook him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really was like that? Did you know something!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no! Just that\u2026 Ever since Ellos lost Baruella, he\u2019s done many things without telling me. He lost his usual laughter, and he got stronger even though he didn\u2019t enter the dungeon\u2026 I also couldn\u2019t talk to him like I could before. That was it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, it was hard to suspect someone just because of that, especially if that person was someone he was close to. I accepted Paul\u2019s explanation and let him go. After letting out a dry cough, I continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn any case, I have your world\u2019s power right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Paul made a nervous expression. If I were in his position, I would have immediately thrown me in the prison until I spat out the world\u2019s power. That was how important the world\u2019s power was. The only reason Paul wasn\u2019t doing anything was that no one was strong enough to restrain me.</p><br/><p>Eventually, he opened his mouth carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Kang Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to pick a new Hero from your continent. I\u2019ll transfer the power to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked openly relieved. Then, he suddenly paled. I didn\u2019t know who put him in the position of a crown prince, but that person must have wished for the empire\u2019s doom.</p><br/><p>\u201cA new Hero? But who?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I already decided, so you don\u2019t need to worry about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou've already decided? But Ellos and I are the only ones you know from this continent!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I also don\u2019t want to make someone I don\u2019t know into the Hero. That\u2019s why I picked someone I knew.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Paul tilted his head. He blinked his eyes a few times, then widened his eyes and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cM-Me!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want me to become the Hero? Hell no!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You might not know this, but you don\u2019t have the right to refuse.\u201d</p><br/><p>I grinned at Paul who was frantically shaking his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt takes a long time to transfer a Hero\u2019s power. That means I\u2019ll need to take that person to Earth, and I absolutely refuse to bring someone I don\u2019t know to Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI refuse! I don\u2019t want to, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you want me to go back to Earth with this power?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s this excellent knight! I\u2019ll recommend her in my place!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust get packing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s an absolutely beautiful female knight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. Go pack.\u201d</p><br/><p>Paul seemed to be going insane. He muttered more nonsense before he dropped his head and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m too weak.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree, you\u2019re weak, but humans aren\u2019t strong from the start.\u201d</p><br/><p>I grabbed his shoulders and spoke seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I've prepared for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou? For me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>I announced with a solemn expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cI call it the thrashing phase.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, I dragged Paul back to Earth. The Edias continent\u2019s people protested, so I cleaned up the invaders for a day with Lotte and Licorice while I waited for Paul to get ready.</p><br/><p>Even though the density had decreased, Edias continent\u2019s atmospheric mana was still on my side. Using it, I annihilated many invaders.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith this, you won\u2019t have to worry about anything for a while. Their leader is also dead, and I should have killed at least a tenth of their overall number.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying you annihilated 10% of them in a single day?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, of course not. The 10% is including the ones I killed on the way to Peruta Mountain Range.\u201d</p><br/><p>Paul opened his mouth with a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not human.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking that recently, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>In any case, after I returned to Earth with Paul, I visited Eleine to report what happened. I didn\u2019t go to Fairy Garden and went directly to the Lost Valley guild area. Eleine had told me how to get there last time we talked.</p><br/><p>When she found out that the Hero was already dead when I got there, she couldn\u2019t hide her shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re even more skilled with magical tools than me? I thought for sure that he was still alive\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey had a way of tricking the dungeon\u2019s system, so that much should have been nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa, Tian\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Eleine dropped her head and quietly murmured what seemed to be the Hero\u2019s name. Was that enough? She soon raised her head and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn any case, you completed the mission perfectly. I\u2019ll make sure to give you the MVP reward.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t save him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you tried. You did everything you could for Edias continent. I\u2019m sure Tian would be thankful to you, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I became lost for words and just stood there silently, Eleine chuckled and put her hand on my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good Hero. It reminds me of the time when I was a Hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Thank you for the compliment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not good enough as a man. I want to see Lin right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but I don\u2019t find that regretful.\u201d</p><br/><p>She frowned at my response and took out a small bead from her pocket. It had strange runes scribbled on it and was radiating a mystical glow.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, that\u2019s a bit hard to answer. Right, I\u2019ll tell you how it was created. When I transferred the world\u2019s power to my continent\u2019s successor Hero, I used the tiny bit of world\u2019s power remaining in my body to make it. It\u2019s a magical tool.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you get in trouble if someone found out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one did, so it\u2019s okay. So what this does is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She confessed her crime nonchalantly and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt forcefully raises the power of an object to its next level. I don\u2019t know how to explain it. Not even Lord could name this item.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an enhancement stone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnhancement stone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, nevermind.\u201d</p><br/><p>I took the bead from her and appraised it. As expected, it was full of question marks just like when I first appraised Radiance. I was surprised that Eleine was such an amazing magic artificer. Even if it was made using the world\u2019s power, making an item that surpassed Sherafina\u2019s ability\u2026 I saw her in a different light now.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, you\u2019re grateful, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, thanks. It looks like it was worth risking my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t being sarcastic. It was a reward that surpassed my imagination. As I received the enhancement stone, all kinds of thoughts ran through my head. Could I use this on myself? If I couldn\u2019t, where do I use it? Chaotic Spear? Pure Black Desire? How was I supposed to activate it?</p><br/><p>When I realized I couldn\u2019t use it on my body, it was decided. I had to use it on Pure Black Desire. Chaotic Spear could still evolve on its own, but this was the only way for Pure Black Desire to evolve.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s it for the reward. Bye-bye. I want to hurry up and meet Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, let me go, too. I have to ask Lin something.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment. Eleine\u2019s scowled like a frog that ate a stinkbug.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Eleine was hiding something like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin grinned and stared at Eleine.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d do something like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t keep a portion on purpose. I wasn\u2019t good at controlling the power at the time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it turned out to be a good thing for this kid. So, you said you wanted to enhance Pure Black Desire with that thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I gave him both the enhancement stone and Pure Black Desire. He took the enhancement stone and examined it for a bit. Then, he shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this is something you can just use.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I need to do something special to get it to work?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stared at Lin blankly. Then, I glared at Eleine. She shook her hands immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What? No! I didn\u2019t put in any strange conditions!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat Eleine made is certainly a magical tool that enhances, no, evolves, objects. But it can\u2019t be used on anything. It looks like it has several complicated conditions. I can only see through a couple of them. First, the object you\u2019re using it on has to have an appropriate league. Your Pure Black Desire barely passes it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the second?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second one is a bit iffy. It\u2019s kind of like your Chaotic Spear, but a little different. Pure Black Desire needs to go through many battles and build a record of blocking all sorts of attacks. As they say, objects have memories too. This magical tool raises the league of an object by using the object\u2019s battle experience with its owner.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt sounds complicated, but in the end, it\u2019s all about EXP.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust something from Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>I received Pure Black Desire and the magical tool.</p><br/><p>\u201cI made a slight modification to Pure Black Desire. When it\u2019s time, it\u2019ll glow. You just have to smash Pure Black Desire with the magical tool. Smash it hard, like you want to break it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, as expected of Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m pretty amazing. Anyways, good job on your Dimensional Mercenary mission. Hurry up and bring that gun-user to me. Ah, it was good seeing you too, Eleine.\u201d</p><br/><p>He chased me away naturally and did the same to Eleine. Eleine frowned and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cArgh, I came to see Lin! I need Lin to console me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoka is still pregnant. Even I wouldn\u2019t do it with another woman at this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll die if Lin\u2019s not here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>For a moment, Lin made an extremely tired face and puffed out smoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you can stay for tea. I\u2019m saying this beforehand, don\u2019t expect me to put a hand on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat means you can\u2019t touch me either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Un?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOtherwise, you can go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m kidding! I\u2019m kidding!\u201d</p><br/><p>Did she like Lin that much? I made a wry smile and quietly left. I suddenly wanted to see Loretta, but now wasn\u2019t the time. I had to something to give to someone as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cHungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I went back to Marianne\u2019s Garden, Daisy was sprawled on the kitchen table as always. I made a wry smile and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did you break through the 16th floor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo hours\u2026 ago. I haven\u2019t, eaten anything, during that time. I\u2019m, starving.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a bit, I\u2019ll make you something. And here.\u201d</p><br/><p>I took out the dragon bracelet Lin made with Radiance and handed it to her. When she received it, she looked at my own wrist fixedly. I added with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI fully absorbed mine. You\u2019ll probably absorb it too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbsorb\u2026? Tsk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy made an inexplicable sound and immediately equipped her bracelet. She did it so quickly that I didn\u2019t even have the time to warn her.</p><br/><p>The change was immediate. Daisy fell from her chair and rolled around on the ground without a word. It would\u2019ve been better if she said something, as the complete silence was frightening.</p><br/><p>Seeing Daisy roll around the ground so energetically, I thought about tying her to a mop. Suddenly, Daisy shot up. She seemed to be doing her best to maintain a calm expression, but she was clearly teary. It seemed it hurt a lot.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou tricked me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou put it on before I could say anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, my bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPunishment, make me, delicious food.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s ramen, sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>I spoke with a grin, and Daisy quickly nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now on, Kang Shin is, forever my ramen chef.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Forever?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForever.\u201d</p><br/><p>In any case, it seemed Paul\u2019s thrashing phase would need to wait a while.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The Third Explorer (1)</p><br/><p>Using Return, we left the Antelope Canyon without anyone knowing. With what happened in Britain, people surmised that Thunder Knight and the Flame Witch had an ally that could use mass teleportation.</p><br/><p>What was more troubling was that even in all the chaos, someone filmed us fighting the Flame Drake and spread it for the world to see. Perhaps\u2026 No, I was certain. It had to be Ciara Kenex\u2019s work.</p><br/><p>All I did was to fight the drake on a black winged wyvern, so why were alll the channels on TV talking about Thunder Knight? In fact, because I defeated the drake on a wyvern, my name had changed from Thunder Knight to Dragon Knight.</p><br/><p>All countries focused on Dragon Knight\u2019s identity and were shocked by Dragon Knight\u2019s strength. The fact that I was the strongest ability user seemed to be going around like an undeniable truth.</p><br/><p>To be honest, it was very troubling. It really felt like it wouldn\u2019t be weird if an organization was made. Thinking about how more troubling things would become if my identity became known, I vowed to hide myself more thoroughly.</p><br/><p>My father, of course, looked at me with envy. He was the world\u2019s greatest in terms of being unable to act his age.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuu, I\u2019m going to obtain a god\u2019s true name too, son!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo ahead. Do you want a hint? I told you before, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI could have missed something! Repeat it for me!\u201d</p><br/><p>I doubted hearing it for the second or third time would help, but when I explained all the circumstances where I obtained a god\u2019s true name, father let out air through his nose and ran to the dungeon. Didn\u2019t you say you were trying to make a breakthrough in your spearmanship? What happened to that, father?</p><br/><p>In addition, with this incident, mother had found out about Ye-Eun and Hwaya as well. Although Yua already knew about Ye-Eun and Hwaya, when she saw them on TV, she seemed even angrier.</p><br/><p>As Ludia lived a disciplined life, she fell asleep at 10, and at the latest, 11. After she started climbing the dungeon, she stopped clinging onto me 24/7. Now, she only held me until she fell asleep and shouted my name when she woke up, so I was quite free from\u2026 Eh? Why did I feel like nothing changed?</p><br/><p>In any case, with Ludia asleep, I was being interrogated by mother and Yua.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo son, of the three of them, who\u2019s the real one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNone. They\u2019re all friends. Just friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t they smack you every time you say that?\u201d</p><br/><p>How did she know!? When I opened my eyes widely, Yua let out a deep sigh, while mother laughed hysterically.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhaha, that\u2019s so funny! I thought my son would die without ever dating a girl. When did he get so skilled? Not to mention, they\u2019re all so beautiful. Ehew, you\u2019re going to make my mouth rip from smiling too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is Mom so happy? I won\u2019t give oppa to women like them. Never!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yua shouted, then stomped up the stairs to her room. I was confused, but mother chuckled and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time Yua graduated from her oppa too. I\u2019m happy that you guys have such good relationship, but it\u2019s too much to be honest. You should really settle on one quickly. I won\u2019t say anything if you get married to Ludia now. To be honest, she\u2019s the most fair. Her personality too\u2026 Other than the fact that she relies on you a bit too much, she\u2019s kind. Although she can\u2019t cook yet, she\u2019s good at cleaning and doing the laundry.\u201d</p><br/><p>It felt weird hearing someone say that Ludia was kind. Well, since mother only met Ludia recently, it wasn\u2019t\u2026 Wait, what? Marrying Ludia? I sweated and explained to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019m only 21 now. What do you mean settle down\u2026 And Ludia? Not Palludia?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what she asked me to call her. Isn\u2019t it nice? It\u2019s more friendly! Ah, that\u2019s not what\u2019s important! You shouldn\u2019t feign ignorance when a girl is openly telling you her feelings. That\u2019s the best way of getting hated!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI properly declined them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Declined? Ehew, you don\u2019t know how lucky you are. Ah, wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>I forcefully ended the interrogation.</p><br/><p>If Dark Wing Lotte was living anywhere near our house, my identity would be revealed to the whole world in a moment. As such, I moved her to the dungeon. Instead of the cramped mansion (there was a new resident in the garden named Flame Drake), she was in a better place. It was Resting Place of the Angels.</p><br/><p>[Wow, it\u2019s Shin!]</p><br/><p>The moment I arrived, Plene noticed me instantly and ran to my embrace. As it happened every time I met Plene, I had somewhat gotten used to her the softness of her body. Though, it was a lie\u2026 I mean, Plene\u2019s attire was too light!</p><br/><p>[Are you sleeping? What do you want to eat? Should I catch you a fish?]</p><br/><p>Like her name suggested, Plene[1. Her name comes from Planetarium!! I finally found out this chapter. That said, I\u2019ll still stick with Plene since that sounds like (P-Leh-Neh), while Plane (sounds like plane as in airplane).] shaped her eyes like stars and looked at me, making it hard for me to decline. However, I first asked her about the new resident.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Lotte?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t know. She hates me. She keeps flying around.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Plene took the chance to complain about Lotte as she clung to me. Thinking the way Plene liked to cling was exactly the reason why Lotte didn\u2019t like her, I waited for Lotte to come. As I thought, it seemed Lotte could sense my presence too, as she soon flew down and landed with her wings folded. She was big no matter how many times I saw her.</p><br/><p>[Are we going somewhere to fight, Hero?]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you can rest a bit more. You too, Plene. When dungeons start appearing on Earth, you\u2019ll both get busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ve been expecting it ever since I joined Hero\u2019s side. Once we killed that drake, it became too late to turn back. I will follow Hero.]</p><br/><p>[Mmm, I like Shin, so I\u2019ll protect the people Shin likes! Monsters are bad, so I\u2019ll beat them up!]</p><br/><p>Lotte then looked down at Plene and snorted.</p><br/><p>[You are also a monster. I can\u2019t believe what you\u2019re saying, just because you fell heads over heels for a man.]</p><br/><p>[Eeeek! But you like Shin too!]</p><br/><p>[I only kneeled at the difference in our strength. Since I swore I would follow him, I would continue to do so, but that is it.]</p><br/><p>[Liar, liar! You like Shin too! Loretta said Taming won\u2019t work if you don\u2019t like Shin!]</p><br/><p>[You biiiiitch!]</p><br/><p>If they really fought, Plene would easily lose, so I had to protect her as I calmed Lotte down.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys, don\u2019t fight and train your abilities. Please.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Okay! Got it!]</p><br/><p>[Tsk\u2026 If it\u2019s Hero\u2019s request, there\u2019s no choice.]</p><br/><p>When I patted their heads, Plene was openly happy, while Lotte smacked her tail on the ground strangely. At least, it seemed she didn\u2019t hate it.</p><br/><p>Now that I was done with checking out how things were in the Resting Place of the Angels, I had to return to my everyday schedule. Of course, that only meant one thing for me.</p><br/><p>It was dungeon exploring!</p><br/><p>\u2026 For the record, there was a very simple reason that I didn\u2019t bring Lotte and Plene along to explore the dungeon. For Plene, monsters on the ordinary floors weren\u2019t strong enough for me to need her, and monsters that were strong could resist Plene\u2019s ability easily.</p><br/><p>Simply put, Plene was still too weak. Thankfully, it seemed she was content with just singing in Resting Place of the Angels. Although she was continuously growing her ability, she was still too weak to bring to real fights. That said, I suspected that I\u2019d need to borrow her ability soon on Earth.</p><br/><p>As for Lotte, I tried to bring her along once, but she was too big to freely fly in the dungeon. It was quite unfortunate. As such, I had to break through the 51st floor on Ruyue\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Before then, however, I wanted an answer from Loretta.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Shin-nim. There\u2019s\u2026 20 years left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><br/><p>At Loretta\u2019s response, I asked her again naturally. With a face on the verge of crying, she answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cUntil Earth\u2019s protective barrier disappears and all monsters realize that Shin-nim is the monster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s 20 years\u2026 until then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait\u2026 Hold on.\u2019 I put my hand on my forehead.</p><br/><p>Wait, what? 20 years? When I asked Loretta about it before, why did she use an expression like \u2018a little while longer\u2019? Don\u2019t tell me she\u2019s joking right now? No, but she looks like she\u2019s about to cry!</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it really 20 years?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. There\u2019s only 20 years left\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. This is why I didn\u2019t want to tell you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, how old are you this year?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m two thou\u2026 Kyak! Rude, how rude! Why are you asking me that so naturally? I almost answered you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta screamed. The punch she sent out glazed past my nose. What? Two thousand\u2026!? This elf that looked younger than me was at least two thousand years old!? Of course, I couldn\u2019t ignore the digits that followed. But, I see\u2026 With that, I understood.</p><br/><p>No matter how much medical science had advanced, humans currently could not live past the age of 150. Although 20 years were long for humans, for Loretta who lived for over 2 thousand years, 20 years could be relatively short.</p><br/><p>In any case, now that I knew, strength left my body. I fell on the ground in panic, and Loretta sat down next to me. She sobbed for a bit, and after seeing that I had fallen down, she blinked her eyes and looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u2018Sh, Shin-nim? Did my punch hit you? Oh no, it must have hurt a lot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you think it\u2019ll hurt a lot, don\u2019t swing your fist around\u2026 And don\u2019t worry, I wasn\u2019t hit. I was just\u2026 relieved.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Relieved?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta tilted her head adorably.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you be relieved, hearing that there\u2019s only 20 years left?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, if I have 20 years, I should be able to reach the end of this dungeon. No, I will do so for sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Finding Loretta\u2019s stupefied expression cute, I laughed again. However, hearing my laughter, Loretta let out a dry cough and spoke with a stern expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, this dungeon was here before I was even born. Back then, although the method of climbing was a bit different, the difficulty wasn\u2019t too different.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean two thou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Something flashed before my eyes and a deep hole appeared in the dungeon\u2019s wall. Even my Heroic Strike could only leave a tiny gap in the wall!</p><br/><p>Loretta smiled sweetly, and I forced myself to smile back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say, Shin-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c1, 17 years ago maybe? Was that when the dungeon was created?\u201d</p><br/><p>I answered as I sweated. Loretta looked satisfied at my answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, the dungeon was created long before I was born. In any case, many people challenged the dungeon during this time, but only three people managed to reach its end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Ellos said no one had succeeded\u2026 Though, Loretta would know more about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, he\u2019s also right. After the dungeon changed to the method it now has, no one has managed to conquer the dungeon. To be honest, the past method was much easier and lax. Because of that, there were errors between achievements and the blessings given out, causing more worlds to\u2026 No, never mind. There\u2019s no need to think about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I can hear you perfectly, though\u2026\u2019 I grinned, and Loretta also grinned. However, she was back to her stern expression in the next moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe dungeon is strict. It is not a place that wantonly gives out strength to people. Shin-nim, are you saying you will conquer the dungeon in only 20 years?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, there\u2019s something else Shin-nim should know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018What is it?\u2019 When I tilted my head and asked, Loretta spoke with a stiff voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes Shin-nim\u2026 still think that First Dungeon is the most difficult dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>ICDS will continue for the next 20 years! (Lies)</p><br/><p>If things will be peaceful for 20 years, I wouldn\u2019t have brought up the Hero so early on, right? ^^</p><br/><p>Look forward to the future development, everyone!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

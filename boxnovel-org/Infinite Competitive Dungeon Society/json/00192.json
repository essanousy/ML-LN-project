Absolute Soul (4)</p><br/><p>[Kugyyyyyya!]</p><br/><p>\u201cLoro, finish him.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>The rhinoceros beetle waved its two horns and tormented the Mana Eater. At the same time, the Mana Eater\u2019s tentacles began to slowly melt the rhinoceros beetle\u2019s carapace. Daisy\u2019s expression changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What is that? Loro\u2019s carapace, can\u2019t be melted by physical attacks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you get the raid message!? It\u2019s a Mana Eater! M.A.N.A.E.A.T.E.R.! It\u2019s eating the mana strengthening Loro\u2019s carapace!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy fight against this crazy monster?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause we can\u2019t run! Tell me if you know anything about it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExtract all mana. Otherwise, won\u2019t die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her confidence from when she first appeared disappeared and she looked a bit nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how the outside, looks hurt, if mana is left\u2026 it regenerates. It\u2019s, not an organism.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s constantly using mana to regenerate its body? That means, if we can\u2019t deplete its mana, there\u2019s no way to defeat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSmart. Good student\u2026 Looks like, I\u2019ll have to go all out.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Daisy flashed her Evil Eyes. Countless number of monsters began to appear in the air. They were all monsters I sold to her. Other than the drake that she was riding on and the rhinoceros beetle that was attacking the Mana Eater, the Cyclops Lord, Mantis Queen, and all sorts of monsters from the Insect World showed themselves as undead monsters.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can control all of them at the same time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Hero successor candidate. Very amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Well, if she wasn\u2019t that strong, the empire behind the Desert Scorpion\u2019s guild master wouldn\u2019t have gone so far to obtain her\u2026 It was just that their method wasn\u2019t the best. Since I could accept Daisy into my guild thanks to that, perhaps I should be thanking them. If they were still alive in that ruined world when I visited, I needed to repay them. With Mad Typhoon.</p><br/><p>The monsters, which had appeared above what had now become a vacant lot, changed their positions whenever Daisy flashed her Evil Eyes. It was then that I understood how Daisy was using her Evil Eyes\u2019 power. Her Evil Eyes allowed her to read others\u2019 thoughts and even transmit her own thoughts to them. Using this ability, she commanded her undead army quickly and efficiently, exactly as she wished.</p><br/><p>Undead monsters under necromancy followed the orders of their master word by word. In other words, no matter how outstanding they were, they would not be able to display their full potential if the necromancer controlling them were inadequate. As I\u2019d never seen other necromancers, I couldn\u2019t say how skilled Daisy was as a commander, but it was fairly obvious.</p><br/><p>All of Daisy\u2019s undead monsters were moving as if they were alive, severing, biting, and burning the Mana Eater\u2019s tentacles. They struck at the Mana Eater\u2019s body, prevented the tentacles from attacking Daisy and me, and even snatched the monsters in the air to prevent the Mana Eater from recovering mana! Daisy\u2019s army was doing all these with ease.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaisy, you really are amazing..!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, show me, Kang Shin\u2019s power. Looking forward to, guild master\u2019s strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>She\u2019s trying to order me around now too, eh? Seeing Daisy swing her whip around on the drake, I snorted and raised my spear. Even if she didn\u2019t say anything, I would have done it anyways! I charged straight toward the Mana Eater as I called my elementals.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, Sharana!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un!]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m ready!]</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, materialize!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Okay, Master!]</p><br/><p>The three elementals flew next to me energetically. Peika had materialized in her dragon form and was emitting her aura wildly.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrevent that guy from touching me! Ruyue, stop the tentacles with ice! Sharana, power up Ruyue! Peika, try to paralyze the Mana Eater as much as you can!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t worry, my lightning is a lightning that can even burn mana!]</p><br/><p>Peika shouted a somewhat familiar line, after which thick bolts of lightning struck the Mana Eater\u2019s body. The damage taken by the Mana Eater was greater than the mana he absorbed from the lightning. As a result, its body became slightly scorched, and the tentacles\u2019 grip on Loro became loose.</p><br/><p>[Guaaaang!]</p><br/><p>[Get away from me with this rotting stench!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m going instead, you son of a bitch!\u2019</p><br/><p>The tentacles flying toward us became frozen by Ruyue\u2019s empowered freezing energy, then shattered. The same happened to the tentacles springing up from the ground. Having all three elementals attacking and having Peika materialized made my mana drop by 1% a second, but I already knew how to replenish my mana.</p><br/><p>[You think I\u2019ll let you!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cObliterate!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kiaaaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>Daisy\u2019s shout caused her undead army to let out strange screams and attack the tentacles even more enthusiastically. Meanwhile, Peika took more of my mana and hurled spears of lightning at the Mana Eater\u2019s body. I then jumped on top of its body, and held up my enlarged spear, as if to hurl it toward him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine Speed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018100 consecutive strikes by a thick and large spear! It\u2019ll different than last time!\u2019 The moment I stabbed its body with my enlarged spear, the Mana Eater\u2019s body puffed up crazily and tried to swallow me. However, a wall of ice immediately rose up around me, freezing parts of the Mana Eater\u2019s body and shattering it. Ice created from Ruyue and Sharana\u2019s joint power truly had incredible destructive power and defensive power.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuaaaaaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kugyaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>Gigant Time\u2019s effect was truly amazing. Even though I was small, I was still able to wield the giant spear freely! In the 3 seconds that felt like 30 seconds, I consecutively struck my spear into its body. I wanted to blow up its entire body!</p><br/><p>[Deathblood activates, taking 10% of the enemy\u2019s mana.]</p><br/><p>[Deathblood activates, taking 10% of the enemy\u2019s mana.]</p><br/><p>Then, Deathblood activated twice and overflowed my body with mana!</p><br/><p>Just 10% of its mana was enough to replenish my mana to full. With twice the amount, an overwhelming pressure weighed down on me. When I circulated Peruta Circuit, I felt like my body would explode. However, I had taken this into consideration! Without hesitation, I poured out mana, flaring up a white aura above the chaos flames enveloping the giant spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeroic Strike!\u2019</p><br/><p>If there was a fire wielded by the Devil of Hell, Balrog, would it be this? A terrifying flame shot up to the sky as I pierced the Mana Eater\u2019s body with my flaming spear.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[Kiaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>The chaos flames surrounding the spear dealt great damage to the Mana Eater, but it was the white aura that was more effective against the Mana Eater. Though it was only a theory, I suspected that Heroic Aura couldn\u2019t be absorbed as a pure mana. Although I couldn\u2019t be sure, I had more than enough mana to test the theory!</p><br/><p>I followed up with a second, then third Heroic Strike. The mana overflowing inside me drained out, and in return, consecutive critical hits rang out. My theory seemed to be true!</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Got it!]</p><br/><p>Peika quickly flew toward me, infusing herself into my spear. Instead of the chaos flames, Heroic Aura and white lightning enveloped my spear. Its body was already covered with chaos flames. As such, it was more effective to borrow Peika\u2019s power than to attack with more chaos flames.</p><br/><p>[Y-You, a mere human!]</p><br/><p>With mana taken by me again, the Mana Eater had become visibly weaker. Furthermore, Daisy\u2019s undead army was cutting apart its tentacles everywhere and preventing it from recovering mana. With chaos flames and blood contamination constantly draining its mana, it would surely die if this continued.</p><br/><p>However, I couldn\u2019t be certain that Daisy and my elementals could last until then. More importantly, I wanted to finish the job with my own strength. Now was the time, when Gigant Time was still active.</p><br/><p>As such, I held my spear transformed into a giant white lightning and struck the Mana Eater again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeroic Strike!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll kill you and regain my mana!]</p><br/><p>[I won\u2019t let that happen!]</p><br/><p>\u201cTentacles, cut them all off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Amidst shouts from all sides, our bodies and powerful mana clashed. Then, no sound entered my ears. The tentacles wanting to penetrate my armor, the earth tremoring with the Mana Eater\u2019s struggling, Ruyue\u2019s ice scattering into all directions, and the Chaotic Spear infused with Peika, crackling with a blinding lightning.</p><br/><p>[Deathblood activates, taking 10% of the enemy\u2019s mana.]</p><br/><p>The moment I heard that message, I detonated the mana gathered in my spear and dealt a final blow to the Mana Eater.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie, my armor\u2019s archenemy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t think I forgot about you breaking my Epic-grade armor!</p><br/><p>[Kak! M-My m-mana\u2026!]</p><br/><p>Its dying words was quite memorable. In an instant, its body shrunk down. The once boundless mana contained in the earth had all drained out, and was gathering in a single point.</p><br/><p>Wait, was this\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u201cDanger, Kang Shin!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the third shout from Daisy I heard. However, I wasn\u2019t the only one in danger. This mana explosion couldn\u2019t be targeting be alone. I gritted my teeth and threw my body toward that single point.</p><br/><p>\u201cDragon Skin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t let me down, Dragon Skin! Don\u2019t let me down, Golden Scarab Tattoo!\u2019</p><br/><p>I covered the Mana Eater\u2019s compressed body with my own. Immediately afterwards, a huge explosion followed.</p><br/><p>[Event Raid success! Four participants successfully completed an Event Raid! This great achievement increases the rewards greatly! As your average rank is lower than the raid boss, the reward increases again!]</p><br/><p>[For completing an Event Raid, you obtained 5 stat points and 2 skill points. Current skill points: 6]</p><br/><p>[Rewards will be distributed in order of contribution.]</p><br/><p>[Kang Shin-nim\u2019s contribution is the highest. Choose your reward.]</p><br/><p>[1. Mana Absorption Magic Book</p><br/><p>2. Million Tentacle (Epic)</p><br/><p>3. Elixir x3</p><br/><p>4. Mana Eater\u2019s Hood (Epic)]</p><br/><p>I felt like I had been hit with a blunt weapon and felt dizzy. Having almost died twice in a single day, I didn\u2019t feel like I was alive.</p><br/><p>But still, I didn\u2019t die. Of course, if I wasn\u2019t confident to a certain degree, I wouldn\u2019t have thrown my body as such.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, Kang Shin! Tell me if you\u2019re dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would I answer if I\u2019m dead!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feeling Daisy\u2019s presence nearing me, I shot up and shouted. After seeing me get up, Daisy\u2019s stiffened expression loosened. She seemed relieved. It was rare for her to shout, but I had heard her shout more than once today. SSS rank raid, how amazing!</p><br/><p>While I was in a daze thinking, another shout rang out from above.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince! I\u2019m coming down!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaaaaaak! Help, I can\u2019t hold out any longer!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah\u2026 Right, that was there. Seeing Daisy tilt her head and look up into the sky, I shrugged and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go take care of those.\u201d</p><br/><p>From then, it only us two hours to clean the aerial army and descend from the mountain.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Panan continent part is close to being done. Now, what reward will Shin choose and how will Ren and Lebuik interact with Daisy!? Will Daisy and Shin be able to safely see them off to the coast? Will they be able to defeat the El Patiz? Look forward to it!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

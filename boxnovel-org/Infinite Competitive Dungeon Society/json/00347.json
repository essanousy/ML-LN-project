The End (1)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Immediately, blood burst out from the Demon Lord\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>[Kuhak!]</p><br/><p>The demonic energy he was emitting was cut in half, flowing smoothly into my body. Twirling dthe demonic energy around my hand, I laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it, Demon Lord? Is your heart beating?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuuuk!]</p><br/><p>In truth, I had never planned to use Lilith\u2019s Temptation on the Demon Lord. He was one of the most powerful among all worlds\u2019 enemies. He was already strong when he had the dungeon\u2019s power, but he got even stronger when he cast it aside.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the possibility of Lilith\u2019s Temptation working kept increasing. Countless injuries from the prolonged fight made him weary, and most importantly, the curse from his subordinate demon lowered his charm to the point I could influence him with my own.</p><br/><p>It was only possible because I learned to quantify a target\u2019s abilities in my fight with the dragon.</p><br/><p>I could double the power of my charm against someone of the opposite sex, and after I absorbed the dragon\u2019s power, I learned to change my appearance without having to borrow a god\u2019s power. With the right conditions laid out, there was no need for me to hesitate.</p><br/><p>Licorice asked in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Zeus\u2019 power disappear!? How?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my ability. Zeus isn\u2019t the only one who can transform into whatever he wants.\u201d</p><br/><p>For example, the dragon I fought could change his appearance too. As I had the dragon\u2019s power and had Zeus\u2019 power until just recently, it wasn\u2019t hard for me to transform into a woman.</p><br/><p>[Kuhuk, this\u2026 this is the dungeon\u2019s power!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the power of my pocket watch and charm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Skills stored in the Collector\u2019s Pocket Watch could be used even when the dungeon\u2019s power was restricted. Although they didn\u2019t work against Lespina, that wasn\u2019t because the pocket watch was the dungeon\u2019s power, but rather\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, what\u2019s important is that this fight is over.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a grin, I held my spear up. Then, I frowned. My arm had gotten caught.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are so cumbersome. How do girls fight with these things?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband\u2026 Most people\u2019s aren\u2019t that big!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Was Kain disappointed? For some reason, he turned away without a word. I snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should be ready to do anything to win! It might be embarrassing, but isn\u2019t it better than losing your comrade because you were holding back!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Indeed, how you win is none of my business.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kain murmured. Then, the Demon Lord shouted as he staggered up.</p><br/><p>[My, my demonic energy\u2026 my demonic energy will devour you!]</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but that won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>The demonic energy twirling around my hand streamed into my body along Peruta Circuit\u2019s flow and smoothly mixed with other mana. Not only was my mana replenished, but my mana pool also continued to grow to an unprecedented level.</p><br/><p>[How can you use demonic energy so easily\u2026!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat nonsense are you blabbering? Demonic energy is mana too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Licorice shake her head from the side, it seemed that wasn\u2019t completely true, but it didn\u2019t matter since it didn\u2019t make a difference for me. I pointed my spear towards the half-dead Demon Lord. The aura coursing into the spear became compressed to the limit.</p><br/><p>[I see, your true ability\u2026 So that\u2019s why all worlds\u2026!]</p><br/><p>\u201cAre those your last words?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hmph, I can still\u2026 Kuk!]</p><br/><p>The moment demonic energy rose up from his body, I reached my free hand towards the Demon Lord. Grabbing him by the neck, I strangled him to prevent him from escaping. It wasn\u2019t just a physical restraint, but an absolute restraint that used Enigma.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I, I\u2026 am someone who will become the ruler of all worlds\u2026!]</p><br/><p>No matter how strong he could become, he stood no chance after Lilith\u2019s Temptation and additionally effects cut his power to a fourth. He attempted an attack by throwing the remaining demonic energy he had, but I simply took his attack with my body with a smile. At this point, I didn\u2019t feel a thing from such meager demonic energy.</p><br/><p>Then, I cut him in half with the spear in my hand.</p><br/><p>While his body was powerful, it was tattered by Kain\u2019s divine spear, fighter jets\u2019 explosions, and Lilith\u2019s Temptation. It simply couldn\u2019t withstand my spear which was strengthened to the limit by Enigma.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>As expected of the Demon Lord, he didn\u2019t die simply by having his body cut in half. Hearing his bloodcurdling shriek, I stuffed my spear back into my extradimensional space, then grabbed the two halves of his body in each of my hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, I won\u2019t let you escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuk\u2026!]</p><br/><p>I drew my power up. It didn\u2019t matter whether the power was Extort, Crimson Hell, or Absolute Soul. It wasn\u2019t necessary to distinguish them when they shared a common purpose. All I needed was for them to carry out my will.</p><br/><p>[Ku, kuuuuuuuuua!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew\u2026 Looks like this will be the final test.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord\u2019s severed halves seemed to be shriveling up. Soon, they began to scatter away as particles. After letting out a sigh, I roused Peruta Circuit and collected the particles together onto my hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop trying to run, will you?\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026]</p><br/><p>The black particles glowed as if to respond to my words, but that was it. Immediately afterwards, I absorbed all of the particles. The last handful of demonic energy and the power of the Luka continent rushed into me.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, now it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feeling the Demon Lord\u2019s energy fusing into my body, I stretched in satisfaction. The moment I felt the numerous attributes and energies in my body merge into one, I became certain that I had obtained something special.</p><br/><p>Immediately, I suspected that this was what Sherafina wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cD-Dear Husband.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? What?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I turned towards Licorice, she flung her body at me at full speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoa, what!?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I received her in shock, Licorice rubbed her face on my chest and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, I think it\u2019s fine if you stay that way!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStay? Ah, I\u2019m still a woman!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay as long as it\u2019s Dear Husband! Kiss, do you want to kiss?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not okay!\u201d</p><br/><p>I quickly transformed back. Licorice got off as she made a noticeably disappointed expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a shame\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only transformed to take down the Demon Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>I smacked her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cKain, it\u2019s over. Let\u2019s go take care of the monsters on Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKain?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kain didn\u2019t speak. When I called his name a few times, he finally looked back at me and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy world\u2019s power disappeared.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Sherafina\u2019s voice rang out.</p><br/><p>[\u2018Kain Zerahard\u2019 Grand Raid commences!

The worlds\u2019 powers of all the Heroes on Earth are going towards you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was as he said. Before I noticed, three worlds\u2019 powers were flowing into me. This feeling was similar to the increase in League I experienced when I leveled up in the dungeon. Kain seemed to have realized it too as he shouted in a hurry.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, hurry. Once the pathway opens, there is no turning back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, what a mess! I\u2019m on it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sherafina finally made her move! I quickly twisted open the door to the dungeon. Pzzzt! After fixing the door rejecting me with Enigma\u2019s power, I shouted at Kain.</p><br/><p>\u201cKain, you remember, right!? Do as we talked about before! That\u2019s more important!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. I obtained this god\u2019s power just for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGod\u2019s power? What god\u2019s power?\u201d</p><br/><p>I recalled back to my first encounter with Kain. I had heard Kain had Odin\u2019s power, but the power I first felt from him was a different god\u2019s power. I had noticed it because I had Zeus and Hermes\u2019 power.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now on, all explorers will gather in one place.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I stepped into the dungeon, Kain activated the power he had been waiting to use. The biggest reason I took him into our guild was now in effect.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now on, all members of Revival except Kang Shin will disappear from Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, at least explain what he\u2019s are you doing before you go! \u2026 Thanks! Revival members, gather! Ignore the monsters you\u2019re fighting and get over here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately after I shared my consciousness with the flustered Licorice, she flew about in a hurry to bring people together. In a way, it was quite cute. Still, I had to acknowledge its effectiveness, as more succubi and members of Revival showed up as she moved about.</p><br/><p>While most were confused as to what was going on, there was no time to explain things in detail. I already had my hands full with deflecting Sherafina\u2019s power that began to pour over us.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs everyone here!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s here! Except Ciara!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not an explorer, so she should be fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the dungeon\u2019s door closed, Kain shouted sonorously. The space around him already became his personal space that Sherafina couldn\u2019t invade.</p><br/><p>\u201cKune\u0113!\u201d</p><br/><p>The golden helmet of Hades, which had the power to hide from any entity, covered all members of Revival. Hwaya who caught a glimpse of me reached towards me, while I waved my hand at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon, dear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, I entered the dungeon.</p><br/><p>In this place, Loretta was nowhere to be seen.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Skill Synthesis (4)</p><br/><p>[Please, Crown Prince. I can\u2019t protect them alone!]</p><br/><p>\u201cW-Why can\u2019t I be happy\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[C-Crown Prince?]</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No, nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>By now, I was used to something happening whenever I was climbing the dungeon smoothly. Event Dungeons, Event Raids, Luka continent, and now this! Just when I thought I could focus solely on the dungeon, Ren was calling me. I couldn\u2019t let my guard down at all. In fact, I felt like someone was doing this on purpose.</p><br/><p>I gritted my teeth and asked Ren.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Ren? Tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 No, Crown Prince, you must be having a hard time too. It was my mistake, forget what I said.]</p><br/><p>\u201cCut the crap and tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Y-Yes!]</p><br/><p>Ren\u2019s world, the Panan continent, was a peaceful land where humans and beastmen coexisted. Of course, both races had to face numerous difficulties until the peace was achieved, but they had reportedly done it. At least, that was how it was 200 years ago.</p><br/><p>Things began to change one day. Small conflicts between humans and beastmen increased in scale as time went on until one day, a war broke out between a human country and a beastman country.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really interested in Panan continent\u2019s history.\u201d</p><br/><p>[What if it was the history of an outsider\u2019s invasion?]</p><br/><p>The war raged and blood flowed like the ocean. Another country then jumped into the war, and the entire continent became enveloped in the war. Before a dungeon explorer revealed the truth of the matter, everyone thought it was a self-created disaster by humans and beastmen.</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t it. It was the doing of Panan continent\u2019s invaders, the \u2018El Patiz.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cEl Patiz?\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s what they call themselves. We call them \u2018brain worms.\u2019 That\u2019s what they are. Bugs that crawl into our brains.]</p><br/><p>According to Ren, these brain worms crawled into the brains of sleeping victims and ate the content. The victims would die and the brain worms would then pretend to be the victims they killed. The only way to detect whether someone was eaten by a brain worm was to use a special magic for detecting life signals.</p><br/><p>Brain worms could perfectly imitate the actions of their victims to the point that not even the victims\u2019 own family members could tell anything apart. However, the fact that they were still brain worms didn\u2019t change. When enough brain worms gathered, they would finally reveal themselves and drag others into their hell.</p><br/><p>[Luckily, people with high mana could detect brain worms in their initial form and avoid them. The explorers who found out about the brain worms\u2019 existence did their best to find their weaknesses, and they notified everyone that they were the ones who caused the war. However, the effect was minimal. Upper echelons of most countries\u2019 government had already turned into brain worms, and soon, stronger brain worms that Panan continent\u2019s warriors had trouble with began to cross over.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Unable to stop the war in time, the population of Panan continent plummeted. The brain worms\u2019 forces only grew stronger as they consumed more people and strengthened themselves\u2026 In the end, 170 years after the onset of their invasion, an incident happened that made everyone lose their hopes against the brain worms.]</p><br/><p>I had a feeling I knew what was coming. Though I blocked my ears, I could still hear Ren\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>[The Hero of that generation\u2026 the Lion Empire\u2019s Golden Lion Emperor was eaten by a brain worm.]</p><br/><p>\u201cRen\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>[The worm that controlled the Hero was the one that ruled over all other worms. It was the so-called world\u2019s enemy. Regardless, after it gained the power of the Hero, the worms began to conquer the continent at an unprecedented rate. They were now able to reproduce in our world.]</p><br/><p>Ren said that the only way the Panan continent\u2019s people could survive until now was because they found the brain worms\u2019 weakness.</p><br/><p>[The ocean. They can\u2019t enter the ocean. Not even the worm that obtained the Hero\u2019s body could enter the ocean. We realized that the worms avoided invading ocean-based countries. Since they couldn\u2019t cross the ocean, they used another passageway to deploy their troops to the countries in the ocean.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have noticed that sooner!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I already told you. They were extremely meticulous and skilled in hiding their weakness. An explorer than ran to the ocean to escape the brain worms noticed coincidentally, and it was thanks to this coincidence that the remaining explorers could breathe a sigh of relief. Of course, that didn\u2019t last long either.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>At my question, Ren became silent for a while. Then, he confessed in a somber tone.</p><br/><p>[Crown Prince\u2026 Beastmen are unable to swim.]</p><br/><p>Beastmen couldn\u2019t enter the ocean. Most of Panan continent\u2019s survivors were beastmen. Thus, they could only resort to creating a base near the ocean and using ocean water to fight against the brain worms. Thankfully, they had someone who could wield the power of water, but after he was eaten by the brain worms, the last hope had disappeared.</p><br/><p>[This was around the time Sir Lebuik died. Most of the remaining explorers also died then.]</p><br/><p>\u201cRen, right now, you\u2019re\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m protecting eight children. Five beastmen, three humans. When the base collapsed, I barely managed to save these children and found a safe place to hide. By climbing the dungeon, I found food to bring back for them. This was when I met Crown Prince.]</p><br/><p>This might sound harsh, but there really seemed to be no hope. Regardless, I urged Ren on since I had to hear what was happening now.</p><br/><p>\u201cRen, tell me the current situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>[They discovered our hiding place. We\u2019re running.]</p><br/><p>It was rather simple.</p><br/><p>[We\u2019re currently resting after defeating the pursuers. But soon, a stronger squadron of brain worms will attack us. I ended up talking to Crown Prince out of desperation.]</p><br/><p>I understood how Ren was feeling. He most likely wanted to get whatever help he could. I sighed and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, what are you planning to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Before it\u2019s too late, we have to go back to the coast. We have to create a base that will protect us from them. We have to drive the ocean water and create a manmade island of some sort.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSounds like tough work even when you get to the coast.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ri\u2026 Right.]</p><br/><p>After thinking for a bit, I continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you submit a request for Dimensional Mercenaries?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes, but no one came.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about using Dimensional Travel skill to move them elsewhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s impossible, Crown Prince. Dimensional Travel can only be used alone.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you put some skill points into it and\u2026 ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right, that was my skill! The original Dimensional Travel skill didn\u2019t have skill levels, so it didn\u2019t matter how many skill points you had\u2026 Wait, but there\u2019s Return! If I could use Return with the eight children other than Ren\u2026! My Return skill was currently level 4. I could take up to three people with me. As I had never distributed skill points into it, I used 15 skill points to raise it up to level 8.</p><br/><p>[Return became level 8! It can be used 6 times per day and you can choose 6 returning points. You can bring up to 5 people.]</p><br/><p>Damn, it\u2019s not enough\u2026! Once I came back to Earth using Return, I couldn\u2019t go back to Panan with Return. I had to use Dimensional Travel to travel between worlds. Because of Dimensional Travel\u2019s cooldown, it wouldn\u2019t work out. I bit my lips.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Ren was still talking.</p><br/><p>[Crown Prince, forget about what I said. I\u2019m Panan\u2019s Ren. This much danger, I can get through by myself.]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo bullshit allowed.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m not a bull, I\u2019m a lion!]</p><br/><p>In this situation, there really was only one thing I could do. It was to ignore Ren\u2019s request. Ren knew he was making an unreasonable request, and he took it back as well. A brain-eating worm\u2026 disgusting. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t feel any sympathy for Ren, but there was just no hope.</p><br/><p>Thus, I told him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t die before I get there.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Crown Prince, I told you, don\u2019t come! I was just ranting!]</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you die, I\u2019ll kill you, got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Crown Prince!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cShut it! If I think it\u2019s too dangerous, I\u2019ll escape by myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Crown Prince\u2026]</p><br/><p>I hung up on Ren. Then, I contacted the person on my friend list whom I never contacted before.</p><br/><p>\u201cLebuik, are you doing well?\u201d</p><br/><p>[P-Panan continent requested for Dimensional Mercenaries\u2026 What do I do, Rookie?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should know who made the request.\u201d</p><br/><p>[N-No one wants to go\u2026! Rookie, tell Ren-nim to get out of there! Please!]</p><br/><p>\u201cRen doesn\u2019t plan on leaving. He\u2019s protecting eight children.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Eight\u2026 That\u2019s two less\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cLebuik, what are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Me? What, are you telling me to go to Panan continent?]</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me quickly. What are you going to do? Tell me what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Rookie, you\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Dimensional Travel skill is a bit special. I can bring someone else with me. So, Lebuik, what are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>As I spoke to her, I put skill points into Dimensional Travel. Lv 2, Lv 3, Lv 4\u2026 It was then that the number of people I could bring increased by one. The cooldown decreased by quite a lot to two months. I now had 1 skill point left. There was no going back.</p><br/><p>[W-What do you mean\u2026 I, I can\u2019t go. I\u2019ll die if I do. Definitely!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou might die, that\u2019s true. I didn\u2019t make my decision easily either.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Then how can you say it like it\u2019s nothing? Are you looking down on death!? If a brain worm kills you, you can\u2019t even enjoy eternal rest! Your brain will get eaten and your body will become their toy!]</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if I don\u2019t go, the same will happen to my friend. Lebuik, I\u2019ll give you 5 seconds, so make up your mind. If you can\u2019t, I\u2019m going to go alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>[W-Wait! No, I won\u2019t\u2026 I won\u2019t go! I escaped by myself, so how can I, at this point\u2026!]</p><br/><p>\u201c3, 2, 1\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Uuuuut! Fine! I\u2019ll go!]</p><br/><p>I smiled. As expected of a woman in love!</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m sure Ren will be touched. Maybe, he\u2019ll be so touched that he\u2019ll hug you.\u201d</p><br/><p>[H-He will hug me? Ren-nim will? Gulp\u2026 N-No, I\u2019m not going to fulfill my desires\u2026! Even I wouldn\u2019t throw away my life to satisfy my lust! I just want to make up for the loyalty I failed to protect!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI got it, so meet me at the First Dungeon Residential Area\u2019s pub, \u2018Cocked.\u2019 Make sure you\u2019re fully prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Rookie\u2026 Okay.]</p><br/><p>I hung up on her as well. Then, I let out a long sigh and opened the guild communication channel.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m going to go do a Dimensional Mercenary request. It might take a while, but don\u2019t worry.]</p><br/><p>[Is it safe?]</p><br/><p>At my sudden announcement, the guild communication channel became noisy. Hwaya then asked me with a worried voice. Though I was thankful that she was worrying about me\u2026 for some reason, I broke out into laughter.</p><br/><p>[What requests are safe? But well, it\u2019ll be fine.]</p><br/><p>I spoke honestly.</p><br/><p>[I can see the ending.]</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Next chapter will showcase a hard-to-see party composition!</p><br/><p>PS \u2013 Do you see the ending Shin saw?</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Tfw the pub\u2019s name is \u2018Cocked\u2019\u2026 Literally, he spelled it out in English :thinking:</p><br/><p>Also, the last bit was a The World God Only Knows reference.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

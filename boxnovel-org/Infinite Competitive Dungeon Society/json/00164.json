The Rondo of Scarlet Flame and Silver Ice (7)</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, what\u2019s with your appearance?\u201d</p><br/><p>[My appearance? What do you me\u2026 Kyaaaak! When was the seal released!?]</p><br/><p>Seeing Peika screaming, I thought back to the moment we made our contract. Peika had said that the small dragon tattoo on her cheek was a creature closest to the essence of my soul. However, when I contracted Ruyue, the tattoo that appeared on her back wasn\u2019t a creature, but some geometric shape. At the time, I just thought it was different for a mad elemental, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Did you lie?\u201d</p><br/><p>[L-Lie? \u2026 Y-Yes.]</p><br/><p>I was told elementals couldn\u2019t lie, but everything was a lie! Wait, come to think of it, elementals were the ones who told me that! Those liars!</p><br/><p>[But I thought you\u2019d hate me if my real body was a dragon!]</p><br/><p>\u201cAi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Do you hate me? Un? Do you hate me?]</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not. No matter what you guys really are, you\u2019re still my precious elementals. You don\u2019t need to worry about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Peika looked noticeably relieved as she hugged my arm. It seemed coiling around my arm was her way of expressing affection. In truth, she looked very similar to a snake. If it wasn\u2019t for the two horns on her head and her marvelous scales, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell.</p><br/><p>The wind elemental, who was watching us, was acting strangely.</p><br/><p>[Hateful\u2026 You took her away from me, but you\u2019re together with elementals!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one who took Pesina away from you!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Unforgivable! All humans are the same. Humans took my Pesina away from me! They should all die!]</p><br/><p>It\u2019s getting worse! I quickly summoned Talaria and flew up. At the same time, I infused Ruyue into my body since she couldn\u2019t fly when she materialized. For an instant, I felt my body getting cold. However, I could also feel myself getting stronger.</p><br/><p>[Wow, I became one with Shin!]</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, yeah\u2026 Certainly, I feel much stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>I somewhat dodged Ruyue\u2019s awkward comment and focused on my next duty. It was to materialize Peika.</p><br/><p>[C-Can I materialize in my human form?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhichever one is stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Uuu. O-Okay.]</p><br/><p>Soon, a black dragon appeared in mid-air. With a body length of about 15 meters, she truly looked like a dragon from Eastern legends. The two horns on her head were continuously letting off sparks, and her black scales were also brimming with lightning.</p><br/><p>Looking at Peika\u2019s awe-inspiring look, I widened my eyes. The amount of mana she was using up was completely different than before. Ruyue also used more mana after she was unsealed, but it wasn\u2019t to this degree.</p><br/><p>Peika wasn\u2019t completely unsealed. What was she really? I swallowed my question and hurriedly took out a highest-grade Mana Potion from my inventory and drank it. Although I was curious, that wasn\u2019t my priority.</p><br/><p>[Die\u2026 die!]</p><br/><p>[Fine, I\u2019ll beat you up until you\u2019re almost dead!]</p><br/><p>It seemed she wasn\u2019t happy with being in her dragon form, as Peika shouted angrily and charged at the elemental. He tried to blow her away with his wind, but Peika snorted and shot out lightning from her mouth. The lightning easily annihilated the wind mixed with freezing energy and continued to hurl toward him. Peika shouted.</p><br/><p>[Try materializing!]</p><br/><p>[You think I can\u2019t!? But if I do\u2026!]</p><br/><p>[If you\u2019re going to be stubborn and refuse to accept the world\u2019s greatest master, you better bet your life on it!]</p><br/><p>Peika was emitting an overwhelming pressure. The endless lightning shooting out from her body became spears that rushed to the wind elemental, and he could only run away. Even though he posed great danger to us in the 2nd floor, he couldn\u2019t do anything now.</p><br/><p>Would I have won if I just materialized Peika before? How did she get so strong!? No, I can\u2019t just stay here and let Peika do everything!</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go before Peika really kills him!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un!]</p><br/><p>I kicked off the air with Talaria\u2019s power and charged toward the elemental. In my hand was the Chaotic Spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to talk, I\u2019ll do it your way!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuu\u2026 No, noooooo!]</p><br/><p>[Master, he\u2019s materializing!]</p><br/><p>His presence suddenly became bigger. The spear I thrust out was caught by the elemental\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>[This\u2026 This is why I hate it!]</p><br/><p>I girl\u2019s voice rang out. At the same time, a giant wall of wind pushed toward me. I formed chaos flames and pushed away from the elemental\u2019s hand. I blocked the wall of wind and murmured in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 I see.\u201d</p><br/><p>An elemental that refused to materialize. Elements might not want to materialize for multiple reasons. I thought that a free elemental would refuse to do so as it didn\u2019t want to waste its elemental power. That was what I thought.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t the case for him. It was obvious from his appearance.</p><br/><p>Long ears and clear facial features, a slim, yet somewhat voluptuous, body. It was undoubtedly the appearance of a female elf. Boundless elemental power and mana. He possessed a mana that an elemental could not possibly have.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fused.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yeah, yeah, yeah! It\u2019s because of you humans! You tricked me by saying it\u2019ll help defeat the Demon Lord!]</p><br/><p>It was only obvious that he would go mad. Throughout history, the fusion of an elementalist and an elemental only brought about tragedy! This fusion was an evil magic, completely different from infusing an elemental into one\u2019s body like I was doing with Spirit Aura.</p><br/><p>It was unlikely that an elf would do such a thing, so just he said, humans had to be involved. How irritating. First Ruyue, now him. Innocent elementals were hurt. The humans who made him like that must have died. There wasn\u2019t anyone for me vent my anger.</p><br/><p>[Do you realize now? DO YOU!?]</p><br/><p>[Why are you getting mad at my master! He\u2019s innocent, you idiot!]</p><br/><p>The reason \u2018he\u2019 kept a male appearance was probably to not subconsciously go back to that appearance. Fusing an elemental and an elementalist was already horrible. Whoever did so couldn\u2019t have made their sex different, as that would only increase uncertainties.</p><br/><p>[Pesina died in pain! I hate humans, I really hate humans!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it was unstable, the fused power of an elemental and an elementalist was truly powerful. The wind power instantly overwhelmed Peika\u2019s lightning and pushed her back. However, I gritted my teeth and charged toward him\u2026 no, her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long do you plan on tormenting her!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m not tormenting Pesina!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThen remember your name! Let her go!\u201d</p><br/><p>I swung my spear. The wind arrows hurling toward me were all burnt away, as I continued to fly toward her.</p><br/><p>[No, I don\u2019t want to lose her forever!]</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to torment her for eternity for a stupid reason like that, Sharana!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I was the one that said it, I couldn\u2019t help but stop in shock. It was the same for the elemental\u2026 Sharana.</p><br/><p>[Ah, aaaaah!]</p><br/><p>She screamed. She suddenly began to shine. Then, I remembered how I knew her name. Right, in the dream I had to awaken my ability, I wasn\u2019t just with Peika and Ruyue. Sharana was there, too!</p><br/><p>\u201cGod, to think Ciara would actually be helpful\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When I fought Ruyue, I barely made her remember her name after beating her up. Back then, I couldn\u2019t remember the dream at all. Feeling somewhat strange, I approached her.</p><br/><p>[Ah, aaaah\u2026. Shara, Sharana\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cSharana!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I shouted her name, something I didn\u2019t expect happened.</p><br/><p>[Pesina, let\u2019s stop. This person isn\u2019t your enemy\u2026 He\u2019s my new master.]</p><br/><p>A new clear voice rang out. She was calling me Master. It was then that I realized I had been gravely mistaken. The one I was facing wasn\u2019t Sharana. I should have realized when she attacked her contractor.</p><br/><p>She was Pesina, who was pretending to be Sharana.</p><br/><p>[Pesina, you can go back now. Look, someone who could save us came.]</p><br/><p>[Sharana, can you believe a human? I can\u2019t do it!]</p><br/><p>[Pesina, I don\u2019t want to see you in pain\u2026 He\u2019s right. We have to go back when we can.]</p><br/><p>Seeing two voices taking turns to talk in one body was somewhat surreal. I simply watched them quietly. Perhaps because Sharana spoke out, Pesina sounded a lot calmer.</p><br/><p>[Sharana\u2026 Is that okay with you?]</p><br/><p>[He\u2019s a good person. Look, he has two elementals that can materialize.]</p><br/><p>Her gaze fell on me. From beyond the elf body, I could feel the elemental, Sharana\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>[But you\u2019re human, like the humans who tormented me and Sharana!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a hobby of tormenting my elementals. Isn\u2019t that obvious from seeing me?\u201d</p><br/><p>[But, I\u2026!]</p><br/><p>[Pesina, let\u2019s stop hurting and rest. Okay?]</p><br/><p>Sharana\u2019s words silenced Pesina. Although my companions were fighting around us, the area we were in was quiet. Even the strong winds had subsided, as we were waiting for her answer.</p><br/><p>Finally, Pesina opened her mouth.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m\u2026]</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re free now, Pesina.\u201d</p><br/><p>[If Sharana\u2019s\u2026 okay with it\u2026]</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s for Pesina and me.]</p><br/><p>[Okay\u2026]</p><br/><p>With a voice of resignation, she reached her hand out toward me. While Peika was coiled up and watching us, I caught her hand.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll trust you one last time, Human.]</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it to me, Pesina.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Okay. Now, I\u2019ll rest\u2026]</p><br/><p>Pesina\u2019s eyes slowly closed as she fell into my embrace. To be exact, their fusion had been released and her body fell after losing the power of its soul. With Pesina\u2019s \u2018corpse\u2019 in my arms, I looked around. There, I saw an elemental. Not an elemental who looked like a boy or looked like an elf, but a beautiful elemental who wore a dress weaved with the wind.</p><br/><p>I finally understood. The reason that Sharana, no, Pesina was in the form of a boy was to prevent Sharana from coming out. Now that she was freed from Pesina, Sharana had regained her appearance.</p><br/><p>She looked like a lively girl in her teens, whose long green hair was split into two-side-up tails[1. Two-side-up is a twintail-like hairstyle, but slightly different. In two-side-up, the back hair isn\u2019t fully tied up like in a twintail. Look up \u201canime two-side-up\u201d hair.].</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m Sharana. Thank you for catching Pesina.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Kang Shin, nice to meet you. Also\u2026 it\u2019s only obvious that I show your past contractor respect.\u201d</p><br/><p>First, I put Pesina into my inventory. I didn\u2019t know if I was going to bury her or cremate her, but leaving her body out in the open here would only damage it further. Sharana flew toward me and spoke.</p><br/><p>[To commemorate Pesina\u2019s departure, I want to cry all night and sleep in Master\u2019s embrace. Can I do that after we sweep this place?]</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Then let\u2019s first finish our contract, Master!]</p><br/><p>With that, Sharan flew toward me and kissed me on the lips. She was swift, as expected of a wind elemental. Feeling the scent of a cool breeze on my lips, I opened my eyes, while Peika screamed.</p><br/><p>[Ugyaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>At that moment, a fanfare rang out in my ear. I felt like I hadn\u2019t heard it in a long time.</p><br/><p>[You formed a contract with the wind elemental Sharana! Your affinity to the wind element increases greatly!]</p><br/><p>[List of Contracted Elementals</p><br/><p>1. Peika \u2013 Lightning elemental. Unique elemental. Materialized. First seal released. Second Awakening.</p><br/><p>2. Ruyue \u2013 Ice elemental. Unique elemental. Materialized. Unsealed. Second Awakening.]</p><br/><p>3. Sharana \u2013 Wind Elemental. Unique elemental. Materialized. Unsealed. Second Awakening.]</p><br/><p>Feeling the new power flowing through my body, I knew the contract between me and SHarana was made. At the same time, Sharana took my mana and began to materialize. She became taller and more mature. Her hair always became longer and fluttered in the air as the wind blew around her.</p><br/><p>Right, this was the normal unsealing. Ruyue and Peika were truly unique in this regard as they changed their form. Ruyue became a girl from a wolf and Peika became a dragon from a girl.</p><br/><p>[Wow, the seal was released right after we formed our contract! We must really be a perfect match, Master!]</p><br/><p>Sharana looked at her body with widened eyes, then hugged me excitedly. Mm, why did elementals\u2019 intimacy go through the roof as soon as they formed contracts? Strange, I didn\u2019t remember pulling the same card more than once.[2. I don\u2019t know what this is referencing. Perhaps some card game where you can \u201cevolve\u201d or \u201cstrengthen\u201d the same card?]</p><br/><p>As Peika was glaring at Sharana like she wanted to eat her, I pushed Sharana away slightly and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy affinity to wind was practically at the peak already.\u201d</p><br/><p>It had been strengthened by many things, so it made sense that Sharana\u2019s seal was undone the moment we formed our contract. In any case, with Sharana no longer being a mad elemental, I was done with my job. I turned around to see how others were doing.</p><br/><p>[He was defeated!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, an opening!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so hard and cold!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re done, hurry up and help us!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ice Souls! Catch them!]</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, block them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you, don\u2019t call me Ludia! O Mitarus, embrace this evil soul with your love!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ice Witch, take this!]</p><br/><p>\u201cMommy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScarlet Flame</p><br/><p>The close-ranged attackers were all fighting the giant armor while dodging its hammer smashes. The long-ranged attackers were destroying the army of armor minions that the giant armor was endlessly creating, while also attacking the giant armor. It was a total pandemonium.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaaaap! Heaven Collapsing Strike!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hmph!]</p><br/><p>The spear father thrust out clashed with the giant armor\u2019s hammer. A boom rang out. Meanwhile, Laz Michel charged toward the giant armor and struck down on its foot with his bastard sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kyaaaa!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu, now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHit and run, Shadow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, Ajusshi!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You can try to hurt me, but it\u2019s useless!]</p><br/><p>\u201cMommy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>A giant scarlet flame rose up above the giant armor. Focused on the area carved away by the others, the scarlet flames were slowly but surely devouring its body. The giant armor roared and summoned more minions, which were promptly melted by a wave of Ina\u2019s hand. Hwaya\u2019s flames and Ina\u2019s ice were dominating the battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, let\u2019s go in straight.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Leave it to me, Master!]</p><br/><p>I formed chaos flames again and asked Sharana.</p><br/><p>\u201cSharana, what are you most confident in?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Master, I can make everything stronger. Colder ice, faster lightning, hotter lightning!]</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m sorry to ask you when you just materialized, but can you help us?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Gladly!]</p><br/><p>Sharana\u2019s body seemed to scatter into thin air. In the next moment, the chaos flames began to rage as if to break through the ceiling. The chaos flames\u2019 power had almost doubled in an instant! Its powerful energy made everyone focus their attention toward me.</p><br/><p>[Elemental, so you choose to side with humans! Even though the Lord gave you a chance!]</p><br/><p>[Demon-ssi, I hate demons more than I hate humans! Let\u2019s go, Master!]</p><br/><p>I imbued all my mana into my spear. The giant armor sent armor minions after me, but they were easily blocked by Peika. While it was focused on me, my companions attacked violently.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un!]</p><br/><p>If I was the only one here, I would have attacked with Crimson Roar, but that skill attacked everyone, whether foe or ally. As such, the next strongest attack was to use chaos flames!</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll melt your fat armor!]</p><br/><p>[Like I\u2019d bow to a mere elemental!]</p><br/><p>While Peika and I were charging toward him together, Peika opened her mouth widely and accelerated. She dodged the hammer it swung and bit down on its neck, immediately releasing a vast amount of lightning. For an instant, the spacious hall became dyed in gold.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>\u201cAttack now!\u201d</p><br/><p>With the opening created by Peika, the attackers each left a grave injury on its body. Father used his shockwaves to break the ice forming its body, Ye-Eun and the others left cracks on its body with quick successive attacks, and Laz Michel widened the cracks with his unexpectedly delicate control over his sword.</p><br/><p>[Freeze!]</p><br/><p>Even with Peika\u2019s full-force attack, it was daunted in the least. Its eyes flashed and the air instantly became colder. However, we had our way of dealing with it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t work on us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with Hwaya\u2019s sharp shout, the air began to heat up. The ice that tried to form were quickly sublimated to vapor, as foggy steam filled up the hall. At the heated air, the giant armor roared.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>It was then that I decided to make my move. Amidst the dense water vapor in the air, I charged toward the giant armor. It seemed it could clearly see me even in this fog, as it flashed its eyes and shot its crumbling fist toward me.</p><br/><p>[I can see you, cowardly human!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d say that, so I prepared this specifically for you. Shadow Blink!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the next moment, I was behind it. Using Divine Speed, I gained more time and focused the chaos aura and heroic aura to the tip of my spear. Then, I thrust forward!</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>My spear easily pierced through the giant armor\u2019s neck, which had been weakened by Ina and Hwaya\u2019s joint attack. A huge flame erupted. Strengthened by Sharana\u2019s power, the inextinguishable flame ignored its resistance and blazed, eventually separating its neck from its body. It let out a death throe.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaak! Y-You cowardly human!]</p><br/><p>\u201cLife\u2019s about the result, Fool.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I swung my spear and shook off the chaos flame, I murmured to myself like a cold city man. I was pretty cool if I said so myself.</p><br/><p>Immediately afterward, a fanfare rang out for all of us.</p><br/><p>[You defeated the Event Dungeon\u2019s boss monster, \u2018High-rank Demon Protesla!\u2019]</p><br/><p>[4,000,000 gold will be distributed evenly among party members. You obtained 500,000 gold.]</p><br/><p>As the other party members were watching, I made a cool pose on top of the crumbling Protesla\u2019s body. I knew what they wanted to say. It was probably why I was acting so cool or that my flame was a cheat. But since I didn\u2019t get the first place in contribution, it should be fine!</p><br/><p>I shouted inwardly and said to the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go home!\u201d</p><br/><p>Our short, yet long, expedition had finally come to an end.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>You must have a question after reading this chapter. Put it aside, as it will be revealed in the next arc.</p><br/><p>This arc has come to an end! We\u2019ll finish off the matter with Earth early next chapter and go back to the dungeon! Plus, since I promised to end the arc by this chapter, it\u2019s 200% the normal length!

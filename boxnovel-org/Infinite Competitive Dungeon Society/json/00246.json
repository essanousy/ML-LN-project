What Happened Once Will... (6)</p><br/><p>\u201cCareful, Shin. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine with Licorice and Lotte around, but if someone on the Lava King\u2019s level appears, you have to wait for us. Got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who put me in a team by myself\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s that, and this is this.\u201d</p><br/><p>I flicked back Hwaya\u2019s forehead as she approached me. Seeing her rub her forehead and mumbling in complaint drew a smile on my face.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry and leave it to me. I\u2019ll come back safe and sound.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unlike me, Hwaya had one explorer, Michel, and Ilayda in her team. Other members of Revival were in similar teams. The reason I was in a team by myself was that there was just too many Event Dungeons. Someone had to decrease the number without caring for the stat points and rewards. More exactly, the number of Event Dungeons I was in charge of was 317. In other words, I would have to clear about five Event Dungeons per day. Among them were 60 S rank dungeons.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, let\u2019s go. Uhuhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLicorice, you better not try anything funny, or else\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, Hwaya.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuu, I can\u2019t trust you\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>With Licorice and Plene, I hopped on Lotte\u2019s back. As some of the other teams had already set out, only a few came to see me off, though there were plenty of reporters with mics and cameras pointed towards me.</p><br/><p>[Hero, can I step on them before I fly up?]</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, Lotte. I don\u2019t want to make headlines like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lotte snorted as if she wasn\u2019t content, then flapped her wings and blew the crowd away. Next, flapping her red striped wings once more, she kicked off the ground and into the air.</p><br/><p>[Where are we going, Hero!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to fly around the Pacific and clear the ocean based dungeons. Then, we\u2019ll clean up the rest of Oceania starting from Papua New Guinea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Dear Husband\u2019s scale of operation is the five seas and the six continents\u2026 Will we be able to go through an entire continent and an ocean in just two months?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, we have another continent and another ocean too.\u201d</p><br/><p>I spoke calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re also in charge of Antarctica and the Antarctic Ocean. You guys brought your anti-cold equipment right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Kyaaak! What is Dear Husband and Hwaya thinking!? That\u2019s a third of Earth! Dear Husband is in charge of a third of Earth? Is the word \u2018impossible\u2019 in Dear Husband\u2019s dictionary?\u201d</p><br/><p>The tight schedule caused Licorice to scream. I patted her head and consoled her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat just shows how much of an emergency we\u2019re in. With Plene\u2019s ability and my ability, we\u2019ll be able to take care of dungeons under SS rank quickly, so it won\u2019t be that difficult. I\u2019ll let everyone rest once a week too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Dear Husband is going to go the dungeon while we\u2019re resting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice\u2019s razor sharp comment almost cut me. Licorice looked at me disapprovingly and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI already know how Dear Husband thinks. Dear Husband is planning on climbing the First Dungeon while we\u2019re sleeping and breaking through Beyond during the once a week break, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUk.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was all true. There was nothing for me to argue about. Seeing me speechless, Licorice made a wry smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can somewhat understand how Dear Husband has gotten so strong at such a young age. Dear Husband can\u2019t stop climbing the dungeon with the situation Earth is in, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, I can\u2019t stop even if I know I shouldn\u2019t rush myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>I could easily climb the dungeon at the moment due to the vast difference between my strength and the dungeon\u2019s required standard. However, this wouldn\u2019t continue forever. I would eventually reach a wall. I had to climb the dungeon as much as I could if I had the time.</p><br/><p>... Especially since I might arrive at that wall within these two months.</p><br/><p>The Pacific Ocean was Earth\u2019s largest and deepest ocean. Over 100 Event Dungeons had spawned in the Pacific Ocean. On average, their difficulty ratings were higher than land based Event Dungeons, as it was hard to find dungeons ranked below B.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere weren\u2019t that many underwater dungeons last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Four days after we left Korea, I murmured after clearing the 27th underwater dungeon and popping out of the water. Plene who also peeked out of the water next to me squeezed her wet hair and laughed happily.</p><br/><p>\u201cI love water!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hate it. My wings and tail get wet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree. I hate the ocean.\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice wrapped herself and Lotte in a bubble and was floating in the air. With a single wave of her hand, she summoned several tens of bats outside the bubble and spread them out. They were looking for the next nearest dungeon for us to visit.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, there\u2019s a S+ rank dungeon nearby.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can get stat points. Let\u2019s hurry. Don\u2019t make that face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really hate water. Hero is stupid\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t Dear Husband go alone? No, nevermind. Let\u2019s go. We can\u2019t leave Dear Husband to just this idiot. Ehew.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unlike Plene, who loved the ocean as expected of a siren, the two winged girls really hated the Pacific Ocean. Licorice seemed to hate oceans in general, while Lotte didn\u2019t go well with water due to her being a wyvern and a flame wielder. If she couldn\u2019t transform into a human, she would have refused to go underwater.</p><br/><p>\u201cLotte, is there a water king or an ocean king?\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked Lotte out of curiosity. Now that we were focusing on the ocean, it was a natural question to ask.</p><br/><p>After the first monster outbreak, most sea routes in the Pacific became sealed off. Large sea monsters made nests in the Pacific, and ravaged any ships that crossed their territories. If they at least spoke human language, people might have tried to negotiate with them, but that was clearly not the case with the monsters.</p><br/><p>Countries that relied on ocean based trade were affected greatly, and some even faced economic crisis. Thankfully, the monster invasion also changed many countries\u2019 landscape, bringing along new crops, new minerals, and monster materials. Without these, the population of Earth may be much less than it is now. It was a form of \u2018giving one diseases while giving him medicines.\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course, Korea was one of these heavily affected countries. In many ways, Korea was quite unlucky.</p><br/><p>Additionally, many sea routes in other oceans had been recovered, but only the Pacific Ocean was still completely blocked. The Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean were fine, but only the Pacific Ocean was wrought with reapers that refused to leave. There were even suspicions that a super massive monster was living in the Pacific Ocean.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think you can just attach the word \u2018king\u2019 wherever you want, Hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lotte\u2019s rebuttal stung me slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Lava King was a flame dragon. He was known as an elemental king for his ability to completely reign over fire. Even in my world, there aren\u2019t many capable of doing that. There was one more, but I don\u2019t know much because I lived too far away from that being.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what are the chances that he\u2019s a water king?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow persistent, Hero. There is no such thing as a water king.\u201d</p><br/><p>To be honest, that was good news for me. I had come to the Pacific to clean up the Event Dungeons, but it was also to reopen the land like I did for the Philippines or the Jeolla Province.</p><br/><p>This was something I had only talked to Hwaya about. No one else in Revival knew about it. After all, cleaning up the Event Dungeons in my area was different than completely cleaning up the area. But if I didn\u2019t take back the land and ocean stolen by monsters, humanity would eventually lose their dominance to monsters.</p><br/><p>I had no plans to volunteer myself for the good of humanity, but it would be sad if there were no humans to live on Earth after I defeated the world\u2019s enemy. \u2026 I was feeling embarrassed for nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cEit, let\u2019s hurry! We\u2019re going to finish the Pacific within two weeks and go to Oceania!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been two weeks since we reclaimed the Philippines, and even that took a whole week. Dear Husband wants to clean up this huge Pacific Ocean in just two weeks? Is Dear Husband insane?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m sane. We already made a lot of progress! Come on, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Once we entered an Event Dungeon, even if the dungeon was underwater, the dungeon rarely had anything to do with water. Most had solid ground for us to walk on, and we just had to wipe the monsters in the dungeon.</p><br/><p>As I said before, since I decided to purify the entire Pacific Ocean, I had to get used to underwater combat. More exactly, I had to get used to massacring monsters with my ability while making use Plene\u2019s ability.</p><br/><p>If there was one thing we felt thankful for, it was that Plene\u2019s singing worked even better underwater than it did on land.</p><br/><p>Plene sang more calmly underwater and her voice inexplicably reached even farther underwater than it did on land.</p><br/><p>Once she started singing, monsters within a vast area flocked towards us, and I just needed to widen my eyes and turn them to stone. Since Peika was limited in using her power with allies underwater, Sharana and Ruyue materialized into human forms and went around breaking the stones. If one ignored all the monsters, the scene was rather mystical and beautiful.</p><br/><p>While a beautiful girl sang an enchanting song, two equally beautiful girls freely swam through the water with their hands flashing colorfully!</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ve never seen such a beautiful massacre in my life, including anything I\u2019ve seen in my world!]</p><br/><p>[Hero, haven\u2019t you killed over a hundred million with your eyes now\u2026?]</p><br/><p>If Licorice and Lotte didn\u2019t interrupt me, I could have stayed in this fairytale like trance forever. With nothing better to do, I glared at the two girls.</p><br/><p>[Hundred million? Please.]</p><br/><p>Using my mana, I pulled on the bubbles rising up from my mouth every time I talked. As I played around with them, I continued.</p><br/><p>[It should be well over a billion by now.]</p><br/><p>Eighteen days after I began my work in the Pacific, I was left standing in front of the final Event Dungeon. It was an SSS rank dungeon, located in Mariana Trench\u2019s Challenger Deep, the deepest known point of the world\u2019s oceans. Just based on its location, I should have started off here, but I wanted to leave it for last as it was the highest ranked dungeon.</p><br/><p>[This is the last one. Surprisingly, we cleaned up this huge ocean without problem.]</p><br/><p>[Do SSS+ ranked monsters not faze Hero in the slightest now\u2026?]</p><br/><p>Well, large monsters did appear the closer we got to the center of the Pacific Ocean. I could finally understand why the Pacific Ocean stayed blocked this whole time. However, as I had already fought against countless SSS+ ranked monsters like the Destroyers in the Philippines, these monsters were only slightly bigger and less scarier versions. They really weren\u2019t hard to deal with.</p><br/><p>I was very fortunate to have fought extra massive salmons. There were even some that were pregnant. I suspected that the reason they couldn\u2019t swim upstream was because they were too fat.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s a good thing we have more snacks to go along with wine. Hwaya will be happy. Well\u2026 Should we go in?]</p><br/><p>[The dungeon is one thing, but there might be other monsters outside. Be careful, Hero.]</p><br/><p>[Right. I can feel something other than the dungeon. It\u2019s getting on my nerves.]</p><br/><p>[Mmm, should I sing?]</p><br/><p>While we chatted, we slowly descended into the ocean. I could feel the aura Licorice was talking about, but as it didn\u2019t seem too troubling, I simply continued on, ready to attack whenever.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, my body stopped as if it hit a wall. I muttered annoyed.</p><br/><p>[Damn it.]</p><br/><p>I looked at Lotte who was in Licorice\u2019s air bubble and asked.</p><br/><p>[Lotte, didn\u2019t you say there was no Water King\u2026?]</p><br/><p>[Well, Hero\u2026 We should run!]</p><br/><p>It was too late. In an instant, a large lifeform in the bottom of the Mariana Trench roared!</p><br/><p>[Guooooooooo! You came, Hero!]</p><br/><p>[The \u2018Hermit King\u2019 Grand Raid commences! You met one of the enemies aiming for the world\u2019s power! The dungeon\u2019s power is not fully effective against worlds\u2019 enemies. The Grand Raid system exists to give what little support it can to explorers who are fighting against the worlds\u2019 enemies. The Lord\u2019s blessing converges on your party. As a result, the enemy can only ignore up to 30% of your party members\u2019 skills and levels!]</p><br/><p>[Absolute Soul nullifies a part of the enemy\u2019s power. Your skills and levels will be 90% effective against the enemy!]</p><br/><p>[Remember that you will not be able to bring out your items\u2019 and skills\u2019 full power. We wish you luck! You will receive a huge reward if you defeat the Hermit King!]</p><br/>\n</div>"}

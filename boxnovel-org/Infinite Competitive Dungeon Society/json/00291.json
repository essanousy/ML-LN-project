The Last Member (8)</p><br/><p>I bit my lips and drew Absolute Soul\u2019s power to the peak. Absolute Soul was the most important skill to prevent his fear from invading my consciousness, especially in this place where the dungeon\u2019s power was restricted. Even a single mistake could lead to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have any information on him? Like his weakness?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the Fear King. He\u2019s adept at mental attacks, but his physical body is weak! To make up for it, his army has terrifying physical strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis physical body?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Gungnir and Sleipnir pierced through him seamlessly, Hwaya was most likely right. But since he was moving just fine after being hit by two of Odin\u2019s powers, I could deduce that he had high health even if his defense was low.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you noticed, Shin, but normal attacks can\u2019t hurt him at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNormal attacks?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything other than Evil Eyes or true names\u2019 powers.\u201d</p><br/><p>I widened my eyes. If this was true\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have used Trishula.\u201d</p><br/><p>Would elementals or Lightning God\u2019s power work? No, I doubt it. Hwaya said her flames didn\u2019t work. Of course, there were also ranks among elementals. There was one I had expectations of. Not to mention, I haven\u2019t used Overlord yet for this moment.</p><br/><p>Still, it was a troubling situation. Overlord had a time limit of just 5 minutes, so I had to kill him in that time. Overlord wasn\u2019t a power to initiate battle, but a power to end one.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it, Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Evil Eyes work on him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Hwaya.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, you just support me so I can focus all my attention on him. You can do it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat much is easy\u2026 Will you be okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, you defeated two kings by yourself. If I don\u2019t defeat even one, my Witch title would cry.\u201d</p><br/><p>I wondered where her anxious self from a moment ago went. Now, she was full of energy. The wounds on her body was also disappearing one by one. I didn\u2019t know whether it was her Evil Eyes\u2019 power, or if she had a power I didn\u2019t know about.</p><br/><p>Or maybe, just like how I mastered Peruta Circuit and overcame my limit, she might have just overcome her limit.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne of us has to handle those small fries anyways. It\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Fine. I\u2019ll put them all to sleep and come help you. I have a plan in mind too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Then\u2026 I\u2019m off!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Hwaya immediately disappeared. She didn\u2019t disappear literally. It was just that she moved extremely fast. In just a breath\u2019s time, she was facing the Fear King and shouting gallantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou lump of tar, fight me again!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You were almost finished just a moment ago. Now, you\u2019re surprisingly fine.]</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid. When I knelt back then, it was to help propel myself forward!\u201d</p><br/><p>Flames shot up from Hwaya\u2019s body, burning fiercely like a pillar connecting sky and earth. Good. It seemed Hwaya would be fine. In that case, I could focus on my role \u2013 dealing with the army of fear filling up this world.</p><br/><p>[He is the Hero.]</p><br/><p>[A Hero aiming for a higher peak.]</p><br/><p>[Even he has darkness in his heart. I can see it.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too noisy!\u201d</p><br/><p>I materialized Ruyue and Sharana. I could fly using Talaria, but even if I couldn\u2019t, I learned to stay afloat effortlessly without using any other abilities when I mastered Peruta Circuit. So it was fine even if Sharana was separated from me.</p><br/><p>[Shin, what should I do?]</p><br/><p>[Master, just give your command!]</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, you protect me. Sharana, you support Hwaya! Amplify her flames and protect her from other small fries!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Gladly!]</p><br/><p>[Understood, Master!]</p><br/><p>Sharana immediately flew off to protect Hwaya, and Ruyue spun around me in her beastgirl form. Meanwhile, the Fear King\u2019s minions were endlessly spawning in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, so that\u2019s how it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>These guys were the Fear King\u2019s clones. That\u2019s what my intuition was telling me. Although the Fear King\u2019s real subordinates might be hiding among them, most of them were giving off identital aura to the Fear King. In fact, the entire area we were in was\u2026</p><br/><p>[Scared?]</p><br/><p>[Are you scared of my power?]</p><br/><p>[Despair and fall! This emotion of yours is a delectable glass of wine to us!]</p><br/><p>No matter where I looked, I could only see grotesque devils. Their words were provocative, like they could peer into my mind, and they were frantically trying to crack my mental defense.</p><br/><p>I raised my foot and took a step forward as if I was walking on ground. Ruyue sensibly created a scaffolding out of ice.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut it, small fries. I\u2019ll only listen to ones that can survive my Evil Eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m going to do it, Shin!]</p><br/><p>\u201cGo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ruyue curled her body like a cat, then stretched in a one big motion. In the sky, which carried a smoky smell of sulfur, large translucent mirrors of ice began appearing.</p><br/><p>[A futile attempt.]</p><br/><p>[Mirrors only serve to reflect your ugliness.]</p><br/><p>[Mirrors can\u2019t stop fear.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>I raised my head and gazed at the sky. With a radiant golden light, my Evil Eyes reflected off the countless mirrors.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou lot aren\u2019t reading my mind at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Reflected off the mirrors, the power of petrification spread through the countless mirrors and eventually covered the entire sky. However, looking at the reflection of Evil Eyes didn\u2019t cause petrification. Even in Greek mythology, Perseus had killed Medusa by seeing her through the reflection on his bronze shield.</p><br/><p>But my Evil Eyes were no longer ordinary Evil Eyes, and Ruyue\u2019s ice mirrors weren\u2019t ordinary mirrors.</p><br/><p>I poured a terrifying, a truly terrifying amount of mana into my Evil Eyes, and Ruyue\u2019s mirrors had the ability to preserve most of the Evil Eyes\u2019 power.</p><br/><p>As a result, facing a mirror was no different than facing me straight on, and there was only one path for those affected by my Evil Eyes.</p><br/><p>Seeing rocks hail down from the sky, I smirked.</p><br/><p>[What boundless mana.]</p><br/><p>[He\u2019s not human!]</p><br/><p>[He tricked us! This human is using the dungeon\u2019s power!]</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, scatter more mirrors!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un!]</p><br/><p>This place blocked the dungeon\u2019s power and made it hard for me to receive Sherafina\u2019s help. Compared to when I had the dungeon\u2019s power, I only had 60% of my mana. But if I quantified this amount, it was about 420,000 points, which was only 80,000 less than the maximum amount I had before I defeated the Beast King.</p><br/><p>I was constantly growing. When my mana pool increased, it didn\u2019t stagnate, but accelerated instead. Not to mention, I had yet to turn all of the Beast King\u2019s mana to my own. My growth speed even frightened me sometimes, but I had no intention to stop myself. In fact, this wasn\u2019t enough.</p><br/><p>[Do you think that\u2019s enough to win over fear? You think destroying such meager amount would affect me in any way!? Unfortunate! I am everlasting, always existing within hearts of humans! Do you not understand what it means to be immortal!? Do you not see what\u2019s awaiting you at the end of your futile struggles!?]</p><br/><p>The Fear King\u2019s gradually raised his voice. His body expanded like a sponge that absorbed water, and his minions continued to pop out endlessly. Just like he said, even if Hwaya charred him or I decimated his minions, he didn\u2019t seem to come close to dying.</p><br/><p>But that was what he wanted us to think. Unfortunately for him, Absolute Soul could see through his antics.</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya, he just has high vitality! It\u2019s neither everlasting nor immortal!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya\u2019s flames grew brighter and transformed white. Every time she moved, black smoke exploded from the Fear King\u2019s giant body, and his indiscernible scream deafened my ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to fight like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t just standing around either. Ruyue continued to make more mirrors, as if to compete with the Fear King\u2019s clones, and the power of my Evil Eyes continued to move from mirror to mirror. No matter how many of them assaulted me, it didn\u2019t matter. They couldn\u2019t provoke fear from me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the end, you\u2019re also someone else\u2019s underling, right? Not to mention, you\u2019ll also die without knowing the truth! Three of your friends were already killed by us!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am different from them. I exist, yet I am in a realm you cannot grasp!]</p><br/><p>[The moment you peer into us, we come to live in your hearts!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen are you going to stop lying, you annoying mosquitos!\u201d</p><br/><p>Countless clones turned to stone and rained down. I raised my spear and lightly shattered the rock falling above me.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee, I can destroy you just fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Let\u2019s see how long you\u2019ll last!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long I\u2019ll last? That\u2019s what I want to ask you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sharana blew away the clones flying towards Hwaya. They were then exposed to my Evil Eyes\u2019 power through the mirrors, and they soon fell after being petrified.</p><br/><p>I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, freeze them all onto the ground! I\u2019ll give you 100,000 mana!\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s more than enough!]</p><br/><p>I gave most of my remaining mana to Ruyue and drank a highest-grade mana potion I had on my belt. Unfortunately, mana potions weren\u2019t enough to rejuvenate my boundless mana pool. I had to rely on Peruta Circuit to do most of the hard work!</p><br/><p>I raised my spear enveloped by an enormous whirlpool. The moment Ruyue froze the fallen rocks to the ground, I drew Talaria\u2019s power to the peak, used Divine Speed, and shot down towards the ground. Before I smashed into the ground, I struck my spear down and shouted at the top of my lungs.</p><br/><p>\u201cGaia Buster!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kyaaaaaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>I grinned. This was the first time I made the Fear King scream with my power. As the petrified clones weren\u2019t dead until I thoroughly shattered them, I hadn\u2019t dealt much damage to the Fear King until now.</p><br/><p>But with Ruyue trapping the petrified clones to the ground and me using Gaia Buster, no clone could have survived. Since he lost so many clones at once, it was normal for their main body to scream!</p><br/><p>[You! Herooooooooo!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be keeping you busy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya\u2019s flames engulfed the Fear King\u2019s outstretched arm. Filling up this entire artificial world, Hwaya\u2019s flames danced and created a wave of flames.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think I just forgot about the humiliation I suffered from you? And when was I rejected? I wasn\u2019t! He said he\u2019d accept me!\u201d</p><br/><p>I decided to pretend not to have heard what Hwaya said. Instead, I focused my attention towards the shattered pieces of land and made them shoot up into the sky.</p><br/><p>Countless clones still filled up the sky. The amount of mana he had even overwhelmed the Beast King and the Lava King. Together with his powerful mental attacks, there wouldn\u2019t be many he couldn\u2019t defeat. In fact, if I faced him before I obtained the Beast King\u2019s power, he might have had a chance. If I didn\u2019t have Absolute Soul, I might already be bowing down to him, and if I didn\u2019t arrive in time, Hwaya would be doing the same.</p><br/><p>But it was different now. I became a monster capable of wielding boundless mana consciously and instinctively, and Hwaya had succeeded in taking a step forward. As a result, the Fear King simply stood no chance.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou call this fear? How laughable.\u201d</p><br/><p>I sneered.</p><br/><p>\u201cBreak them all!\u201d</p><br/><p>The heaven and earth seemed to shatter. Countless rocks and ice carrying black lightning energy mixed together and shot across the sky, shattering the fragments of fear.</p><br/><p>[Kyaaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too early to scream. I\u2019m already just getting started.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Gaia Buster tearing apart the Fear King\u2019s clones, I flashed my eyes. The Beast King\u2019s remaining mana was roused awake feeling the movement of mana and attempted to go wild. I didn\u2019t squash it and accepted it. Wild instincts, having beaten off a fair amount of rationality, made me more energetic than before.</p><br/><p>I raised my spear again. Now, I felt like I could do it. Within the next five minutes, I felt like Hwaya and I could kill him!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is what true fear is! Overlord!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

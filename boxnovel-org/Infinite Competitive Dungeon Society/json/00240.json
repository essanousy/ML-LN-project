Guardian (10)</p><br/><p>Even after I waited for a long time, no other voice rang out. The last time I defeated a world\u2019s enemy, the response was much more chaotic. This time, however, made me doubtful that the one we defeated was a real world\u2019s enemy. However, the power in my hand was undoubtedly a world\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>I asked Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin, we defeated a world\u2019s enemy\u2026 Isn\u2019t there anything more?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid. Where do rewards come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s obviously the dun\u2026 Ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason we were here was to allow the dungeon to operate normally. Of course there wouldn\u2019t be any rewards now! At that moment, Sipua\u2019s face shone as she shoved her face towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, if it\u2019s stat or skill points, I can give them to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou shut up, Sipua. Don\u2019t waste any more of you power!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t interrupt me when I\u2019m talking to Master, Lin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSipua shut it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was beginning to understand how the dungeon operated. Once Sipua became quiet, Lin looked at her dumbfoundedly and turned his attention towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if Sipua is weak, turning her into this\u2026 What are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m wondering the same thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Serves her right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy glared at Sipua with disdain as she approached me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Kang Shin. Promise, you already kept.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one who killed the world\u2019s enemy. It was Lin. If you want to thank someone, thank him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDragon Horn, good job.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you thanking him sincerely and treating me like a pet dog!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve been thinking this for a while, but could Daisy really be thinking of Lin as an animal\u2026? Maybe she just liked his horn. It seemed I needed to warn Lin to be wary of his horn being cut off while he\u2019s asleep.</p><br/><p>\u201cFound hope\u2026 Though, before those weaklings grow, it\u2019ll take some time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry. So many people died because of us\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Kang Shin\u2019s fault. No one expected it\u2026 It\u2019s my fault for, believing in a human too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, she seemed to ponder momentarily before she shook her head and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Kang Shin is different. I trust Kang Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have the brains, to trick people\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too harsh! At the very least, I\u2019m not stupid!\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy said she was just joking and laughed lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin likes me, so you don\u2019t try to trick me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u2018like\u2019\u2026 You know that I didn\u2019t mean what I said before, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin hiding his embarrassment, annoying but slightly cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you really want to leave it as a misunderstanding, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>I told myself to lecture her later. For now, there was something else I needed to do. I held the white sphere of light on my palm towards her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to keep my other promise. Daisy, I\u2019m going to make you a Hero. Are you prepared?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the moment 90 years ago, when I was chosen as a Hero candidate, I was ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already knew this, but you\u2019re old, Grandma Dai\u2014 Kahak!\u201d</p><br/><p>I almost absorbed the world\u2019s power accidentally. Daisy waved her foot near my shin as she glared at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a maiden in her prime. Apologize for your rude remark.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>First, I made Daisy into a Hero on the spot. Watching this happen, Lin made a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty skilled at handling that power. Wielding a foreign world\u2019s power so easily and bestowing it to someone safely, it\u2019s almost like I\u2019m watching the Savior Hero\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSavior Hero?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back. We can\u2019t let the dungeon stay like it is any longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Savior Hero, that was one of my titles. Did Lin know something about it? Lin didn\u2019t seem to want to say anything as he turned back silently.</p><br/><p>In the dark and silent underground base, the only ones left were me, Lin, Daisy, Sipua, and the headless corpse of the world\u2019s\u2026 Hey!</p><br/><p>\u201cGood undead material\u2026 Good rival for Laki.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVery, very good material.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, that was your world\u2019s enemy\u2026 Do you really want to make control someone like him?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I asked dumbfoundedly, Daisy looked at me like I was crazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cCorpses\u2026 have no sins. All corpses are good corpses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that like it\u2019s some profound truth!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, the search for Sipua ended and everyone deployed to the Sylon continent returned to the dungeon. Although short, the event remained an unforgettable memory.</p><br/><p>For helping to find Sipua, Revival became an A ranked guild, and Daisy and I both received a top-class accessory each to make up for the reward we missed out in defeating the world\u2019s enemy. The dungeon\u2019s power for defeating the world\u2019s enemy and the power for bringing Sipua back would both be included.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do I have to make them when I worked my ass off too!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s obviously because you didn\u2019t bring Sipua back immediately after you found her! Because you showed mercy to Sipua, do you know how many worlds were placed in danger!? Two of them almost fell!\u201d</p><br/><p>Furthermore, it was the first time I had seen Loretta this angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe moment Sipua left the dungeon, she became our enemy! She was our ally for 2,500 years!? You pitied her!? She trampled on all these years we spent together! Lin, how can you do something so stupid!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No, Noonim\u2026 You see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd that even led you to fight a world\u2019s enemy!? It thankfully worked out well, but what if something happened to Shin-nim!? Tell me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta was so scary that I wanted to run away. However, I couldn\u2019t escape as Loretta was hugging me tightly. Kuk, at the same time her fragrance and touch led me to heaven, my breath\u2026 my breath\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I could, Lin, with my own hands\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cS-Scary! Noonim, your expression is too scary!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time I had seen Lin so frightened! I was wondering what kind of expression Loretta was making\u2026 but I felt like I would regret it, so I quietly stayed trapped in her embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was so worried\u2026 For you too, Lin! How can you be so immature? Didn\u2019t you say you almost died!? What if Loka gets left alone!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, she has a kid now, so she won\u2019t be alo\u2026 Sorry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin kowtowed. However, Loretta didn\u2019t seem satisfied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should know more than anyone else that you should never let your guard down against any world\u2019s enemy! Even I have to be extremely cautious. I told you multiple times to protect Shin-nim, but you fought the world\u2019s enemy together? You came back feeling proud of that? Hm? You want me to praise you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin was actually pretty usefu\u2026 Spare me, Noonim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, I can\u2019t\u2026 breathe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO-Oh. Sorry, Shin-nim. I got a little excited\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t think anyone else would call it \u2018little\u2019, but I closed my mouth. Loretta who had let go of me slightly had embraced me once again from the front.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was so worried\u2026! Thank god you\u2019re safe, thank god\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for making you worry, Loretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou came back alive, so it\u2019s fine. If something happened to Shin-nim\u2026 I might have put myself in a position where I couldn\u2019t blame Sipua anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said that, Loretta\u2019s expression was strange. Almost as if she had discovered something new, her face was pale. Then, she let me go. While I was feeling dizzy, drunk on her fragrance, Loretta put her hand on her forehead and sighed as if to spit out something buried deep inside her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor\u2026 For a long time, we maintained the dungeon like this. For a long time\u2026 Right, for a very long time. Something like this was bound to happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t it have been prevented somehow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShould all the administrative guild masters be put in a coffin? If we\u2019re sealed with the Lord\u2019s power, we won\u2019t have to worry about something like this happening.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, Loretta. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor us, the power of the dungeon within us can\u2019t be detached unless we die. To maintain the dungeon, we had to stay within it. Unable to bear the stress built up from countless years, two masters had even given up their seats to others\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, doesn\u2019t that mean\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey killed themselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stopped breathing. While I was frozen, Loretta continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe weight of the passing time had strangled them. There was simply no stimulant. Things were looking too dangerous, and one by one, we began to receive the positions the Lord\u2019s power used to maintain. That was truly a saving grace. More and more people were beginning to require the dungeon\u2019s power, and no matter how amazing she was, she had her limit. We made contact with the dungeon\u2019s explorers and through them, we found a new life. However, that had its own problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA problem like what happened this time\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I told you something like this happened before, right? The person who first caused trouble was the administrative guild master of Lost Valley. He had fallen in love with an explorer. To save her and her world, he focused too much of the dungeon\u2019s power to her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lost Valley\u2019s guild master, I had already met that person. And she\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cShe became very powerful and succeeded in defeating her world\u2019s enemy. Because of the amount of power given to her, the dungeon had reached a point where it ceased to function. The Lost Valley\u2019s master then attempted to escape to her world to live with her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, wait\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEleine killed him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta continued without pause.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe returned the dungeon\u2019s power to its normal state and became the new guild master of Lost Valley. A power that could protect her world, she believed that other worlds needed it as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor that, she killed her lover\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTheir relationship was more one sided than mutual. Plus, Eleine has a tough spirit, though she may not look like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe looked like a girl who just liked to play around.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not wrong either. Didn\u2019t I tell you? She\u2019s completely into Lin right now, so she\u2019s constantly chasing after him, but in the past, it was much worse. She\u2019s the type of girl who doesn\u2019t fall deep into love. To be honest, Eleine\u2019s personality is the most fit for an administrative guild master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta\u2019s main point was what followed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter that incident, all administrative guild members including the guild masters began to use puppets instead of their real bodies. Although communicating with explorers was nice, everyone realized that they couldn\u2019t be affected by their encounters too much. Only few became exceptions to this rule. For example, Eladel and Maladel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, nothing could stop Sipua from falling in love.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere just couldn\u2019t be a perfect solution\u2026 Just like how I, who had only contacted Shin-nim through a puppet, had fallen in love with Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta sighed once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHarboring feelings for or against explorers isn\u2019t encouraged. With this incident, you can see the ending. Even so, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, Shin-nim, always stay the way you are\u2026 Shining, as you always are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She shook her head and mended her words.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, nevermind. Shin-nim should do what Shin-nim wants to do. I won\u2019t pressure Shin-nim anymore, I won\u2019t\u2026 That\u2019s the way it should be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine if there are other women. I won\u2019t be selfish, so\u2026 If you only look for me, I won\u2019t stray from my path. I won\u2019t become like Sipua. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>I silently embraced Loretta. With that, Loretta, who was talking nonstop as if she was drunk, became quiet. Lin widened his eyes, Daisy covered her face with her hands, and Sipua shouted something before getting silenced by Daisy\u2019s kick.</p><br/><p>With a blank expression, Loretta spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne day\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne day\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, sorry. It\u2019s a secret for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen until Shin-nim is ready to say it, I\u2019ll wait\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That day, I set a seemingly unpredictable impossible goal. That was the only solution. Now that I had come to know, I couldn\u2019t stop. I could only continue running infinitely.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, by the way, Loretta\u2026 There is something I need to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like Loretta too\u2026 I love you.\u201d</p><br/><p>That day, I was almost raped in front of Lin. It was scary.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>I threw several plot points, but the readers will probably only focus on Shin\u2019s confession\u2026 right?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right! Congratulations! (Official) Heroine has been decided! And our protagonist\u2019s thorny future has been decided! What will happen to the other heroines!? Will they be thrown away? Will they!? Will the popularity contest\u2019s result be ignored!? For now, no one knows the answer. Follow me to the end! You won\u2019t be disappointed!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

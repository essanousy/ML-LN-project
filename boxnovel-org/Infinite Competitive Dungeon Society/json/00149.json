What We Can Do (7)</p><br/><p>For the past month, my companions had joined hands to clear all sorts of Event Dungeons. Although those dungeons were below A rank, I didn\u2019t feel that the time was wasted. They had gotten more accustomed to fighting with each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a spirited shout, father thrust his spear forward. A chunk of a cyclops\u2019 leg blew up, making it fall on top of two of its friends. Of course, incapacitating the two of them didn\u2019t do much to help the current situation. Ever since a while ago, piles of cyclopes were coming at us.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust one of them is annoying enough. Where are they all coming from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to our cute leader. They must have realized that they have no chance of winning unless they all joined forces.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya leisurely retorted, reaching her hand out and burning the cyclopes in that direction. Sumire and Shuna were blocking the cyclopes from the front, while Hwaya burned them with long-ranged attacks. As for us close-ranged attackers, we ran around killing incoming cyclopes on our own. One thing for sure, we had too many close-ranged attackers compared to the one long-ranged attacker we had.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, help the right side!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Responding to Sumire\u2019s call, I kicked off the ground, while a whirlpool surged around my spear using Peruta Circuit. The two cyclopes attacking Sumire were sent flying by the spear I thrust out.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlene!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLalala~!\u201d</p><br/><p>When five new cyclopes appeared, Plene began to sing energetically. Every time she sang with a delightful expression, it looked like strength were leaving the cyclopes\u2019 bodies.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, I\u2019m losing strength\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn\u2026 it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The S rankers, who weren\u2019t considered to be in our party, were also affected, but it was fine since they didn\u2019t need to fight. Without caring about them, I continued hunting.</p><br/><p>\u201cLotte!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I know!]</p><br/><p>As I decided to fight with the party members on the ground, Lotte and I were moving separately. Lotte harassed the cyclopes while freely flying in the sky. The black flames she breathed out could heavily injure them, and even cast curses.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaa! A bird with wings keeps blocking us!]</p><br/><p>[That bird is a harmful bird!]</p><br/><p>The cyclopes tried to attack Lotte, but without any long-ranged attacks, it was impossible. As Lotte also knew this, she jumped in and out, drawing as much of their aggro as possible. Meanwhile, we used the openings she created to attack them.</p><br/><p>\u201cEit! Eit! Die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun made cute shouts as she tenaciously focused on the cyclopes weak points. In her hands were one black and one white pair of daggers, the reward she got from the Flame Drake raid. Her shouts and expression didn\u2019t match at all, so I wished she\u2019d stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are we doing with their corpses?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya asked, as she endlessly generated flames to burn the cyclopes. She gave me a small wink. Although we already talked about it, it seemed she said it for the S rankers to hear. I also replied casually.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll sell them. I\u2019m sure many people will want S+ rank monster corpses. Ah, we\u2019ll keep a few as souvenir\u2026 I wonder if they taste any good.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ku, Kuooooooo!]</p><br/><p>[T-The Hero is scary!]</p><br/><p>After hundreds of cyclopes died, the situation changed, as black cyclopes began to appear. These cyclopes were bigger than the normal ones and were holding gigantic clubs in their hands. Since Hwaya\u2019s flames couldn\u2019t easily burn them, it seemed they also had higher resistance to elements.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe boss is going to appear soon, Hwaya!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re tired, fall back to the defense line and rest until the boss comes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya shouted in response to my words and shot out white flames at all sides. It was a powerful attack, which made all of the cyclopes step back. Walker immediately ran to the back. It seemed father was tired from the constant fighting, as he also ran back after Walker.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuk huk, damn it, my attacks are barely effective\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Walker, if you keep it up, you\u2019ll get stronger from the stat bonuses.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t force me into being your sister\u2019s bodyguard, I would have been much stronger right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWalker, you have to seize the opportunity when it arrives!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, you prevented me from doing that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I wanted to talk to him in the guild communication channel, it seemed Walker didn\u2019t want to. It probably didn\u2019t matter, since the S rankers were too focused on what was happening in front of them that they didn\u2019t pay attention to our conversation. I became seriously sorry for Walker. I hoped to reward him soon!</p><br/><p>Chatting with Walker was fun, but it was about time to clean up the battlefield and prepare for the boss. First, I took out a highest-grade Mana Potion and put it in my mouth. I fixed my grip on my spear, bending down and leaping up.</p><br/><p>\u201cShuna, Sumire! Get back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim!?\u201d</p><br/><p>After instantly jumping over 10 meters in the air, I pulled my spear back and activated Peruta Circuit to its limit. A five-colored light then began to gather in my spear.</p><br/><p>[Kyak! One-eyed giants!]</p><br/><p>[Are you teaching them a lesson? Prince-nim, are you teaching them a lesson?]</p><br/><p>[I can ride this! Strangely, I\u2019m fine!]</p><br/><p>[Everyone come, it\u2019s a special spin spin!]</p><br/><p>Countless elementals caused the whirlpool enveloping Gluttony Spear to take a rainbow hue. In the short moment where I stayed in the air, I thrust my spear toward the incoming cyclopes and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn, I wonder when I\u2019m going to fix my habit of shouting.\u2019</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>From the sky to the ground, a violent elemental storm raged. The black cyclopes in the front were quickly swept through, as were the cyclopes behind them. Although not all of them were dead, they were incapacitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya, let\u2019s clean up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya, who was blankly staring at me for a moment, snapped out of her daze and began to quickly kill the cyclopes that managed to survive. She simply threw her white flames into their throat. If there was no response, they were dead. Otherwise, they choked on it and died. It was quite convenient.</p><br/><p>After landing, I drank the Mana Potion I put in my mouth. After Elemental Tempest ended, countless elementals scattered, giving me blessings and blowing me kisses. I couldn\u2019t help but smile. I had heard that I would be able to see the elementals I wasn\u2019t connected to as I grew as an Elementalist. It seemed that was true. Although they were still a bit hazy, I could somewhat recognize them.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yeon Hwawoo-ssi, what ability was that? Wasn\u2019t your ability lightning?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really think I\u2019ll tell you that, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>I responded to the female ranker\u2019s question and gave her a wink. Then, I threw away the empty potion bottle. Although Elemental Tempest took 50% of my mana, if I prepared a potion beforehand and drank it in time, most of my mana would be restored by the time I was done! Since I could reduce the potion\u2019s cooldown time, it was quite smart.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat an enviable ability. Mm\u2026.!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShockwaves are good too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough chattering. Get ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya shouted acutely. Since we would be going up against a S+ rank dungeon boss, it was understandable. Plus, she was likely preparing for the potential Event Raid as well.</p><br/><p>[Shin, I\u2019ll use Blessing again.]</p><br/><p>[Yeah. Thanks, Ludia.]</p><br/><p>\u201cPlene, get ready to sing again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia stuck her staff into the ground and began to chant a holy scripture with a silvery voice. The fatigue that had unknowingly built up disappeared and my body brimmed with strength. It was truly mysterious. Even after her world fell and Ludia moved to Earth, she still maintained the power of the god she believed in. Although I didn\u2019t think too deeply, I thought about the existences called gods once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe boss is probably going to be a cyclops. After Lotte breathes her black flame to decrease its resistance, we\u2019ll each use our strongest attack. The boss fight will start from there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe cyclopes\u2019 boss\u2026 I can\u2019t even imagine what it would be.\u201d</p><br/><p>The party members began to prepare their attacks. Father\u2019s spear was vibrating since a while ago. I suspected that it was the new path of martial arts he created.</p><br/><p>Then, it finally appeared, seemingly out of nowhere. It just suddenly appeared in front of our eyes.</p><br/><p>[Guoooooooo!]</p><br/><p>It was over 10 meters tall, and its red skin and ghastly eyes exuded an oppressive aura. As if just two arms weren\u2019t enough, it had an additional two for a total of four. It held a club in each hand. At the same time, Gluttony Spear began to vibrate. Eh? Wait, could it be\u2026? As a thought crossed my mind, it opened its mouth. Since it probably wasn\u2019t going to breathe flames, it was probably going to shout.</p><br/><p>[Black Curse Breath!]</p><br/><p>What a cool name!</p><br/><p>Before it attempted to fear the entire party, Lotte\u2019s poured black flames on it. The word \u2018pour\u2019 was extremely suitable for her attack. Like tar, her flames stuck to its body, unpleasantly squirming around and burning its body. If she wasn\u2019t on our side, I would have been frightened out of my wits.</p><br/><p>[Guooooook!]</p><br/><p>[It won\u2019t last long. It\u2019ll reduce its attack power, movement speed, and resistance to everything.]</p><br/><p>[Why didn\u2019t you use that against the drake?]</p><br/><p>[I couldn\u2019t back then. I acquired it after being with Hero\u2026 Mm.]</p><br/><p>It seemed like Lotte was embarrassed, but I didn\u2019t have the time to think about that right now. Hwaya was the first one to attack. Her flames were so white that they could be mistaken as light.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u201d</p><br/><p>Was that a universal shout!? Her flames struck the cyclops\u2019 chest, scorching it until its bones could be seen. Even more shocking was the fact that Lotte\u2019s tar was preventing it from regenerating. Father\u2019s spear attack then struck the same place. An explosion boomed and it trembled from the shock, coughing out a large amount of a blood. Father dodged its club swing and fell back, all the while shooting a condensed shockwave aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally! It just sounds lame!\u201d</p><br/><p>We don\u2019t need to all say the same thing!</p><br/><p>\u201cEit, die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026 Spear Charge!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2019m going too! Shield Rush!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other members exploded out with their attacks. The cyclops let out an enraged scream and tried to swing its clubs at them. Lotte\u2019s tar was slowly losing its effectiveness.</p><br/><p>\u201cO power of the earth, stop the sword of the mobs!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Guoook!]</p><br/><p>Ludia\u2019s silvery chant rang out, and the cyclops\u2019 clubs halted in midair. Its wounded chest was wide open.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia shouted. Her staff was radiating incandescence.</p><br/><p>I aimed my spear at its chest. I had long since finished turning it into a white lightning bolt. The chest wound burned by Hwaya and dug by father! I could even see its beating heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cDieeeee!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cE-Embarrassing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Almost as if my spear was being sucked in, it pierced its chest with a huge explosion of aura. The whirlpool of aura devoured its regenerative power and successfully blew up its heart.</p><br/><p>[You defeated the Event Dungeon boss monster, Cyclops Lord!]</p><br/><p>[2,000,000 gold is distributed evenly amongst party members. You received 250,000 gold.]</p><br/><p>[Kang Shin-nim\u2019s contribution is the highest. Choose your reward.]</p><br/><p>[1. Cyclops Lord\u2019s Broadsword</p><br/><p>2. Cyclops Lord\u2019s Rags</p><br/><p>3. Half Elixir</p><br/><p>4. 1,000,000 Gold</p><br/><p>5. Cyprus Dagger</p><br/><p>6. Cyclops Lord\u2019s Golden Eye</p><br/><p>7. Lump of Refined Blue Iron</p><br/><p>8. Deathblood Ring]</p><br/><p>\u201cShin killed it, now\u2019s our chance, everyone atta\u2026 Eh!? It died!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like that, we perfectly cleared the Forest of Rage.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>For the other 3 dungeons in Korea, they won\u2019t take so much of the chapter, and will mostly be skipped over. The important thing is the characters\u2019 accomplishments, not the process of conquering the dungeons\u2026 The dungeon will have to at least be SS rank to be exciting, right? ^^</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Guardian (9)</p><br/><p>Everything had gone terribly. The barely surviving Resistance Army had great losses, and Sipua had turned against the dungeon and tried to kill me, Lin, and the others from the dungeon who had come to take her back. Hydelcyon had destroyed the magic circle maintaining the underground base knowing that it would kill the people who he once tried to protect. He was trash beyond my imagination.</p><br/><p>I had not imagined that things would go this way. That Sipua would join the side of the world\u2019s enemy!</p><br/><p>Of course, it made sense. In exchange for her and Lodert Hydelcyon\u2019s safety, she must have promised the Book Walkers a Hero\u2019s power. She must have used me as a bargaining chip as well as others who would come to this empire.</p><br/><p>Would the Book Walkers have declined? Would they have captured Sipua instead? Of course not! If they used her as bait, appetizing prey would walk in by themselves! They were undoubtedly satisfied with Sipua\u2019s offer. Although no one knew whether their alliance would last after the prey had all been eaten, their current relationship would have been solid.</p><br/><p>However, leaving the dungeon to find her love was different from cooperating with a world\u2019s enemy to protect her love. Even if it made sense to do so, neither me, Daisy, nor Lin thought that Sipua, as an administrative guild master, would have joined hands with the world\u2019s enemy. Even if she resisted us, we thought it would be between us and her. The thought of involving a world\u2019s enemy had been just too absurd!</p><br/><p>We could only think that she might have prepared traps using the Resistance Army or the underground terrain. I felt especially suspicious when Daisy read Hydelcyon\u2019s thoughts.</p><br/><p>Daisy\u2019s report that was completely contrary to his attitude,and the strange sensation when I kicked him made me even more cautious. When I asked Lin out for a drink, it was in order to talk to him about this.</p><br/><p>Of course, Lin may have had a hidden life line that I didn\u2019t know about. But in any case, Lin was someone who had received a share of the dungeon\u2019s power, an administrative guild member who had given himself for the benefit of explorers. For this reason, I thought to prepare myself for when he fell in danger. What I then explained to him was the power of Caduceus, the power of the white snake.</p><br/><p>The white snake\u2019s power was the opposite of the black snake\u2019s. In other words, it had the power of healing. Its effect was simple, yet powerful. As expected, however, tricky conditions had to be met in order to use it.</p><br/><p>[When used within 10 seconds of an ally\u2019s death, you use half of your health to completely revive your ally and boost his ability by 50% for 1 minute.]</p><br/><p>The 10 second period was indescribably cruel. However, as long as I was close enough to witness an ally\u2019s moment of death, I was able to revive him. A power to undo death, it was truly worthy of being called a god\u2019s power. The fact that I earned Hermes\u2019 power was certainly a great fortune.</p><br/><p>One of the main reasons for my grief at the succubi\u2019s deaths in the Philippines was that I couldn\u2019t activate Caduceus as I wasn\u2019t next to them. That said, even if I did, deciding on who to save would have been difficult as well. Not to mention, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to carry out today\u2019s plan.</p><br/><p>The reason Lin never used his sniper rifle was also for the world\u2019s enemy. Though, he never would have thought the world\u2019s enemy would appear with Sipua.</p><br/><p>According to him, the only ones who knew about his sniper rifle was Loretta, Loka, and a few others. In other words, it was the perfect secret weapon. Naturally, compared to his handguns, the sniper rifle had a greater concentration of his power and authority.</p><br/><p>A secret was more powerful the more hidden it was, especially in this continent. Lin concealed his secret weapon perfectly and revealed it in the perfect moment when no one was expecting it. While fighting the world\u2019s enemy, he made his opponent miscalculate his strength and led him to let his guard down.</p><br/><p>However, even if one knew he would be revived, would he be able to include his death in his battle plan? Today was the first time I experienced Lin\u2019s true power. He wasn\u2019t only physically powerful. He was equally as powerful mentally.</p><br/><p>In any case, I revived him just as we planned and immediately activated Overlord to conceal his aura with mine. Lin snorted at my doubt over his stealth ability, but everything had to be perfect. When Daisy reactivated the darkness magic at that timing, the reason I cheered was that I had gotten certain that my plan would succeed.</p><br/><p>From then, I continued to grab the world\u2019s enemy\u2019s attention and restrained him to aid Lin\u2019s sniping. Although I acted as if I was fine, I was secretly trembling at his fierce resistance.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, Lin assassinated the world\u2019s enemy before it was too late. Now, only the two great sinners were left in front of us.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou probably don\u2019t need us to explain what you did wrong, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin, please don\u2019t kill us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuuk\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Despite Lin\u2019s cold tone, Sipua shamelessly beseeched him. Hydelcyon, on the other hand, was writhing in pain next to her, holding his pierced knee.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot kill you? That\u2019s all you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThink back to what I said yesterday. I gave you two the chance to go back to where you belonged. Did I say I\u2019d kill either of you? \u2026 And look at what you did today. This trash sacrificed his allies, who saved him when he was kicked out of the dungeon, to kill Kang Shin and me, and you sold us to the world\u2019s enemy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin fired his gun again. This time, he hit Hydelcyon\u2019s left arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuuaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cL-Lodert! Oh, Lodert, no! Lin, please, shoot me instead! Don\u2019t shoot Lodert!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll shoot you too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin retorted without batting an eye and really shot Sipua\u2019s left arm. Sipua didn\u2019t even groan in response, only glaring at Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cI normally hate bullying others to vent my anger. My style is to kill those who deserve death without dragging it out. But this damned\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t hold his anger back, cutting himself off and aiming his gun at Hydelcyon again. After his gun flashed twice, two holes appeared on Hydelcyon\u2019s right ear and right arm. His shriek filled the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis damned bastard is already marked by someone else. Ah, you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn, just came.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the darkness, Daisy appeared. I could clearly see Hydelcyon\u2019s trembling body. Was it because I was using Overlord? The darkness magic could no longer block my vision.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaisy Ectradion\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c72 alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, how did you get so strong!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were 389. Now, only 72 are alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>As always, Daisy sounded calm. She was calmly boiling with rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cLast pride, as an explorer, you threw away, for your greed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy\u2019s inventory opened. Seeing hundreds of undeads crawling out of it, I felt stifled. They were undead\u2026 humans. This was the first time I had seen Daisy wield human undeads. That said, for someone who could turn monsters into the undead, being able to turn humans into undeads was obvious. Furthermore, those undeads\u2026</p><br/><p>Daisy continued, widening her deep scarlet eyes fiercely.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the ones you\u2019ve killed, die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t kill Lodert!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that trash will certainly die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin rolled his foot lightly. In an instant, a wall of fire shot up around Sipua. The magic she was trying to cast was canceled. The blazing heat made it hard even for me to breathe. Separated from Sipua, Hydelcyon shot back as he screamed crazily.</p><br/><p>\u201cLaughable! You think some zombies will be able to kill me!? Sipua, Sipua! Hey, Sipua! I\u2019m about to die! Sipua!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLodert, oh Lodert! Lin, please! Please save him, I\u2019ll do anything you say!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will? Sorry, I can\u2019t trust you anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin bit down on his cigarette. Almost as if Lin was the one controlling the zombies, one of the zombies bit off Hydelcyon\u2019s right arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaaak! It hurts, it hurts!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Neither Lin nor I batted an eye as we watched on. As for Daisy, after she ordered her zombies to attack Hydelcyon, she was murmuring in an undecipherable tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cI believed you. You were an explorer, so I believed you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHiiik! No, ugaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Hydelcyon\u2019s shrieks got louder, Sipua\u2019s screams also got louder.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! Lin, please! No!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat made you like this? What made you join hands with the world\u2019s enemy who you hated so much!? What made you force me to experience something so dirty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>As more pieces of Hydelcyon\u2019s flesh were bitten off by the zombies, he was getting smaller. His eyes, holding onto a tiny sliver of life, were getting dimmer. Sipua\u2019s screamed in despair, but Lin wasn\u2019t moved in the slightest.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor these countless years, I respected you and treated you as an ally and friend. And you made me a fool! We had gathered for the sole purpose of protecting countless worlds, and you spat on our will!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSave Lodert!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCaduceus\u2019 power has already been used.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied instead of Lin. At that moment, Sipua\u2019s screaming stopped. Hydelcyon had already gone silent a while ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cLodert\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLodert\u2026 Lodert!\u201d</p><br/><p>The wall of fire trapping Sipua disappeared. She shot up and looked around for Hydelcyon. All the zombies gathered in one spot ran back. However, there was nothing there. Not even a single fragment of his armor or a single strand of his hair was left.</p><br/><p>\u201cLod\u2026ert.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDragon Horn, burn them. I want to, let them go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you not to call me Dragon Horn\u2026 Tsk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fire ignited on the zombies, and in a brief moment, the hundreds of zombies all burned away, not even leaving behind ashes. Seeing that we were the only ones left, Sipua plopped down.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 It can\u2019t be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree. No one will believe what happened here, especially what you have done.\u201d</p><br/><p>The worst we had assumed was Sipua laying a trap, not a fight with the world\u2019s enemy. One of the five administrative guild masters of the First Dungeon had not only attracted the world\u2019s enemy, but had also trapped us by making an Event Dungeon. I still couldn\u2019t believe it. When I thought about how Loretta would react when she found out, I couldn\u2019t help but sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cLodert, Lodert\u2026! You killed Lodert, you! There\u2019s\u2026 no longer any meaning to life\u2026 I don\u2019t want to live.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the burden you carried was that heavy\u2026 If you hated it so much that you would have rather thrown it all away, I\u2019ll help you go to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed he had made his decision. Lin held up his gun and aimed it at Sipua.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie, Sipua. From this moment on, I will preserve the dungeon in your place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh?\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at Lin. Then, I spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis punishment would be too light. Just today, hundreds of people lost their lives. Even Lin died once. Even with all this, are you trying to bind yourself to the dungeon for her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m practically bound to the dungeon anyways. Or what, will you take her place? What happened to your will of wanting to rid all worlds of their enemies?\u201d</p><br/><p>I halted. At Lin\u2019s words, I felt a deep sense of regret. I of course didn\u2019t think that I was the first to have held this wish.</p><br/><p>Right\u2026 Lin must have also been threatened by his world\u2019s enemy, and he undoubtedly faced numerous challenges while fighting against them. Then, despite his deep hostility and hatred against them, he chose to become part of the dungeon, throwing away his wishes.</p><br/><p>As such, I replied resolutely.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet her carry the burden herself. She has to pay the price for her sins. The only way to do so would be to bind her to the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re more cruel and vicious than I thought. But how?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe chance of succeeding isn\u2019t high, but I thought I should try it.\u201d</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t much time before Overlord would end. I could hold on until now because I hadn\u2019t used much of my power, but only 10 or so seconds were left. If I wanted to utilize the stat doubling effect of Overlord, I had to hurry.</p><br/><p>It went without saying that charm was one of the stats being amplified. Currently, I was confident that I didn\u2019t lose to anyone in the dungeon in terms of charm. That applied to the Sipua in front of me as well.</p><br/><p>I approached her. Her eyes shot towards me with a deadly glare.</p><br/><p>\u201cHero, Hero! Damn you to hell! I will never go back to the dungeon! You will be torn to shreds by the world\u2019s enemy and your world will fall to ruin! Remember this. It. Will. Come. True!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLilith\u2019s Temptation.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t have the time to listen to her meaningless babble. There was only a 20% chance of it succeeding. If I failed, Lin would have to become the new administrative guild master.</p><br/><p>However, my worry was for naught. Almost as if it was the most natural result, the power that left my body dominated her.</p><br/><p>[You used Lilith\u2019s Temptation! You stole 50% of the target\u2019s health and magic!\u201d</p><br/><p>[The target falls under \u2018absolute obedience\u2019, forever becoming your servant.]</p><br/><p>The moment the messages rang out, I saw a bone-chilling scene. Sipua, who had been cursing me out just a moment ago, changed her expression completely. Almost as if she had gained an incredible enlightenment, she looked around and examined her body. Then, she located me in the darkness and spoke as she kowtowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, aaaah\u2026 My master\u2026 P-Please forgive my impudence! Please don\u2019t look at me like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin\u2026 You\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn\u2026 This is why I didn\u2019t want to use it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone who had thrown away everything, including herself, for her love had discarded her love as if it was an old pair of shoes. Could the person in front of me be considered Sipua? If someone asked me this question, I could only shake my head.</p><br/><p>In a different way than Lin had intended, I had killed her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026 truly a punishment. Kang Shin, you scary bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t use this skill ever again. Damn it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>My gamble succeeded. From now on, she would continue to protect the dungeon as an administrative guild master along with losing the love of her life and obtaining a new love that would never be reciprocated. That was the greatest punishment I could give her.</p><br/><p>The moment I put her under my command, a fanfare rang out. Ironically, the voice belonged to Sipua\u2019s.</p><br/><p>[Event Dungeon clear! You obtained 10 stat points and 3 skill points!]</p><br/>\n</div>"}

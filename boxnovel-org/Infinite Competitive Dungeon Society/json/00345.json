Demon Lord (8)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>\u201cThe power you\u2019re using isn\u2019t something you came up with by analyzing the dungeon\u2019s power.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because of the size of the Demon Lord\u2019s body, I didn\u2019t know where to aim my spear. For now, I aimed at his gigantic neck and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just the dungeon\u2019s power.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026]</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord didn\u2019t say anything. Or perhaps I couldn\u2019t hear him.</p><br/><p>However, the dungeon was steadily creeping towards us to claim our lives. The earth shot up and the air froze. The river of blood I got rid of before reappeared. The fragments of the moon I destroyed with Shiva\u2019s and Zeus\u2019 power were falling as countless meteorites.</p><br/><p>[Do you expect me to believe you? That I am being controlled by her?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see a reason you shouldn\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[She controlled me and put the dungeon\u2019s power into me without my knowledge?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><br/><p>[To claim you through me?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that. Could be, or\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I thought back to the first time I became a dungeon explorer. At the time, I was just an ordinary yet not so ordinary boy.</p><br/><p>I climbed the dungeon and grew stronger through Sherafina\u2019s help. And within a year, I was able to meet with her face to face.</p><br/><p>She was powerful beyond my imagination. She also favored me greatly. If she ever wanted something from me, she could have taken it whenever she wanted.</p><br/><p>If the person the Demon Lord was talking about was indeed Sherafina, things just didn\u2019t add up. I couldn\u2019t understand why she needed to take such a roundabout way.</p><br/><p>Except, if what she wanted couldn\u2019t be obtained from my weak self and could have been obtained only when I had gotten strong to this point, then things made sense.</p><br/><p>I also had a guess as to what that was. An ability that no one else has. Not the ability to wield elementals, not Absolute Soul nor Peruta Circuit, but an ability that belonged only to me. An ability that I honed throughout all these years.</p><br/><p>An ability that I had yet to see the end of.</p><br/><p>If my thought was correct, even the Demon Lord could be a sacrifice for my growth. Of course, it was unlikely that the Demon Lord would believe me even if I told him.</p><br/><p>Putting these thoughts together, I asked the Demon Lord lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026. Haha, hahahahaha!]</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the Demon Lord burst into laughter. Because of how big he was, his laugh resonated through the entire dungeon and even injured our ears. Parts of the dungeon flying towards us suddenly halted in midair.</p><br/><p>[Good, now I understand. I\u2019ll acknowledge that I was played by her!]</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord raised his hand, where crimson mana began to gather.</p><br/><p>[But both you and she are too arrogant! You shouldn\u2019t have told me about this!]</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord shrunk slightly. On the other hand, the mana gathering on his palm became larger. I was very familiar with this mana. It was none other than the dungeon\u2019s, Sherafina\u2019s mana!</p><br/><p>[Now I know. I believed it to be mine, but it really wasn\u2019t!]</p><br/><p>His voice was getting smaller, but the power I was feeling from it was increasing.</p><br/><p>Eventually, the energy on his palm shone with a brilliant light and tried to envelop him, but the Demon Lord released a black demonic energy with his body and cast the light aside.</p><br/><p>[No one can control me!]</p><br/><p>This crazy guy!</p><br/><p>Immediately afterward, the dungeon shattered.</p><br/><p>We came back out to Earth. Beneath the still dark sky and blood red clouds, screams of despair rang out. A countless number of massive monsters were running amok. As I expected, the monster continent had started their final attack!</p><br/><p>[I am the king of all things demonic, reigning supreme over all things evil! None may err me and none may stand above me!]</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord spread his arms open. The ground was full of death energy, and he was clearly trying to absorb them! I quickly opened up an extradimensional space and sent a flurry of metallic fragments towards him.</p><br/><p>At the same time, I tried to absorb the death energy before he could, but it was almost as if he got stronger by casting aside the dungeon\u2019s power, as he began to absorb all negative energy on Earth.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just death energy. He was using a power I hadn\u2019t experienced before. Demon Lord, this title surely didn\u2019t come from simply being the leader of the demon race.</p><br/><p>[As such, I will obtain you and rule over all worlds!]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time you stop dreaming!\u201d</p><br/><p>His body had shrunken to about half its original size. Seeing the mana in his hand being compressed, I clicked my tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think just some words affected him this much. He\u2019s more talented than I thought.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were too careless, Son.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>I shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? I was purposely stalling for time to come up with a way to take the dungeon\u2019s power out of him. I troubled Father, Sumire, and Ye-Eun because of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You mean you made him do this on purpose?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, are you saying you controlled the Demon Lord? You finally entered the realm of gods!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing amazing, so don\u2019t be so exaggerating.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Father and Sumire couldn\u2019t close their mouths in shock, Ye-Eun, who was ready to restrain the Demon Lord with her golden chains if given the chance, turned her head slightly and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you click your tongue, Shin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, if you see a talented person, a demon, in this case, you naturally get jealous. That\u2019s why I clicked my tongue. The situation itself is very favorable for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said that and raised my spear. The Demon Lord\u2019s killing intent also became focused on me. It didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out he wanted to kill me and take my power.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, the dungeon is now our enemy. So what good would it be to stay in that dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying you provoked him to destroy the Event Dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s another reason too.\u201d</p><br/><p>While the Demon Lord brought Earth\u2019s demonic energy together to a single point, his right arm was cut off. The severed arm bloated up for a moment before losing all its power and disappearing. In the nearby airspace, \u2018he\u2019 appeared.</p><br/><p>Kain.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, with this much power, he should be one of the strongest among worlds\u2019 enemies.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaaaaaa!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cGive up on that arm. I won\u2019t be able to use any divine power in exchange for that attack, so it\u2019ll be hard to recover your arm.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a truly lighthearted tone, Kain twirled a spear that was beginning to lose its light. Riding Odin\u2019s famous steed, Sleipnir, he prepared himself to charge forward at any time.</p><br/><p>[Ku, kukukukuku! How painful!]</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord screamed in pain at first, but soon he broke out into laughter. Rather than blood, black demonic energy shot out of his wounds. Putting his uninjured left hand on the wounded area, he continued to laugh.</p><br/><p>[Right, this is it! This pain and hostility from many! This is what I felt when I conquered the Luka continent! Aah, how foolish was I, relying on a power that wasn\u2019t my own!? After conquering the Luka continent, I believed I had gotten stronger, but no! I had just blinded myself with a power I couldn\u2019t control!]</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what, you\u2019re going to give up on taking my power?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Of course not, Hero. You should know the answer to the question. Your power is different than the dungeon\u2019s mishmash power! It is an authority! Eternity is granted to those who strive for power! Come! I will step over everything, including that arrogant fool above the Tower of Babel!]</p><br/><p>Without even a single warning, demonic energy detonated around the Demon Lord. It was powerful enough to critically wound even me! As I now continually maintained Divine Speed inBattle, I could thankfully react quickly.</p><br/><p>To be exact, I controlled the metallic fragments I previously took out from my extradimensional space and blocked the explosion of demonic energy. The metallic fragments flooded forward, enveloping the demonic energy and obliterating them.</p><br/><p>However, the Demon Lord\u2019s attack didn\u2019t diminish.</p><br/><p>[Is that all!? Show me that power once more! The power that will become mine!]</p><br/><p>Spears of demonic energy began to hurl towards everyone. In addition, magic spells that made me recall my fight with the dragon filled the air.</p><br/><p>The only difference was that the Demon Lord\u2019s magic belonged to demons. As they were different from the magic of dragons, I couldn\u2019t analyze them at all. Seeing small wounds beginning to appear on my companions, I asked worriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSumire, can you block them!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Shin-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhuhu, it just got more exciting!\u201d</p><br/><p>While Sumire replied nervously, Ye-Eun\u2019s battle hunger seemed to be triggered. In an instant, the golden aura she had transformed into a bluish black aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlay with me! Use more of that magic!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuk, I\u2019m not interested in you!]</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun charged at the Demon Lord and began to push him back with the weapons on her aura arms. However, she was exerting much more energy than before. Even if she could injure the Demon Lord, I couldn\u2019t leave her be.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeon!\u201d</p><br/><p>My voice rang out, spreading across the sky. The reply came just as quickly.</p><br/><p>[The preparations are done, friend.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThen start!\u201d</p><br/><p>In that instant, a deafening sound capable of burying the numerous explosions of demonic energy resounded. Thousands of fighter jets shot up into the air. It was truly a sight to behold. I could imagine how difficult it was to protect all these fighter planes with so many monsters running amok.</p><br/><p>[Mm!? Scraps of metal that can fly!? Is this Earth\u2019s power!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cNormally, it wouldn\u2019t be effective against you.\u201d</p><br/><p>But Leon was controlling them.</p><br/><p>Leon, and nobody else.</p><br/><p>[I can\u2019t do any elaborate maneuvers! I can\u2019t even have them all at full power!]</p><br/><p>It was as he said. No matter how amazing his mana control has become, it was impossible to control several thousand fighter jets to attack a single target. It was already surprising that he could pull up thousands of fighter jets carrying explosives.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, this is good enough. It\u2019s dangerous, so stay back and send Licorice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m already here, Dear Husband.\u201d</p><br/><p>As though she learned teleportation or blink, Licorice appeared behind me before I noticed.</p><br/><p>After evolving into an empress, Licorice looked more beautiful than ever. She could easily claim the title for the most beautiful woman in the myriad worlds. The two horns growing from the forehead were like accessories that adorned her beauty.</p><br/><p>For the first time, the Demon Lord examined Licorice\u2019s body and my body closely.</p><br/><p>[Hero\u2026 Did you become a mare!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI stopped trying to distinguish that long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied with a snort. The Demon Lord\u2019s follow up was rather surprising.</p><br/><p>[It does not matter. To think I\u2019d meet another woman that is to my taste. When the Hero dies, his power will become mine. Beautiful mare, come to me. I am the king of all things demonic, king of all things evil! I will become the sovereign of all!]</p><br/><p>Licorice made a dumbfounded face and whispered to me in a daze.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, is he crazy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you realize it when you saw him?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, one of the fighter jets suddenly exploded. It was the Demon Lord\u2019s doing.</p><br/><p>[Hero, why haven\u2019t you made your move? Are you afraid of me? Or did you really plan on these scrap metals to be your trump card?]</p><br/><p>His demonic energy began to spread out in tentacles. At the same time, Licorice leaned against my back with a soft smile, and the boundless mana in her body began to flood into me.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just her mana. She served as a medium to transfer the mana of all surviving succubi.</p><br/><p>Using their mana, I activated my power. The power of the Eliminator that I perfectly molded into my power. The power to reinforce and control all weapons.</p><br/><p>Thousands of fighter jets charged towards the Demon Lord, each carrying my mana and using Divine Speed.</p><br/><p>An enormous explosion erupted.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

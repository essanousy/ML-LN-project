Double Crisis (3)</p><br/><p>Because it\u2019s been so long since I entered the dungeon, I\u2019ve almost forgotten what monsters appeared in the 50th floor range. Regardless, I met the giant humanoid monsters of the 54th floor head on and broke through in just one hour.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time I had broken through a dungeon floor in one hour. When I reached the Floor Shop and saw that Loretta wasn\u2019t back, I realized just how quickly I had broken through the 54th floor. Flustered, I looked back.</p><br/><p>[Huhu, this is my power, Master!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Peika is really amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s a good thing my seal was released!]</p><br/><p>It seemed like the biggest reason was that I charged through the floor by riding on a materialized Peika. When I materialized Peika, I didn\u2019t have the spare power to summon Ruyue or Sharana. I simply drank Mana Potions whenever they were off cooldown and scorched monsters in our way with chaos flame. It was fine to use Peika\u2019s ability from time to time, but I was still lacking in mana to ride her and rush forward for dozens of minutes.</p><br/><p>This method would not work in Beyond. Just five stacks of Orc Lords\u2019 Warcries would turn our quick charge into a shortcut to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cRegardless, I need to clear the First Dungeon as quickly as possible. After all, Beyond inadvertently takes up more time.\u201d</p><br/><p>I first dematerialized Peika and circulated Peruta Circuit to restore mana and relieve fatigue. Now, climbing the First Dungeon wasn\u2019t so difficult. If it was, I would be troubled. I only had 2 years left. The less time I spent in the First Dungeon, the better. I needed to focus my time on conquering Beyond.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go once I\u2019m fully revitalized! My goal is to break through in 4 days!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Master can do it if Master is with me! Master doesn\u2019t need the others!]</p><br/><p>I smiled at Peika\u2019s declaration and patted her head. \u2018Sorry Peika, but I\u2019m going to need Ruyue and Sharana\u2019s power too for Beyond.\u2019</p><br/><p>On Beyond\u2019s 4th floor, both Orc Lords and Wraith Queens were waiting for me. I already knew how fierce Orc Lords were, but the Wraith Queens\u2019 mental attacks couldn\u2019t really affect me. Since the only physical attack they could do was shooting ectoplasms arrows, I felt that I could just ignore them. Of course, things didn\u2019t go as I expected.</p><br/><p>The Orc Lords\u2019 warcries affected all allies. In other words, the Wraith Queens were also strengthened. Their mental attacks weren\u2019t strengthened by much, but their ectoplasm arrows were extremely scary. Just a single one of them could break through my armor and shake my soul. If that wasn\u2019t enough, they were shooting hundreds of them at once, which bounced around and got strengthened further. It was like I was in hell.</p><br/><p>[Human! A human with a shining soul!]</p><br/><p>[Kuoooooo! Eat him!]</p><br/><p>[Handsome men are all enemies!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastards\u2026 including personal enmities\u2026! Have a taste of my crossbow bolt!\u201d</p><br/><p>My Spear Technique couldn\u2019t do much on Beyond 4th floor. Since the Wraith Queens shot hundreds of ectoplasm arrows at me whenever they saw me, I didn\u2019t have the chance to run into them and create whirlpools or whatnot. What I relied on was the Epic-grade crossbow, Perfect Hunter.</p><br/><p>[Perfect Hunter (Epic)</p><br/><p>Durability \u2013 351/360</p><br/><p>Attack \u2013 3,750</p><br/><p>Equipment Requirement \u2013 Strength, Dexterity, Magic +150. Mid-rank Crossbow Marksmanship</p><br/><p>Option \u2013 Strength +15, Dexterity +15, Magic +15. Adds wind attribute to bolt-based attacks. Attack speed +20%. Automatic reloading. Uses 10 mana to create mana bolts when the user is out of bolts.</p><br/><p>Skill \u2013 Invisible Shooter: Makes the bolts invisible and removes sound and presence from bolts. Adds 30% bonus to speed and attack power.]</p><br/><p>Thankfully, Perfect Hunter already had a wind attribute bonus. When Sharana was infused into it, the wind attribute was strengthened even more, maximizing the speed and piercing power of the bolts. In addition, one couldn\u2019t see the bolts Perfect Hunter shot out. As a result, it was hard to dodge them and many only recognized the bolts once they were hit.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaaaaang!]</p><br/><p>[Cowardly human!]</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaa! Kill that human!]</p><br/><p>No matter how much they struggled and tried to kill me, they couldn\u2019t catch up to me in speed. The only thing they could do was to use Warcries and shoot out the strengthened ectoplasm arrows. But since ectoplasm arrows exploded upon contact, it was possible to shoot them down. I left Ruyue to this task. The countless ice crystals Ruyue created was perfect for blocking the ectoplasm arrows.</p><br/><p>[Elemental! Kill the elemental!]</p><br/><p>[Girls prettier than me should all die!]</p><br/><p>[Kill all the girls hanging around guys!]</p><br/><p>\u2026 And the important thing was to purposefully let a few ectoplasm arrows go through.</p><br/><p>After I dodged them with acrobatic maneuvers, they would bounce around the walls and kill Wraith Queens or Orc Lords. It was similar to how I was dealing with them before.</p><br/><p>[Kyaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>[My soul is being purified\u2026!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you being purified by your own arrows\u2026 You\u2019re going to put exorcists out of business. Haat!\u201d</p><br/><p>I busily maneuvered around, dodging their attacks and shooting out bolts. With my stats increased over the last month, I felt much lighter. It was why clearing the 4th floor was quicker than the 2nd floor. If I could control the ectoplasm arrows with Ruyue, the 4th floor was a piece of cake. That said, I couldn\u2019t continue this hit-and-run tactic forever. As I had to continue onward to find the pathway, it was possible that I had reached a dead-end.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaang!]</p><br/><p>As expected, when I found myself in a dead-end, the Orc Lords shouted and charged at me, as if they were waiting for this moment. The Wraith Queens also shot out a countless number of ectoplasm arrows as they flew toward me. I ordered Ruyue to create a whirlpool of ice and used it to strike away the ectoplasm arrows. Then, I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Thunder Ground!]</p><br/><p>A black dragon appeared in the air. A thick bolt of lightning flashed through the crowd of monsters. When the powerful lightning joined the ice crystals, it became stronger and spread out in all directions. The monsters all screamed in unison.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>\u201cNext up..!\u201d</p><br/><p>I hung the crossbow on my waist and took out the Chaotic Spear from my back. Because the monsters were super-armored, they continued to run at me even as they screamed in pain. If I didn\u2019t kill them now, I would be trampled to death by them.</p><br/><p>\u201cElemental Tempest!\u201d</p><br/><p>Elementals gathered in my spear while chatting noisily. Peruta Circuit spun vehemently and covered my entire body in a whirlpool. I tamed the whirlpool of mana that seemed to want to explode and trapped it at the tip of my spear. As more elementals gathered, the spear shone with more and more brilliant light.</p><br/><p>[Die, humaaaaaaaan!]</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but I can\u2019t die even once\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment they arrived in front of me, I released the storm of elementals. Almost as if I shot a cannon, a giant back blast pushed me backward and made me hit the wall behind me. I groaned and checked my surroundings. If any of them were alive, I had to get them before they got me.</p><br/><p>However, after the storm passed, the pathway was still. Just like always, the monsters all disappeared without leaving a trace. Although they would respawn soon, there were currently no monsters within my detection range.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Good.\u201d</p><br/><p>After confirming that no monsters survived, I put my spear away on my back. Then, with a deep sigh, I took out and drank a new Mana Potion. The highest-grade Mana Potion was delicious no matter how many times I drank it!</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, I\u2019ll call you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>[But I want to stay with Master.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry. It\u2019s okay during battle, but it\u2019s hard to keep three elementals out at all times.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Pii.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>I sent Peika back and quickly moved on. When I wasn\u2019t in battle, I infused Sharana into my body instead of the crossbow, so I could maximize my movement speed. If I used more mana, I could even fly. Talaria\u2019s usefulness had somewhat disappeared. Though, if I summoned Talaria, my speed would increase even more!</p><br/><p>[It looks like Master is very used to flying. Most elementalists have trouble when they fly for the first time.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI have something called Talaria. It lets me fly for a fixed period of time every day. I was using it when I was fighting Pesina, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Wow! Now that you mention it, you really were flying back then! You really are special, like having three elementals isn\u2019t enough\u2026]</p><br/><p>While listening to Sharana and flying through the pathway, I shot a bolt toward the ground. The bolt then bounced around from the ground to the ceiling multiple times like a bouncy ball, then struck a corner of the wall with a mountain-crumbling force. Immediately afterward, a boom rang out along with a scream.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. This zone is taken care of.\u201d</p><br/><p>Using Mana Detection, I had detonated a trap I discovered and even killed an Orc Lord that was waiting around the corner. It was truly a satisfying feeling.</p><br/><p>[Kiaaaaaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>The Wraith Queens that were outside of the trap\u2019s range came out and began to shoot ectoplasm arrows. However, if they weren\u2019t strengthened by Warcries, I didn\u2019t even need to dodge them.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, shield!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Crystal Guard!]</p><br/><p>I took out my spear and charged at the crowd of Wraith Queens. At the same time, Ruyue\u2019s ice crystals enveloped me like a cloud. I circulated Peruta Circuit and activated Mad Typhoon. The whirlpool of mana mixed with the ice crystals disintegrated all ectoplasms arrows it touched.</p><br/><p>[Kyaaaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>[Kill that human!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaaaaaap! Blade Rush!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before I reached them, I activated Blade Rush. Blades then immediately protruded out from my mouth. I bumped into a Wraith Queen, tearing her to shreds. Then, the blades shout out and tore apart the rest of them. Chaos flames swept over those that survived.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[Kyaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu, how long do I have to listen to your screams?\u201d</p><br/><p>I muttered and erased all traces of the Wraith Queens. The moment the monsters disappeared, complete silence once again arrived. I had gotten used to it by now. In Beyond, it suddenly became loud, then suddenly became silent. It was truly a capricious space.</p><br/><p>However, even though everything was proceeding smoothly, I couldn\u2019t be happy. Two days had passed since I entered Beyond\u2019s 4th floor. I was confident that I was advancing quickly, but I still hadn\u2019t seen a straight pathway. Though, I knew I was rushing things compared to my last Beyond explorations.</p><br/><p>It seemed Ruyue had seen through my impatience, as she cheered me up.</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t worry! Shin is very strong!]</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what being strong had to do with it, but I knew she was trying to console me. I patted Ruyue, who materialized on her own accord and hugged me. Sharana, who was infused in my body, also added.</p><br/><p>[Even if Master doesn\u2019t hurry, Master is already very fast!]</p><br/><p>Her words were much more meaningful than Ruyue\u2019s. I made a bitter smile and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. If I rush too much and die, it would be a true disaster. Thanks. Let\u2019s keep going at this pace.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two year time limit was extremely stifling. I could no longer climb the dungeon solely based on my desire to improve myself. The fact that I had to save my friends and family continued to push me.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, it was acting as a poison. When the spear held up to protect freedom was weighed down by responsibility, it would lose its sharpness and swiftness. That would be truly foolish.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright\u2026 Snap out of it and go!\u201d</p><br/><p>I slapped my cheeks with spirit and flew up again. I even summoned Talaria. I wanted to push away some of this stifling feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un!]</p><br/><p>[Yes, Master!]</p><br/><p>20 minutes after that, the straight pathway opened, and I broke through the corridor filled with Orc Lords and Wraith Queen using Crimson Roar and Elemental Tempest. I had broken through Beyond\u2019s 4th floor in two days. It was a pleasant surprise.</p><br/><p>Damn, I should\u2019ve waited a bit more! I wasted Talaria!</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Quickly, quickly, quickly!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

You Cannot Escape from the Saintess (2)</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ve faced countless challengers, and only a handful are allowed to pass through. Most tried to defeat me in groups, and less than 10% were brave enough to challenge me alone. Among them, those who eventually defeated me with their powers alone could be counted on my fingers. Of course, none managed to break my sword in our first fight.]</p><br/><p>He pointed towards me with his black greatsword and spoke with a deep voice.</p><br/><p>[I wonder which type you are.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite cooperative to the dungeon, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>I held my spear up and asked. The Death Knight then laughed in a dreary voice.</p><br/><p>[Cooperative? Young warrior, let\u2019s say I rebel against the dungeon. Is there anything I can do?]</p><br/><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>[No. There is no future for those who have become undead. There is no path to walk, no stairs to climb, what am I to do against someone I can\u2019t reach with my sword!? The only thing I can do is enjoy battle and sink dreaming warriors into despair! Come before I lose interest. You will become one of the countless fools who despair in the face of my sword!]</p><br/><p>All Floor Masters were powerful. No matter how high one\u2019s stats were or how many skills one had, it was hard to ignore a Floor Master\u2019s move. The Death Knight was in a different league than even them.</p><br/><p>[If you are not careful, you will die in an instant.]</p><br/><p>Black aura rose ominously from the greatsword the Death Knight held up. Just like chaos flames, it seemed to be a different power and not pure aura. To face it, I also ignited my chaos flames.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ha!]</p><br/><p>Shooting forth like lightning, I thrust my spear to pierce straight through the Death Knight\u2019s helmet. However, the Death Knight\u2019s greatsword received my spear just before. My stats had unknowingly even surpassed Floor Masters\u2019 stats, but this wasn\u2019t the case against the Death Knight. My spear was being pushed back little by little. However, the Death Knight seemed to be the one who was more surprised.</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re strong. Abnormally strong.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you\u2026 making fun of me!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I pulled my spear back, used Divine Speed, and stabbed his great sword consecutively. It seemed even he couldn\u2019t follow Divine Speed, as he faltered back. Continuing with this momentum, I continued to attack him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hmph!]</p><br/><p>The Death Knight, who was continually pushed back, suddenly changed his stance and struck down with his greatsword. He was aiming precisely for the tip of my spear. In other words, he had read my spear\u2019s movements. However, I didn\u2019t stop and continued. When his great sword and my spear clashed, he opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>[Breath of Death!]</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Freeze!]</p><br/><p>The black mist coming out of his mouth froze in the air. At the same time, I kicked him away.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s dirty, you son of a bitch!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuk!]</p><br/><p>The Death Knight soon regained his posture and swung his greatsword, shooting out an aura wave. I stopped charging towards him and jumped back, borrowing Ruyue\u2019s power once more. The Death Knight\u2019s aura struck the ice barrier Ruyue created and dyed the ice black. As the ice barrier melted, the black water let out a horrid stench. Seeing it, I nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>Anything touched by that aura rotted. Seeing how Ruyue hid behind my back frightened, it seemed it could even damage spiritual bodies. It was truly a deadly breath.</p><br/><p>[You shouldn\u2019t have time to dawdle!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHa!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was quick and powerful. His techniques were in the realm of experts, so fighting him was harder than fighting enemies who only had large bodies. Perhaps, those with a shallow understanding of martial arts might think that the Death Knight is an easier opponent than the Dragon Zombie. After all, people who couldn\u2019t understand the depth of the Death Knight\u2019s techniques would be more fearful of an opponent possessing larger and tougher bodies and bountiful mana! Only someone like me, who had the ability to exchange attacks with the Death Knight, would understand the Death Knight\u2019s real capabilities.</p><br/><p>Just like he did before, I swung my spear in a wide arc and shot a horizontal wave of chaos flames. Just like how I was wary of his aura, he was also wary of mine. He immediately jumped up and easily dodged my attack. Then, with the addition of his falling weight, he flew towards me swinging his great sword.</p><br/><p>[Is this it!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like what he did before, I also stabbed my spear precisely where his sword blade was. As the Death Knight\u2019s eyes slightly widened, chaos flames danced and scorched his aura, climbing up to his arm. The Death Knight immediately noticed what was happening. His eyes glowed ominously, and a chilling aura shot out from his body.</p><br/><p>[Arrogant!]</p><br/><p>\u201cShow me everything you\u2019ve got! Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve got nothing left!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if I didn\u2019t plan on grinding elixirs, I still needed to obtain his equipment. Floor Master skills were still valuable. Overlord, which was one of my most important powers, was a result of synthesizing skills. Who said another skill like it couldn\u2019t come out?</p><br/><p>In that case, I needed to defeat him ten times a day for just one day, or two days at most. If I discovered all of his attack patterns in our first fight, I would have an easier time afterward. I didn\u2019t know what the Death Knight felt from my words, but he released thick aura from his entire body and spoke in a displeased tone.</p><br/><p>[You underestimate me\u2026!]</p><br/><p>The aura emanating from his body shot up as if it exploded. Sticky black aura rose up from his great sword and blazed like chaos flames. Without me saying anything, Ruyue shrieked and shot out ice spears, and the Death Knight blocked them without even moving. The aura staying in his sword rose and split automatically and devoured all ice spears coming his way. In an instant, all ice spears melted and became absorbed into his aura.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll show you the power of curse I gained in exchange for becoming an undead!]</p><br/><p>\u201cCurse, you say.\u201d</p><br/><p>I circulated Peruta Circuit strongly. A platinum aura swirled above Pure Black Desire, and a whirlpool containing chaos flames separately swirled above my spear. In response, the few streaks of aura dancing on the Death Knight\u2019s greatsword halted momentarily.</p><br/><p>My Peruta Circuit was still level 9. How would it be when I mastered it? Hundreds and thousands of times a day, I was tempted to put in my skill points to master it. However, I instinctively knew that the result wouldn\u2019t be pretty if I didn\u2019t master it with my own power, so I barely held on. Peruta had also given me a similar advice.</p><br/><p>Next, I infused Sharana into my body and strengthened the whirlpools as I charged towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me that power!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You\u2026 A Hero, you\u2019re a Hero!]</p><br/><p>When he saw the platinum aura around my body, the Death Knight\u2019s glowing eyes became a level fiercer.</p><br/><p>[Death Cross!]</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine Speed!\u201d</p><br/><p>A cross-shaped aura brimming with curse swept towards me. I immediately concluded that Ruyue\u2019s barrier wasn\u2019t enough to block it, and using Divine Speed, I jumped into the air. However, his aura was also flying towards me there.</p><br/><p>[Is that it!?]</p><br/><p>Without answering him, I utilized the duration of Divine Speed to dodge his attack. Then, I shot the aura in my spear towards him like a bullet. It seemed he didn\u2019t expect me to dodge his aura, as he let his guard down and was struck by my aura. The Death Knight\u2019s helmet partially broke, and his rotting head appeared through the cracks.</p><br/><p>[You moved in the air!? Are you a magician!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m an Elementalist, you idiot!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuk, I\u2019ll dye your elementals in curses, too!]</p><br/><p>\u201cTry it if you can!\u201d</p><br/><p>With chaos flames burning his helmet, he looked even more ominous. Even so, since he wasn\u2019t a dullahan, he shouldn\u2019t be able to move if I send his head flying!</p><br/><p>I swung my spear with the sole purpose of swallowing his head with chaos flames. As expected, his great sword met my spear, creating a resounding metallic ringing. With ordinary spearmanship, I couldn\u2019t find an opening in his defense. His swordsmanship was the greatest of all monsters I\u2019ve met so far! After exchanging sword for spear once more, I made some distance and murmured.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut with just that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuooooo! Dark Needle Arrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a countless number of black needles shot up from the ground underneath me. Ruyue, who noticed it earlier, created a bed of ice under me, but some needles managed to break through the ice and even my platinum whirlpool, stabbing into my armor. Even though I wasn\u2019t hurt, I felt heavier. It seemed his curse also worked on items.</p><br/><p>[Will you be able to defeat me with that heavy body, Hero?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou talk too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without moving from that place, I pulled my spear back and took my stance. I mostly finished analyzing him. His swordsmanship was certainly excellent, but his fighting style put more emphasis on utilizing his aura and curse. He most likely had at least one more hidden card. However\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll end this before you have the chance to use it.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Despair, and despair again! This is the greatest revenge I can exact in the dungeon!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Death Knight\u2026 Why do you have to be so petty!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The whirlpool swirling around my spear lessened. It didn\u2019t get weaker, just that it became compressed to a single point. The platinum aura enveloping my armor had also moved to Chaotic Spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it couldn\u2019t be called a proper Heroic Strike, if complete, it should be able to easily blow away a single the Death Knight! A partially incomplete spear attack hurled towards the Death Knight. He quickly rolled his body, dodging it, but I simply grinned in response.</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t think you can run away!]</p><br/><p>Peika, who was on standby, shot up into the air and spread her arms out. A chain of golden lightning crackled out, binding together his four limbs.</p><br/><p>[Kuk!?]</p><br/><p>[Master!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI know!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without a single moment of hesitation, I thrust my spear and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cSacrifice!\u201d</p><br/><p>His helmet burst into pieces. The rotting skin and bones of a corpse appeared underneath. As dead blood shot up into the air, he let out a strange howl.</p><br/><p>[Kiaaaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>So he really did have something left! In an instant, black mist surrounded his body. From it, large double-edged axes, razor-sharp scimitars, and other curse-ridden weapons shot out. Each of them was enough to threaten my life! Because of the effect of Sacrifice, I could only dodge them by the skin of my teeth.</p><br/><p>[These are the grudge-filled weapons of all the warriors I defeated thus far! Your spear will soon become a part of it!]</p><br/><p>\u201cFunny. Too bad your weapon collecting hobby will end today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as I dodged the weapons with death just inches away, I had something else in mind. Is this\u2026 not copyright infringement?(E/N: Open! Gates of Babyl- sorry)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever, let\u2019s just kill him first!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You sure can talk for someone who\u2019s about to die!]</p><br/><p>Peruta Circuit became fiercer. As it healed my internal organs, which were damaged from Sacrifice, I leaped up. Weapons continued to shoot out, signifying the sheer number of warriors he killed. Dodging them skillfully, I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re about to die too! Stop resisting!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You will die first!]</p><br/><p>I broke out into laughter. Because I had to defeat him multiple times today, I didn\u2019t use my pocket watch\u2019s skills or any other once-a-day skills. It seemed he was gravely underestimating me because of it. At this point, exhausting my power was a waste. Now that I understood his capabilities, all I had left to do was finishing him swiftly and cleanly.</p><br/><p>At first, I wanted to hold out for a little longer to see how long this skill of his would last, but I decided to do that next time.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019m coming\u2026 Try to dodge this!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Come!]</p><br/><p>I twisted my body in the air and shot towards him. Dodging all the weapons hurling towards me with Divine Speed, I focused my eyes on his ugly face. With my sole goal being to destroy it, I thrust my spear!</p><br/><p>\u201cDieeeeeee!\u201d</p><br/><p>I gave up trying to fix my habit of shouting. Since it inadvertently became the guild\u2019s official rallying cry, I might as well keep pushing it!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

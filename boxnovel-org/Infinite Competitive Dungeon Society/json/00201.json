Second Season (4)</p><br/><p>What kind of a golem had bones!? If it\u2019s a bone golem, it should only be made of bones. Alternatively, if it\u2019s a flesh golem made of a mixture of bones and flesh, it should be covered with disgusting rotten flesh. But this guy was neither! I scrutinized it closely and realized something. It wasn\u2019t a golem!</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuha!]</p><br/><p>Its steel arm extended like a certain pirate king candidate\u2019s and shot toward me. As I thought, this wasn\u2019t a golem, but a living being! Golems couldn\u2019t freely transform their bodies like that. However, it could maintain its steel body and stretch its arm. What was its identity? Did it really have bones underneath all that steel\u2026? No, now wasn\u2019t the time to leisurely think about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLotte, dodge!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Leave it to me!]</p><br/><p>Lotte dodged the steel arm in an instant. At the same time, her wings produced a raging whirlpool of black flames. It seemed she had gotten stronger from the trip to the Panan continent. Was it because she spent more time with me? Or was it because she participated in battles? Regardless, I may need to reconsider how I let Plene grow.</p><br/><p>[Hero, it\u2019s trying to do something!]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I know what it is, so let\u2019s finish it now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The 60th Floor Master wasn\u2019t worthy of blocking my way for over 9 seconds. It seemed its ability was freely manipulating its large steel-like body. Though it probably had one or two hidden skills, I didn\u2019t care. Rather than waiting for it to use them, I decided to just kill it.</p><br/><p>However, just when I thought that, its steel body began to boil. As Lotte said, it seemed to be preparing for something.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>[An opening, Hero!]</p><br/><p>Right! Lotte flew forward at an incredible speed. Meanwhile, I compressed the elongated spear blade and enveloped it with my white aura and chaos flames. My skill of choice was Heroic Strike.</p><br/><p>It seemed to be trying to transform its body to something. However, before its boiling body could complete the transformation, I reached it. Cutting off a transformation was one of the best feelings!</p><br/><p>\u201cSacrifice!\u201d</p><br/><p>A black aura seemed to wrap itself over the spear blade. Realizing that the spear blade now contained an immense amount of power, I slightly hesitated to thrust forward. However, thinking that it was probably better to hurt myself than letting it do something suspicious, I thrust my spear forward.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>My spear penetrated its body before the transformation completed. At the same time, I felt a heart rupturing amount of pain. It was as if someone squeezed my heart and set it aflame. The pain then spread through my body. Perhaps this was what being in lava felt like. Alternatively, it could be like being pierced with a thousand needles.</p><br/><p>In an instant, everything within my sight turned white. This skill\u2026 I couldn\u2019t take it lightly. The damage I took was one thing, but more importantly, it even stopped me from moving for a moment. If it didn\u2019t finish the enemy, I would be vulnerable to the enemy\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>That said, I was only taking 50% of the damage, while the enemy received 200% of the damage. Currently, with the enemy having bones and receiving a critical hit, the damage it took totaled to 600%. Whatever this golem-like thing was, it instantly exploded in the middle of its transformation. Blowing up a Floor Master\u2026 Sacrifice, I like you!</p><br/><p>[A Grand Achievement! You defeated the Floor Master, \u2018Superior Doppelganger\u2019, alone! Amazing!]</p><br/><p>[You became level 61. You obtained the qualification to challenge Beyond\u2019s 10th floor.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained 5 bonus stats.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained the title, \u2018Superior Doppelganger Slayer\u2019. All stats permanently increase by 1. This effect will apply even if the title is not equipped.]</p><br/><p>[You became Gold Rank 6. Congratulations.]</p><br/><p>[You defeated the Superior Doppelganger alone. You obtained the special reward, \u2018Superior Doppelganger\u2019s Hat.\u2019]</p><br/><p>[You obtained 400,000 gold.]</p><br/><p>[Choose your reward.]</p><br/><p>[1. Weapon Swap Magic Book.]</p><br/><p>After confirming its death, I fell on Lotte\u2019s back. Right, if it didn\u2019t die with how much damage I dealt to myself, I would be troubled. But doppelganger? I was right! After all, doppelgangers were closer to mimics than golems!</p><br/><p>[Are you okay, Hero? It looked like you received a huge blow just now.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. In fact, this much pain makes me happy slightly. It snaps me awake, you know? It\u2019s not like I like pain or anything, but it helps me not overestimate myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Wise words as expected of a warrior.]</p><br/><p>I smiled at Lotte\u2019s words while circulating Peruta Circuit and recovering. It seemed my HP never fell under 10%. After battling this Floor Master, I became certain about one thing.</p><br/><p>Sacrifice had a clear flaw, but if used correctly, it would be of great help to me. It was probably best to use it with weaker skills to minimize the damage I took, or conversely with extremely powerful skills when I knew it would surely kill the enemy. Or perhaps, using this skill with Devourer could mitigate Sacrifice\u2019s flaw.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, it looks like I\u2019m not the first one to clear this floor solo on my first try\u2026 Well, I guess it isn\u2019t that surprising. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was the same for the future floors.\u201d</p><br/><p>The world was infinite and full of outstanding explorers. There were undoubtedly other talented explorers who could defeat Floor Masters alone on their first try. In fact, Daisy probably could do it without much difficulty.</p><br/><p>For now, I decided to look at the reward. Though I wasn\u2019t expecting much, I quelled the thought and chose the reward. Immediately, a message rang out.</p><br/><p>[You learned \u2018Weapon Swap.\u2019 By using 1,000 MP, you can instantly store the weapon in your hand into your inventory and replace it with another weapon. When empty-handed, you can instantly equip your weapon. Conversely, you can instantly unequip your weapon, becoming empty-handed. For 15 seconds after using Weapon Swap, your weapon\u2019s performance increases by 10%. The buff duration and performance increase are enhanced with skill levels.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t so bad! I was curious why something that sounded like a physical technique came in a magic book, but with an effect like this, it really was more like magic.</p><br/><p>For example, if an enemy ambushed me while I was empty-handed, I could use Weapon Swap and instantly equip my spear. Although my spear would take the form of a choker, it was still easier to directly summon it in my hands than having to reach for it.</p><br/><p>Plus, this skill would let me change between different battle methods. Weapon Swap\u2019s strong point was being able to use it without any delay. Although I had to use 1,000 MP, that much was an expenditure I could easily handle. Plus, with this skill, I would be able to use different weapons depending on the situation, which I had found difficult to do in the heat of battle.</p><br/><p>My Crossbow Marksmanship was high-ranked. Attacking enemies far away was significantly easier with a crossbow than a spear. If I felt like an enemy was nearing me, I would be able to swap to my spear instantly. I quite liked it.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, I could now do something entirely new\u2026 Huhu.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s start the grinding!\u201d</p><br/><p>Encouraged by the new skill that was better than my expectations, I jumped down from Lotte\u2019s back so she could transform back to her human form. After all, she wouldn\u2019t be able to leave through the door otherwise!</p><br/><p>[Hero, Hero\u2019s body is shaking.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI might be a bit anemic\u2026 Let\u2019s rest for a bit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I almost forgot about the HP I lost from Sacrifice! Once I left the Floor Master room, I bought a Fatigue Recovery Juice and Special HP Recovery Meat Skewer from Loretta. It was only then that I continued with the Superior Doppelganger grinding.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaaa! Human, I will\u2014]</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right when the Superior Doppelganger was about to transform with a villain-like line, I killed it with my spear. As this was today\u2019s 10th fight or the last, I happily ended it with Sacrifice Heroic Strike. Now that I had felt the pain from Sacrifice a few times, I felt like I had gotten somewhat used to it. I trembled at my potential.</p><br/><p>\u201cOr maybe, I\u2019m just becoming a pervert\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn, I\u2019d rather not have said it!</p><br/><p>I resented my instincts and chose the item I desired from the reward list. The 60th floor also had strengthening elixir. It was none other than the \u2018Mana Circulation Elixir.\u2019</p><br/><p>Somewhat like the other elixirs, the Mana Circulation Elixir raised my magic and charm by 1. Supposedly, it cleaned the internal pathway used for mana circulation and increased the quality of mana. Because of it, I felt like I was getting cleaner every time I ate one. It was undoubtedly a placebo effect.</p><br/><p>It took exactly one hour to defeat the Superior Doppelganger 10 times. I\u2019d kill one every 5 minutes and rested for a minute, so it was about right. These Superior Doppelgangers were rather easy to hunt. I just had to kill them before they transformed!</p><br/><p>Although they appeared as a giant golem, the moment they received damage, they started transforming. As I\u2019d never seen them complete their transformation, I still didn\u2019t know what they were transforming into. My guess was that they took the form of the explorer that damaged it.</p><br/><p>Since they started transforming after receiving damage, I easily killed them by taking their head with the first attack or by using two attacks before they finished their transformation. It was too obvious that their real attacks began after their transformation.</p><br/><p>Although killing them with first blow was ideal, for explorers that weren\u2019t confident in their attack power, it was probably better to kill them with their second attacks. After all, while they transformed, they were noticeably slower. Of course, if they couldn\u2019t kill them by the second blow, it was better to just give up.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Why was I talking about this?</p><br/><p>When I left the Floor Master room with a tired expression, Loretta, who was waiting at the Floor Shop, smiled brightly and jumped on me.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, that was the tenth, right? Then play with me. You can buy some items while you\u2019re at it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think the \u2018while I\u2019m at it\u2019 part is what you really want.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow rude! It\u2019s half-half!\u201d</p><br/><p>I ignored Loretta\u2019s pleading eyes and bought more of the relatively low-priced Fatigue Recovery Juice and HP Recovery Meat Skewers. Even as she sold them, Loretta tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, why do you need them? Didn\u2019t you finish grinding for the day?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you see, Loretta\u2026 That\u2019s because the second season of thrashing phase is beginning now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThrashing phase\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta looked like she had heard the phrase before. Meanwhile, I snickered with an evil grin. That was what a thrashing phase was.</p><br/><p>Ever since I went through the thrashing phase with Father, I always thought that it was more to alleviate the teacher\u2019s stress than to help the student fix a habit. Now, I knew the answer. Fixing a student\u2019s habit and alleviating a teacher\u2019s stress. It was half-half!</p><br/><p>[Crown Prince, I\u2019m at the training room\u2026 Is it really happening?]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll be there in a moment, Ren!]</p><br/><p>[Take your time, please!]</p><br/><p>The thrashing phase full of Ren\u2019s pain and my happiness was waiting.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

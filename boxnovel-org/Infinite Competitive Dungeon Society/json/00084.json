S-ranker Yeon Hwawoo (1)</p><br/><p>I had asked Peika to destroy all electronics within and around the pension. As a lightning elemental, she was skilled in detecting electricity. It was something that only she could do.</p><br/><p>Smartphones, cameras, security cameras, monitors, etc. Not a single electronic device was spared. Although it required a lot of mana, it was easily solved with two bottles of Mana Potions. Unfortunately, even Ye-Eun and my phones were destroyed.</p><br/><p>Although the Blood Succubus must have put some effort into removing the evidence, I wanted to be sure. Peika was perfect for the job. As an elemental, cameras could not see her, and as a lightning elemental, she had talent in easily breaking electronic gadgets.</p><br/><p>What I was most worried about were the memories of the students that were controlled by the Blood Succubus. Depending on the circumstances, I might need to completely modify my plans. Thankfully, I managed to rouse and question a student, who could not remember anything. In fact, the student could only barely remember coming to the MT.</p><br/><p>I was glad I didn\u2019t need to silence all the witnesses. Ah, the student I woke up? I made him chug alcohol until he passed\u2026 I mean, slept. He would probably not remember the questions I asked.</p><br/><p>Next, we created our alibis. First, while the students were sleeping from the aftereffects of being under the succubus\u2019 control, I made Ruyue clean us up. As an ice elemental, she cleaned us as following.</p><br/><p>[Eit, freeze!]</p><br/><p>Like that, she froze everything (blood, dust, etc) on our bodies except our clothes. We then wiped off and threw everything in the toilet. With that, we didn\u2019t need to take a shower or wash our clothes. After experiencing the power of elementals, Su Ye-Eun touched her body with a blank expression, then became excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing! I want one too!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I hate you! Scary!]</p><br/><p>After retorting to Ye-Eun, Ruyue flew toward me and hid behind my head. She couldn\u2019t hear or see you anyways, Ruyue.</p><br/><p>\u201cDrink this. We have to get rid of your injuries too.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I patted Ruyue, I gave Ye-Eun a potion. It was the potion I chose when the Floor Masters didn\u2019t drop elixirs or the equipment parts I wanted.</p><br/><p>Since I couldn\u2019t give the potions from the Floor Shop to others, I had to give her one of these potions, of which I only had a little amount.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA potion. You\u2019ll find out if you drink it.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, Ye-Eun made a fuss soon after. I ignored her and healed my own injuries. With this, we were perfectly clean.</p><br/><p>What? It would be weird if our surroundings were a mess and we were perfectly clean? Of course, it would. But there was a reason for us to be this clean. We had to pretend we were never here tonight. When people began to investigate, the people at the scene of crime would be questioned first. Although we might just be burying our heads in the sand, we had to try to avoid it first.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople usually sleep in other rooms anyways. We should pretend we did that too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-In another room\u2026 with just us two!? Uuu, I\u2019m nervous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re obviously going to be with others\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hey, why were you making that clearly disappointed face? Even as I was lost for words at her expression, I cleaned the room that became a mess from the fire, ice, and lightning.</p><br/><p>Although no one would find out I did it, it was best to get rid of as much evidence as possible. I also picked up the students I threw out into the hallway and threw them back in. With that, everything was more or less done.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, now we just have to go to some other room, pretend to have fainted, and act surprised when we wake up in the morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, you\u2019re evil\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for our peaceful lives, so cooperate.\u201d</p><br/><p>My plan was as followed. Tomorrow, people would freak out when they saw that people had died and that Chloe Blanc had disappeared. New Moon Agency would deploy Guardian to investigate without being able to obtain much information. At least, I hoped they wouldn\u2019t. I had used two elementals to get rid of the evidence. If they found dirt on me, they would reassess my ability as an Elementalist.</p><br/><p>Anyways, I would then appear a few days later as Yeon Hwawoo. I would tell the New Moon Agency that I coincidentally met a succubus that claimed to be the owner of a dungeon beyond the Gate, and promptly took care of her. Although the plan seemed full of holes, the succubus\u2019 disguise ability was real, so I could just play around it.</p><br/><p>The whole world had to find out about this incident. They needed to understand that dungeon bosses had spread out across Earth, so they could prepare themselves for it.</p><br/><p>The things I had to be wary about were how to explain me running into the succubus who had left the pension, or the people from Guardian that would get on my back trying to get the corpse of the succubus from me. Of course, I would insist that I met the succubus by chance and I had no reason to give them the succubus\u2019 corpse. Beginning from the succubus\u2019 eyes Ye-Eun took out, I would not let even a single hair of the succubus fall into the hands of the government. Anyone that dared to covet my belongings would get a beating from me. I would have no mercy.</p><br/><p>For the record, I exchanged the eyes Ye-Eun took out for taking her out for fries five times. Although I thought I was taking advantage of her, she was the one who offered. Just like that, the succubus\u2019 golden eyes ended up in my hands. I decided to give something to Ye-Eun later to make up for it. In fact, I already knew what to give her.</p><br/><p>It was time to carry out my plan. Ye-Eun and I found a room to go into. As the succubus\u2019 charm had reached this place, everyone was lying on the ground fainted. We found a place to sit and leaned against each other. Once I sat down, the tension built up in my body released, making me sigh naturally.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026 I want to lie down and sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d</p><br/><p>Who would find a nice place to lie down and sleep in this mess? I decided to be happy that I could at least be clean as I leaned against Ye-Eun. Just like that, we stayed silent for a little while. Ye-Eun was the first one to break the silence.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You won\u2019t ask?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can talk about it when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She went silent again, then as if to say everything she had been holding back, she opened her mouth again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see\u2026 I fought against monsters in front of my family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFamily, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. For some reason, whenever I see monsters, I get the urge to fight them. That time\u2026 before I realized it, I was pulling out the monster\u2019s heart with my bare hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I imagined a pretty girl laughing as she took out a monster\u2019s heart. It was indeed not the most pleasant image. In any case, she had an innate gift. An innate gift for fighting. Even while she was usually perfectly normal, whenever she saw monsters, she would want to shred them to pieces.</p><br/><p>Monsterphobia? Absurd. She was a monster slaughterer.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t forget the way they were looking at me then\u2026 it was as if they weren\u2019t looking at a human being, much less their own family member. Even though I saved them, even though I was their daughter and sister\u2026 In the end, I couldn\u2019t stand it and left the house to live by myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Apparently, ever since that day, she would freeze when she saw monsters because she remembered the way her family looked at her. I never imagined something like that could have happened to Ye-Eun.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the day I met Shin, watching you fight\u2026 I thought, \u2018wow, so you can be this cool and beautiful while fighting\u2019\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t hear that towards the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>Plus, I didn\u2019t think I was that cool. If I remembered right, I just pierced a pigeon with an iron pipe.</p><br/><p>\u201cA-Anyways! I thought good things would happen if I stayed with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have said it earlier and asked for help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cH-How could I\u2026? It\u2019s hard for me to say it, even now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I was too thoughtless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun stopped talking for a moment. I waited silently. Soon, she continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut today, because you\u2026 looked like you would get killed\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI would have, if not for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to continue pretending like I had monsterphobia. I didn\u2019t want to show you my ugly side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, you were cool.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a light smile, Su Ye-Eun continued.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 When the thought of you dying crossed my mind, I forgot my parents\u2019 faces for an instant. Before I noticed, with my hands\u2026 I was digging out that woman\u2019s eye.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you knew where to attack instinctively. I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t realize you had such talent before. As a martial artist, I\u2019m ashamed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd because Shin kept saying I was cool\u2026 I forgot my parents faces forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForever!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re sure you won\u2019t remember them for life!?\u2019 At my question, Su Ye-Eun nodded her head vigorously.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now, I think I\u2019ll be fine if I\u2019m with you. Yup, I\u2019m sure I will.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Good to be of help.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was happy that such an ability user of such caliber could finally use her full potential. I was happier that that person was my friend, and I was extremely happy that she had stepped up to protect me. Though, because the amount of contact her body was making with mine kept increasing, I was feeling a bit uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo take good care of me\u2026 forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, forever is exaggerating too much. Regardless, take good care of me too. As ability user comrades.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026 I really like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, well, me too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Ye-Eun suddenly shot up and held my shoulders. Her eyes, which had turned black after the fight ended, were expanded to a scary size. The shoulders she grabbed onto hurt. Then, she said some nonsense that I would never forget about for the rest of my life.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen is today our day 1!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s a bit\u2026 I don\u2019t have any plans to date for a while. I have to run the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun paled and froze in place. In truth, I froze too. What just happened? Although I rejected her on reflex, did she just confess to me!? What kind of a confession was that? That was the second confession out of the blue since the one from my third year of high school! Was it a prank? But I should have broken all the cameras already! I fell into a state of panic.</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun fell on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you liked me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s called being overconfident.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you bought me fries\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think your standard of judgement has long passed a normal person\u2019s level.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I liked her, I had never thought of her as a member of the opposite sex. To think that was what she thought this whole time, it seemed Ye-Eun has also been single her whole life. Ren, be happy. I found another comrade!</p><br/><p>\u201cD-D-D-Do you maybe have someone you like?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood\u2026 Then I\u2019ll wait! I can wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s a bit pressuring\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun ignored what I said and openly looked relieved. When I was watching her, the back of my neck began to itch. I couldn\u2019t believe that a girl this pretty liked me.</p><br/><p>Of course, compared to the days when I was gorilla-bodied, I looked much better now. But back then, I had once given up, thinking, \u2018in this world, it might be impossible to date without taking appearance into consideration.\u2019 Just because someone said she liked me, I couldn\u2019t just say, \u2018Oh, really? That\u2019s what I thought.\u2019</p><br/><p>I felt like I was dreaming, like I was floating among the clouds. As such, although I was a bit sorry, I couldn\u2019t accept her confession.</p><br/><p>Thus, I gave her an offer.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t really say it\u2019s in its stead, but Ye-Eun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You want to start out as just friends? But we\u2019re already friends\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not something dumb like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething dumb!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I want to offer to an Awakened full of talent and desire to beat monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Ye-Eun who was frozen without understanding what I was saying, I spoke with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to try becoming a First Dungeon explorer?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The Last Member (1)</p><br/><p>After putting on my clothes, I headed to our guild house in Jongno with Hwaya. As I sat in the back of the car, I kept grumbling.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you joke in a situation like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like not being a minute or two early is going to solve anything. It\u2019s better to relax and take things slow. If they were going to die, they would already be dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya spoke casually as she put her lips near my ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe explorer that went missing this time was contracted to Daisy. According to Daisy\u2019s report, he\u2019s already dead. The media thinks they\u2019re just missing, but\u2026 You get what I mean, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you not whisper such a chilling story in my ear?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya lightly smiled and suddenly gave a deep sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not happy either. Just when I thought we wouldn\u2019t have to worry about explorers betraying us, one of them went ahead and died. If we end up being the only explorers alive\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s gather everyone up once this is over. I don\u2019t think the new explorers will ever get to stand on the front lines though\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya looked at me astonished.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think we even have a year left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what our Hero says, I have no choice but to believe you\u2026 Mmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed what I said wasn\u2019t something she could just glance over. She made a groaning sound, then suddenly said something absurd.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we make a kid?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you come to that conclusion? A girl shouldn\u2019t say something like that easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking. I don\u2019t want to think about it, but you know, just in case something happens\u2026 I want to give birth to our child before that happens\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I thought she joking, but she had a serious expression. She looked and acted like a Westerner, but she was quite Korean when it came to something like this. Or maybe it was the combination of her boldness and Korean personality that made her say astonishing things like this. In any case, I answered her by pinching her cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u201cNeither of us will die, so don\u2019t worry about such nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlus, it will be the end for Earth if I die, so it won\u2019t matter even if we make a kid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what if I die? You\u2019re going to regret it in ten or so years, and you\u2019ll think, \u2018Gee, I wish I had a daughter who looked like Hwaya\u2026\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want a daughter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious? What\u2019s the point in raising a son? So, will you make a daughter with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it after I defeat the Demon Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya pouted like a duck.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, do I really have to die to make you think properly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t die. I won\u2019t let you, so don\u2019t say stupid things like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs always, you\u2019re only talk\u2026 Ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>I embraced Hwaya. She stopped what she was going to say and became quiet.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for making you feel uneasy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya spoke with a flustered voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, mm\u2026 N-No, I\u2019m sorry too\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She might have acted like she was fine, but she must have felt great pressure from this incident. She was the person in charge of almost all of Revival\u2019s operations, and naturally she had to worry about Earth\u2019s situation the most. This time, things had progressed too quickly and even a king had made its move.</p><br/><p>There was no way she could be fine in a situation like this. The reason she was joking around must have been to hide her anxiousness too. I could only see this now when she was saying rather extreme things.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Analyzing her words and actions until now, I could consider her barging into the bath as a result of her anxiousness and desire to make a child, but I decided not to think that way as it was scary.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you calm down?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cM-Maybe, b-but I\u2019m getting nervous in another sense\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I tried to let her go, Hwaya shook her head and dug deeper into my embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust until we get to the guild house.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActing spoiled at your age?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re forbidden from talking about age!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya shouted sharply. She was 25 this year in Korean age. She was three years older than me. Because of it, she tried to change the topic whenever her age came up in our conversation. With a bitter smile, I closed my mouth.</p><br/><p>When I gave up trying to keep her off, Hwaya put her arms around me and held me tightly. Then, she murmured quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for saying strange things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was quick.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for accepting everything. This too\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stroked Hwaya\u2019s back. Hwaya made a satisfied laugh and embraced me more comfortably. If it was the usual her, I would have refused to be this intimate, but today was special. Like she said, I planned on staying this way until we arrived at the guild house.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a dry cough rang out from the front seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice being young, isn\u2019t it, Son? Flirting in front of your father\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you weren\u2019t talking, you should\u2019ve stayed that way until we arrived.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed Hwaya had really forgotten about the driver, as she froze stiff when she heard Father\u2019s voice. However, as expected of Hwaya, she didn\u2019t leave my embrace.</p><br/><p>As soon as we arrived at the guild house, we first checked the video we received. Revival members currently staying in Korea were all present, and they naturally joined us to watch the video. When the video came on, the first thing we saw was a countless number of people filling up the heart of a city and a gate floating in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn Event Dungeon? But I didn\u2019t receive any notifications!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s the problem. There was no notification.\u201d</p><br/><p>A succubus reported. Then, another video popped up next to the video we were watching. It was also showing a floating gate.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a different place, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. The first gate is where the king appeared. As for the second gate, no one has gone in yet. The former is located in France\u2019s Bordeaux, the latter is in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in Vatican City.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere of all places!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I smacked my forehead. It was in the perfect place to cause a headache. Setting aside its religious importance, a monument of an enormous historical value was about to disappear. Of course, that was if couldn\u2019t clear the Event Dungeon.</p><br/><p>Wait, a king appeared in a dungeon? Sure, cameras worked inside an Event Dungeon, but how was it possible to live stream it to the outside world?</p><br/><p>\u201cWas the video sent from inside the Event Dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, through a dungeon explorer. It was possible only because he was a dungeon explorer. Sadly, the video was cut off the moment they were discovered by the king.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was still amazing that we managed to procure a video. Being a dungeon explorer sure had its benefits. I nodded silently and examined the two gates.</p><br/><p>When Event Dungeons appeared, Sherafina would normally tell us their ranks to minimize the risk we\u2019d have to take. This time, however, neither of the two dungeons were ranked. Of course, since we didn\u2019t even get a notification, it would be strange to expect them to be ranked.</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, they were one of those.</p><br/><p>\u201cMore things that ignore the dungeon\u2019s power? Ehew.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll face more of them in the future. That in itself isn\u2019t surprising, but what I\u2019m afraid of is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What was only possible for the demons was now possible for the monsters. This made my head hurt.</p><br/><p>\u201cHero-nim, can I say something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ciara spoke up. The crosses in her eyes were shining brilliantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoth places have kings.\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, silence descended. Coincidentally, the first video was showing people entering the gate. A dense jungle appeared along with giant monsters. I stared at the video intently, then turned towards Ciara and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You know what we mean by \u2018king\u2019, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe head of the monsters, five leaders working for an unknown being. Two of them already died to Hero-nim\u2019s hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly right.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed I needed to apologize for underestimating Ciara\u2019s power. Now that she could better control her Evil Eyes\u2019 power, she was no longer who she was in the past.</p><br/><p>But if what she said was true, it meant we had a steep mountain to climb. I asked Ciara another question.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can tell even if you\u2019re far away now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, before that video came to the succubi, I had a dream. Hero-nim knows that my ability manifests in many ways, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter my eyes opened, my dreams became even clearer. I often have clairvoyant daydreams, and I can somewhat control what I want to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you want to see?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. The world is saved by Hero-nim, and Earth continuing peacefully under Hero-nim\u2019s reign\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNevermind that, tell me what you saw.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ciara explained slowly. At the same time, the group that went into Bordeaux\u2019s gate was facing a truly massive creature. It looked like a lion and had two frightening yellow eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Beast King, the four-legged ruler of all savage beasts. He is strong and fast, an overlord who can cut and destroy anything with pure strength. Other than Hero-nim, only Daisy Ectradion-nim has the potential to win against him. Kang Yungoong-nim, Minami Violet Sumire-nim, and Su Ye-Eun-nim are included if we\u2019re only talking about stalling for time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ciara said solemnly as if she was making a proclamation. As if to prove her words, the lion stomped with one leg and caused the earth to quake and fall. When he roared, the entire jungle blew away. Rather than a creature, that was more of a calamity in the form of a creature. It seemed he was even stronger than the Lava King.</p><br/><p>Seeing the lion\u2019s imposing display, I blurted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cRen, work harder. You\u2019re falling behind Ye-Eun and Sumire against a lion. That\u2019s an extra month of Ren\u2019s thrashing phase.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuuu\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren made a mortified expression. Thankfully, Father\u2019s spearmanship and mana control improved, and he joined the lineup of people who could fight. Otherwise, the guild\u2019s men would have been embarrassed to no end.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe other one is the King of the Dead, one who rules over all corpses and despises all living beings. He has powerful magic power and antimagic. He does not die even if he\u2019s killed. Only Hero-nim and Hwaya Eleni Mastiford-nim can compare with him, and Daisy Ectradion-nim must be present when fighting him. His immortality cannot be broken without Hero-nim\u2019s final move or Daisy-nim\u2019s power. \u201c</p><br/><p>Daisy who was listening on suddenly sparkled her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cCorpses? Are there lots of good corpses? Lots of pretty corpses?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKing of the Dead\u2026 Good, very good, very very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan the word \u2018dangerous\u2019 be in there somewhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the video ended with the lion breathing an acidic breath. Missing my ass, it would be a miracle if there was even a single survivor. Damn it.</p><br/><p>I pressed my brows and asked Ciara.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, what do you mean by my final move?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe eye\u2019s power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Evil Eyes? I wouldn\u2019t really consider that my\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I mean Hero-nim\u2019s third eye.\u201d</p><br/><p>I immediately closed my mouth. I began to feel fear at Ciara\u2019s power. If I made someone with this power my enemy\u2026 No, she wouldn\u2019t be able to do this if I didn\u2019t open her eyes, but still, I felt relieved knowing that she was on our side.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, I had two dreams today. The first alerted me of the two kings. In the second dream, Hero-nim was already using that power against a black-eyed man with a giant shadow and two twisted horns.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord. I instinctively realized who she was talking about and bit my lips. Ludia\u2019s eyes also shook when she heard Ciara\u2019s description. Right, Ludia had directly faced him before. I hoped I could ease Ludia\u2019s worry as I continued to ask Ciara what happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I win?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Hero-nim. I couldn\u2019t see that far. All I know is that Hero-nim would lose if Hero-nim doesn\u2019t use the eye\u2019s power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Since I was expecting the same thing, I didn\u2019t put Shiva\u2019s Eye into the calculation of my total strength. I didn\u2019t know when the Demon Lord would appear, and Shiva\u2019s Eye was a critical power that could only be used once per year.</p><br/><p>As if to confirm my thoughts, Ciara looked at me straight on and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn conclusion, Hero-nim cannot use the eye\u2019s power from now on. The Demon Lord will descend before a year passes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I shut my eyes tightly. I understood why Ciara was saying all this. This is what she wanted to say.</p><br/><p>Save your strength.</p><br/><p>No matter what happens today.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Wow, you can really feel the atmosphere of a novel that\u2019s closing in on its end. Personally, I think Ciara should have been deployed sooner. I\u2019m regretting it a bit as the author. She came so late, and she\u2019s talking so much by herself. T.T</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Crimson Roar (2)</p><br/><p>Even in winter, Windermere was beautiful. A few ships were tied to a dock and a silver lake was spread out beyond it. The nearby town was small and had clean, pretty roads.</p><br/><p>However, the people there had deathly pale faces and were mostly ability users. In the lake, a large tuna-like thing jumped up every once in a while, then disappeared back below the surface. Those guys, weren\u2019t they in the wrong place? This wasn\u2019t the ocean, it was a lake!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late!\u201d</p><br/><p>I turned my head at the slightly piercing voice that called out to me. Hwaya, who was running towards me with a smile after I got out of the limousine, suddenly frowned. She must have realized my appearance was different than the last time we met.</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t just covering my face in a way that would hide that I was \u2018Yeon Hwawoo.\u2019 My entire facial structure, hair color, and eye color were different. It meant that I had a way of changing my appearance, and that the appearance of Yeon Hwawoo I showed Hwaya before would have a chance to be false. In that case, it was normal that she would doubt whether my name even was Yeon Hwawoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, Hwaya.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya seemed to have realized the truth from my apology as she clenched her fists. Then, she unclenched them softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa, I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll tell you more about it later. You know why I did it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you lie again, I\u2019m going to pull out your hair, and you\u2019d better tell me properly later. Show me your real appearance too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood\u2026 Well, thanks for coming\u2026 and for believing in me.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a light hug, we shook hands. Behind her, I saw three other ability users. As Hwaya greeted me, they watched us with curious gazes. Hwaya then turned and introduced me to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Thunder Knight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThunder Knight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him? How young!\u201d</p><br/><p>They each spouted awestruck words and stared at me fixedly. Hwaya then bragged without any hint of unhappiness.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? That I was an acquaintance of Thunder Knight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing, Mastiford. I didn\u2019t think you could really call him here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot to mention, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d see the face of someone who never revealed his identity. Though, he\u2019s still wearing a mask.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without showing any signs of doubting Hwaya\u2019s words, the three ability users showed interest in me, seemingly with good first impressions. At their following questions, I tried to use my beginner level English to barely respond to them. I was thankful I could understand them properly. British accents were difficult\u2026</p><br/><p>Damn, Korea really needed to teach English on a conversation level basis! The English I learned in my first semester of college was more helpful than the English I studied for the SATs!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, poor Brightman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThunder Knight is quite handsome, and he\u2019s young!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know why they were laughing. Even though I changed my hair to platinum blonde and had red eyes, since I didn\u2019t change my skin-color, they should have realized I wasn\u2019t Caucasian. Even so, they treated me favorably. I was glad.</p><br/><p>Hwaya shook her hands as if to shoo away their useless talk, then introduced them to me. They were S-rank ability users. Mike Dellon, a man in his 30\u2019s, was a magician who could command over ten different kinds of water magic, and Paul Bacchus, a man in his 40\u2019s, was a dual shield wielder. There was apparently nothing he could not block.</p><br/><p>However, I was surprised when I heard he could only strengthen shields with his mana. Since I couldn\u2019t imbue mana into my crossbow either, I imagined it was similar to that. That said, as long as he could wield mana, he should be able to wield other weapons if he practiced\u2026 Well, it wasn\u2019t something I should be concerned about.</p><br/><p>The last member was Emily Brown, a woman in her early 50\u2019s with well-aged blonde hair. She was the owner of the precious healing ability.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing, right? There are only ten S-rank healers in the world and Madam Brown is one of them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Thunder Knight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Nice to meet you too, Madam Brown.\u201d</p><br/><p>I wanted to stop them from calling me Thunder Knight. What could I do? After thinking about it for a bit, I came up with a plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can call me John Smith\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about we call you T.K., short for Thunder Knight?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t, Hwaya.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Then hurry up and say your real name.]</p><br/><p>[Like I can say it here.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then, T.K.\u201d</p><br/><p>This girl, she really was angry\u2026! In the end, because of Hwaya, my nickname became T.K. In any case, I couldn\u2019t help but look at them curiously after being introduced to the three ability users.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think everyone would come to receive me, but I\u2019m surprised how distinguished everyone here is. Wasn\u2019t there another S-ranker? Why isn\u2019t that person here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person\u2019s with the other SS-ranker who\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow\u2026 But it\u2019s not even dinner time yet\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At my words, Hwaya\u2019s face reddened slightly and she lightly kicked my shin. Then, as a result of kicking my leg that was stronger than steel, she held her foot and jumped in place.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, stupid! That S-ranker is a man! He\u2019s just following Joshua Brightman around!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUek, he\u2019s into men? That\u2019s even worse\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou idiot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding, kidding.\u201d</p><br/><p>There couldn\u2019t be that many ability users here, but it seemed factions had already developed. I was happy that Hwaya\u2019s side had more S-rankers, but the member composition was rather strange. There were two long-ranged magicians, one person to block monsters\u2019 attacks up close, and one healer to heal them. It wasn\u2019t bad, but there was one thing missing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one to kill monsters in melee range. Is that why you called me, Hwaya?\u201d</p><br/><p>In gaming terms, they were missing a close-range damage dealer. At my question, the three S-rankers wore bitter expressions, while Hwaya let out a sigh. It seemed there was a reason behind it.</p><br/><p>\u201cOther than you, other countries sent their S-rankers to help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I was annoyed with Brightman, I suggested that with the added people, we split our forces into two and explore the dungeon in separate ships. After all, that should be faster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that makes sense. It\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen we were discussing it, Brightman agreed to it wholeheartedly, but when the other countries\u2019 S-rankers came, they all said they would only join Brightman\u2019s group. They said he was more trustworthy than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder how much that trust cost\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shoot, so Hwaya\u2019s side actually had less people.</p><br/><p>As expected of a chaebol. His scale really was different. To think he could make S-rankers, who generally did not lack anything, come to his side. It probably wasn\u2019t just money that did it. Adults were scary!</p><br/><p>While I was wearing an amazed look, Hwaya\u2019s complaints continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs a result, for the past few days, we couldn\u2019t even delve that deeply into the dungeon. With only Paul in the front, we shot out our magic attacks\u2026 and today, Brightman said, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be bad to continue like this, Miss Mastiford? How about we change our strategy?\u2019 Argh! So annoying! I want to burn him up!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Hwaya complained, little balls of flame sparked around her. Paul, Mike, and Madam Brown, who could be considered her party members, nodded their heads as if they were also thinking about what happened. I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut not all of the S-rankers went to his side, right? After all, they\u2019re S-rankers. They shouldn\u2019t be lacking anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, of course, there were people who wanted to join my party too, but they were all schemers who were trying to do something with my fame, and the way they were looking at me\u2026 Uuu. I refused them all, saying I didn\u2019t need them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are a cool woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPaul and Mike here don\u2019t have any ulterior motives. Unlike Brightman whose head is only filled with money and women, they know what\u2019s important, and that\u2019s thinking of our country first! Ah, it\u2019s the same for Madam Brown, of course! With her on our side, Brightman\u2019s side only has an A+-rank healer.\u201d</p><br/><p>With Hwaya laughing as if to say \u2018it serves you right,\u2019 I also responded with a laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought something was weird when you sent a plane so hastily. Then are we going there right now? I haven\u2019t fought any fish monsters before, so I\u2019m pretty excited.\u201d</p><br/><p>In truth, my body was itching for a fight. After sleeping on the plane, I wanted to get some exercise. I mean, just look at that tuna-shaped monster! It was undoubtedly delicious. I was sure of it, 100 percent! Come to think of it, I hadn\u2019t eaten that boar in the dungeon\u2019s Residential Area either. I needed to drain the blood and dismantle it soon\u2026</p><br/><p>However, after hearing what I said, Hwaya tilted her head rather cutely with a \u2018huh?\u2019 Then, she spoke as she blinked at me slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? The boat\u2019s not going anywhere today. We were already on it for nine hours today, and it\u2019s almost time for evening tea. Work hour is clearly over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I was kidding.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s true that we aren\u2019t hunting any more monsters today. You only just came. There\u2019s jet leg to worry about, so you should rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was dumbfounded at Hwaya\u2019s words that seemed to say, \u2018don\u2019t overwork yourself and rest.\u2019 I was thankful she was worrying about me, but did she really think that way?</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you treating me like a normal person after acknowledging me as an S-ranker\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, Mastiford. The bodies of us melee type ability users aren\u2019t weak like yours, who, as an SS-ranker, faints often from anemia.\u201d</p><br/><p>Paul, who was a melee ability user like me, assisted me. Hwaya then retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t faint from anemia! I just get dizzy from using up my mana!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should watch how much mana you have left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s easy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Was it because Hwaya\u2019s mana was too strong? It seemed she had a tendency to use it unsparingly. Because of it, she was getting anemia from mana exhaustion. As I felt the same way the last time I partied with her for the Event Dungeon, I decided to warn her about it this time.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you faint, your party members will be in danger. No matter how much mana you have, you need to practice controlling how much you spend.\u201d</p><br/><p>[But I can\u2019t see my MP on Earth.]</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t rely on the gauge, rely on the feeling.]</p><br/><p>[You think that\u2019s easy!? Can you do it?]</p><br/><p>[Isn\u2019t that obvious?]</p><br/><p>[Obvious\u2026!? You, can you really do it?]</p><br/><p>As we started talking in private messages in the middle, we must have looked like we were having a glaring contest to the others. Paul and Mike thought we were fighting and stepped in.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you guys need to calm down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s thanks to Mastiford\u2019s magic that we\u2019re able to do so much with just the four of us. T.K., as her acquaintance, you should know how amazing she is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I do, but she could be even more amazing if she tried.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At my words, Hwaya shrunk back. With how prideful she was, she should dislike others pointing out her flaws. The air heated up quickly. I was prepared for a ball of flame to fly my way. When I prepared myself for it, Hwaya unclenched her fists. Then, with her eyes burning like flames, she glared at me and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you can do it, there\u2019s no way I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, that\u2019s more like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>This is what I liked about her. Someone who was proud but could understand her flaws could always increase her self-worth.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo teach me. Don\u2019t tell me you can\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I can do at least that much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, then after dinner, come to my place. I can at least offer you milk tea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it\u2026 Hm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh? Did I hear what I think I just heard? While I was standing there just blinking blankly, Paul, who had walked past me before I noticed, spoke while grinning.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, I knew something was up when she kept bragging that Thunder Knight was her acquaintance, but I didn\u2019t think THE Mastiford would invite a man to her room\u2026 If Brightman found out, he would lose it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mike, who was younger compared to Paul, placed his hand on my shoulder and advised.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful of Brightman, my friend. I don\u2019t know what that man would do out of jealousy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 Thanks for the advice\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I retorted while taking Mike\u2019s hand off of me.</p><br/><p>Also, Madam Brown! Don\u2019t give me a thumbs up with that radiant smile. It\u2019s annoying!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

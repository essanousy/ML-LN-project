The World Becomes a Dungeon (6)</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you notice any difference between the wraiths on the 7th floor and 8th floor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm\u2026 the 8th floor wraiths were a bit stronger. Their defense seemed to be higher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unlike the wraiths on the 7th floor, the wraiths from the 8th floor didn\u2019t die in one hit. But noona didn\u2019t seem satisfied with my answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t feel anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnything else? Uh\u2026 oh, yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>There seemed to be ones that spit out something from their mouths. They were almost like goblins with their poisonous darts. Because I became temporarily paralyzed when they hit me, they were quite annoying to deal with. Without them, I could have reached the end of the 8th floor a few hours quicker.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think the 9th floor won\u2019t have wraiths like those?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though I asked, I knew what she was going to say. Just as I had expected, the shop noona shoved a strange object in front of my face and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere! This here is Spiritual Shield, something that can block the wraiths\u2019 ectoplasm arrows 100 times! It\u2019s only 5,000 gold! If you buy this, you might be able to break through the 9th floor in under 9 hours!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Did you give me a quest just to sell me things?\u201d</p><br/><p>Noona clearly turned her eyes away at my inquiry. Then\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBut customer, you never come to the shop\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-That\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor over 3 years, no less! Not once! Do you know how much my performance has fallen during that time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cP-Performance\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we help each other, customer? You make so much. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to spend some at the shop, would it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut 5,000 gold is too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since the exchange rate was 2,100 won, that would mean 10.5 million won. Now that I did the conversion in my mind, I really didn\u2019t want to buy it. I couldn\u2019t buy such a high price item on a whim\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout this, it probably will be impossible to break through the 9th floor in 9 hours. Ah, it\u2019s 8 hours, 57 minutes, and 58 seconds now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too meticulous with time!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, I reluctantly bought the Spiritual Shield. It was a sticker, and when I put it on the back of my hand, I felt an instant zap. The sticker then disappeared and the sticker mark seemed to be tattooed onto my hand.</p><br/><p>I regretted it. It was a Pokemon sticker.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, I have to quickly use these up\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>If mother or father saw me with a Pokemon tattoo on my hand, they would no doubt look at me with strange eyes. I quickly rushed up to the 9th floor, leaving behind the shop noona cheering me on.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext time you buy it, I\u2019ll give you a 10 percent discount!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I will!\u201d</p><br/><p>I ran. Although my mana rose to over 1,000 after hitting level 9, I did not pay any attention to it. I only had 8 hours 55 minutes and 34 seconds left!</p><br/><p>\u201cCommence Exploration!\u201d I shouted with a ringing voice.</p><br/><p>Wraiths surged out from all directions. Just like shop noona said, there were more wraiths that shot out ectoplasm arrows. Although I doubted whether I needed to spend 10.5 million won to block them, I managed to leave the thought behind, believing that the quest reward would be much better.</p><br/><p>[Quest Success]</p><br/><p>[Seeing you break through the 9th floor in 24 hours, the shop owner regrets making a bet. But a promise is a promise. She will give you a worthy reward.]</p><br/><p>[You received a system reward. You obtained 1 skill point. You can raise the level of a skill by 1.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really succeeded.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really\u2026 succeeded\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNoona, your face.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unable to take on shop noona, Loretta\u2019s depressed expression directly, I turned away. I was more concerned with this skill point. Raising a skill level, wasn\u2019t this an amazing reward? It seemed better to save it than to use it now.</p><br/><p>Loretta seemed to have found her calm as she grabbed my hand and handed me a translucent circular object.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu, a promise is a promise. Here is your reward.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You received Soul Bomb x2.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re Soul Bombs, customer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I was thankful she talked to me nicely, her eyes were still dead. I thought about pointing this out, but I just chose to check the information on these Soul Bombs.</p><br/><p>[Soul Bomb (Rare)</p><br/><p>A magical tool created by a great sage who wields soul magic and Kaloha race\u2019s blacksmith, \u2018Hand of Creation.\u2019 When this magical tool is thrown and shock is applied, the \u2018Spiritual Burst\u2019 skill will be used, dealing fatal damage to all existences in soul form. It deals 500 ~ 5,000 damage to all souls in a 20 meter radius.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are consumables!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I gave you two!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I can only use it twice!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, customer, would you like to make another bet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s breaking through the 10th floor, right? I don\u2019t even need to be told!\u201d</p><br/><p>To think she\u2019d make use of her reward and make another bet! What a vicious woman!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there won\u2019t be a time limit this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can complete it whenever you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Let\u2019s hear it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, I\u2019ve got him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour inner thoughts are coming out, noona.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe bet is simple. You have to defeat the 10th Floor Master, the Wraith Queen, by yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>[A quest appeared!]</p><br/><p>\u201cRace Queen[1. 'Wraith' and 'Race' are homophones in Korean]?\u201d</p><br/><p>I hoped she didn\u2019t ask. Thinking about a racing girl in a miniskirt upon hearing \u2018wraith queen\u2019 only proved that I was a man.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you accept the challenge?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta looked at me provokingly. I smirked and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will. Something like that will be no challenge for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You accepted the quest.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, how bold for someone who stayed on the 5th floor for three and a half years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI ended up defeating the Orc Lord alone, so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, Loretta\u2019s face turned pale and froze. Then, she suddenly grabbed onto my arm. She looked like she was about to cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2026 let me take that back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe die is cast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-Then let me add a time limit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA girl\u2019s words carry the weight of a thousand gold.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no such saying!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVisiting the doctor after death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAgh, you evil customer! At least buy more Spiritual Shields!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one I\u2019ve got still has 72 uses left, so I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, really! You\u2019re evil!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like that, I accepted my second quest. Mm, it seemed like I was forgetting something\u2026 must just be my imagination. Yep, just my imagination.</p><br/><p>The 10th Floor Master, Wraith Queen. It was accompanied by 50 wraiths, and used fear magic, confusion magic, and ectoplasm arrows to torment dungeon explorers facing it. However, it had a clear weakness. It was that its HP was much lower compared to the Orc Lord.</p><br/><p>Loretta was also selling items that blocked fear and confusion magic. These items that only blocked the Wraith Queen\u2019s magic for 5 minutes were 5,000 gold a piece. According to Ellos, dungeon explorers who challenged the Wraith Queen suffered under her insatiable desire to devour money.</p><br/><p>\u201cI still won\u2019t buy them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy!? With them, it\u2019s impossible to beat it alone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to beat it alone for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Priest-type explorers knew spells that could cleanse the fear or confused status effect. Rather than challenging it alone from the beginning, I chose to enter a party and experience a boss raid.</p><br/><p>In this chaotic time when mutant life forms were appearing on Earth, being unable to enter the dungeon for a week meant my time stopped flowing. Even if I hunted the mutant life forms, not only would my level not rise, I would risk exposing myself as an ability user. As such, the only place I could train was in the dungeon.</p><br/><p>I had no plan of ever being kicked out of the dungeon again.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake good care of me. I\u2019m Kang Shin from Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEarth? Are you\u2026 that Kang Shin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep, I\u2019m that Kang Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way, the Crown Prince has advanced to the 10th floor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s really the Crown Prince?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoa, the Crown Prince is in our party!\u201d</p><br/><p>Amazing. I had just entered a random party, but it seemed everyone knew who I was. I wonder how the rumor spread.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my first time fighting the Wraith Queen. I might get in your way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be more than enough help just by clearing all the wraiths. The priestesses can take care of the rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it to us!\u201d</p><br/><p>There were three priestesses in this party. Oddly enough, there were no priests. Although the priestesses were beautiful, they were ugly compared to my beautiful Yua. Just as I was thinking this, one of them talked to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince-nim, do you perhaps know her highness?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Who?\u201d</p><br/><p>I was about to say, \u2018Crown Prince is my nickname. By her highness, do you mean Yua?\u2019 her serious eyes stopped me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean Ehuir Empire\u2019s crown princess, her highness Palludia Gren Ehuir! I heard you partied with her previously!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, Palludia? Yeah, I know her, but\u2026 crown princess?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I told the priestess that this was the first time I\u2019ve been told about it, she gave me a dumbfounded look.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean you couldn\u2019t tell from her graceful and beautiful appearance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGraceful? She was just a noisy brat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah, whoops\u2026\u2019 Just like that, I had to spend the next 5 minutes hearing about Palludia\u2019s beauty. Why did I have to go through such an unreasonable treatment? What part of that flat-chested twin-tail was so beautiful? Of course, I didn\u2019t say anything out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou understand how beautiful and splendid Palludia-nim is now? She is the rising morning star of our continent, the ever-burning flame of hope, a flower that must not fight against the demon kind!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, I understand, so let\u2019s just go hunt the Wraith Queen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy your half hearted response, it look like you didn\u2019t understand in the slightest! I\u2019ll tell you one more time, so wipe your ears clean and listen!\u201d</p><br/><p>My ears were very clean, thank you very much. In fact, hearing more about Palludia would only make my ear go\u2026 wait. Palludia? Come to think of it, yesterday\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAAAAAAHHHHHH!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaa! You surprised me!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I screamed, the shocked priestess fell on the ground. However, I wasn\u2019t in a position to pay attention to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh no, I ignored Palludia\u2019s messages.\u201d</p><br/><p>That noisy girl wasn\u2019t the type to stay silent after having her messages ignored. With my rising fear, I began to sweat. Now that things had come to this, should I keep ignoring her? No, I couldn\u2019t avoid her forever. Eventually, I would meet her again in the dungeon. Plus, ignoring her would be too rude. Although she wasn\u2019t likable, she wasn\u2019t detestable either\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright, I\u2019ll contact her as soon as the Wraith Queen raid ends.\u2019 Making a vow, I spoke to the party members.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hurry and do this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCROWN PRINCEEEE!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 Although I made an enemy in an unexpected way, I chose to ignore it.</p><br/><p>Not paying any attention to the burning gaze behind me, I opened the door to what was a haunted house.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

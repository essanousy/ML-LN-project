The World Becomes a Dungeon (4)</p><br/><p>Apart from light shining down on my future as a dungeon explorer, my final day as a high schooler was approaching. It was graduation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe scent of the evergreen pine tree\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At the auditorium, the school\u2019s old fashioned and childish song was playing. Of course, none of the graduating students were paying attention to the song nor the principal\u2019s instruction. Only when a few students were going up to the podium to receive awards did anyone check to see if it was someone they knew.</p><br/><p>Just like that, my graduation ended. My sister came and handed me a flower bouquet.</p><br/><p>She had long, straight hair and a doll-like face. Although her short height could be considered a flaw, other than that she had a body even a model would be jealous of. Her chest which wasn\u2019t all that big could also be considered a flaw as well, but to my eyes, it was one of the things that made her perfect.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, congratulations on graduating!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Yua. How pretty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, I picked it myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I meant you\u2019re pretty. I wonder who your lucky brother is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhehe, oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing my sister laugh with such a lovable smile, I lightly hugged her. As my height went down to 190cm and my body no longer looked massive, Yua stopped instinctively trembling when she saw me. It was the dungeon that turned me into a human capable of communicating with my sister!</p><br/><p>As I was enjoying happiness by holding the bouquet and embracing my sister, my mother slapped me on the head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, stop right there! You\u2019re both my son and daughter, so don\u2019t get any weird ideas. If you want, I\u2019ll even let you do a DNA test.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, M-Mom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course we\u2019re your son and daughter. We take after your pretty looks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew, after you started going to that dungeon, only your talking has gotten smoother.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I partied with explorers from other worlds for the last 3 years, I too noticed that I had become a lot more sociable. Even in the short span of time where party members gathered to defeat the Orc Lord, a lot of internal problems could happen, just like what had happened between me and Palludia.</p><br/><p>As a party leader, I learned to deal with situations like those. It almost felt like I learned a passive flattery skill, not that that\u2019s a good thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to a restaurant! We can celebrate oppa\u2019s graduation with steak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Dad\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather\u2019s probably fooling around somewhere. Let\u2019s just go eat without him.\u201d</p><br/><p>A few days ago, when I met Peruta for the third time, he taught me the high-rank spear technique that made use of mana. The first technique allowed one to attack for a long time by lightly imbuing the spear with mana. The second technique was an explosive thrust where one instantly imbued a large amount of mana into the spear. With just these two techniques, I was able to easily tear through the wraiths on the 6th floor.</p><br/><p>I could now move forward. What was more important was my father. He still did not have mana, and could only remain on the 5th floor.</p><br/><p>Some time ago, I showed myself swinging my spear with mana. He then said as he grabbed my shoulders, \u201cteach me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, you see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I could not leave a mana pathway in his body like Peruta had done for me. He couldn\u2019t summon Peruta to his body either.</p><br/><p>As a result, he decided to walk the same path I had. He would grind for compressing elixirs, obtain the Orc Lord equipment, and try for a 1-man boss fight. But because he was a lot smaller than me, I was worried that he wouldn\u2019t be able to ingest too many compressing elixirs. I made sure that he knew the negative effects of overdosing on compressing elixirs. As my father was the type to worry for his safety, I did not worry too much.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying your father\u2019s in the dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep, he\u2019s probably fighting for his life right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew, when will he grow up\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know, he\u2019s going to get slimmer like me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get stronger too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Gulp.\u201d My mother swallowed.</p><br/><p>In truth, father wasn\u2019t so bad looking. It was just that his body made him look muscle-brained. Seeing mother change from disparaging father to looking forward to his transformation, Yua made a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew, who\u2019s the adult here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing my sister act grown up was too cute, and I couldn\u2019t help myself from petting her head. Thinking how happy I was, I laughed. If only things continued like this\u2026 Of course, I knew my life would always be slightly more special than others\u2019.</p><br/><p>But life didn\u2019t always go as one expected.</p><br/><p>That day, two moons rose above the sky. The world had begun to change.</p><br/><p>Monsters appeared. Not inside the dungeon, but in the outside world.</p><br/><p>\u201cBreaking news. In Seoul\u2019s Ahyeon-dong, a 2 meter tall wolf appeared and began attacking people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two moons and the mutant animals. The relationship between the two will be discussed by our panelist\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter \u2018Two Moon,\u2019 reports say that parts of the mountain ranges have changed formation and that the oceanic crust are acting up\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMembers of the government are saying that a state of martial law must be proclaimed\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReports say that mutant marine life have begun to attack major harbors and vessels. This incident, which is estimated to affect sea commerce, is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBreaking news. A man seemingly fighting against the mutant life forms, which have shown to take little damage from guns and knives, saved several nearby citizens. Experts say this is an effect of the \u2018Two Moon\u2019\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the same time that mutant life forms began appearing, people with the power to fight against them also appeared\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMutants that suddenly struck humanity with calamity. Would you believe that these mutants possess a secret that could advance our medical and chemical knowledge by 100 years?\u201d</p><br/><p>After the so called \u2018Two Moon,\u2019 the world became a mess. The government had even barred its citizens from stepping outside our homes. Because of strange creatures that suddenly began appearing all over the world, 20 percent of the human population suddenly died. Although various countries\u2019 militaries managed to drive them out, guns, knives, and even missiles were ineffective against them. These monsters flat out drove some countries to ruins, and feeling the danger of these monsters, the remaining countries formed an allied force against them. However, even the allied forces could only stop their advances by a little.</p><br/><p>In this situation where Earth was going crazy, like vaccines, people that could fight against the monsters appeared.</p><br/><p>Some beat down monsters with strange auras they imbued into their weapons, some burned them down with strange fires, and some twisted their necks off with telekinetic power.</p><br/><p>Although they were weak by themselves, they could fight well against monsters in groups. As a result, the government began to gather these people with powers and formed new divisions to fight against the monsters.</p><br/><p>In humanity\u2019s sudden moment of crisis, there was no time for countries to fight amongst themselves. Soon, a global anti-monster institution was established and monsters were chased out until they no longer appeared in areas populated by humans. Consequently, monsters began to gather in previously unpopulated areas or areas that had been abandoned by humans.</p><br/><p>With this, the fight between ability users and mutant life forms seemed to slow down.</p><br/><p>Ironically, the war resumed when scientific analysis of the mutant life forms, now called monsters, finished. Surprisingly, the monsters\u2019 corpses themselves, substances extracted from them, and blue nuggets very rarely found inside them all seemed to possess significant value for use in science, medicine, the military and energy.</p><br/><p>As a result, the government began to change the way they worked. They began to use these special divisions, formed to protect citizens, to instead collect these resources. People were very sensitive to this change, and under the pretext of protecting the rights of ability users, many left the government divisions and formed their own institutions.</p><br/><p>Such phenomenon occurred on a global scale. In the end, two main structures emerged for ability user institutions. One was \u2018Guardian,\u2019 formed under the government. The other was \u2018Freedom Wing,\u2019 formed by independent ability users.</p><br/><p>What was at first considered a calamity for humanity was now considered an important resource for human advancement.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe world became a dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt did.\u201d</p><br/><p>We spoke as we watched an interview from a representative of Freedom Wing.</p><br/><p>\u201cBetween fighting monsters in the dungeon and fighting monsters here, what do you think will earn more?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really care about money, but wouldn\u2019t the monsters here give more money? They say it\u2019s 200 million won for just one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks easy, doesn\u2019t it, son?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt does, father.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWant to go hunt some together?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be annoying if anyone finds out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho cares? We can just say we\u2019re rogues.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were, of course, ability users who were not part of either Guardian or Freedom Wing. As Freedom Wing was once part of Guardian, it still had remnants of an organized structure. Ability users who disliked being tied down hunted individually or in small parties, then sold monster corpses to those that wanted them. It seemed trading centers for monster corpses were also in the making. According to the rumors, America already had them set up.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will be really annoying if we get branded as ability users. I\u2019d rather go to dungeons. Besides, even if I hunt monsters here, I don\u2019t get any stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs getting stronger all you care about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep. I want to conquer the dungeon all the way to the 100th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>According to Ellos, no one had ever reached the 100th floor of the dungeon. I wanted to see the 100th floor with my own eyes.</p><br/><p>Although I was only level 7, if I traded all the gold I had accumulated from 3 years of hunting the Orc Lord, I would have more than 500 million won. It was an awful lot of money for someone who had not even gone to college yet. Ah, of course, colleges were currently closed due to monsters. The point was, I didn\u2019t plan on doing anything bothersome just for money.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, do you want to obtain an ability user license?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you already earn a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can never have enough money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you need more money for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can buy a bigger house, a bigger car, a bigger ring for your mother, more expensive clothes for Yua\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can make your own money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father did not get licensed right away. It was partly because he had yet to obtain mana, but more importantly because the world wasn\u2019t yet stable. I agreed with his decision.</p><br/><p>Although ability users were amazing human resources, beside the fact that they could fight against monsters, they were no different than normal human beings. It was impossible to know whether anything untoward would happen.</p><br/><p>It took another half year before everything calmed down. It was a stormy period where the paradigm of human history was changing. Some sang of the end, while some sang of a new beginning.</p><br/><p>My mother busily stockpiled canned food and ramen, my sister studied at home as schools were still closed, and my father continued to fight the Orc Lord in hopes of obtaining mana.</p><br/><p>Of course, in that half a year, I devoted my entire time to the dungeon.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Those That Climb the Dungeon (1)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>I had already heard about taming before. In games, it referred to domesticating hostile monsters with food or training them to become one\u2019s allies. However, I didn\u2019t think a Tamer subclass would appear like this! Just by naming a monster, I could make it my ally? No, that probably wasn\u2019t it.</p><br/><p>I shook my head at the words asking if I wanted to change my subclass. The Skill Collector subclass was a huge part of my strength. No matter how strong Plene was, she couldn\u2019t replace it. Not to mention, it seemed I could always change my decision. Though, I didn\u2019t think I would ever change to the Tamer subclass\u2026</p><br/><p>After looking through the messages, I looked at Plene, who was rubbing her head against my shoulder with a smile.</p><br/><p>[Thanks for the pretty name! You gave me an apple pie and a name! I like you!]</p><br/><p>She was being completely submissive. I patted her head as a test, and she showed her happiness by making her eyes into star shapes. Easy, she was too easy\u2026! If a bad oppa became your master, bad things would have happened!</p><br/><p>\u201cPlene.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yeah!]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like I became your master.\u201d</p><br/><p>[What\u2019s a master? I like you!]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, she hugged me directly. Feeling the cold, soft, and squishy sensation (the ice below me began to fissure with cracking noises), I sat blankly, then remembered I had things to do. In fact, there was something I had to ask Plene.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlene, you said you didn\u2019t want to kill humans, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yeah! I hate monsters more than humans! They only want to eat, and they even tried to eat me! But\u2026 I also want to sing.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 do you want to come with me to find a way to do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Okay! I like you, so I\u2019ll follow you!]</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn\u2026 I didn\u2019t think someone stronger than Ruyue would appear! Plus, although Plene had an unrealistic appearance, she still looked human. I couldn\u2019t help but react as a man. Snap out of it, Kang Shin! No matter how cute and pretty she is, she\u2019s a monster! Don\u2019t forget it!</p><br/><p>Crack. The ice split into two right down the middle of my stretched out legs. The ice then began to drift apart, splitting my legs along with it.</p><br/><p>\u201cR-Ruyue!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Shin\u2026 Meanie\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cNot now! I\u2019ll play with you as much as you want later!\u201d</p><br/><p>From then, it took a considerable time before I could make it to the dungeon\u2019s Residential Area.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you tamed a siren, Shin-nim. This is the first time I\u2019ve heard anyone taming a siren. Kuk, as I thought, a man that I find charming will also be like that to other women\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta made a displeased expression as she stared at Plene who stuck was to me like glue. If I thought more about why Loretta was feeling unhappy, I felt like I would be in serious trouble, so I quickly changed the subject.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlene said she wants to sing without killing people. Is there a place like that in the dungeon\u2019s Residential Area?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. There\u2019s the recreational area. You should already have the qualification to enter it, Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yeah. I also got a life-time free voucher for a place called \u2018Resting Place of Angels\u2019 for the first achievement, uhuk!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I brought up Resting Place of Angels, Loretta\u2019s eyes sparkled, pushing Plene aside and grabbing my hands. After being thrown on the floor, Plene blinked her large, clear eyes, unsure of what had just happened, then began to tear up.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, go there with me! Now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you let go of me first, Loretta? I want to pick Plene up before she cries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you go there, you can probably find what this shallow and arrogant siren wants.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m not shallow or arrogant! I don\u2019t even know what that means!]</p><br/><p>From what I heard, Resting Place of Angels was a resort. The so-called recreational area was similar to the Residential Area\u2019s residences. Unlike the residences, however, it was a place purely for the purpose of recovering the fatigue built up from exploring the dungeon and letting dungeon explorers relax freely. It was truly like a resort in real life. Apparently, anyone from the guild of the resort\u2019s master could enter, and other than them, one person could enter as long as that person was accompanied by the master.</p><br/><p>Explorers could go there by making achievements or completing special quests. Like the mansions and the houses, the area they could go changed depending on the scope of the achievement and the difficulty of the quest. There was an even trickier condition. Only those that owned a residence, had a room in a tenement house, or were a member of a guild could go to the resorts.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Resting Place of Angels was one of the few Special Resorts. Unlike the other resorts, which explorers had to share, it was bound to one specific explorer. If a guild master owned a Special Resort, the guild members could enter the Special Resort with the guild master\u2019s permission. Because it was called life-time free voucher, I thought it was for something like a waterpark, but it seemed it was even more generous.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, can Loretta come with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person accompanying Shin-nim can even be an outsider.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Plene?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m going, I\u2019m going!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat siren is Shin-nim\u2019s servant so of course she can go with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without having to visit Meladel, Loretta exchanged the Resting Place of Angels voucher for a key. Thinking, \u2018so it\u2019s another key,\u2019 I received it with a bitter smile. Then, just like how I opened the path to my mansion, I used the key with familiarity. When I used the Resting Place of Angels\u2019 key with Loretta and Plene standing next to me, the surrounding scenery melted and a new scenery appeared. High, blue sky, warm sunlight, a sandy beach, crystal clear ocean, and fairly big birds flying above it. Behind me, I saw trees with all sorts of fruits hanging from them and a big seaside villa.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 This is an island, right? It\u2019s the picturesque uninhabited island.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s indeed an island!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Uninhabited island!]</p><br/><p>When Loretta spread her arms out and shouted excitedly, Plene also imitated her and shouted. I doubt she knew what uninhabited island meant. I mean, just what was that sun? I knew the dungeon was full of mysterious things, but this was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think I would come to the Resting Place of Angels\u2026 Do you know why this place is called that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause people staying here can relax without a worry in the world, like angels! The ocean, the sandy beach, the fruit trees with all sorts of different fruits, and this villa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help but think it has everything a resort should have.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s even an hot spring deeper into the island. That\u2019s not all! It even has dense forests, valleys, and springs!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hot spring! I want to go to the hot spring! I like hot springs!]</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know how this island could have so many different areas, but I understood that this Resting Place of Angels was an amazing place. I also didn\u2019t know how Plene could like hot springs.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo? Why did I need to bring Plene here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s here, there are no humans who would be affected by the siren\u2019s singing. She\u2019ll have an audience as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAudience?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Lalala~]</p><br/><p>Plene suddenly began to sing. Her voice was truly beautiful, and as I had tamed her, it didn\u2019t seem to have any effect on me. I glanced at Loretta. She had closed her eyes and was enjoying Plene\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>Soon, the audience Loretta talked about began to appear. Large birds from the sky, dolphins and fish from the ocean, and animals from the inner area of the island. They were gathering here slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Lalala~ Lalala~]</p><br/><p>As Plene sang, the animals approached slowly, responding to her singing with quiet cries. Their eyes were clear and their minds did not look like they were affected by Plene\u2019s singing. Loretta opened her eyes, and seeing my surprised expression, smiled lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing. No one has been here for a long time, so everyone has been lonely. Shin-nim luckily found a siren who is extremely good at singing. Her singing will be an excellent gift for them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s \u2018them\u2019\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt a hint of sadness from Loretta\u2019s words and patted the small and cute wolf that walked up to me. Loretta then smiled sweetly and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, they\u2019re the emergency food supply for when we\u2019re hungry. They all look delicious, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I wanted her to let my dream stay a dream\u2026! How mean!</p><br/><p>Plene really liked the Resting Place of Angels and decided to stay here unless I needed her. Here, she would be able to play and sing to her heart\u2019s content. There were also no monsters which she hated. It was the ideal place she hoped for.</p><br/><p>However, there seemed to be one thing she didn\u2019t like. It was that I wouldn\u2019t be there.</p><br/><p>[You have to come visit me often! Otherwise, I\u2019ll go find you!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll visit often, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Okay! I\u2019ll wait with the new friends I made!]</p><br/><p>After promising Plene multiple times, she nodded her head as if she finally believed me. She then walked up to me and kissed my cheek. I was startled, but I thought back to the kisses Yua gave me and tried to calm myself down. Of course, it wasn\u2019t so easy.</p><br/><p>Next to me, Loretta was shaking with her fists clenched.</p><br/><p>\u201cObliterating Third\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta!?\u201d</p><br/><p>In any case, with that, I took care of the matter with Plene. After saying my goodbye to her, Loretta and I returned to Fairy Garden. Opening the door to her log cabin, Loretta made an offer.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, stay for a cup of tea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure. There\u2019s something I have to ask Loretta too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, come in!\u201d</p><br/><p>The tea Loretta brewed looked normal, but was incredibly tasty and fragrant. However, I couldn\u2019t be drunk on the taste of tea today. The reason I took care of Plene\u2019s matter was for this moment. Today, I couldn\u2019t just enjoy my time with Loretta.</p><br/><p>I took a sip of tea, then slowly placed the teacup down and asked her.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a small sigh, I asked her straightforwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is a Hero?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta\u2019s smile became stiff. However, that only lasted for a moment, as she continued with a warm smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim already knows, right? There is only one such being in a world! They\u2019re amazing, and everyone respects them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>I called her name with a low voice. She flinched then froze, but I continued without paying it any attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I met Plene for the first time, she said she was ordered to kill the Hero\u2026 Am I someone that must die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-It\u2019s\u2026 the opposite! You\u2019re someone who isn\u2019t allowed to die! Never! Don\u2019t even say something so horrible! No! I-If you die, I! I!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for worrying about me, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. Am I someone that \u2018must die\u2019 to the monsters that are invading Earth?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A cold silence flowed, and Loretta dodged my glance with her mouth shut. Just that was enough of an answer for me. \u2026An empty laugh came out.</p><br/><p>What was this? I had to die because I was a Hero? The monsters that appeared on Earth, or rather, its high-ranking monsters, were trying to kill me. I was their first priority. It was just that no one knew about it because it hadn\u2019t been long since monsters began to appear on Earth. If more time passed, monsters that actively sought me out might appear. But how had I acted until now, hearing that I was the Hero?</p><br/><p>I became conceited, thinking everyone was just raising me up. Even while I told them not to call me a Hero, I enjoyed it inwardly. I even named the skill I liked the most after it. Even while I looked down on the explorers who credited my strength to being a Hero, I was relieved that I was one. I might have even thought I was glad to have been born as the Hero. But what? Heroes are the first targets that monsters aim for? They had to kill me? There was no comedy like it. How much did the other explorers sneer seeing me? Praising me on the outside, while thinking how clueless I was.</p><br/><p>To calm down my beating heart, I began to circulate Peruta Circuit. Trying to stay calm, I asked Loretta again.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, just what am I? What exactly is a Hero?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta didn\u2019t say anything. Trying to stop myself from getting impatient, I asked again.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, Loretta, I want to know. I should know. Or, do you also plan on leaving me to be clueless? You\u2019ve shown me respect and did your best for me. I at least thought I had a special relationship with Loretta. Was I wrong? Did you just\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><br/><p>She spoke with a trembling voice. She raised her teacup and gulped down the hot tea all at once. As she had moist eyes that seemed ready to burst into tears at any time, I was startled.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, do you have to hear it now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you might already know, I don\u2019t really want to tell you right now. Once you hear the answer, you\u2019ll change without a doubt, and if you do, I will change as well. I don\u2019t like that. I want us to stay the way we are. For even a little while longer, I want to enjoy my carefree daily life with you. Am I being too greedy? Shin-nim, can you give me a little more time? You still have time to spare. The time hasn\u2019t come yet. So please, until then\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The words didn\u2019t come out. I felt like I had been punched in the most unexpected spot. Although my mouth was open, I couldn\u2019t say anything. Then, with a slightly cracking voice, I replied barely.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 wait. So\u2026 when the time comes, you have to\u2026 tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta wiped the tears around her eyes, and made a clumsy smile. I almost lost myself in her feminine and extremely beautiful appearance, but I held on, thinking about what she just said. Then like a fool, I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I change\u2026 Loretta will change too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, it\u2019s not like you don\u2019t understand, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, no, well, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t think I would say something so stupid. Seeing me stutter without knowing what to say, Loretta made a small smile and said in a voice that just barely reached my ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cCoward.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUk.\u201d</p><br/><p>I became silent, unable to make any excuses. I felt dizzy. As it seemed so absurd, I thought I was dreaming, but when I pinched my thigh in secret, the pain was vivid. No, she even found out I pinched myself. I wanted to die. I really wanted to die.</p><br/><p>Loretta again spoke in a whispering voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll also give you time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to give me a proper reply, okay? Of course, I\u2019ll only acknowledge one answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, she once again smiled. Even while I was in a daze from her fragrance and beauty, her smile was ingrained in my head clearly. I had to accept it. To a certain extent, my heart was already stolen by her.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>8,000 characters. I thought about writing 2,000 characters and splitting the chapter into two, but just stopping at the 8,000 mark seemed to be the best option.</p><br/><p>The little bit of the secret of the Hero has been revealed. Some people have already guessed, but not saying any more will be our promise!</p><br/><p>Also, the relationship between Loretta and Shin has taken a step forward. What will Shin do? Will he forget about Ye-Eun and choose Loretta? Not even the author (me) knows. Look forward to the future development ^^</p><br/>\n</div>"}

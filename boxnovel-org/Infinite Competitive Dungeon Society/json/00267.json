Kahar (1)</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t reject the request. Since I gave up on grinding stats, Dimensional Mercenary requests didn\u2019t really matter, but to me, Dimensional Mercenary requests were more than a way of obtaining stats and skill points. It was a way of getting one step closer to my final goal.</p><br/><p>In Revival, there were two other Dimensional Mercenaries, Hwaya and Daisy. It hasn\u2019t been six months since Daisy last used her Dimensional Travel, so it was still on cooldown. Hwaya was currently dealing with Ciara who was practically a bomb on a short fuse. Hwaya had to stay with Ciara for at least the next few days.</p><br/><p>But my Dimensional Travel skill let me bring other people, so I could easily bring Daisy along. If I wanted, I could bring other volunteers from the guild too.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to hear them out first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos had asked me to come to Edias continent when I had time. He said he was preparing for the final battle. Although his world faced numerous hardships, it seemed it was heading for salvation.</p><br/><p>However, the fact that this request came from an administrative guild rather than Ellos made me feel uneasy. I messaged back, trying to hide this feeling.</p><br/><p>[Where should I go?]</p><br/><p>[Come to Fairy Garden. You\u2019re more familiar with that place, right? I\u2019ll go first and deal with Loretta. It doesn\u2019t really matter whether I\u2019m hit now or later.]</p><br/><p>[Thank you.]</p><br/><p>Last time, when Eleine requested me to go on a Dimensional Mercenary mission, Loretta hit her. Because I always met or fought a world\u2019s enemy in my Dimensional Mercenary missions, Loretta was extremely worried about me going. It was understandable. I would have felt the same way. No matter how dangerous Dimensional Mercenary missions were, they shouldn\u2019t be to that degree.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I got a message about something. Sorry, Sumire. Can you train by yourself for a bit? I have to go do something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll do my best! Good luck, Shin-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>I smiled sweetly and felt better after seeing Sumire clench her fists. Right, I shouldn\u2019t be so scared before I heard their words. After leaving Sumire, I immediately went to Fairy Garden. When I neared the pavilion, I saw Eleine getting mercilessly beaten up by Loretta while other Fairy Garden members watched from the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to die! I\u2019m really going to die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll bring you back to life just to beat you up again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOw! Don\u2019t just watch, save\u2026 Aak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I made a impressed interjection, some of the members noticed me and greeted me. I also waved my hand. I came to Fairy Garden so often that I was being treated like its member.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long has she been getting hit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the moment she came to Fairy Garden.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was he working inside the guild today? The hobgoblin Meladel replied with a cup of green tea in his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think she got hit about 1.2 million times.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI should praise Loretta for hitting her over a million times in just a short time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta was so focused on hitting Eleine that she didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d come. Even I couldn\u2019t follow her arms and legs easily. Still, I improved a lot. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to see anything in the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cI. Told. You. Not. To. Involve. Shin. Nim. Didn\u2019t. I?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough, ow! People, ow! S-Stop hitting me! You\u2019re going to ruin my skin! Ow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere. Are. Other. Explorers!\u201d</p><br/><p>How were Loretta\u2019s slender arms and legs so powerful? I was extremely curious. Next to me, the elf Sikatra murmured as she nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of the Queen. Using her power of blessing, she\u2019s making her muscles sustain no fatigue. Being able to use the power of magic for such a violent physical attack shows how much of a genius she is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very scary genius.\u201d</p><br/><p>If I saw this side of her earlier, I might not have fallen in love with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cOw! It hurts!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can make it so it doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJ-Just hit me!\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t want to see a corpse, so I stepped in.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, that\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKahuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta stood tall the moment she heard my voice and kicked Eleine. With a short memorable cry, Eleine flew far, far away like a character from a manhwa. After Eleine left everyone\u2019s view, Loretta finally turned around. It seemed she was giving her best in beating Eleine up, as she had tiny droplets of sweat on her forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You came, Shin-nim? What business do you have? Did you come to play with me? Uhu, Uhuhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been watching for a while, so don\u2019t pretend nothing happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta despaired. Meanwhile, the Fairy Garden\u2019s members at the pavilion were betting on whether I\u2019d lose interest in Loretta with what happened. These cruel people\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cCall Eleine here. I have to hear what she has to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Shin-nim. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a friend in Edias continent. Plus\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I swallowed my words. It wasn\u2019t something I could say to someone else. Loretta tilted her head, but I just asked her to call Eleine back or bring her back to life. The dejected Loretta then clapped twice. Eleine appeared with her butt pointed up.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, you bitch\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet up before I hit you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour big chested violent elf! Hardcore stalker! Muscle fetishist\u2026 Kak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet up before you die.\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, Eleine needed some time before she could talk to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll keep it simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>With both her eyes bruised, Eleine began.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was in charge of Edias continent\u2019s Hero, just like how Loretta is in charge of Earth\u2019s Hero now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was why she was so interested in Edias continent\u2019s affairs. When I nodded, Eleine also nodded and opened her scabbed lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be frank, you and I are pretty much on the same level. Just what did you eat to get so strong at such a young age?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI trained a lot, but I was also lucky, very lucky. Anyways, you sure got a beating, Eleine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut it!\u201d</p><br/><p>She used healing magic on herself again and gave Loretta a deathly glare. When Loretta smiled back at her, Eleine trembled and looked away. It seemed that an instinctive fear was instilled into her. Even so, I didn\u2019t feel particularly sorry for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cEdias continent\u2019s allied force went head to head with the continent\u2019s invaders. The Hero was wise and courageous, and he acted as the allied force\u2019s vanguard. After fighting rough battles over and over again, the time for him to fight the world\u2019s enemy was coming close.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been talking in past tense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eleine became quieter ever so slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t contact him right now. He\u2019s not dead\u2026 but I just can\u2019t contact him. I think he\u2019s gone missing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you, ask other explorers to take care of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta spoke up coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to involve another Hero after a Hero\u2019s gone missing? Are you insane? What are you going to do if s-something b-bad happens to Shin-nim!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe can run if it\u2019s dangerous!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t run from the world\u2019s enemy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Eleine then bit her lips. Loretta continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems you already involved several other explorers. I know you\u2019ve been taking care of him since the beginning and that you favor him a lot. Even so, risking the safety of another world is foolish. I\u2019m sorry, but Shin-nim\u2019s Earth is more important to me than the Edias continent, just like how Edias continent is more important to you than Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this guy\u2019s mission completion rate is 100%!\u201d</p><br/><p>Eleine suddenly shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe already defeated two worlds\u2019 enemies too! Can\u2019t I be hopeful? He might find the missing Hero, and together, they might even\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Do you really want to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, stop. You\u2019re being scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stopped Loretta. While Loretta soothed her momentary killing intent, I answered Eleine.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll accept this request.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a friend in Edias continent. There\u2019s something I\u2019m looking for too. I want to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, you know what it means for a Hero to go missing, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>I breathed in a long breath, and exhaled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt means there\u2019s someone stronger than a Hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still going to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, what I\u2019m looking for is there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething Shin-nim is looking for\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta widened her eyes. For a moment, her cuteness made me speechless. I stroked Loretta\u2019s head and held myself in.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I said before\u2026 Someone stronger than a Hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta jumped. However, I continued with a sinister smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I need right now. The dungeon is nice, but I need to fight a powerful enemy with my life on the line. I feel like that\u2019s the only way I can achieve what I\u2019m looking for. Something that can\u2019t be expressed with levels.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, there\u2019s no need to dive into danger!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI never dove into danger, Loretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>I rebutted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t need to. Danger came to me instead. Even now, Earth is facing a catastrophic danger. Next time Event Dungeons appear in mass, there will be more of them in higher danger. Loretta, does Earth\u2019s current situation look like any other world\u2019s?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-It might be a bit different.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just a bit. Their speed of invasion and the powerful enemy above them, they\u2019re both far greater than what any other world has to deal with. There\u2019s no way I can be like any other Hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>I had to advance my league.</p><br/><p>For the current me, fighting a world\u2019s enemy might be dangerous, but it was also a chance. Through Dimensional Mercenary missions, I had improved both physically and mentally. I didn\u2019t think it would be any different this time. Perhaps, this could be a chance for me to complete the technique I felt. That technique that wasn\u2019t Heroic Strike nor the family\u2019s secret technique\u2026</p><br/><p>It would be dangerous, extremely dangerous\u2026 but I still needed to go to Edias continent. That\u2019s what my instincts were telling me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t just keep climbing the dungeon. I need to do everything I can. You can laugh if you think it\u2019s foolish, but still encourage me. I want Loretta to cheer me on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta stopped breathing.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, did you already\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks! You\u2019re really a good guy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Eleine interrupted Loretta and grabbed my hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin was the only one for me, but if it\u2019s you, I wouldn\u2019t mind a one night stan\u2014 ugyagyagya!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what Shin-nim decided, I won\u2019t stop you\u2026 But I\u2019m still worried about sending you off like this. Go find Lin. He should be mostly finished.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta stepped on Eleine, who twitched like a worm. After stomping on her twice, she stood on her and looked at me with serious eyes. What a mess. But since her advice was appropriate, I nodded and went to find Lin.</p><br/><p>It seemed Loretta notified Lin already, as he was waiting for me. There were two bracelets on his hand. One was thin and small, while the other was thick and fairly big. The former seemed to be for women, while the latter seemed to be for men.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood timing, I just finished them today. I\u2019ve been working for two whole months, damn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin cursed the moment he saw me. Then, he threw the thick bracelet at me. Because of its dull silver color, I felt suspicious of its effects. I looked at Lin, asking if it was properly made. Lin smirked and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cCheck it out yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay\u2026 Let\u2019s see.\u201d</p><br/><p>I opened the item information window. Then, I immediately widened my eyes.</p><br/><p>[???(???)</p><br/><p>??? - ???</p><br/><p>??? - ???</p><br/><p>??? ???]</p><br/><p>Bugged! This is bugged!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

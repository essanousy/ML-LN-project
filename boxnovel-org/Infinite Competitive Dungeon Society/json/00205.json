The Qualification of an Explorer (2)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Chapter 205. The Qualification of an Explorer (2)</p><br/><p>The day we made our announcement, we received endless crude attacks from the press. Some denounced us, saying that what we said about other worlds, explorers, and world\u2019s enemies was all made up, while some criticized us for monopolizing what should have been shared among all of humanity. Some also claimed that the dungeon was an enemy no different than the monsters, and that Revival was their vanguard. The sheer stupidity in that claim made us speechless.</p><br/><p>When exposed to something they couldn\u2019t understand, people easily denied or dismissed it as false. They wouldn\u2019t be convinced unless the world\u2019s enemy showed themselves in front of them. Although we showed them how the inventory worked and even showed ourselves going in and out of the dungeon, in the end, it wasn\u2019t easy to accept the existence of the dungeon unless they personally saw it.</p><br/><p>However, there still were people ready to adapt and progress. These were the people who applied to become explorers. Not to mention, there were more than just a small number.</p><br/><p>Hwaya glanced over the computer screen and spoke with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, we\u2019re being flooded with applications. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there are over a million.\u201d</p><br/><p>On TV, there were reports denouncing our claims as make-believe and untrustworthy. It was truly laughable. I retorted with a chuckle.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe already decided anyways. The applicants we accept have to be at least S rank. That\u2019s the best way for the explorer count will gain momentum.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. Out of all the applicants, only 5 people meet that requirement. Still, so many people applied!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Hwaya pressed a button and wiped the list clean. Immediately afterwards, the printer started spewing out five applications. She came over to hand them to me, but realizing that my hands were full, she made a wry smile and spread her arms out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIna, come to Mommy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ina, who was in my embrace, made a small nod and went over to Hwaya. Although I couldn\u2019t compare her to my 9 year old self who was busy brandishing a wooden spear in the Amazon jungle, Ina liked to act spoiled too much. It was most likely because she lost her parents at a young age. Though I was happy to spoil her, as I couldn\u2019t let her become a spoiled teenager, I\u2019d have to fix her man\u2026 manners\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018No, but it\u2019s cute, so it\u2019s fine. Ina\u2019s smart, so I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll fix it on her own when she grows up! Once she gets a boyfriend, I\u2019ll kill\u2026 I mean, she\u2019ll distance herself from Mommy and Daddy.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? There are two SS rankers? I recognize Laz Michel, but\u2026 who\u2019s this woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a Turkish ability user that recently became a SS ranker. I think she had a healing ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHealing ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>Became a SS ranker? Doesn\u2019t that mean her ability evolved? Feeling a bit surprised, I looked at her profile page. She was rather young and quite beautiful. Although I expected her to be brown, she looked Caucasian. Apparently, most Turkish people were like that. Mm, Turkish, how pretty.</p><br/><p>\u201cShiiin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-Nothing. I was just wondering why all high-ranking ability users were so beautiful, like you and Ina.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd this woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You\u2019re more beautiful of course!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it for now, but I\u2019m confiscating this. Ina.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn!\u201d</p><br/><p>At Hwaya\u2019s command, Ina reached out and took the application from my hand. The two of them then began to give their impression of the healing ability user.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, she\u2019s not even that pretty. Her skin isn\u2019t that white, her eyes aren\u2019t that big, her nose isn\u2019t that high, and her breasts aren\u2019t that big!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer clothes are worn. I don\u2019t like her earrings. Her hair is old-fashioned.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like how she looks so na\u00efve! She\u2019s short, too! Ina, who\u2019s prettier? This woman or Mommy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMommy is a lot prettier!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIna is beautiful too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, you\u2019re both beautiful\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I took my eyes off the two who were rubbing their cheeks against each other and examined the other four profiles. I first looked at Laz Michel\u2019s. His ability being reevaluated to SS+ rank was especially eye-catching.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe wants to join Revival? Hwaya.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with it. That oldie has manners and is sensible. Who knows, maybe he can give us advice when things aren\u2019t going well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with it too, but we should talk to everyone about it first. Let\u2019s make him our first contractor. He\u2019s an SS ranker, and if he joins Revival, we\u2019ll gain credibility.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya lightly eyed Ina, and she handed me the paper she had crumpled up. It was the Turkish healer\u2019s application.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe wants to join Revival.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Turkey will let her go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you have to abandon your country to join Revival. She can just join us for Event Dungeons or Event Raids as part of Revival without being tied to her country.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing if she can\u2019t prioritize her country. Of course, I\u2019ll prioritize helping the countries of Revival\u2019s members, but\u2026 Ah, I see.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had a healing ability. In other words, even if she was an SS ranker, she had no ways to attack. Not everyone could be like Ludia who could both attack, buff, and heal by coming to Earth and receiving the power of earth.</p><br/><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d I murmured and curled the corner of my mouth up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith her joining Revival, Turkey can borrow our strength for Event Dungeons or Event Raids they can\u2019t handle. That\u2019s quite smart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her name was Ilayda Van. She was 26 this year, a university graduate, and an active ability user. Apparently, her ability was still growing. She was quite outstanding.</p><br/><p>Of course, Revival already had an excellent healer, Ludia. However, it didn\u2019t hurt to have another healer, especially a high-ranking one. Who knew? Maybe there were some things only she could do.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s joining us for her country, she might not feel as committed\u2026 but I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll do her share of work. Alright, let\u2019s accept her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, Daddy\u2019s being smart for once. Right, Ina?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy\u2019s always smart!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIna\u2019s the only one that knows me. Come here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn!\u201d</p><br/><p>I decided to look at the remaining applications later, and received Ina from Hwaya\u2019s arms. Ina laughed innocently as she played with my cheeks. She really was cute. I became more certain that I didn\u2019t need to fix her manners.</p><br/><p>Ina was important, of course, but I didn\u2019t delay the explorers because of her. If we were going to accept the two SS rankers today, we wouldn\u2019t have time for others.</p><br/><p>As we decided to accept Laz Michel and Ilayda Van as Revival\u2019s members, we had to see them in person. Without me having to do anything, Hwaya was already calling them. She truly was a reliable vice-guild master.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a woman\u2019s voice rang out from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, this is the perfect family. I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t had your wedding yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom! Don\u2019t come out of nowhere!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya, who was in the middle of calling someone, dropped her phone and screamed. The woman that appeared in the living room ignored Hwaya and put the plate of fruits she was holding onto the table with a bright smile. She looked like how Hwaya would look in 10 years. Although her beauty and youth made it seem as if she was only in her early 30\u2019s, she was undoubtedly Hwaya\u2019s mother.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, Son, when\u2019s the wedding?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 Mother, you see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t I explain when I first met her!? The questions from Hwaya\u2019s mother, Lana, made me sweat. When Hwaya suggested that it was rude not saying hello when I left Ina with her all the time, I agreed and came to visit Hwaya\u2019s home. However, I didn\u2019t think Hwaya\u2019s mother would like asking so many tough questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy, with how you appeared on TV, I thought you were full of experience, but you\u2019re quite innocent. I didn\u2019t know this was your type, Hwaya. Didn\u2019t you like guys that played around when you went to school?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy, look at you getting all mad. Ina\u2019s going to learn bad things, right, Ina?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMommy is nice. She\u2019s just being shy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAw, siding with Mommy?\u201d</p><br/><p>I smiled and patted Ina. Hwaya seemed to have given up on calling, as she sent text messages somewhere, then sat down next to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019d make lunch for us, right? Hurry up. We have to go soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me, what do you like about Son-in-law? Between Allen and him, who would you choose?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, stop!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut my daughter is dating the world\u2019s most famous man, I\u2019m jealous! How can I not!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Devil, there\u2019s a devil here\u2026! I hugged Ina and shuddered. Unlike her gentle appearance, Hwaya\u2019s mother loved joking. I told myself to remember it at all costs.</p><br/><p>After eating the excellent Korean food she cooked for us, I circulated Peruta Circuit and warmed up my body. When I got up, Hwaya who was playing with Ina tilted her head and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going, Shin? We have to meet them in two hours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo hours is enough to climb the 64th floor. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou only need two hours to climb a floor? \u2026 Are you really human?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wondering about that recently, but it looks like I\u2019m human. There are still people stronger than me in the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re only level 64\u2026 Huu, nevermind. Also, I should be able to enter the First Dungeon in a few days too. I\u2019m at the end of the 79th floor now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Hwaya spoke like it was nothing, it was a truly outstanding achievement. When she became a First Dungeon explorer\u2026 though she would become weaker for now, she would be able to become much stronger in the long-run. She would also get the opportunity to become a Beyond explorer.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongrats, Hwaya. Good job.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce I defeat the First Dungeon\u2019s 50th Floor Master and obtain Dimensional Travel, I won\u2019t need to send you off to other worlds alone anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight\u2026 Were you thinking about that the whole time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, I have to watch out for Daisy too. Right now, she\u2019s the only one that can follow you to Dimensional Mercenary missions. It makes me jealous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Daisy\u2019s interested in me, it\u2019s probably just my corpse, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat makes it sound like I\u2019m worried that someone will steal you from me! I might be jealous, but I never even considered you being stolen by someone! Got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded with a wry smile at Hwaya\u2019s temperamental shout. Really, I had to at least praise her heaven-piercing confidence.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Hwaya lowered her voice and spoke quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cA-Also\u2026 what Mom said before\u2026 Allen is just a friend I used to know when I was a kid, so don\u2019t worry. T-There\u2019s really nothing more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I know she was just joking. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>I thought I gave a 10 out of 10 reply, but Hwaya frowned and shouted as if I said something unpleasant.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You should mind it at least a little! How can you not care at all when another guy\u2019s name came up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want me to mind it or not!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Really, women were as annoying as they were lovable!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

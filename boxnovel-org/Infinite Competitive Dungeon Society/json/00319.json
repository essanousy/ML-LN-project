The Clash Approaches (6)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>\u201cKuk!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop him! Those metals are dangerous!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed demons liked to pretend to be dragonknights, as they all wore dull suits of armor. However, the metallic fragments Dortu shot out dug through even the tiniest gaps in their armor to injure them. The death energy that invaded their bodies then weakened them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe can use death energy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAttack him together!\u201d</p><br/><p>The monster birds charged towards me. It seemed they realized they couldn\u2019t dodge Dortu\u2019s attack as they endured the barrage of metallic fragments in their path. At that moment, Ye-Eun leaped up above me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the enemies are demons\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ye-Eun\u2019s form disappeared from my sight, the head of the closest demon from us flew off. The monster bird he was riding on also began to fall with a vast amount of blood spurting out of his neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe sure is fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her speed even made me think she had Divine Speed. If I remember correctly, I think she said she moves through shadows? Regardless, her speed was shocking. The demons also stopped in place, seeing one of their comrades suddenly die. Meanwhile, another head of a demon flew up. With how powerful these demons were, I could see how formidable Ye-Eun has gotten.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t lose!\u201d</p><br/><p>I also didn\u2019t plan on receiving their attacks for free! I aimed my spear at the opposite direction of Ye-Eun and began to charge forward. A fierce gale blew around me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you Wind King\u2019s Rage!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnder His Highness Demon Lord\u2019s name, we will subdue you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor His Excellency Duke!\u201d</p><br/><p>The demons shouted valiantly and held up their weapons carrying chilling magic power. At the same time, the strange aura emanating from them seemed to choke me.</p><br/><p>However, I brushed it off as though I\u2019d experienced this restraint hundreds of times. In fact, their restraint of the dungeon\u2019s power helped me sense it more clearly, and I pushed this power off to the side separate from my other powers. Since I couldn\u2019t use this power, it was better to separate it to minimize the demons\u2019 effect on me than to worry about it.</p><br/><p>Moreover, I was no longer weak without the dungeon\u2019s power!</p><br/><p>\u201cHold onto your weapons tightly! Try not to die before you can use it!\u201d</p><br/><p>I thrusted my spear at the demons in front of me. Dark blue skin and red eyes, a demon attempted to hold up her shield but stopped when she met my eyes. The trembling voice she let out helped me affirm she was female.</p><br/><p>\u201cH-Hero, I\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoving an enemy commander is not allowed!\u201d</p><br/><p>I mercilessly pierced her head. Then, I shot up high using the monster bird as a stepping stone and used the wind energy following me to gain momentum for my next attack.</p><br/><p>The next target wasn\u2019t female, and this one shot out a thick lightning bolt from his hands. When the red lightning struck my body, it disappeared without leaving behind a trace. In the next instant, I was close enough to the demon to see his hair follicles. His shocked eyes were quite funny.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnlucky.\u201d</p><br/><p>I also pierced his head, and blue blood spurted out, drenching me.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, this is it!? Come on then!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, he\u2019s a monster!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is His Excellency!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur duty is to complete our mission! Attack!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the demons came together to guard against me, one of the demons was beheaded and Ye-Eun showed herself for an instant. In her hands were two daggers shining with a faint light. I immediately wondered.</p><br/><p>\u2018She already learned to compress her energy to that extent?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA woman!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t catch me with that speed.\u201d</p><br/><p>A monster bird spat out a breath mixed with fire and acid, but Ye-Eun was already gone. Freely running across the ice footholds Ruyue created, Ye-Eun moved like she was in a pinball game. The demons\u2019 formation became disorderly, and I charged straight into them.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>When my spear struck a demon, countless number of bone spears shot out around me and attacked nearby demons. However, the bone spears weren\u2019t enough to deal fatal blows.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTaste the wrath of demons!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis Excellency will claim your life!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor victory!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even with Wind King\u2019s Rage continuing, demons charged toward me the moment they saw me. They were shining with threatening demonic energy, but I snorted and cut them down easily. Dortu then gave me a warning.</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. The armor\u2019s state is becoming strange.]</p><br/><p>\u201cArmor?\u201d</p><br/><p>I furrowed my brows. He wasn\u2019t wrong. The surface of Pure Black Desire, which was now coated with the blood of demons, was faintly shining. As if it was pulsating, the light became weaker then stronger periodically. I couldn\u2019t remove it with Sharana\u2019s power, and not even Peika\u2019s power could burn it off.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like you don\u2019t know about our ancient spell.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the demons spoke arrogantly. Ancient spell? I barely knew anything about the current demons. There was no way I would know anything about their ancient time. I first beheaded that demon and converged wind energy around me.</p><br/><p>I tried to take on Pure Black Desire, but that wasn\u2019t possible. Without the dungeon\u2019s help, I couldn\u2019t tell what this spell did. At the very least, I knew that it prevented me from taking off the armor.</p><br/><p>\u201cDortu!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. I am working on it. A formidable power is hindering me, but for now, it is not doing anything.]</p><br/><p>It\u2019s even warding off Dortu who can dominate metal? Why were they hiding such a powerful spell until now? Trace of blood, concentrated energy, and the times when the light shone\u2026 Could it be?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a spell formulated with our lives! Will you drench yourself in our blood knowing that!?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was as I thought. They were prepared to die from the beginning solely to cast this spell on me. I began to sense danger.</p><br/><p>A spell capable of affecting a Legend grade armor that I couldn\u2019t do anything about. When I became flustered, the demons began to grin as though they\u2019d gained the upper hand. It was extremely unpleasant.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>I guided the lightning and wind energy of Wind King\u2019s Rage\u2019s final attack and concentrated them around my spear. The demons noticed it and tried to escape, but I released the energy before the could do so.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys can all die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dozens of monster birds were swept away by the lightning storm and disappeared without leaving behind a trace. The demons riding on them also shared the same fate except a few that managed to escape the range of the attack in time. I took a deep breath and shouted at Ye-Eun.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let their blood get on you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Shin. I\u2019m clean.\u201d</p><br/><p>I turned around as Ye-Eun\u2019s voice seemed to have come from behind me, but Ye-Eun wasn\u2019t there. Instead, blood spurted out from one of the demons charging toward me from the left.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaaaak! We were all waiting for you, Hero! You will die here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut it, die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just thinking about being tricked annoyed me greatly, but when their voices fanned the flames, I shot balls of aura and exploded them to death. At the same time, I was angry at myself for not noticing their spell when I thought I mastered mana.</p><br/><p>It was most likely because I was only focused on the fact that they weakened the dungeon\u2019s power. Foolish! Though I\u2019ve fought countless number of demons until now, I shouldn\u2019t have thought they were all the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis Excellency will arrive soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet us offer our lives until his arrival! Ensnare the Hero!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to dream, do it when you\u2019re asleep!\u201d</p><br/><p>But there was nothing I could do to change what had already happened. I didn\u2019t think being showered by their blood would cast a curse. In any case, this was a good lesson for the future. From now on, I would kill them without letting anything touch me!</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. The energy is activating. Careful, Master.]</p><br/><p>Dortu\u2019s sharp voice warned me. I nodded inwardly and moved even quicker. At the same time, I felt a mass of energy flying toward me from the north. Even without confirming it with my eyes, I knew it was the duke the demons were talking about. Since their spell was activating now, it seemed the duke\u2019s existence served as a trigger to start the spell.</p><br/><p>I drew up Absolute Soul and Peruta Circuit to the peak. I asked Dortu to place a thin layer of barrier between my armor and skin. With Sky God\u2019s Play and World Trickery, everything was perfect. Anything else wouldn\u2019t pose a problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys, get ready!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAikan, defense mode.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLuna, protect us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy and Yua seemed to have felt the duke\u2019s energy too,a s they immediately began to make preparations.</p><br/><p>Brining the two of them was truly a wise decision. In front of enemies who suppressed the dungeon\u2019s power, tamers and necromancers, who wielded other monsters\u2019 power rather than their own, were the least affected. As long as the link connecting them to their monsters were secure, they would be able to show their full power.</p><br/><p>I was worried about Ye-Eun the most, but since she hasn\u2019t called Duca yet, it seemed I didn\u2019t need to worry much.</p><br/><p>In truth, I was shocked by her speed that could match Divine Speed and destructive power that could behead a demon in one blow. This was especially so considering the dungeon\u2019s power was being suppressed. It seemed what I felt a couple days ago wasn\u2019t wrong. What was left now was for her to\u2026 Uk!</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu! The curse is activating, Master!]</p><br/><p>I could see the so-called demon duke approaching. With a huge pair of bat-like wings and a set of long, curved horns, a man carrying himself proudly flew over. I did not see him in the Luka continent, so he had to be one of the high ranking demons that didn\u2019t appear.</p><br/><p>I was also certain that he wasn\u2019t born with the ability to suppress the dungeon\u2019s power like Lespina. The depth of time I could feel from him was too great for that to be the case. Then how was he suppressing the dungeon\u2019s power? The answer was simple.</p><br/><p>He was powerful enough to crush an average world\u2019s enemy. Just like how worlds\u2019 enemies nullified the dungeon\u2019s power with their leagues, this demon duke was also defying Sherafina\u2019s power with his league. Furthermore, the demon elites that attacked us previously had covered this area with their energy. Part of the reason was to place this curse on me, but their main role was to construct a battlefield! A space where the dungeon\u2019s power couldn\u2019t be used properly!</p><br/><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Hero!\u201d</p><br/><p>The demon duke shouted excitedly. Though he didn\u2019t have anything in his hands, he was reaching his hands towards me in a claw-like manner as if to wrench something out of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am truly thankful that I got to meet you. Of course, I\u2019ll have to ask you to pay the price for blowing away our new base!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Master, now! Now!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHave a taste of what you did!\u201d</p><br/><p>I widened my eyes. I understood what he was doing. I was all too familiar with this flow of energy.</p><br/><p>Pure Black Desire exploded. In this moment, this armor, which carried the unbreakable option, was separated from the dungeon\u2019s power completely. Then, it split into hundreds of thousands of fragments and swept through all demons around me. Of course, someone who was wearing it couldn\u2019t be safe.</p><br/><p>\u201cShiiiiiin!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun shouted. Now that I think about it, if our genders were swapped, isn\u2019t this the perfect moment for a main character of a novel to awaken a new power? While facing an unimaginable pain, such stupid thought crossed my mind.</p><br/><p>However, at that moment, Ye-Eun began to shine with a dark blue light.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaaaaaaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun\u2019s stretched out her hands covered in black aura. Seeing three pairs of arms sprout up from her shoulder joints, I thought in a daze.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t even crack a joke.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

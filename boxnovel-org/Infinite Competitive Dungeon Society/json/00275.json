Kahar (9)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat crazy bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hazen shouted as he gritted his teeth. The powered suit he was wearing vibrated quietly, and he was in front of Ellos in the next moment. He held up his fist.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare trick me!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late, Hazen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos laughed. His sword was already deep inside the crystal. The violet colored crystal pulsed red like a glass heart. At the same time, the surrounding mana began to detonate. Hazen punched Ellos and sent him flying, but as Ellos said, it was too late. There was no way to recover the crystal.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, you\u2019ll die too! Help me stop it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear? It\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amidst the thundering explosion of mana, I roused Peruta Circuit and retorted calmly. I looked behind me. Neither Licorice nor Lotte was there. Mm, they properly escaped when I whispered them to.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos staggered up and looked at me. His body was also shining periodically. I was certain that he was perfectly connected to the crystal.</p><br/><p>When Ellos got up completely, one of his arm exploded. At the same time, a part of the crystal also exploded with a thundering roar, dyeing the surroundings red. This was probably what it was like to witness a bomb go off up close.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour friends aren\u2019t here\u2026 Did you see through my plan that much, friend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep. Though, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d detonate the crystal. Also\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I held up my spear. The superdense mana around us shot towards the reddened crystal and exploded. It was a truly catastrophic amount of mana.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no longer my friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ellos died, the crystal would detonate completely. In other words, the entire space around us would explode. Perhaps, the entire Peruta Mountain Range would explode and even continue out to the rest of the continent. That was how overwhelming the amount of mana gathered here was. Kahar. As Peruta said, he was a god that destroyed everything, even the things he wanted to protect. Thinking about it now, Peruta hadn\u2019t mentioned him randomly. He had undoubtedly felt an ill omen and had advised me to be wary of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, Kang Shin! Don\u2019t kill him now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hazen seemed to have realized that Ellos was connected to the crystal. Regardless of what they were saying, I rolled my eyes, looking for the last thing I needed to obtain. This was the only thing I couldn\u2019t prepare for. I could only depend on my luck.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for? That crater\u2019s the only place you can run, Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos pointed to the sky and spoke. I followed his finger and looked up at the sky. Beyond the giant hole in the faraway ceiling was a night sky. It was so far that even Divine Speed couldn\u2019t help me escape. There were only few seconds left until the explosion.</p><br/><p>\u201cDa\u2026 Damn it! Etos! O God of Destruction!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hazen had a god\u2019s true name, one belonging to a Destruction God. As I thought, he was incredible. Considering his power, I felt he rather suited the Destruction God.</p><br/><p>Shiva\u2019s power boiled inside me. It wanted to break out. Did it want to determine who was superior as a Destruction God? However, it seemed Hazen\u2019s power wasn\u2019t enough. He probably wanted to destroy Ellos\u2019 energy covering the crystal, but as they were both gods\u2019 true names, that was difficult to do.</p><br/><p>Mana exploded. It broke through the whirlpool surrounding my mana and injured me. Most of the crystal shattered and my explorer power was restored, but that wasn\u2019t enough. Even Hazen, who had used his god\u2019s true name, was being injured. There was no way I could be safe without doing anything.</p><br/><p>Still, I was smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Ellos. I found out thanks to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos retorted in a flustered tone. In the next moment, I used Divine Speed. I approached him, and kicked him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll let you find your own death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos flew straight across the sky and smashed against the crystal. Red mana shot out from the crystal and grabbed Ellos. Before Ellos could say anything, he froze. The crystal had begun assimilating with Ellos.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll increase the destructive power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you still did it\u2026!? Wasn\u2019t he once your friend!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFriend?\u201d</p><br/><p>I found it absurd.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone who used my life to get his revenge? That\u2019s not a friend. He only used me as a chess piece.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Didn\u2019t you say you trusted him!?\u201d\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cMe? How could I? I could see his scheme from miles away.\u201d</p><br/><p>I smirked and shook my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I knew he wanted to kill you. No matter what sacrifice he had to make.\u201d</p><br/><p>To be honest, I wasn\u2019t confident I could win against Hazen. The magical tool suppressing explorers\u2019 power was too strong. Hazen had also reigned supreme in almost two dimensional world wars. It was impossible to fight such a world\u2019s enemy without using the dungeon\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I also used him as a chess piece.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, you\u2026 You!\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t think Ellos could kill him, but I expected him to weaken the world\u2019s enemy. Ellos responded to my expectation outstandingly. In fact, he even went beyond my expectation. The mana gathered in the crystal wasn\u2019t just enough to kill Hazen, it was enough to ruin the entire continent. The only downside was that it might kill me too.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah! In the end, you\u2019re also a Hero! Someone who stands on the peak of such dirty worlds can\u2019t possibly be clean!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you worry about your subordinates than me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Almost in response to my words, mana once again exploded. This time, it was far bigger. Most of Hazen\u2019s subordinates were swept away by the explosion. Hazen realized what happened and screamed in despair.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaa! Kasinaaaaaaa! Someone like you, someone like you!!\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter what happened, no matter what anyone said, I didn\u2019t care. I looked up at the sky. From the giant hole to the holes in the surface of walls leading down to the floor I was standing on. I looked at the spiral helix radiating out.</p><br/><p>How long did his vestige stay here? It was engraved so clearly and had withstood countless years. I could only admire his divinity.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Peruta.\u2019 I murmured to myself.</p><br/><p>He was amazing. It was a power and vestige befitting a god. I was somewhat doubtful, but it really was here. If it wasn\u2019t for Ellos, I wouldn\u2019t have noticed until this entire space was destroyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cOverlord, Trishula.\u201d</p><br/><p>I quietly recited two powers and held up my spear. Peruta Circuit\u2019s extreme spin made it difficult for me to carry myself, but I endured it. I could do it. I should be able to.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it can\u2019t end like this! Our hope! I swear I will not\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, the crystal exploded along with the entire surrounding space. Ellos was the first one to explode, and Hazen, who was resisting with the Destruction God\u2019s power, couldn\u2019t withstand the current of mana and transformed into a stream of blood. A world\u2019s enemy, who successfully conquered a world and bared the ambition to devour the dungeon, died in vain.</p><br/><p>However, I didn\u2019t have the time to pay attention to anything else.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this, Peruta\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the middle of the overwhelming blood-red mana, I accelerated Peruta Circuit. I tuned my breathing and whirlpool to the helix Peruta drew. I didn\u2019t need to two whirlpools to cover my body and spear. I only need one whirlpool centered around the Peruta Circuit in my body. Just one was enough.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuoooooop!\u201d</p><br/><p>An enormous amount of mana rushed into my body. It attacked Ellos and Hazen whimsically, but as soon as I pulled it towards me, it happily shot towards me as if it found the master it had been waiting for. At the same time, Peruta Circuit continued to vibrate, absorbing and spinning everything.</p><br/><p>The mana filling up the surrounding space perfectly suited me. Still, there was just too much. A current of mana I had never wielded before creaked to escape my control. As it reeled to destroy me, I desperately straightened my breathing. If I missed this moment, there was nothing else I could do.</p><br/><p>To top it off, another type of mana rushed towards me. It was the storm caused by the shattered blood-red crystal that swallowed Hazen and Ellos. Tens of thousands of crystals, imbued with the giant crystal\u2019s power and Kahar\u2019s power, didn\u2019t follow my command and swept towards me like a wild beast.</p><br/><p>My armor became tattered, my hair was cut, and blood spurted out from my body. My vitality fell to a miserable level, and it felt like my soul was being yanked out. Still, the spin continued. I had long forgotten about any pain. This was also a type of mana. I should be capable of controlling it. Mana followed an even larger mana!</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t even tell where I was. Volcano? Would it still look like one? I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t even care what condition my body was in. I only focused on one thing. This giant whirlpool I had to create.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2026 do it\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a piece of the blood-red crystal was sucked into the whirlpool surrounding my body and began to spin. Next, more and more crystals became incapable of withstanding the current of mana and was absorbed by my whirlpool.</p><br/><p>The mana, which detonated the entire space, didn\u2019t spread and continued to be collected. The whirlpool roiling around me slowly compressed itself. In the process, the tens of thousands of scattered crystals were beginning to become one again.</p><br/><p>I breathed. A terrifying amount of mana had come inside me and was accelerating Peruta Circuit\u2019s spin. The surrounding space crumbled and the hole connecting the sky to the ground became larger. The whirlpool Peruta drew was completely gone. However, I was now displaying that whirlpool with my own body.</p><br/><p>Peruta\u2019s mana covering this place, no, this whole continent, was rushing towards me and forming a whirlpool. Almost as if it had been waiting for this moment.</p><br/><p>I body floated up automatically. I was in the center of the whirlpool. Now, nothing could injure me. Mana circulated around me calmly, and the pieces of the blood-red crystal compressed themselves as they fused together. At that moment, I realized.</p><br/><p>That I had become one with Peruta Circuit.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, aaaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unable to withstand the sense of ecstasy, I shouted. The mana filling up my body was beginning to change me from the inside. The bracelet Lin gave me, Radiance, then scattered. It didn\u2019t disappear. Everything forming the bracelet had melted down and was flowing into me along with mana.</p><br/><p>The current sensation was incomparable to when I first equipped Radiance. An overwhelming mana shattered my body and reforged it from the very beginning. I disappeared entirely, leaving only Peruta Circuit behind, then reappeared around Peruta Circuit from head to toe. It was a body formed from only Peruta Circuit\u2019s mana, one that other trivial mana couldn\u2019t dare to approach.</p><br/><p>Still, it wasn\u2019t enough. Peruta Circuit, in the end, belonged to Peruta. I needed something that belonged to me. Only then would I take a \u2018step\u2019 forward. I could only realize this now that I had gotten this strong. No one needed to tell me, I was enlightened naturally.</p><br/><p>With my hair being reconstituted, the current of mana began to subside.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I slowly opened my eyes. Neither the superdense mana nor the blood-red crystal was here. I was floating in empty air. Volcano? It had long since disappeared. Only magma was boiling from the deep depths.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband!\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice rang out from far away. Lotte and Licorice was flying up towards me. I smiled and waved my hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you two safe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband!\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice called me yearningly. They looked fine on the outside, but were they hurt!? I rushed towards them anxiously but stopped in place when I heard Licorice\u2019s shouting.</p><br/><p>\u201cWear something! You\u2019re too lewd!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

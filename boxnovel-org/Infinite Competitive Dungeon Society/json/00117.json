Avarice Devours Everything (4)</p><br/><p>Among the members of the expedition, Ludia had the lowest level, and everyone else including me were explorers that were at least level 50. Other than the magicians, who had a low constitution stat, we had no problem going without sleep for a few days. As such, even though we stopped to rest and eat, we did not set aside time to sleep.</p><br/><p>Taking care of the chimeras that the demons had left behind, chasing them, resting, and chasing them again\u2026 After two days, Ludia didn\u2019t look so well.</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>We were currently taking a 2-hour rest. We were told that we would catch up to the Demon Army in just a day, so the Dimensional Mercenaries were relieving their fatigue in their own ways and preparing themselves for battle. As I wasn\u2019t fatigued in the slightest, I worried about Ludia instead, who looked to be in a serious state.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. It\u2019s nothing compared to what Shina must be experiencing right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia drank a Health Potion and replied with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows what Shina is going through right now\u2026 I can\u2019t complain with just this much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me see that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>I snatched the potion Ludia was holding, and her eyebrows shot up. She really was fierce when angry. However, Ludia soon made a curious expression watching what I was doing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m making a potion slushy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSlushy\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>I froze the potion with Ruyue\u2019s freezing energy, then shook it! With just that, I made a slushy in just a few seconds. When I gave it to Ludia, she tilted her head. After eating it, she exclaimed in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool and crunchy. It\u2019s good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>While I was happy watching Ludia whose expression had gotten brighter, I heard a voice that I had grown familiar to in the past few days.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis stalker\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The violet-haired woman on her hoverboard glared at me like I had killed her parents. With a sigh, I spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you not to come near Ludia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, she\u2019s one of the mercenaries\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia noticed her too, bowing her head slightly to greet her. The woman started breathing roughly just from that. It was truly disgusting.</p><br/><p>\u201cT-The disheveled priestess robe is\u2026 kuk, unbearable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s unbearable, please go back to your planet and stop giving me goosebumps.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to greet her too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust go!\u201d</p><br/><p>While I was arguing with her, Ludia\u2019s voice became low for some reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know her? Are you close? \u2026 Are you guys in a man-woman relationship?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen her until I came here. Don\u2019t say something so horrible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! Why would I, with a man\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman exclaimed in a loud voice, then sat upright on the hoverboard and beat her chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Syrmia Bamirtuno. I\u2019m Xenon realm\u2019s first-class warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s homosexual.\u201d</p><br/><p>I added to her introduction, and Ludia instantly moved back. Syrmia Bamirtuno gave me a deathly glare.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to slowly let her know!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but I have no plans to give you my friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m normal. I, I have a fianc\u00e9 too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFiance!? Who\u2019s that? I\u2019ll kill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>At her words, Ludia\u2019s cheeks reddened as she pointed at me. You\u2019re using me as a shield? You coward! Pretending to be shy won\u2019t work!</p><br/><p>Then, Syrmia Bamirtuno quietly took out a steel whip. I flinched for a second and took out my Gluttony Spear as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cS-Shin? Are you really fighting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, duck.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDuc\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment, I embraced her and rolled on the ground. Boom! Above us, Bamirtuno\u2019s whip had collided with something.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an ambush! Everyone prepare for battle!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHo, you blocked that? You aren\u2019t so bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with Bellode\u2019s ringing voice, an unpleasant screeching voice also rang out. Holding Ludia with one arm, I retreated to where others were and raised my head. We had noticed their presence too late! We were already surrounded my demons. Not to mention, these guys\u2026 they were extremely strong!</p><br/><p>\u201cWarm\u2026 This isn\u2019t fair.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, did you say something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, nothing. I\u2019m okay, so you can let me go now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet. Even if you hate it, wait just a bit more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStupid, I don\u2019t hate it, so\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProtect her, newbie! If she gets even a scratch, I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look this way and fight, Bamirtuno!\u201d</p><br/><p>There were 16 demons, but four times as many chimeras. While I was retreating with Ludia, a few of the magicians\u2019 heads had already been severed. A few of the mercenaries had also used Return or ran to the dungeon. Damn it, they really cared for their safety the most!</p><br/><p>\u201cWyvern, burn them!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Guaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>\u201cFight! Magicians, calm down and chant your spells! Although they\u2019re demons, we can kill them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to use magic in front of us? How cute!\u201d</p><br/><p>The fight had become chaotic quickly. I sent the chimeras attacking us flying with Tempest and tried to ensure Ludia\u2019s safety. Meanwhile, Bamirtuno was fighting the demon that had attacked us. The demon had a human-like appearance, dark blue skin, and a single horn shooting out of his forehead. His completely black eyes made me feel a natural aversion to him. However, this demon was strong, stronger than any of the ones that had attacked us.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you\u2019re aiming for the princess!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWas I? She\u2019s the princess?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk!\u2019</p><br/><p>He was using a whip like Bamirtuno, but his long and thin whip was clearly stronger than Bamirtuno\u2019s steel whip. Bamirtuno shouted with tendons showing on her forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cIron Rain!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her whip disassembled and the lumps of steel shot toward the demon. The demon raised his whip, striking them down quickly, and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, not bad! You didn\u2019t learn whip technique, but were born with the power to wield steel!\u201d</p><br/><p>You should have realized that earlier by seeing her hoverboard!</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t watch their battle any longer. Although I was retreating deeper into our camp, more and more chimeras were approaching us.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe target is there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the man, but the woman he\u2019s holding!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake her! If not, kill her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kuk! These damned bastards! With Ludia in my arm, I couldn\u2019t fight freely.</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, run to the dungeon for a bit! They\u2019re aiming for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t run by myself while everyone is fighting!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you when the fight is over, so go to the dungeon! You\u2019re in the way!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe target is trying to run to the dungeon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop her! Sever her limbs!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ugh, these god damned bastards! You want to cut off her limbs to stop her from going to the dungeon!? Even I only broke them!</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaang!]</p><br/><p>In an instant, everything in sight became dyed in white. Ruyue made an ice wall completely protecting Ludia and me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t last long. Hurry and go to the dungeon!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuut!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you, I\u2019ll call you when the fight is over, so please.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, Ludia. When you\u2019re back, only trust my words.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing cracking sounds from the chimeras trying to break in, I let Ludia go. Then, I gripped my spear tightly and told her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking that it was strange that they\u2019re specifically picking our rest periods to attack. Something doesn\u2019t feel right. They know about us too well. There\u2019s most likely a spy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO-Okay\u2026 Don\u2019t let me wait too long\u2026 Don\u2019t die. If you think you will, you have to run.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia raised her arms and opened the door to the dungeon. With a smile, I nodded my head, watching her leave.</p><br/><p>Immediately afterwards, the ice wall shattered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe target escaped!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake hostages! That man is in a relationship with the target!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hey, you guys have something wrong! Confirming the sheer number of chimeras charging toward me, I hurriedly materialized Ruyue and jumped on her back. Then, I put a highest-grade Mana Potion (30,000 gold each) in my mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome at me!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You used Provoke! Enemies from all sides attack you with hostility!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are all the mercenaries!? You guys need work harder!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to deal with small fries like the chimeras, rookie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese damned demons! They\u2019re so strong!\u201d</p><br/><p>I realized that the mercenaries were fighting the demons. The knights had finally arranged themselves in a formation. As for the magicians, half of them had already died. Damn, they really should have put some points into their constitution\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cGale Track!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Dodge!]</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t get it by that, run!]</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I\u2019d let you! Get over here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that they were affected by the Provoke skill, only the tip of my spear awaited them! I stabbed and slashed the chimeras without hesitation. After sending several chimeras flying with the final blow, I could finally secure a clear view.</p><br/><p>[Low-ranked Gale Track became level 7! The AoE (Area of Effect) of the skill has increased, letting you damage enemies not in your path!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Many demons were dead, as were most of the chimeras. Only half of the knights remained. If the ones that ambushed us were elites within the Demon Army, then after winning this battle, it wouldn\u2019t be impossible to complete the request successfully.</p><br/><p>However, most of the Dimensional Mercenaries had already run away. In other words, they had decided that the mission would not be successful. Of course, they must have realized that there was a spy in our midst. If there were enemies on the inside, the difficulty would shoot up.</p><br/><p>Even so, it might be possible if the Dimensional Mercenaries worked together, but to think they\u2019d give up so easily\u2026 Although there were around six mercenaries still fighting the demons, looking at their ugly complexions, it seemed they would give up soon.</p><br/><p>Then, something rolled toward my feet. Looking at it, my eyes opened wide.</p><br/><p>It was Syrmia Bamirtuno\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was a fun fight. So, will you let me enjoy more, \u2018Earth\u2019s Hero?\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>When I raised my head, I caught sight of the demon that was fighting Bamirtuno. The blood on his whip was extremely clear and fresh.</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably not. I\u2019m strong, you see\u2026 Haat!\u201d</p><br/><p>Heroic Strike together with Divine Speed. The Heroic Strike I was using for the first time since I came here was blocked by the demon. Although it busted his hand, it healed up in an instant. What was that regeneration? Don\u2019t tell me he could continue regenerating forever?</p><br/><p>\u201cHero, is this the first time you\u2019ve seen rapid regeneration? What\u2019s with that surprised face?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI quietly thrust my spear at him. Although I used Divine Speed again, he blocked it. This time, his entire arm blew up, but he easily regenerated it.</p><br/><p>But seeing him protect his heart, it meant his regenerative ability would not work easily if his heart was blown up. That said, it didn\u2019t mean anything if I could not pierce his heart even with Divine Speed!</p><br/><p>\u201cI can see your trajectory. If you\u2019re just stabbing in a straight line, I can block your attack the moment I grasp your trajectory, regardless of your speed. Hero, you\u2019re quite weak, aren\u2019t you? Even weaker than that steel bitch.\u201d</p><br/><p>He threw Bamirtuno\u2019s body at me. Startled, I received her body and fell back, setting it down carefully. Then, I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t show any evidence of being a Hero after I arrived here. How did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? Didn\u2019t all the knights know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s as I thought.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I already knew, I was now certain. Who was it? Who was the spy? I didn\u2019t know. What was important now was to survive.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow nice of you to ask. I\u2019m His Highness Demon Lord\u2019s right arm, the Demon Army\u2019s Commander Shatuno.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you mean you\u2019re currently the strongest in the Demon Army.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I couldn\u2019t trust him, it was probably true. There was no reason for him to lie, and it made sense for the strongest demons to attack us if they wanted to prevent us from reaching the Demon Lord. It also made sense why the strong Dimensional Mercenaries couldn\u2019t defeat the demons so easily.</p><br/><p>In that case\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to save it\u2026 but there\u2019s no other choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDeific Manifestation!\u201d</p><br/><p>If I wasn\u2019t strong enough, I would leave it to master to teach me!</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note: N/A</p><br/>\n</div>"}

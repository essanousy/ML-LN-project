With Your Own Power (5)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>\u201cSee you, Loretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, you haven\u2019t slept for two weeks.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I met Loretta, I gave my goodbye as always and tried to head to the next floor. However, Loretta held me back.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim has superhuman powers, and I know Shin-nim is growing even now. Soon, Shin-nim might even reach my level. But you still need to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be a match for\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As I turned around, I laughed at what Loretta said. Then, I stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you see it now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta spoke with a faint smile. It was as she said. Looking at her directly, I felt as though I could take her on. This didn\u2019t come from a simple estimate of her mana. It came from the intuition of a warrior comparing his League against his opponent\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Loretta was far away not too long ago\u2026 What happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how fast Shin-nim is growing. For others, it becomes harder to take the next step the further they go, but it\u2019s the opposite of Shin-nim. Shin-nim was slow to grow at first, but now, Shin-nim\u2019s mana, League, and body are all growing by the day. Do you think that\u2019s because of the dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 No.\u201d</p><br/><p>I slowly shook my head. Absolute Soul, Peruta Circuit. Beast King and the others kings I absorbed mana from. The most recent Extort. All of these didn\u2019t just end after I obtained them. Even now, they were slowly yet explosively growing.</p><br/><p>My body grew sturdier by the day, while my muscles grew stronger, the charm in my horn grew more powerful, and my mana multiplied. Even if I was facing a million of myself from a year ago, I had the confidence to crush them with a single punch.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf even a little more external power flows into Shin-nim, Shin-nim will explode. For now, you need to make the power you have yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need time. I originally planned to just watch until Shin-nim reached the 90th floor, but I didn\u2019t think Shin-nim would get stronger while crossing the 89th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I did think I got stronger when I almost completely destroyed the Eliminator. It would be silly if I didn\u2019t gain anything after experiencing such a torrential storm of mana and reflecting it back.</p><br/><p>Loretta reached her hand out. Immediately, the gate to Fairy Garden appeared. I thought one needed the key Loretta gave me before to enter Fairy Garden, but seeing Loretta and Fairy Garden\u2019s other members, it seemed they could enter and leave Fairy Garden freely.</p><br/><p>Most likely, the key was only needed by an outsider like me.</p><br/><p>Loretta gestured at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, let\u2019s take a lesson. \u2026 With Shin-nim\u2019s current mana, \u2018that\u2019 might be possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>I knew what she was talking about. Dimensional Travel! Since she was going this far, there was no reason for me to refuse. With a bitter smile, I grabbed Loretta\u2019s hand. She made a satisfied smile and stepped into the gate. In the next moment, I found myself in front of Loretta\u2019s log cabin.</p><br/><p>I let out a deep sigh. Since I was the one who wanted this, I had no plans to go back.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Loretta, how long do I need to rest for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot too long. A month or two should be enough!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hah?\u201d</p><br/><p>I rebutted. Loretta laughed, and I did too. I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we start?\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed she wasn\u2019t. I attempted to back away, but Loretta grabbed my arm at lightning speed. It was still too early for me to be a match for her strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re only teaching Dimensional Travel, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, Shin-nim! Of course!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you say that twice!?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no point in resisting any further. The door to the log cabin opened, then closed.</p><br/><p>Only after two full months later did Loretta give me the okay to climb the dungeon.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect now. How is it, Shin-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I understand Dimensional Travel better now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGeez, not that! Though, that\u2019s amazing too!\u201d</p><br/><p>I had Petasos, a cheat ability that tripled the speed of my thoughts. Without this ability, it would have taken longer to establish the foundation for Dimensional Travel. Of course, this wasn\u2019t the only thing Loretta was talking about. She was also talking about the immense energy filling me up.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, I can call everything mine, except Steel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already unbelievable that you managed to perfectly control such a huge energy in such a short time. Anyone else would have taken at least 20 years. Shin-nim\u2019s talent isn\u2019t just extraordinary anymore, it\u2019s freaky.\u201d</p><br/><p>I simply smiled at what Loretta said. Things that came easily to me were hard for others to do. But that wasn\u2019t anything uncommon. There were many that I couldn\u2019t do that others could do easily.</p><br/><p>In the past, I didn\u2019t understand why that was the case, but since this was just how I was born, I had no plans to throw my weight around and act superior. But of course, that didn\u2019t mean I would allow the opposite to happen. I simply thought I was lucky to have been born with the potential to get stronger.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving then. I have to take care of some things and climb the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, have a safe trip.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Loretta pushed her lips towards me. I honed myself during the past two months, but I still couldn\u2019t do anything against Loretta\u2019s charm. It was simply too strong for me to reject.</p><br/><p>As soon as Loretta let me go, I returned to the guild house and found Father drinking alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt sure is hard to see my son\u2019s face. Did you visit another world again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you, I had to spend some time to clean up the energy within me. I learned something new too. Come to think of it, didn\u2019t I come visit from time to time? It\u2019s not like I was imprisoned.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou change so much each time that it feels like it\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>I smiled and scanned the room. As expected, there was no one else.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Walker? Doesn\u2019t he usually drink with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the First Dungeon now. He\u2019s been working himself tirelessly recently to climb even a single floor more. With Sophie, of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>What Father said made me realize how much time had passed. Although I came to visit once every few days, I didn\u2019t have the time to meet with each guild member. I see, now that Walker was in the First Dungeon, Revival\u2019s members were now all climbing the First Dungeon.</p><br/><p>Wait. Then why was Father drinking here alone?</p><br/><p>When I gave Father a curious look, he let out a hearty laugh and closed his mouth. I asked with a grin.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou died?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t poke your father\u2019s weakness like that, Son.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI should when I can.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems I thought you well.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI learned from the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I replied to Father, I sat down across him and handed him an empty cup. He then made a pleased smile and filled the cup.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou died too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t go around dying now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen did you suddenly learn to take things slower? You\u2019re always in a rush.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a good reason I\u2019m in a rush\u2026 It\u2019s not like I can ask someone else to do my job.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father didn\u2019t say anything. Although Father had also gotten stronger in the past two months, the two of us were now too far apart in strength to even compare. Father put down his drink with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that. I wanted to always stand by your side as a reliable father, but what I can do? I just have too good of a son.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Father. We don\u2019t have much time left anyways. I can handle it.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, I emptied my cup. Was what I said unexpected? Father also took a sip with a bitter look.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 My son\u2019s going too far, too fast. I wanted to raise him strong, but I didn\u2019t want to raise him an old man.\u201d</p><br/><p>I smacked my lips. I didn\u2019t expect to get such a reaction just by saying I\u2019ll fulfill my responsibility. Since I didn\u2019t know what to say, I stayed silent. Father also seemed to felt awkward, as he scratched his head and filled my cup back up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we have a spar after this. Your father\u2019s gotten stronger recently, so it should be helpful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, Father. Ah, by the way, where\u2019s Paul?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s spending all his time doing the training regime you assigned him. Do you want to see him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I need to pass him the rest of his power. A Hero shouldn\u2019t be away from his world for too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I thought about Paul, my body shot up automatically.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have another drink here alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCall Sumire too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I immediately looked for Paul. Like Father said, he was fully concentrated in his training without even thinking to climb the dungeon.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you forgot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did, once. Has it been a week?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I blocked Paul\u2019s shield and calmed him down.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for being late. It took a while to settle everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm\u2026 No, it\u2019s more important that you train yourself. I can\u2019t really complain..\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, Paul quickly understood my position. If anything, his character was great.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t just play around. I can give you the rest of your power now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRest? Isn\u2019t there over a half of it left?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Come here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Paul approached me half in doubt and slowly sat down with his back towards me. I placed my hand on his back and pushed the rest of Edias continent\u2019s power into him. Paul flinched, and soon became immersed in properly receiving the energy. Without being able to speak a word, he struggled to control the energy I passed him. I stood by his side and prevented Edias continent\u2019s energy from going berserk by injecting him with my massive mana.</p><br/><p>An unknown amount of time later, Paul opened his eyes in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is what it feels to be a Hero? \u2026 It doesn\u2019t feel like anything changed at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll feel it soon. Your shoulders will start getting heavy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What about you? Isn\u2019t it heavy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it was, I would throw it away. That\u2019s just how I am.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you don\u2019t feel burdened at all now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, but to do what I want to do, I have to protect Earth first. So my responsibility as a Hero doesn\u2019t burden me at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, I stayed silent for a moment. Then, I told Paul.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo back to Edias now. You have something to do there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Paul answered after a moment of silence. Now, Paul\u2019s connection with Earth was gone. He wasn\u2019t from Earth, and the Edias continent was still warring with its invaders.</p><br/><p>Plus, Edias continent also had the Peruta Mountain Range. Or was that different?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Paul began to roll his feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 Let me join you too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be crazy and go back to Edias. You have a job to do there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ll be fighting the Demon Lord here. I won\u2019t be in danger. And with my power, I can help protect Earth from other monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, don\u2019t be crazy and go back. What if you die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to protect Edias with my own power alone. If I die here, I would have had no hope in Edias anyways!\u201d</p><br/><p>I smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cPaul, go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin! I\u2019m not someone who doesn\u2019t know how to pay back his debt!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Paul. Go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>I turned around and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, there\u2019s something you need to do there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Paul widened his eyes. I shrugged and smiled.</p><br/><p>Anyone who saw it would agree that it was a terrifyingly evil smile.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

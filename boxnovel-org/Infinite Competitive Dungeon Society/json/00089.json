Crimson Roar (1)</p><br/><p>[Kukuku, it\u2019s him.]</p><br/><p>[A new one has come.]</p><br/><p>The moment I commenced exploration on the 36th floor, I calmed down from the whispers I heard. The pathway was much wider than usual, and the walls even had windows, letting me see outside the dungeon.</p><br/><p>This was the first time windows had appeared in the dungeon. Furthermore, beyond the windows was a pitch-black night and a purple-colored moon. I touched the windows, curious as to what world was beyond the dungeon, but I instinctively realized I could not break the windows with my ability. Not that I would have anyways.</p><br/><p>What was more important were the voices I heard. I looked around once again. I saw something pale reflected in the windows. I closed my eyes and tried to detect any presences in the surroundings. However, I could not sense anything. It was almost like the time I first climbed to the 6th floor. The only difference was that I could not see anything this time.</p><br/><p>However, I had prepared for something like this happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Thunder Wave!]</p><br/><p>Peika waved her folding fan, and along its trajectory a radiant golden wave undulated out into all directions. As I was growing as an Elementalist, Peika\u2019s ability was also growing. When Peika used her skill, the surroundings became loud.</p><br/><p>[Kuk, an elemental!]</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s a stronger elemental than we thought!]</p><br/><p>I opened my eyes and held my Silver Bone Crossbow. At Peika\u2019s wide-scope attack, the monsters that were hiding made their appearance. They were human apparitions, pale white in color. I somewhat knew what they were. They were right above the apparitions that I had fought from the 6th to 10th floor, the wraiths. These guys were ghosts! They were also undead monsters.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, come into my crossbow.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Okay!]</p><br/><p>Without hesitation, Ruyue dematerialized and infused herself into the crossbow. Soon, the white Silver Bone Crossbow began to emit a blue freezing energy. I aimed the crossbow and started shooting. Although my Crossbow Marksmanship was only low-rank, with the addition of mid-rank Spirit Aura, the bolts carried formidable power.</p><br/><p>[Kik! He\u2019s shooting at us!]</p><br/><p>[Attack, attack him!]</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t let him shoot!]</p><br/><p>The ghosts created pale white balls in their hands and threw them at me. I assumed they were a stronger version of the 9th floor wraiths\u2019 ectoplasm arrows. In any case, Peika did not let them attack freely.</p><br/><p>The folding fan in her hand shook, and a wave of lightning once again undulated, shooting out bolts of lightning as it expanded outward. Just from the stray bolts, the ghosts took damage and flinched. Without missing this opportunity, I shot out bolts consecutively and shot down the ghosts that had been affected by Peika\u2019s lightning.</p><br/><p>As I often felt, Peika and Ruyue\u2019s attributes really complemented each other well. When I took turns using their attacks, the amount of damage I dealt increased exponentially. The ghosts frantically ran around trying to dodge my bolt attacks, but became paralyzed after being hit by the lightning wave Peika emitted periodically. Once they were paralyzed, my bolts infused with Ruyue\u2019s power penetrated their foreheads.</p><br/><p>One hit was enough to take care of most of them, and those that survived surely died by the second hit. When I killed them so easily (though I had a Mana Potion in my mouth), the wraiths seemed to have realized the gravity of the situation.</p><br/><p>[If we run, that arrogant man will kill us.]</p><br/><p>[Attack him together.]</p><br/><p>[One who disrupts our rest, become the sacrifice for our amusement.]</p><br/><p>Ghosts flocked at me from all directions. Even without having to use Provoke, they gathered in large numbers incredibly fast. I ordered Peika to increase the output of Thunder Wave and ran forward. Aiming my crossbow at the ghosts in front of me, I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cA ghost in here has 8th grade syndrome!\u201d</p><br/><p>Did you think I didn\u2019t notice, you damned ghosts!?</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, why are you lying on the couch?\u201d</p><br/><p>As I was about take a nap on the couch, I woke up naturally from the voice of an angel. Yua was in her school uniform and had her bag. It seemed she had just come back from school. Today was December 23rd. Although my college went on winter break after the finals, Yua was still in high school and thus had to go to school until the end of the month.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, oppa was in the dungeon until just recently. Oppa is having a bit of trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>I had wanted to advance to the 40th floor, but even after 10 hours of shooting crossbow bolts and Peika\u2019s lightning shower, I was only on the 37th floor. The sheer number of ghosts was one thing, but the difficulty also came from the fact that normal attacks could not hurt them. My Crossbow Marksmanship did level up a lot as a result, though\u2026</p><br/><p>Most importantly, compared to the past, the pathway was much longer, to the point that it made me grit my teeth. Using the Dash skill, I ran without rest while using elemental magic and my crossbow, but it had taken me over 10 hours to go through the 36th floor. If I was this slow, how would the other explorers fare? I could only grit my teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut oppa, if you\u2019re going to sleep, you should do it in your bed. Otherwise, you\u2019ll catch a cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Yua\u2019s question, I checked the time. It was 4 in the afternoon. It was about time to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember what oppa told father, mother, and Yua? That I\u2019d be going outside of Korea for a few days to help a friend out. It was almost time to go, so I was just taking a nap.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, right\u2026 Is it really not dangerous?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not. I can come back immediately if it gets dangerous, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though that\u2019s unlikely to happen. Seeing Yua\u2019s worried frown, I patted her head a few times and got up. After contracting Ruyue, I became immune to the winter weather. I put on a black suit and took out and put on Otus\u2019 Secret from my inventory. With that, I was done getting ready.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, hiding my identity is going to be a pain.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, I was going to Britain, not as Yeon Hwawoo, but as Thunder Knight. As such, I made myself look different than Yeon Hwawoo using Otus\u2019 Secret. When I was Yeon Hwawoo, my hair had a hint of grey. This time, I made my hair platinum blonde. As I wanted to make sure I would not be compared with Yeon Hwawoo, I even made my body look a bit more like my real self. My eyes, which could be seen from beneath the mask, were made red. When I looked at myself in the mirror, a third person that wasn\u2019t Kang Shin or Yeon Hwawoo was in the mirror wearing a suspicious mask.</p><br/><p>Perfect.</p><br/><p>\u2026 I would probably have to use this opportunity to tell Hwaya my real name. She thought of me as her true friend, and she would realize that I\u2019d been lying to a certain extent once she saw my appearance. Since she\u2019s smart, she would probably realize that the appearance I showed her the first time we met was false.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Dad? Is he not going with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said he quit being Dark Knight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not that he would be able to do so easily! Although I told him about Britain, he was currently rushing through the dungeon, saying he wanted to break through the 45th floor before the end of the year. I was 100% sure he wouldn\u2019t be able to do it, but I only wished him good luck and gave up convincing him otherwise.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried if it\u2019s just oppa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa\u2019s strong. I went on TV too, remember?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, who\u2019s your friend, oppa?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cH-Hm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Oppa?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yua\u2019s eyes became sharp ever so slightly. Was Yua planning on asking this from the start? I tried to smile as I answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe friend is British. I\u2019m also going to Britain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, how did you meet a British friend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cH-Hm? Ah, you see, that person is half-Korean! We met in Korea, and that person turned out to be an ability user.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa\u2026 is that person a girl?\u201d</p><br/><p>How did she find out!? There shouldn\u2019t have been any hints!</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, you don\u2019t have to hide it or anything. The only difference is whether your friend is female or male.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you\u2019re right, she\u2019s a girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026 I knew it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Strange\u2026 I never felt cold since I contracted Ruyue, but my body was slightly shaking. Was there a cold-controlling monster nearby!? When I tensed and raised my guard up to the limit, Yua delivered an additional surprise attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, is the place you\u2019re going Britain\u2019s Windermere Lake?\u201d</p><br/><p>She got me!</p><br/><p>\u201cH-How did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, it\u2019s all the talk in the news right now. The dungeon that appeared in the tourist attraction known for its natural beauty, and the SS-ranker Hwaya Mastiford who was summoned back to her country during her stay in Korea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA-Ah! I see!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your friend, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>My sister might be much smarter than me, even with my now above 40 intelligence\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 When did you become so friendly? With someone so strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYua, oppa\u2019s going to be late. I\u2019ll explain later. Yua\u2019s a good girl, so I trust you\u2019ll stay at home without causing trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be sure to buy you a present on my way back. If something happens, remember to call me, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, that\u2019s not fair\u2026 I wanted to hear your answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe met each other through work and became friends. I\u2019ll explain properly later, so study hard and wait. Okay, yua?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yua pouted as she reluctantly answered. It had been a while since my obedient sister openly showed discontent, and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Now that I thought about it, she often showed such responses when I met with other girls, like that time with Ye-Eun. Was she jealous that another girl would steal her oppa away? No, I knew it was impossible, but that\u2019s what I wanted to think!</p><br/><p>I stroked her hair a few times and left the house, heading towards the place we promised to meet. Platinum hair, red eyes, and mask. When I arrived at the location with an appearance even I wanted to punch, there was a limousine waiting for me.</p><br/><p>\u201cMastiford-ssi sent me here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen excuse me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya was an SS-ranker. If that was hard to understand, I could put it this way.</p><br/><p>Hwaya was one of the seven most importantly regarded people on Earth.</p><br/><p>Simply put, any nation would prepare anything she wished for, whether it was a limousine, private jet, or yacht. She could be said to hold omnipotent authority. Of course, the amount of responsibility she had to bear was equally big.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Britain especially tried to fulfill her requests in order to cut her ties with Korea as much as possible. No matter how suspicious or irrational her requests were, they would fulfill them without objection. It was also why I was going to Gimpo International Airport in a limousine. The driver didn\u2019t say anything and neither did I. It was the same as I got on the private plane waiting for me at the airport. Only after I sat down in my seat did I finally let out a breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis plane is going straight to Britain\u2019s Heathrow Airport. We will take off at 5:10 PM, ten minutes after the Skunk Plane takes off.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Two Moon, people were desperate to clear the monsters from land, ocean, and sky, securing routes for cars, ships, and planes to travel. As the ocean was filled with large number of huge, powerful monsters, a few harbors had to be given up, but humans reclaimed the skies rather easily. We had discovered a monster that emitted an odor detested by flying monsters. We had developed a technology that scattered this substance in the air and prevented it from dissipating for a fixed period of time. Skunk Planes were the planes tasked with scattering this substance in the air and securing a safe route for ordinary planes to travel.</p><br/><p>Of course, this smell did not affect all flying monsters. The odor was useless against monsters like wyverns or manticores, but otherwise, the Skunk Planes did their jobs fantastically. It was a monumental victory, as human wisdom had defeated the monsters\u2019 rampage. It was also why I could go to Britain on a plane.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will arrive at the Heathrow Airport at 1:20 PM, London time. Afterwards, we will take the limousine waiting at the airport and arrive at the Windermere Lake District in 4 hours.\u201d</p><br/><p>The flight that had taken 12 hours in the past only took 5 hours now. This great improvement could, of course, be credited to the source of energy found after Two Moon: the Bluestones. Monster remains were also being used as materials for core parts of planes, ships, trains, etc. All this had happened within a year of the Two Moon incident. Humans\u2019 ability to adapt was really\u2026 Every time the thought crossed my mind, I couldn\u2019t help but think humans of other worlds. Although their civilizations might be different than ours, they were still humans.</p><br/><p>What could have driven them to the brink of extinction? What had driven them to a corner? No matter how much I thought about it, I could not come up with an answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be taking off soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nodding my head at the flight attendant\u2019s announcement, I leaned against the flight seat. Although I was generally not sleepy, because of fighting Dullahan without getting much sleep and focusing on clearing the 36th floor, fatigue had built up in my body.</p><br/><p>Even sitting here and doing nothing made my body itch to do something, but I had no other choice. Since there was extra time, I had to make use of it to get some rest. Imagining finding myself in London when I woke up, I closed my eyes. A+-rank Field Dungeon\u2026 I was looking forward to it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The Rondo of Scarlet Flame and Silver Ice (2)</p><br/><p>[Our SS ranker was always mentally unstable. Before he entered the gate, he caused a huge incident. He murdered all key personnel of the government and top brass members of Guardian before he entered the gate.]</p><br/><p>[He probably thought he could escape us forever by going inside the gate. It just shows how mentally unstable he is.]</p><br/><p>[The team we created did not consist of 2 SS rankers and 50 S rankers as you may have heard, but France\u2019s 1 SS ranker and the 50 S rankers led by him. In other words, he was out of our control.]</p><br/><p>[No matter how important SS rankers are, we can no longer tolerate his madness. He is a psychopath and a murderer. I beg you, please kill him. We will take care of the rest.]</p><br/><p>I said that wasn\u2019t for me to do and refused. However, before I left the reception room, I told him that once I went inside the gate, I would act appropriately given the circumstances. When I came back to my companions, I told them what happened. Hearing that the government personally requested me to kill an ability user, they were extremely displeased.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe killed all key personnel of the government, but the prime minister is alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething stinks. Even if he\u2019s telling the truth, it\u2019s irritating. If he\u2019s not, it\u2019s more irritating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMentally unstable person\u2026 Why would someone like him have such a power\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>If the prime minister was telling the truth and Russia\u2019s SS ranker was alive, we may have to fight a human, not monsters, when we entered the dungeon. When I considered that the reason France\u2019s SS ranker and other 50 S rankers couldn\u2019t clear the dungeon was because of Russia\u2019s SS ranker, a chill went down my back. However, Hwaya and father came to a rather simple conclusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no problem. We can just think of it as having one more SS ranked enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right, son. No matter who appears, can that person be stronger than me? Don\u2019t worry too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, father, what I\u2019m worried about is\u2026 No, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t spoil the mood when everyone sounded so confident. Plus, I had already killed a human before. I couldn\u2019t ask whether they could kill a human, even if he appeared as an enemy.</p><br/><p>Before we entered the Event Dungeon, we inspected our equipment and condition. After seeing that that everything was perfect, we headed to the snowy mountains where the Event Dungeon was located. The prime minister also came with us. This person\u2026 didn\u2019t he have better things to do?</p><br/><p>When we were about to enter the dungeon, Ludia tilted her head and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, where\u2019s the wyvern?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Lotte? She left for training.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I look like I\u2019m kidding?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lotte seemed to be extremely vexed that she couldn\u2019t enter America\u2019s SS ranked Event Dungeon with me, as she asked for my permission and left for training. I wanted to ask what training she was doing or if it was even effective, but I didn\u2019t. Since she wanted it so much, I couldn\u2019t say no. I let her go after telling her not to overdo it.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know what it was that she wanted. I just hoped she wouldn\u2019t return as something like Dark Destiny Wing\u2026 In any case, not having Lotte wasn\u2019t detrimental to our success. As such, we entered the dungeon.</p><br/><p>[You entered the SS ranked Event Dungeon, \u2018Frozen Castle.\u2019]</p><br/><p>The moment I stepped inside the Event Dungeon, a bone-chilling wind blew. Of course, with my contract to Ruyue and the effect of Red Dragon Felixes\u2019 Cape, it only felt like a light breeze. However, it seemed that wasn\u2019t the case for my companions.</p><br/><p>\u201cC-C-C-C-C-C-Cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, I thought you were an undead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I-I-I-I-I\u2019m c-c-cold t-too.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Ye-Eun jumped in my embrace. Then, she cheered.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin\u2019s cape is hot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s made out of a red dragon\u2019s leather.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Ye-Eun yelled, few more people clung to my cape. Pushing them off forcefully, I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you buy cold weather clothes in the dungeon? Wear that instead!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s hard to fight in it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re clinging onto me, neither of us can fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, everyone other than Hwaya and me wore thick cold weather clothes. Although I was fine thanks to my cape, it seemed Hwaya could protect herself with her flame ability.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, where are we?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like the castle\u2019s underground corridor. Everything\u2019s made out of ice.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked around. We were in a corridor about 5 meters wide and 10 meters tall. The flat walls had no windows. It was the perfect underground corridor where you\u2019d expect to hear the cries of captured criminals. However, for an underground corridor, the ceiling was too high. Not to mention, everything was made out of ice. The floor, walls, ceiling, everything!</p><br/><p>Although we entered all sorts of dungeons, the surroundings were always wide open and we had a spacious area to explore. However, although the place we were standing in was fairly spacious, it was clearly limited since we were caged in. If we took account the freezing energy that was continuously pouring in, the penalty we were suffering from couldn\u2019t be said to be light.</p><br/><p>We put Hwaya and Ludia, who were weak to close-ranged combat, in the middle, and quickly walked along the corridor. If the Event Dungeons we had entered so far all had the monsters attack us immediately, this dungeon was the complete opposite. Even after 30 minutes, we had not run into any monsters.</p><br/><p>\u201cEchoo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, come here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn!\u201d</p><br/><p>After we walked in this cold for a while, Ludia, who had a weak constitution, kept sneezing. Even though we prepared ourselves for any environment we might find ourselves in, it seemed it wasn\u2019t enough.</p><br/><p>Feeling sorry, I brought Ludia to my side. I couldn\u2019t give her my cape because it was bound to me, but she would be able to share the warmth by being near it. After Ludia grabbed the edge of my cape, she stopped sneezing. Instead, Hwaya and Ye-Eun\u2019s cheeks were puffed up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m cold, too\u2026 I\u2019m so jealous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour favoritism is too strong. I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun, your condition is much better than Ludia\u2019s! And Hwaya, you\u2019re warmer than anyone else here! I wanted to argue, but since it would probably be a hassle, I didn\u2019t. I simply ignored them and firmly walked onward.</p><br/><p>However, not long afterward, I hate to stop everyone. I had discovered blood splashed on the wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was a battle here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s frozen.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked around, but there was nothing other than the trace of blood. I told everyone to be on guard, then we continued onward as I actively used Mana Detection. After about 30 minutes, I suddenly felt a presence in front of me. It came with an extremely cold energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, get back!\u201d</p><br/><p>I pushed Ludia into our formation. I pulled out my spear and manifested my aura. At the same time, I called Ruyue and Peika. The moment they were summoned, they floated up over my shoulders and emitted elemental power. Soon, the enemy made its appearance. It was a golem about 7 meters tall, made out of dozens of boulder-like ice. I finally understood. The ceiling had to be this high for this golem to appear.</p><br/><p>[Guooooooo!]</p><br/><p>When the golem saw us, it roared and charged directly at us. However, it couldn\u2019t have picked a worse opponent.</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t touch Shin!]</p><br/><p>[Guoooo\u2026ooo!?]</p><br/><p>Just three words from Ruyue made the golem freeze in place. Dozens of ice crystals also rose up and stormed the golem. Shockingly, the ice forming the castle broke off readily and followed Ruyue\u2019s command. Hmm, could this place be a stage for Ruyue to shine?</p><br/><p>However, the golem looked fine even after being struck by Ruyue\u2019s frightening attack.</p><br/><p>[Guoooooo!]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I see.\u201d</p><br/><p>The flaw was that Ruyue couldn\u2019t deal huge damage to the golem as they were both had ice attribute. Ruyue, who was looking proud, quickly became dejected.</p><br/><p>[Uuu, I have to protect Shin.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was enough. Focus on blocking the golem\u2019s movements, Ruyue. Hwaya!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEit!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya threw a white flame at the golem. Even after colliding with the ice, the flame was not extinguished and continued to burn until it completely swallowed the golem.</p><br/><p>[Guoooooooo!]</p><br/><p>In the end, the golem melted to a puddle of water, while Hwaya proudly puffed out her chests.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, did you see that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, good job.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018For someone who fainted just by seeing bugs\u2026\u2019 It seemed she forgot all about what happened in America. In any case, it was true that defeating the golem was easier with Hwaya. I adequately lifted Hwaya up and surveyed my surroundings with Mana Detection again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, wait, let me go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like we\u2019ll run into monsters from now, so stay with me, Ludia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me Ludia! I\u2019m going to be with Shin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, it\u2019s warm next to me, too, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You big-breasted jealous witch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hmph, it\u2019s better than being a tiny-breasted jealous witch, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2019m still growing! The alphabet just changed, too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Please don\u2019t say what alphabet changed\u2026 Like B, C... Ah, no, I shouldn\u2019t be thinking about this!</p><br/><p>After that, we fought giant bats, gargoyles, and golems all made out of ice. Ruyue immobilized them, and Hwaya\u2019s flames violently melted all enemies even in this environment filled with ice.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, because the monsters were all made out of ice, they didn\u2019t leave any corpses. However, we were happy because Mana Stones dropped with a higher chance. Mana Stones could be used as currency in both Earth and the dungeon.</p><br/><p>We were most likely underground. After all, there were no windows anywhere. Almost to prove that I was right, the rooms along the corridor were all weapon storage rooms (full of golems), food storage rooms (full of golems), or prisons ( full of golems).</p><br/><p>After three hours, we explored the entire corridor. It seemed that we were on the lowest floor. We found a staircase going up. I couldn\u2019t hide my excitement as things started looking more and more like an RPG game.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s first eat before we continue!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d say that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Because everyone other than Hway and me were freezing, we all agreed to eat to warm ourselves up. I cooked ramen, using the Floor Shop\u2019s special item, \u2018Burned to White Ashes....\u2019 With it, I had no reason to fear the Ice Castle, which even extinguished Hwaya\u2019s flame in a few minutes. After all, even without fire, this magical item could heat up its content at the desired temperature for a desired amount of time!</p><br/><p>However, things didn\u2019t go the way I expected.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, no. The water won\u2019t boil.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it\u2026 Even though the pot is hot, the water won\u2019t boil because it\u2019s too cold outside!\u201d</p><br/><p>What kind of an absurd environment was this!? Even as I shook from this illogical situation, I refused to give up. If it the outside was too cold, I just had to make it warmer! I cleared some space around the pot and enveloped the area in chaos flame. Chaos flame wouldn\u2019t be extinguished unless I wished for it, and it wasn\u2019t just hot; it was scorching! Seeing the water boil, I became satisfied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re using a flame that could kill an SS ranked dungeon\u2019s boss to boil water\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t say that Walker when you\u2019re using that flame to warm your body.\u201d</p><br/><p>With all the training expeditions I went with father, I had become a master of making ramen. Even while boiling 10 packs, I could maintain the noodles\u2019 springy texture. I considered it a marvelous talent! Soon, when we were gathered around the Ice Castle\u2019s underground corridor and eating ramen\u2026</p><br/><p>We sensed someone\u2019s presence.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you\u2026 going to eat that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya and I turned around with noodles in our mouth.</p><br/><p>There, we saw the Witch of Silver Ice.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>It\u2019s unknown whether Russia/France\u2019s SS rankers are male or female as gender-neutral pronouns are used.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

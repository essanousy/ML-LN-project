Second Season (2)</p><br/><p>Of course, I didn\u2019t just march straight into the dungeon. I had to see the guild members, and more importantly, I had to hold a funeral for Ren\u2019s father, whose corpse was in my inventory. Daisy drooled after hearing that I had a Hero\u2019s corpse, but there was no way I could let her use a friend\u2019s father as an undead. However, I still promised her that I\u2019d get her a similar corpse one day.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrevious Hero\u2026 Strong, warrior\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as we cremated Ren\u2019s father, Daisy murmured with regret. It was slightly scary.</p><br/><p>As Lebuik and the children had to be at the funeral, it couldn\u2019t be held at the dungeon\u2019s Residential Area or the resort area. In the end, we gathered others who wanted to come and held the funeral at a nearby mountain. As it would be hard to explain if an ordinary person saw us, I had Hwaya cast magic to prevent people from approaching the mountain. Naturally, Hwaya became the first to hear about what happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d defeat a world\u2019s enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe conditions were favorable. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya lightly smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m extremely curious. Who knows, maybe it\u2019ll help us deal with the danger Earth is facing. Tell me about it in detail when we\u2019re alone later. Along with a drink, of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything special\u2026 but sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although only people unrelated to Panan continent didn\u2019t have to come, all of Revival\u2019s members attended the funeral. It was partly to meet Ren, who was the newest member. When the female members saw the little children, they were all extremely elated.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at those rabbit ears.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s shaking. I want to hug her\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo cute!\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, with their overwhelming affection, the children got scared and hid behind Ren, Lebuik, and me. Though there was a little accident where Ina who came running toward me almost froze Elfa accidentally, everything else went smoothly. Ren could send his father off, which I was sure would serve as a good way to affirm his resolve.</p><br/><p>Going back to Ina, as she was about the same age as the children from the Panan continent, she had a little conflict with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy, who are they? Daddy\u2019s Ina\u2019s!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy isn\u2019t Ina\u2019s. Also, they\u2019re friends from the Panan continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy? Shin oppa is a daddy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has to be a lie! They don\u2019t have the same hair color!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing how Ina called me Daddy, Elfa perked up her rabbit ears and asked, while the other children stared at Ina and me surprised. Ina puffed her cheeks and put her arms around mu neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cIna is Daddy\u2019s daughter!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yeah\u2026 Ina is my daughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>It felt a bit weird saying it, but there was no other choice. I didn\u2019t want to provoke Ina\u2019s trauma. I patted Ina, who was stuck to me like a Koala, and announced to the others that I was her father. Seeing the surprised children jumping up and down while flapping their ears, I wanted to die.</p><br/><p>After that, the funeral ended. I did catch Daisy trying to put her hands on the ashes, but we managed to clean everything up. After that, the problem was where Ren and the children would stay. As they couldn\u2019t all live in my house, we decided to simply buy a house near ours.</p><br/><p>When Lebuik realized that Ren and the eight children would live by themselves in a house, she came up to me with a look of determination.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to enter your guild.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to live with Ren?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s written all over your face!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although her motives were impure, it wasn\u2019t a bad idea to have a woman in the house, especially with Ren being insensitive about certain things. Like they say, the more the merrier. Furthermore, she was a skilled First Dungeon explorer on the 69th floor. After a bit of talking, Lebuik left the Demonic Girls guild and joined mine.</p><br/><p>Only after that did I feel like everything was taken care of. I had to spoil Ludia and Ina as I hadn\u2019t seen them for a while, but that was it.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, you came to climb the dungeon right away?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to my short reply, Loretta made a serious expression. Then, she said something that really didn\u2019t match her expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, congratulations on defeating the world\u2019s enemy of Panan continent. That is truly a great achievement. It\u2019s not something you can disclose carelessly, but at least the dungeon\u2019s administrators all know about it. Especially the ol\u2026 Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks. So\u2026 when will you let go of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>At my question, Loretta strengthened her grip on my wrists and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Shin-nim, you have to be careful. Not all world\u2019s enemies are the same. Don\u2019t think that Earth\u2019s problems can be solved as easily as the Panan continent\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ll stay with Loretta for an hour before I go. Happy?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a complete non-sequitur, but it seemed to have been the correct answer. Loretta immediately let go of my wrists and smiled brightly. She dragged me along to a table, sat down, and tapped on the seat next to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen sit here and tell everything that happened!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhehe, hurry!\u201d</p><br/><p>From then, I had to wait 3 hours before I could go up to the 59th floor. Since I ended up getting the Queen Elf\u2019s Blessing, I wasn\u2019t particularly unsatisfied. Of course, I didn\u2019t do any other strange things. Yup.</p><br/><p>After breaking through the 59th floor, which only had an increased number of golems, in 2 hours, I immediately entered Beyond\u2019s 9th floor. Each floor of Beyond was bigger than the previous. Without Mana Detection, it was practically impossible to advance onward. Of course, Mana Detection was something one naturally learned the first time one entered Beyond.</p><br/><p>\u201cKugyaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuman, see the power of Lizard Knight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m happy to see you guys too.\u201d</p><br/><p>After fighting annoying enemies like the Mana Eater and El Patiz, seeing Dark Ratmen and Lizard Knights gave me a sense of comfort. Feeling such things in Beyond, I felt depressed like I\u2019d taken the wrong road somewhere. Now, even if two hundred Orc Lords appeared at the same time, I felt like I could deal with them without a change in my facial expression.</p><br/><p>[You cleared Beyond\u2019s 1st floor. You obtained the qualification to challenge the dungeon\u2019s 60th floor.]</p><br/><p>[Your maximum HP and MP increase by 2%. You obtained 5 bonus stats.]</p><br/><p>[Experience has been added to skills you frequently used to progress through Beyond\u2019s 9th floor.]</p><br/><p>[High-rank Provoke became level 7! Your existence itself is a provocation. Perhaps, even lifeless objects might get angry and attack you.]</p><br/><p>[Wind King\u2019s Rage became level 3! Damage increase per monster increases to 15%, and the maximum amplification increases to 200%.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After decimating hundreds of Dark Ratmen and Lizard Knight with Crimson Roar, I let out a satisfied sigh and checked the message window. It was now time for the 60th floor. After I defeat the Floor Master, Ren\u2019s thrashing phase would begin. Thinking about how much Ren will grow, a smile bloomed on my face.</p><br/><p>At that moment, someone sent me a message. Though I flinched, thinking Ren somehow found out what I was thinking and messaged me about it, it wasn\u2019t Ren. The message was from someone I couldn\u2019t remember when I had added him to my friend list.</p><br/><p>[Oi, the armor\u2019s finished.]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll come right away!]</p><br/><p>The moment I saw Lin\u2019s message, I left Beyond through the gate and rushed to the Residential Area. I felt like someone was off while I was breaking through the 59th floor and Beyond\u2019s 9th floor. I didn\u2019t have my armor! I was wondering why it hurt so much when I got hit!</p><br/><p>When I arrived at Fairy Garden, instead of going to Loretta\u2019s cabin like I usually did, I asked around and headed to Lin\u2019s workshop. As expected of a vice-guild master\u2019s workshop, although it looked like it ruined Fairy Garden\u2019s natural beauty, no one paid any attention to it.</p><br/><p>In Fairy Garden, where everything looked natural, Lin\u2019s workshop was the lone modern building that ruined the environment. A chimney that spewed out black smoke and extreme heat that could be felt all around the building, only after seeing Lin\u2019s workshop did I picture Lin as a blacksmith.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you came here quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin greeted me with a loose well-ventilating clothing and a cigarette in his mouth. Next to him was a new armor in a bracelet-form like the Crimson Dragon Scale Armor. Interestingly, this one was jet-black.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s made out of the materials you brought me. Just because I\u2019m a descendant of a red dragon, it doesn\u2019t mean everything I make has to be red.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that makes sense\u2026 Well, thanks, Lin. You did all this for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for you. It\u2019s for noonim, tsk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin flicked away the cigarette ashes and murmured curses. However, he seemed to be making a satisfactory smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you like Loretta?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up and take the armor. Thanks to my outstanding skills, it turned out better than what\u2019s possible from the materials.\u201d</p><br/><p>Did I hit the mark? But he plays around with other women too freely for that to be true\u2026 Maybe, it\u2019s something like respect and admiration rather than passion. Though Fairy Garden\u2019s inner workings seemed to be complicated, since it wasn\u2019t any of my business, I just took the black bracelet and examined it.</p><br/><p>[Pure Black Desire (Legend)</p><br/><p>Durability \u2013 Indestructible</p><br/><p>Defense \u2013 7,500</p><br/><p>Equipment Requirement \u2013 Kang Shin</p><br/><p>Option \u2013 All stats +30. Decreases damage taken from all basic attacks by 50%. Decreases damage taken from all attack skills from 30%. Chance of receiving a critical hit increases by 50%, but chance of dealing a critical hit increases by 200%. When using a charge type attack, \u2018Desire Thorn\u2019 activates. When using any attack skills, \u2018Sacrifice\u2019 can be used. When HP falls below 10%, \u2018Devourer\u2019 activates once per day.</p><br/><p>Desire Thorn \u2013 Can be activated once per day while using a charge type attack. Countless number of thorns shoots out from the armor, absorbing the HP from enemies hit by the thorns. The amount of HP absorbed is half the damage dealt. As such, the targets will end up receiving 50% more damage.</p><br/><p>Sacrifice \u2013 Usable with any attack skill. Receives half of the skill\u2019s damage, but doubles the skill\u2019s effect. The damage received by Sacrifice cannot drop your HP under 10%.</p><br/><p>Devourer \u2013 After choosing a target, all attacks done absorbs a portion of the target\u2019s HP to recover your own. However, overabsorbing the target\u2019s HP may cause mutations to your body. This change can be purified by highest-grade holy magic or Elixir.]</p><br/><p>\u201cLegend!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, I upgraded your cape to Legend too. Do you not want it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want it! Give it to me now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Two Legend-grade equipment! I feel like I can conquer the dungeon\u2019s 100th floor right now!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Crimson Chaotic Spear (5)</p><br/><p>[You entered the Event Dungeon, \u2018Insect World.\u2019]</p><br/><p>\u201cHiiiiiiik!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the message rang out, Hwaya screamed and jumped at me. Feeling the sudden warm touch and the sweet scent, I looked down at Hwaya blankly. At the same time, the others, who were also looking at me blankly, said with cheerful voices.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be able to expect help from Hwaya, but let\u2019s do our best!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaughter, spiders aren\u2019t insects. You won\u2019t see them here, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAjusshi, I\u2019m bad with both spiders and insects\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yep, I knew she\u2019d say that\u2026 I couldn\u2019t help but sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya, I understand how you\u2019re feeling, but this is an SS ranked dungeon. Without you, we\u2019ll be in danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, sorry\u2026 I\u2019ll try my best.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t even run into any monsters yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long are you guys going to stick together!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Hwaya not getting off after saying she\u2019d do her best, Ludia raised her eyebrows. With a bitter smile, I slowly separated from Hwaya and turned around.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll go survey the area on Lotte\u2026 Lotte?\u201d</p><br/><p>[This Event Dungeon prevents monsters with strong mana from entering. Tamed monster, \u2018Lotte,\u2019 could not enter the dungeon.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just one thing after another.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Plene wasn\u2019t strong enough for an SS ranked dungeon, I sent her back. Lotte, on the other hand, could raise my strength by twofold just by being with me. Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t enter the dungeon. She probably won\u2019t be in any danger outside, but without her, we might be in danger.</p><br/><p>No, that was the old me. My stats were increasing by the day, and I had also learned Mad Typhoon. Even before that, my companions and I defeated the SS+ ranked Flame Drake. There was no reason we couldn\u2019t clear this dungeon with our current strength. It wasn\u2019t good to underestimate ourselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cT.K., what\u2019s up with her? What is she scared of all of the sudden\u2026 Insect?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you\u2019ll understand soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I answered Pepper, the ground fissured, almost as if a secret base was hidden underneath. Then, a black head emerged from it. It seemed like the head of an ant, only magnified thousands of times.</p><br/><p>Hwaya then jumped on me again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I might not be able to do it. Can I just stay like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>While I shouted at Hwaya, father charged forward with his spear. His spear vibrated strongly as shockwaves gathered around it. The ant discovered father and pointed its giant head, creepy eyes and annoying antennae at father. Then\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMen!\u201d[1. In Kendo, this is what you yell when you strike the helmet/head area]</p><br/><p>\u201cI know how you\u2019re feeling, but you\u2019re a spearman, father!\u201d</p><br/><p>Father struck his spear down vertically at the ant\u2019s head. Surprisingly, the ant easily received father\u2019s spear with its hard carapace. Even as its head grinded against father\u2019s vibrating spear, not even a scratch appeared on it. It really had an incredibly powerful integument.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, father didn\u2019t back down and shot out even more powerful shockwaves. He was probably the best in the world in bypassing his enemy\u2019s powerful outer defense and attacking its internal system. The ant twitched for a moment before its head exploded and shot out its bodily fluid.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Because the terrified Hwaya blocked the bodily fluid with her flames, it didn\u2019t splash on us. On the other hand, father looked like he had gone swimming in a pool of it. He didn\u2019t seem to mind at all, as he gave us a thumbs up.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see that, son!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, father. It was a perfect battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>I inattentively complimented father, when Ye-Eun suddenly hushed us by putting her index finger over her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s coming here in large numbers, Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn large numbers?\u201d</p><br/><p>I promptly focused on the tremor of the ground and the presence of mana. There really were enemies gathering here in large numbers. The problem was that they weren\u2019t just coming from land.</p><br/><p>When I looked up, it was exactly as I expected. I could see a black cloud swarming toward us. That was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cA swarm of locusts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuk\u2026 Kyaaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, Hwaya couldn\u2019t overcome her fear of insects and exploded. The scarlet flames she shot out pulsed like waves and swept over the swarm of locusts heading toward us.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come, don\u2019t come, don\u2019t comeeeee!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGirls who hate insects are scary\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I inadvertently nodded my head at Walker\u2019s murmuring. An indescribably vast scale of flames \u2013one that I had never seen before\u2013 began to burn the locusts that numbered close to a disaster. Each of the locusts that died crashed on the ground, ringing a large thud. At the same time, a spicy fragrance spread out, and I had to stop my drooling father.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are others coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun shouted hurriedly. Damn it, I had briefly forgotten about it because Hwaya\u2019s attack was so overwhelming! I could feel countless presences from the ground as well. The moment I realized, I stuck my spear into the ground and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThunder Wave!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kiaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>[Kashakashakasha\u2026.]</p><br/><p>The damned insects sang in response to my lightning attack. No, please stop\u2026 You\u2019re giving me goosebumps!</p><br/><p>Just like the ant we initially killed, they appeared from within the earth. Most of them were ants, but there were also beetles, worms, and larvae. I didn\u2019t think insects were that creepy but seeing them magnified thousands of times, I could undoubtedly say they were one of the most frightening and creepy monsters I met.</p><br/><p>After Hwaya saw them, she began to shake.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2019m scared, Shin. I\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing great, Hwaya. Just focus on burning the locusts. I\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yeah, g-got it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya tightly shut her eyes. Meanwhile, the others were killing the insects in their own ways.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! I didn\u2019t think there were monsters who could survive a bullet from my Desert Eagle! How fun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO Earth, punish the creatures who stole thy blessings and defied thy providence!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re tough! But they aren\u2019t looking at me even when I hit them!\u201d</p><br/><p>At Ye-Eun\u2019s words, I looked around. No matter how much my companions attacked them, the insects ignored them and were charging to a particular place. It seemed their target was\u2026 my father.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha, come at me! I, Kang Yungoong-nim, will take you on!\u201d</p><br/><p>Father shouted a line from a 90\u2019s movie and faced the incoming insects. His shockwave ability was an extremely good match against the insects, as it destroyed the insects\u2019 insides.</p><br/><p>What was the difference between father and the other party members? It was obvious. Father was covered with the bodily fluid of the ant he killed. Plus, he was being updated in real-time with other insects\u2019 bodily fluids.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, you need to wash yourself off! The ant\u2019s bodily fluid is attracting the insects!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we have to kill them all anyways!? Why don\u2019t you get covered in it too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, that\u2019s exactly what I thought you\u2019d say!\u201d</p><br/><p>If father volunteered to take the aggro, it was the duty of a good son to make use of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather said he\u2019ll bait them on his own! Ludia and Pepper, reduce the number of insects coming from afar! All the close-ranged attackers, stay near father and attack the insects! Ah, Shuna, you stay and protect Hwaya, Ludia, and Pepper!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood idea!\u201d</p><br/><p>After explaining our strategy, I took Hwaya off of me and gave her to Shuna. Then, I shot forward with my spear. Peika was already infused in my spear and flickering with lighting. As I surged up the power of Peruta Circuit, a whirlpool began to form. I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yay, it\u2019s been a while since I materialized.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to use a skill. Will you be able to run?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yeah!]</p><br/><p>I immediately jumped on Ruyue\u2019s back. As Ruyue ran forward, I thought, \u2018There were just too many of these insects. Not even mentioning the swarm of locusts covering the sky, there were hundreds of insects coming toward us.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hundreds of SS ranked monsters! What a\u2026 What an enjoyable battle!</p><br/><p>I immediately activated Gale Track. With the increased speed, I instantly sent a beetle in front of me flying.</p><br/><p>\u201cOraaaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>Every time I sent an insect flying, Ruyue accelerated and the charge became stronger. With the effect of the armor and tattoo, our charge was already amplified by 110%. Every time we sent an insect flying, it was rising by an additional 7%. After the tenth insect, the insects\u2019 bodies began to explode just by making contact with my spear. I freely changed the trajectory of the charge and killed the insects. If you wanted to defeat Revival, defeat Kang Shin with just this much, you were gravely mistaken!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaaaaaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>I let out a spirited shout, realizing that Gale Track\u2019s power had reached its peak. In other words, we had already sent over 30 insects flying.</p><br/><p>My original strength was amplified by Gale Track, which was then amplified by 110%, and was then amplified by another 200%. Although I would have been stronger if I was on Lotte, there was no reason to discuss what could have been. I was glad that Ruyue was here.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you, a tank!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, he\u2019s so strong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO Earth, protect him from injuries!\u201d</p><br/><p>How many insects did I kill? After running wild in the front line for a while, I suddenly felt the earth trembling. I could only imagine that the second wave of insects was coming.</p><br/><p>I took care of the insects nearby and got ready for Gale Track\u2019s final blow. Wind energy gathered and strengthened Mad Typhoon.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, I\u2019ll send the leading monster flying\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>I held my spear tightly and adjusted my stance. I was prepared to kill any monster with one blow.</p><br/><p>Then, it shot up from the ground. A head with a terrifying horn, a leg like a crimson thorn, a segment, a leg, a segment, a leg, a segment, a leg\u2026 I couldn\u2019t help but shout.</p><br/><p>\u201cA centipede! Hey, you\u2019re not an insect!\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn, if you\u2019re going to do this, name yourself Bug World, not Insect World! Now that I thought about it, I felt like there were non-insects in the ones I already killed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that guy getting caught up on the wrong things?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-That\u2019s what\u2019s cute about him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI got it, Flame Witch, but you open your eyes and say that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDie, you stupid arthropods!\u201d</p><br/><p>I placed my rage in my spear and released its storm on the centipede. The centipede that had finally appeared was instantly blown into pieces, dying without even completely pulling itself out of the earth. Just the part that was outside was well over 20 meters long. By the looks of it, not even half of it was out of the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like it\u2019s a semi-boss monster.\u201d</p><br/><p>I placed my hand on the centipede\u2019s severed head and placed it in my inventory. Checking with Mana Detection, around the third segment, I noticed\u2026 a Mana Stone. Good, the Mana Stone of an SS ranked dungeon\u2019s semi-boss! This is what makes dungeon runs exciting!</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys, there\u2019s something other than locusts flying here!\u201d</p><br/><p>While I was drunk on the feeling of victory, Pepper\u2019s rather tranquil voice rang out. Something other than locusts? I raised my head and looked at the sky Pepper was pointing toward. I could really see another swarm of insects that weren\u2019t locusts. I inadvertently cursed out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cGod damn Asian giant hornets!\u201d[2. Google it. These guys are vicious and quite famous in Asian culture for being able to kill people. Every year, in Japan, they kill 30-40 people]</p><br/><p>It seemed the fight would only get worse from here. I heard Asian giant hornets could kill humans, but those guys were enlarged thousands of times. That\u2019s\u2026 cheating! The biggest cheat was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastards don\u2019t even live in America!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ignoring my shouts, the Asian Giant Hornets flew toward us like arrows. It was the start of a second round.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Next chapter, we\u2019ll finish the dungeon boss and start the Event Raid! The chapter after that, we\u2019ll finish the Event Raid and head to Russia\u2019s SS rank dungeon\u2026 maybe\u2026</p><br/><p>PS \u2013 I plan on holding a character popularity contest soon. One contest for all the characters and one with just the heroines. Finally, a contest\u2026 for whether the ending should be harem or not! (This isn\u2019t a popularity contest per se but I\u2019ll do it anyway!) This contest can affect how the series will end (since I haven\u2019t decided on it yet, especially the third contest), so please join in! I\u2019ll do it around ch160 or 170!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>We\u2019re doing the same contest! Although it won\u2019t matter in terms of how to story will progress (heh). I\u2019ll do it whenever the author does it, hehehe.</p><br/><p>Editor\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>My heart is eternally in favour of Loretta. (Uncreative)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

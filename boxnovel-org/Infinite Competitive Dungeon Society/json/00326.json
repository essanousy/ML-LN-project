As he had gotten stronger while toiling with Revival\u2019s members, I knew he would do just fine.</p><br/><p>After sending Paul off, I went down to the training room. As expected, Father and Sumire were sparring. I waited until their spar ended to reveal my presence.</p><br/><p>Sumire stabbed her spear into the ground and leaned against it to catch her breath. When she saw me, she jumped up in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cS-Shin-nim! You were here!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. You sure are improving fast. I\u2019m happy to see you\u2019re trying hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>While embarrassed, Sumire couldn\u2019t hide her happiness. But Father, who was standing next to her, clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no way to woo a woman. Instead of exchanging your spears, you should take her out for tea or something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSumire\u2019s my disciple\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I retorted back at his nonsense, as I immediately went up to spar with Father. Leaving mana and skills aside, we fought purely with our physical strength and spear technique. As Father was also high up in the dungeon, his physical strength was suitably great. As he was the one who taught me spearmanship, his spear technique didn\u2019t need to be explained either.</p><br/><p>But of course, I was now much stronger than him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMonster\u2026 I gave birth to a monster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t give birth to anyone, Father. It was Mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although we only sparred for a short five minutes, Father fell to the ground covered in sweat. I then turned towards Sumire, whose eyes were sparkling with excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s see how much you improved.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Shin-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Sumire\u2019s style was different than Father\u2019s, sparring with her was more fun. Attacking with her spear and defending with her shield. However, her offense and defense weren\u2019t limited to these obvious methods. If the chance arrived, she freely attacked with her shield and defended with her spear.</p><br/><p>Her shield technique was in a realm I couldn\u2019t offer any advice on, and she was firmly establishing her one-handed spear technique style. Thankfully, I could still help her in this aspect, and I helped her fix several problems throughout our spar.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for this match! Shin-nim really is amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say that to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Second Master is amazing too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks\u2026 So Son, when are you going to the dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter swinging my spear a couple times, and if possible, after seeing Hwaya and Ina. I\u2019m planning on clearing Beyond\u2019s 39th floor, First Dungeon\u2019s 90th floor, and Beyond\u2019s 40th floor in one go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father nodded, then spoke firmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy new daughter has been busy with Ciara recently. You should go to Earth if you can.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Got it.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I gave Sumire a glance, she nodded without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems Unni is trying to predict the next wave of Event Dungeons.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, that was one of the most important tasks. I wanted to head to Earth immediately, but because what I said about swinging my spear a couple times made Sumire look at me with eyes full of expectation, I had to carry it out with a bitter smile. It was the purely physical technique that I had gotten fairly used to by now.</p><br/><p>Of course, if I really concentrated all of my power, the guild house would crumble, so I had to hold back.</p><br/><p>Sumire began to call me Takemikazuchi and seemed ready to ask me to show it one more time until the end of the night. Thankfully, I managed to get away from her and return to Earth after showing her a few more times.</p><br/><p>When I entered the guild house on Earth, I heard a clacking sound in the kitchen and a smelled a sweet aroma. When I entered the kitchen thinking someone else other than Hwaya and Ciara was here, I found a rather unexpected sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cIna, don\u2019t eat that yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we waiting for Daddy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to put it on the cake. Wash it clean and chop it. You can do it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya was moving around busily in an apron. The source of the sweet aroma was a cake batter full of sugar, which Hwaya was swirling.</p><br/><p>I rubbed my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cMommy, when is Daddy coming?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSumire said she\u2019d hold him back. If we fail, we have to make it again, so hopefully Sumire will do a good job\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes Daddy like cakes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin eats everything. Apparently, he likes sweet things the most. Yungoong Ajusshi\u2026 Father said so, so it must be true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya had an extremely bright expression. She looked especially cute when she smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, I\u2019ll show him I can do it too! Since it\u2019ll be a joint attack with Ina, he won\u2019t be able to withstand it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIna\u2019s attacking Daddy with Mommy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to attack his heart with this cake. Ina likes it too when Father\u2019s happy, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, don\u2019t cut grape seeds! How did you even cut it!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI froze it and split it in half. I\u2019m good, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>After watching until this part, I silently left. The past me might have barged in to see Hwaya\u2019s flustered face, but now, the first thing I thought of was to let myself be surprised. But will I be able to act naturally? That was the only thing in my mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, looks like I\u2019ll have to take Hwaya failing into account and go to the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>I could also feel Ciara\u2019s presence in the guild house. Sumire probably wasn\u2019t lying when she said Ciara was trying to predict the next wave of dungeons. Once I came back, I would be able to hear about the result.</p><br/><p>Humming happily, I headed to the dungeon. Even while breaking through Beyond\u2019s 39th floor filled with Death Knights and Vampire Lords, I couldn\u2019t be more light-hearted.</p><br/><p>[A challenger.]</p><br/><p>[A challenger really appeared.]</p><br/><p>Past a certain point, monsters in Beyond were all shocked when they saw me. It wasn\u2019t because I was strong, it was just because I made it here.</p><br/><p>[He\u2019s trying to go higher.]</p><br/><p>[Envy is driving me on. Let\u2019s make that man kneel down in despair.]</p><br/><p>[Our swords hold our resentment from being left without a choice. Are you strong enough to accept them?]</p><br/><p>\u201cStop being so noisy and just come.\u201d</p><br/><p>I pointed my spear towards them and ignited chaos flames on its tip. Beyond was long. If I walked through it as though it was a park, I would need several days to go through it. I had to use Divine Speed constantly to break through in a day.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys can\u2019t give me what I want anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>[This magic power\u2026!]</p><br/><p>[H-How can a human possess such an overwhelming magic power!]</p><br/><p>I kicked off the ground. Chaos flames rose up after sucking in my magic power and shot towards the Vampire Lords and Death Knights. Chaos flames scorched everything it touched. Although a few lucky Death Knights managed to dodge the flames, when they tried to attack me with their swords carrying death aura, Steel simply sucked in their auras.</p><br/><p>[What!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for the death energy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The powers I had all worked well together. Absolute Soul and Crimson Hell\u2019s power, and now Steel\u2019s Extort. They stole mana from anything and anyone that attacked me and made it mine in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can have it back.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Back? Kuaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>Without integrating the absorbed mana, I directed it to my spear and stuck it inside the monsters in front of me. Attacking all enemies with fast consecutive stabs, it was Lightning Spear Storm.</p><br/><p>As expected of monsters in Beyond\u2019s 39th floor, the Death Knights and Vampire Lords had high magic power and defense. However, there simply wasn\u2019t anything they could do against me. Any monster that appeared in front of me turned into particles of light and disappeared thereafter.</p><br/><p>[You dare insult the knights who rule over death!? I will show you the true power of death!]</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, go ahead!\u201d</p><br/><p>Death Knights began to form a magic circle using their death energy.</p><br/><p>[Come, Swords of Death!]</p><br/><p>\u201cLame!\u201d</p><br/><p>Though that was what I said, the swords they summoned were quite good. It seemed they had to consume their death energy permanently to make them, but they attacked their enemy without having to be held by the Death Knights.</p><br/><p>As there were many Death Knights, the number of swords flying around numbered several hundred! As they also used their special skill, Death Collection, I couldn\u2019t tell whether these guys were knights or sword collectors!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s still nowhere close to being enough! Show me more! Don\u2019t tell me this is all you can do with death energy?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaa, fine, we will!]</p><br/><p>When I mocked the Death Knights\u2019 power, they became enraged and began to pour one black magic after the other.</p><br/><p>[Curse of Death!]</p><br/><p>[Curse of Madness!]</p><br/><p>[Curse of Pestilence!]</p><br/><p>As expected of death energy, it could form many different kinds of curses. I looked intently at the magic circles they drew and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAny other curses?\u201d</p><br/><p>[How can you be fine after taking all these curses!?]</p><br/><p>A Death Knight asked in shock. I nodded and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m immune to curses.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Bastard!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that was a good lesson. Thanks!\u201d</p><br/><p>When dense death energy flowed into my spear, the Death Knights flinched and stepped backwards. Using my spear, I drew a giant magic circle in the air.</p><br/><p>[No way\u2026!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes way.\u201d</p><br/><p>[He can wield death energy!]</p><br/><p>From the black magic circle I drew, many greatswords began to pop out. Although the Death Knights lacked the death energy to summon more than a couple swords at once, I was different. I possessed so much death energy that I had to compress it multiple times.</p><br/><p>As I was generous with the death energy I used, several hundred greatswords popped out of the magic circle and hovered above the air. I then added Dortu\u2019s power into the swords. Be it Death Knights or Vampire Lords, they couldn\u2019t shut their mouths watching this scene.</p><br/><p>[This\u2026 crazy\u2026!]</p><br/><p>[Didn\u2019t you guys teach him!?]</p><br/><p>[Shut it, you annoying mosquitos!]</p><br/><p>In the end, they began to fight among themselves. I leisurely shot my greatswords at them with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, now, if you have anything else you haven\u2019t shown, please do so now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Two hours afterwards, after learning all the ways that Death Knights used death energy in, I freed them for eternity. I then left Beyond\u2019s 39th floor. It was now time to eat cake!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

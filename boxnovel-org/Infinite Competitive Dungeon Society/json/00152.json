Crimson Chaotic Spear (2)</p><br/><p>Japan didn\u2019t have any S+ ranked gates, but it did have three S ranked gates. In addition, it had eleven dungeons ranked A or below. Although it was less than Korea, considering there were only about 200 Event Dungeons left scattered through Earth, Japan strangely had a lot of Event Dungeons. Right, similar to Korea, Japan had unnaturally many Event Dungeons.</p><br/><p>Because of what happened in Korea, the media portrayed us as a lawless group. What was interesting was the reaction of the civilians when we neared an Event Dungeon.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoa! Holy shit, it\u2019s Dragon Knight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe came to Japan first!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake good care of us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Most of the people that saw us were cheering us on. I was rather bewildered by their unexpected reaction, but I soon realized why.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo them, this place is their home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImagine that a dungeon appeared in your backyard, and the only weapon and defensive equipment you had was a kitchen knife and a chopping board.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t that happen often? It\u2019s like that whenever you\u2019re cooking and suddenly forced into battle. Ah, for the record, you\u2019re better off bare-handed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one holding the knife and the chopping board isn\u2019t a monster like you, but an ordinary civilian! Of course, you\u2019d be better off with a knife than just your fists!\u201d</p><br/><p>To ordinary people, monsters were only targets of terror. Plus, Event Dungeons appeared wherever they wanted. They could be in the middle of desserts or heavily populated areas.</p><br/><p>When dungeons became Field Dungeons, the government would aid the original residents, but it didn\u2019t change the fact that they would have to move away or live with monsters right in front of them. Both options were extremely stressful. Since someone volunteered to get rid of the dungeons, it made sense that they were so happy.</p><br/><p>Just like that, we cleared our first dungeon with an unexpected welcome. After eating a late breakfast in a nearby restaurant, I went to get Lotte back, as she had gone back to the dungeon during our flight here. When I came back, Hwaya approached me with a piece of paper.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, I planned out our route. If we\u2019re lucky, we should be able to take care of all of the dungeons other than the S ranked dungeons. But, we have to ride your wyvern instead of my plane.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I refuse!]</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, Lotte?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Mmmm\u2026!]</p><br/><p>When I scratched Lotte\u2019s neck and pleaded, she elongated her neck and began to contemplate. Hwaya made a dumbfounded expression, but I silenced her by giving her a thumbs up. Then, I scratched Lotte\u2019s neck more. It was a special technique of mine. If ordinary people tried, they would only have their fingers broken.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do it, right? Hwaya only says that because she knows you\u2019re much faster than a plane.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Mmm\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cLotte, you\u2019re the only one I can rely on. You\u2019ll let us ride you, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[F-Fine\u2026 Since it\u2019s Hero\u2019s request, I\u2019ll allow the inept humans to ride me.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Lotte!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Mm, scratch me more, Hero.]</p><br/><p>[Shin, you\u2019ve gotten pretty used to handling women, haven\u2019t you\u2026?]</p><br/><p>[I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d call Lotte a woman, Hwaya.]</p><br/><p>Since we were in the middle of a city, we naturally caught the attentions of countless people. After they recognized Hwaya and me, it became even worse. In any case, I took the paper from Hwaya to memorize the route, when someone called me from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, here!\u201d</p><br/><p>A cute little girl handed a box of chocolate to me. It was similar to the chocolate mushroom snack[1. Note, it\u2019s not actually mushroom flavored or anything. It\u2019s just shaped like one, with the mushroom cap being the chocolate and the root being the cracker.] from Korea. When I took it, the girl smiled and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat this and defeat those monsters!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>To be honest, I was surprised. Not even a day passed since we caused a ruckus in Korea, but even a little girl knew us! As I thought, mass media is scary!</p><br/><p>That aside, I patted her head to thank her for cheering us on.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks. It means a lot. I like this snack too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhehe, I like it too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t have anything to give you\u2026 Ah, do you like meat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! You\u2019re not going to dismantle a monster here, right!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about, Hwaya. Meat is a universally loved food!\u201d</p><br/><p>Because Hwaya jumped in and stopped me, I had to give up on giving the little girl meat. I ended up giving her the cup ramen from my inventory instead, which she happily received.</p><br/><p>After the girl left, the others came out of the restaurant as well. It seemed they were watching the little girl from just now, as Ludia\u2019s expression was\u2026 shaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, you like\u2026 little girls\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d say that, but no. She must have seen me somewhere. She just gave me a snack.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia still looked like she didn\u2019t believe me, but Hwaya grinned and supported me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been awhile since the world began to revolve around monsters and ability users. High-ranking ability users are global superstars. Not to mention, we displayed the flashiest performance. Since Japan\u2019s time isn\u2019t that different from Korea\u2019s, they already had morning and night time news to hear about us. It\u2019s understandable that a little girl like her recognizes Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten famous, Kang Shin. How about writing \u2018Ally of Justice\u2019 on a cape? You\u2019ll be able to appeal to the masses better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou shut up, Walker. We\u2019re just doing what we can. What justice?\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied to Walker\u2019s teasing bluntly. I opened the box of Japanese chocolate mushroom, grabbing a handful and throwing it in my mouth. It was delicious.</p><br/><p>In Korea, we\u2019d already clashed with Guardian once. It served as a show of force, not only to Guardian but also to Freedom Wing and various governments. Although it was a secret plan by the pro-gate destruction faction within Guardian, we\u2019d still sent all of the rankers to the hospital. It was clear that we were unstoppable.</p><br/><p>As for what happened, I presumed it went like this. Within Guardian there were those that agreed with dungeonifying gates, while there were those that disagreed. The former seemed to have the upper hand in the conflict, but when we made a commotion, the gate destruction faction took the chance to crush the other faction. Then, they showed the result to the whole world.</p><br/><p>A conflict between a small number of people, who wanted to destroy the gates, and the Guardian, who wanted to create dungeons to reap benefits. If they could overwhelm us, they could have used us as the sacrificial lamb to calm the voices of dissent. Guardian was the world\u2019s protector. They would push the narrative that we were terrorists, and they would relate our cause to the act of terror as well.</p><br/><p>Although it was absurd, the victors always had the stronger voice, while the losers could not say anything even if they were blamed for crimes they didn\u2019t commit.</p><br/><p>However, Guardian lost thoroughly. It was exactly what the gate destruction faction wanted. The pro-dungeonification faction lost in physical strength and they also lost their cause through my interview. Could they stop us again in such a situation?</p><br/><p>The reason Guardian was bigger than Freedom Wing was that it was an organization created to protect ordinary civilians from the monsters. Now that their claim that dungeonifying gates would protect humanity crumbled, they had no means to stop us.</p><br/><p>Even so, they wouldn\u2019t be able to do a complete 180 and start destroying dungeons ranked A or below. If they did, it would be the same as bowing down to Revival, which only consisted of 8 members. In the end, the only thing they could do was to leave us alone. They would pretend not to care no matter what we did and would focus on clearing S ranked gates to show their good side. It was the best way to recover their image.</p><br/><p>What I didn\u2019t expect was how glorified we were. I clearly told the representative from Korea\u2019s Guardian that I would cheaply sell the monster corpses ranked A or below. However, he had announced this grandly. In other words, we became Santa Claus, who got rid of various countries\u2019 gates and gave them monster remains. In a way, it wasn\u2019t wrong.</p><br/><p>At first, I was unhappy that he made such a big deal out of it, but we didn\u2019t have much use for low-ranked monster remains anyway. Since his announcement increased our reputation, we also decided to cheaply sell monster corpses to Japan. In truth, it was possible since no one in our group was lacking money.</p><br/><p>Perhaps for that reason, our popularity in Japan reached the heavens. Up until now, the only Asian SS ranker was China\u2019s Xin Shaomei, but Revival had 4 Asians. They especially seemed to like the fact that its leader was Asian. Of course, there were the Korean-hating Japanese who went out of their way to leave hateful comments on every news about us. However, they were only an extreme minority.</p><br/><p>Plus, even though Sumire was hiding half of her face with a mask, people suspected that she was Japanese from her frame and facial structure. Revival\u2019s popularity in Japan was only natural. That said, Sumire was a half, and her frame and facial structure were both different from a traditional Japanese girl\u2019s\u2026 Well, since she was still Japanese, I couldn\u2019t say anything about it.</p><br/><p>After Japan, our dungeon breaking[2. Like dojo breaking] continued to Britain (Brightman was nowhere to be seen), France, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, and other Western Europeans nations, all in just two days. That said, there were only 18 gates in Western Europe. Korea and Japan really did have an unnaturally large number of gates. With how big Russia and China were, they had 23 and 28 gates respectively. Even so, they were relatively few compared to Korea and Japan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we mostly done with Western Europe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOther than Italy, yeah. Though, that could be considered Southern Europe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cItaly\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When I was young, I had visited there with father for training. Of course, back then, surviving and getting stronger were my only goals, so I didn\u2019t visit any tourist attractions. While I was reminiscing about Italy, Hwaya whispered in my ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know that there\u2019s an SS ranker in Italy, right? I heard that person is quite sexy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested\u2026? Besides, France also has an SS ranker, but we didn\u2019t see him. There\u2019s no guarantee that we\u2019ll meet all the SS rankers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the record, the SS ranker is a man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>I became irritated. I don\u2019t know what kind of a crazy person used the word \u2018sexy\u2019 to compliment men, but I didn\u2019t like it! It wasn\u2019t because I was expecting a sexy female ranker! Ludia began glaring at me too!</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder how handsome he is. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I grumbled, Hwaya laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding, so don\u2019t worry about it too much. I\u2019m only focused on a single man right now. I don\u2019t have the leisure to look at other men.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s a funny joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>My face reddened and I turned away. Because Hwaya\u2019s hit and run came at the most unexpected timing, I couldn\u2019t get out of it well. Thankfully, if I just sat in this awkward atmosphere, someone came to take care of it. Who?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too close to Shin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO Earth\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other girls, of course. With a sigh, Hwaya got off.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. Don\u2019t worry, kids. I won\u2019t do any foul play. Anyways, start getting ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>Italian ranker\u2026 I wonder what kind of a person he is. No, I\u2019d rather prefer that I didn\u2019t meet him. Murmuring to myself, I got up. Italy had a S+ ranked Event Dungeon. To be honest, I couldn\u2019t wait to get the S+ ranked dungeon\u2019s rewards. I transformed the choker into a spear and pointed it at the direction of Italy.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go! To Italy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to see the Leaning Tower of Pisa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to see Rome and Firenze!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVenice\u2019s gondola rides! And Undines!</p><br/><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t going there as tourists! And no matter how hard you look, you won\u2019t find any Undines!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-There aren\u2019t Undines?\u201d</p><br/><p>No! If you want to see them, look in Neo-Venezia!</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Japan and Western Europe were taken care of in just one chapter. The chapter title is Crimson Chaotic Spear, but somehow it was only mentioned once towards the end. Oops.</p><br/><p>When I was planning, I created the SS rankers based on countries\u2019 images. There are 4 SS rankers in Western Europe alone\u2026 (2 in Britain, 1 France, 1 Italy). Mmm\u2026 it\u2019s not because I like Western Europe! Definitely!</p><br/><p>PS \u2013 1. The Japanese chocolate mushroom snack is called Kinoko no Yama. It\u2019s from Meiji Dairies Corporation. There\u2019s a high chance it copied Korea\u2019s chocolate mushrooms\u2026 T.T For the record, there\u2019s a similar snack called Take no Ko no Sato by the same company. I heard there is a war between the two snacks to determine who takes the throne (kidding)</p><br/><p>2. Undine, Neo-Venezia: It\u2019s a reference to the famous healing anime, ARIA. More specially, it refers to the city and the boatmen.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

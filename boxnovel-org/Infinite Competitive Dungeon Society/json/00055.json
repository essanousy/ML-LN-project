What It Means to Climb the First Dungeon (2)</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, I heard Fields get created from the 25th floor onward. It was true\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cField?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about that graveyard! It\u2019s the optimal environment to power up undead monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>The instant the words left Ellos\u2019 mouth, dozens of hands began to pop up across the graveyard. These guys had clearly seen some horror movies before. Palludia didn\u2019t seem to want to let it happen, as she took in a deep breath and yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cO Mitarus of justice and love, shine out with holy brilliance in this evil place!\u201d</p><br/><p>The image of her holding her staff and chanting with her silvery voice complimented her appearance, making her look even more beautiful. As I was thinking this, the graveyard, which was darker than usual boss rooms, possibly from the effect of the so-called field, became brighter. The majority of the zombies popping up from the ground screamed like vampires that just saw sunlight and returned to the ground. Palludia looked at me and shrugged her shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, how was it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, I don\u2019t know how to describe it, but it was cool.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUu, Uung\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Palludia flinched at my compliment. Wasn\u2019t that what she expected? Girls were really complicated\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Giant Ghoul is appearing! Paul, Miss Shuna, please!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Palludia and the other magicians struggled to keep up with the dozens of zombies popping out of the ground like daisies, while a gurgling roar rang out from deep inside the graveyard. I first called Peika.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, we\u2019re going to take care of all the zombies. Can you do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Leave it to me, Master! \u2026 I\u2019m going to need a little mana, is that okay?]</p><br/><p>\u201cTake it!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Okay, Chain Lightning!]</p><br/><p>Immediately afterwards, Peika\u2019s body shone and a nearby zombie was swept up in lightning. The lightning then bounced to another zombie near it, then bounced again to other zombies in its surroundings. Strangely, although the lightning was changing its target continuously, it was not losing energy, but gaining it.</p><br/><p>The chain of lightning continued endlessly. It finished off each zombie in just a few seconds and bounced to the next one, expanding further outward. It was like a huge net had been cast over the graveyard. It went without saying that it caught the party members\u2019 attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What\u2019s this!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it lightning magic? But we don\u2019t have a lightning magician in our party!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this is elemental magic. Crown Prince-nim has a lightning elemental.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh right, the archer from Luka continent was an elf. When I glanced at her, she gave me a courteous bow in return. Eh, wasn\u2019t she acting differently than before? She was courteous before, but I could feel awe and respect from her this time.</p><br/><p>[Master, this won\u2019t harm allies!]</p><br/><p>\u201cAllies won\u2019t be harmed, so charge at the ghoul!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, everyone, the zombies\u2019 feet are tied. Now is our chance!\u201d</p><br/><p>At my shout, Ellos directed the party members. Paul and Shuna were already heading towards the ghoul with their shields. Ellos and the other damage dealers followed soon after. The Giant Ghoul that was slowly making his appearance seemed to have become angry at his minions being slaughtered, as he let out another roar and fully revealed himself.</p><br/><p>Unlike the zombies, he had an entirely hardened body. His steel claws shone with a malicious gleam, and his two large eyes showed clear hostility. Slightly over 4 meters tall, the Giant Ghoul came off as incredibly intimidating. In truth, I only remembered ghouls as being frail crybabies. I hoped the Floor Master Giant Ghoul would be a bit different.</p><br/><p>\u201cE-Eit! You stupid monster, come attack me!\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a line from a cartoon for little kids. It was Shuna using Provoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cEit, Eit!\u201d The sight of Shuna pushing on the Giant Ghoul\u2019s legs with her large shield was slightly mismatched with her mature appearance. It was cute. However, the Giant Ghoul seemed to have thought differently, as he lifted his leg and tried to stomp on Shuna. In that instant, Shuna\u2019s eyes sparkled as she tilted her shield slightly. It looked like she had her own way of dealing with it.</p><br/><p>I then turned to face the zombies. Peika\u2019s lightning net had already killed several hundred of them, but more were coming out.</p><br/><p>[Master, these guys keep popping up! I\u2019m annoyed!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re really like cockroaches. Let\u2019s split the work, Peika. You protect the long-ranged damage dealers and healers.\u201d</p><br/><p>I playfully spun the spear in my hand twice, then aimed it forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll protect the guys facing the ghoul. Tempest!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuooooo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince-nim, do you not need any assistance?\u201d</p><br/><p>After I had turned dozens of zombies into pieces of flesh, the elf archer asked me respectfully. Behind her, Baruela was also looking at me. I also saw Palludia glancing at me. You focus on healing Miss Shuna!</p><br/><p>I took out a low-grade Mana Potion and put it in my mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can focus on the Giant Ghoul. Peika will protect you perfectly, and I won\u2019t let the zombies near the other party members.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>After asking Peika to protect them, I shot forward. Seeing the newly popped up zombies heading toward the damage dealers and tanks, I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou half-rotten corpse bastards, come fight me!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You used Provoke. You draw nearby enemies toward you.]</p><br/><p>\u201cGuooooo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuman, arrogant, human\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuoooo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLiving, human\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>My mid-rank Provoke succeeded in drawing the zombies\u2019 attention instantly. These cockroaches were crawling out of the ground even now. Letting out a deep breath, I charged straight forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>The zombies that collided with my spear and armor exploded and flew back. The unintelligent zombies continued to flock to me like moths to a flame, and subsequently were blasted into pieces. After I cleared the zombies in a straight line to the Giant Ghoul, the number of zombies seemed a lot lower.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing. It\u2019s not just his elemental\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince\u2026 So that\u2019s why they call him Crown Prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 O Mitarus!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two archers were talking about me instead of shooting out their arrows, but when Palludia chanted her spell, they snapped out of it and began attacking the Giant Ghoul. Of course, I didn\u2019t really mind no matter what they did.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Giant Ghoul is attacking with his claws!\u201d</p><br/><p>I heard Ellos\u2019 voice echo across the graveyard. At the same time, an air-severing swoosh rang out. When I turned to face the direction it was coming from, the Giant Ghoul was swiping in a cross with both his arms. Poison seeped out from the tips of his claws and tried to envelope the party members. With shocked expressions, they quickly ran around to dodge it.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice, we dodged it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hey, don\u2019t be so proud after dodging such an easy attack! Ah, a follow up!</p><br/><p>\u201cPAUL!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough, I\u2019ll be going first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying the same thing he said 4 years ago, Paul disappeared. He was the first to die 4 years ago, too! What was this feeling of deja vu? That guy, wasn\u2019t he just weak? How could a tank be so slow? Also, why be a tank if you\u2019re going to die in one hit!? Countless questions and annoyed screams resounded in my mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Shuna, will you be fine on your own?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 kyak, worry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the scream worried me, Shuna was holding her ground, possibly thanks to that blessing by her family\u2019s guardian god. Since I couldn\u2019t run to help her at the moment, I set my worries aside. I decided to first focus on taking care of all the zombies.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019m using a lot of potions today.\u201d</p><br/><p>That said, the 300 gold Double Potions were truly delicious. While I was at it, I put one hand on my waist and made a refreshing expression like I was filming a sports drink ad. While I was having my fun, the nearby zombies jumped at me with their claws and teeth. The result was as expected. Their claws and teeth shattered without even leaving a scratch on me.</p><br/><p>Even so, I couldn\u2019t just forgive the perverted zombies for trying to bite my neck. I kicked the zombies here and there. Even my kicks could instantly kill these weaklings.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, was Crown Prince-nim a tank?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe can fill all roles and even wields an elemental. He really is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s because he\u2019s my Master! Isn\u2019t he cool? Isn\u2019t he awesome!?]</p><br/><p>Peika had joined the party members before I noticed and was bragging about me. There was no problem since she turned the zombies around them into ashes, but it was embarrassing, so I hoped she\u2019d stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cO benign Mitarus, become one with my allies!\u201d</p><br/><p>Palludia\u2019s holy chants were especially effective against undead monsters, and had the effect of weakening them. More importantly, it healed Shuna, who was blocking the Giant Ghoul\u2019s attacks with difficulty, and even recovered her stamina.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Ludia!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFocus on your opponent! Reinforcements are coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWarriors, attack! The ghoul\u2019s attacks are blocked. Now\u2019s our chance!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuooooooo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Being in a party raid felt refreshing. Warriors shouted, healers chanted, and party leaders endlessly gave orders. I even felt a bit nostalgic as I remembered our raid from the 5th floor.</p><br/><p>Of course, that was the past, and this was reality. Before I even noticed, two more people had died.</p><br/><p>It was the rapier warrior from Luka continent and a swordsman from Pilos continent. It was just shameful.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, the ghoul is too strong! We can\u2019t even let him scratch us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Shuna, Miss Shuna!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m blocking it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The surviving warriors dodged the ghoul\u2019s attacks with their lives on the line, and Shuna was running around, trying to block the attacks with her large shield. Although she tried her best to draw his aggro, the Giant Ghoul became enraged and changed his target once a damage dealer hit him even once. In that sense, it was more intelligent than any of the Floor Masters from before. He made it much harder for the tank to keep his aggro.</p><br/><p>I reached the conclusion that everyone except Shuna would die if this continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cEllos, switch!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, switch! \u2026Switch?\u201d</p><br/><p>I held up my Black Earthen Spear and swung it horizontally with great force. With Extending Spear, the spear\u2019s range instantly reached 5 meters, and the zombies in the radius of 5 meters all died in a single swing.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, go protect the long-range damage dealers. I\u2019ll handle the Giant Ghoul.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Wait, Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMake use of what you can. Level-up takes priority over your pride, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>At my words, Ellos shut his mouth. He must have realized\u2026</p><br/><p>That I was extremely disappointed in my party members.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

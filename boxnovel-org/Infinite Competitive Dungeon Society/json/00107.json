Those That Climb the Dungeon (6)</p><br/><p>As we strolled through the Residential Area, Loretta received countless gazes from others. Of course, I knew why. At first glance, they would be surprised at Loretta\u2019s appearance; at their second glance, they would be awed by her otherworldly beauty; and at their third glance, she would look even prettier than when they looked at her the first time. That is, as long as she didn\u2019t open her mouth. Loretta ruined her goddess-like appearance by talking like an idiot. Though, that was her charm as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas there an elf like that in the First Dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought the most beautiful explorer was the Luka continent\u2019s crown princess.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, on the higher floors, there\u2019s another famous beauty. From that\u2026 ruined continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s been dozens of years since she made an appearance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, that elf isn\u2019t an explorer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know who she is. She\u2019s the master of one of the administrative guilds. She was so pretty that I remembered it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think she was dating a rookie\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m jealous, damn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were some that realized who Loretta was from her appearance. Most of them looked strong. With a bitter smile, Loretta explained to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are times when I have to make my appearance as the guild master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you actually do your guild master work. Ow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta got angry and smacked my arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a proper guild master! Though it\u2019s Lin\u2019s job now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin said he was a substitute, though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s how everyone becomes the master. Huhu, Lin is actually very suited to be a leader. Lin\u2019s special ability was the only reason why a human like himself could enter Fairy Garden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin isn\u2019t a human, but a draconian\u2026Well, it\u2019s fine. By the way, Loretta, what are you going to do if you stop being a guild master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see, my dream was always to become a housewife! So I\u2019ll become employed to Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d like my partner to be able.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cS-Should I\u2026 continue being a guild master\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta should do what Loretta wants, but I want to marry a woman who actively improves her life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cW-W-Work\u2026 I have to work\u2026 Kuk, but I want to play\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The way Loretta\u2019s ears trembled like she was in deep agony was too cute. However, while I was preoccupied with making fun of Loretta, I accidentally bumped my shoulder into someone. Although my shoulder hurt, I apologized since I was the one at fault for not watching where I was going.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m more surprised that you\u2019re okay after bumping into me. I haven\u2019t seen you before, so you must be a newbie.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the low, silvery voice of a woman. I raised my head. In front of me was a young beauty my height, with most of her figure hidden by a black armor. She was looking at me with eyes of interest.</p><br/><p>Inside her beautiful amber eyes, a pair of unusually sharp and long, vertical pupils left a deep impression on me. They were not the eyes of a human, but those of a beast. As if to wipe away any hint of doubt, two triangular ears were on her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeastman\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so you know. Right, I\u2019m a beastman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeb, let\u2019s go! Saure already ordered our drinks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, you\u2019re walking with me, but you\u2019re looking at other women?\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone who seemed to be her companion called her while Loretta pulled me with her arms linked to mine. The woman replied to her companion that she\u2019d be there in a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou even have an elf girlfriend? You\u2019re doing pretty well, rookie. Let\u2019s hear your name, I\u2019ll remember it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Kang Shin, an explorer from Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lebuik from the guild, \u2018Demonic Girls\u2019. Good luck climbing to the higher floors. I\u2019ll take you out for a drink the next time we meet.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, she waved her hand and turned away. The clunking of her fancy, black armor proved that she was a skilled explorer from a higher floor than mine. Plus, on her back, there was a stupidly large and thick, black claymore, which even I might have trouble carrying.</p><br/><p>Looking at it, I was sure. It wasn\u2019t the time to be shocked about her being a woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you weren\u2019t dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Who said I was dead? Bring me the guy who had the audacity to say that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Right, he must have had the possibility in mind when he asked me. It might have even gone past the point of being a possibility, and he might have even been sure. After all, he wasn\u2019t a complete idiot. If I told him, what would he\u2026</p><br/><p>I spoke, \u201cThere\u2019s an explorer who got famous on the 35th floor. They call him the Golden Lion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGolden Lion? What\u2019s that? Tsk, can anyone be called Golden Lion these days? There\u2019s only one true Golden Lion, the Panan continent\u2019s\u2026 Huu, never mind. Rookie, what is it that you want to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Golden Lion you\u2019re talking about is rushing through the First Dungeon with his own strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Ren-nim is?\u201d</p><br/><p>I was surprised that she addressed him as Ren-nim. While I was imagining what status Ren had, the woman jumped at me. No, she jumped at me but was instantly pushed away. I saw Loretta stepping forward angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to get beaten, customer? Do you? You can\u2019t touch other customers that don\u2019t belong to you. Understand? Do you want to know what Last Bullet tastes like? Do you want to try it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk\u2026 What kind of an elf\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lebuik got up, holding her stomach in pain. There was a crack in her armor. Seeing her ears folded down, she looked especially pitiful.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, who are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m the Floor Shop\u2019s Loretta. Regardless, if you want to ask Shin-nim a question, can you do it without making contact with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFloor Shop? The administrative guild\u2026! Ku, that hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing this strong explorer in pain didn\u2019t feel like someone else\u2019s problem, so I asked her with worrying eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yeah, I\u2019m fine. Anyways, if you know about Ren-nim, can you tell me more about him? I assume Ren-nim is still noble and beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>I had just heard two words that didn\u2019t fit Ren the most.</p><br/><p>In the end, I ended up staying with Lebuik, who was about to head to the bar, a bit longer. Lebuik had two companions, one was a human woman who had called out to her, Zevina (shield warrior). The other was a dwarf woman who had already ordered drinks at the bar, Saure (axe warrior). I wondered if all of her guild members were warriors, but I was told that one of the five members was a priestess. The remaining guild member was a claw warrior. With everyone\u2019s classes being so macho, I was surprised that everyone was female.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, w-what about Ren-nim\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I received a glass, Lebuik asked me impatiently. Her cheeks were bright red. As she didn\u2019t drink anything yet, she was undoubtedly flushed. Feeling a murderous intent toward Ren boiling inside me, I replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cI first met him on the 20th floor. He couldn\u2019t control his temper then and almost died.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, he does have that cute side to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 After that, he stayed with me for a while and fixed his bad habits. In the end, he succeeded in defeating the Lizard Knight alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA-Alone? The Lizard Knight? Kuk, I should have seen it\u2026 Ah, he must have looked so cool.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter that, he continued to climb the dungeon alone and succeeded in defeating all the Floor Masters alone. In the process, he gained some fame from helping other explorers defeat the Floor Masters. He should still be on the 35th floor to get strengthening elixirs from the Floor Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStrengthening elixirs? The thing that only drops occasionally? Wow, I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s grown so much\u2026 He must look incredibly handsome now\u2026 Like a real man\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lebuik\u2019s cat-ears twisted and revealed her confused emotion. Meanwhile, Loretta was confirming information about Ren through my whispers.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, the Ren you\u2019re talking about is that messy-haired customer, who makes people even looking at him feel hot, right? Are you sure that customer isn\u2019t talking about someone else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, to be honest, I was confused about the same thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised. I didn\u2019t think this man named Ren was real. Leb always talks about him when she\u2019s drunk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. Once she starts talking about Ren, she won\u2019t talk about anyone else for the day, so today\u2019s already over.\u201d</p><br/><p>In front of me was the cute dwarf girl Saure. No matter how I looked at her, she looked like an elementary school kid. Seeing her holding a beer mug and hitting it against Zevina, I felt overwhelmed, but I managed to pass it off as I had already gotten used to dwarves from Fairy Garden\u2019s Lotang. Meanwhile, Lebuik\u2019s madness was still continuing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was cute ever since he was little\u2026 When I was sparring with him with wooden swords, he fell down and scraped his knees. He then ran to me with teary eyes\u2026 haak, haak.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt disgusted. Both by Ren\u2019s crying face that I imagined and by that woman who was letting out weird breathing noises as she imagined the same crying face.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-When I licked his wound, he tried to smile bravely with tears still in his eyes, saying \u2018I\u2019m fine now, Sir Lebuik!\u2019 \u2026 haa, haa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeb, you have a nosebleed.\u201d</p><br/><p>After enjoying herself for a while, thinking about Ren\u2019s younger self, Lebuik\u2019s ears and tail suddenly drooped in sadness.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, I\u2026 leaving Ren-nim by himself in Panan continent\u2026 Uk, uuk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much did that person drink?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne glass. Just one glass of beer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2026 should have been with him. I, I shouldn\u2019t have thrown it away\u2026 but still, I wanted to live\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRen thinks you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lie. The knights that were with me on the battlefield must have lied\u2026 After all, I ran away right in front of them. In front of everyone\u2019s eyes, I opened the door to the dungeon, to survive by myself\u2026 Leaving behind the honor and pride of beastmen\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The light atmosphere had suddenly turned sour. Saure and Zevina, who were clashing their glasses in a good mood, suddenly looked grim. I suspected that they had similar experiences. As explorers of the First Dungeon, they must have abandoned the country and world they were from, into the dungeon.</p><br/><p>I opened my mouth to say something, but I realized I only had unqualified criticisms to say. I stayed silent. That would only be the grumbling of an immature child, who had never experienced the unfairness of cruel reality. In this safe space, they would be vulnerable to my words lacking self-awareness.</p><br/><p>As such, I said the best thing I could say in this situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cRen wanted to see you. He was looking for you\u2026 If you\u2019re alive, he will be happy with just that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cB-But\u2026 I don\u2019t have the qualification to see him. In the hopeless Panan continent, he is the only remaining explorer. He has a truly great and noble soul. Just by meeting him, his soul will be hurt. I\u2019m scared. The fact that I can still affect him\u2026 No, I can\u2019t meet him\u2026 I don\u2019t have the qualification to stand next to him, much less talk to him. I\u2019ll just think about him alone, like this\u2026 hic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe started crying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no choice now. Stop bothering Leb now. We\u2026 want it to stop too. Sorry, even though we\u2019re the ones who invited you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zevina and Saure felt uncomfortable with us as well. I exchanged bitter smiles with Loretta and got up. I didn\u2019t think our conversation would end in the worst way possible. If Ren came to the Residential Area and heard about Lebuik or even met her\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Lebuik.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Don\u2019t call me that. I\u2019m no longer a knight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Ren will change just because of meeting you, he wouldn\u2019t have survived on his own until now. So don\u2019t worry and try meeting him\u2026 Your wound will have to be ripped open one day.\u201d</p><br/><p>That is, before it festers and becomes bigger from being left alone. She seemed to have understood my meaning as her ears twitched slightly. She then murmured in a barely audible voice.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Can I add you to my friend list?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like that, I met with Ren\u2019s master, Lebuik, and parted. Although Lebuik had abandoned her world, she was still climbing the dungeon as an explorer. Just what was it that she was hoping for in the end? Perhaps\u2026 as long as she had the desire to continue challenging, as long as her world didn\u2019t collapse completely, would she still have the chance to go back?</p><br/><p>Although Lebuik was worried that she\u2019d change Ren, my thoughts were different.</p><br/><p>Ren was a warrior, one that walked forward without ever looking back. If it\u2019s him, he might rekindle the fire in that runaway knight\u2019s heart. If it\u2019s him, he might change her.</p><br/><p>Hoping and worrying for that to be the case, I surprisingly realized that I was thinking a lot about Ren.</p><br/><p>For the record, I couldn\u2019t buy any charge type skills from the auction house. Damn, nothing in this world was easy!</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes:</p><br/><p>With the First Dungeon\u2019s important explorers appearing, this chapter has come to an end. I wanted to show you what kind of explorers they were more vividly, but my lack of ability might have somewhat made it hazy. What did you think, everyone? ^^</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes:</p><br/><p>While translating this chapter, I realized I originally translated \u201ccharge type skills\u201d as \u201crush type skills\u201d (for the Rage Rush Boots) for the reason that \u2018charge\u2019 sounded like \u2018charging\u2019 (as in, storing energy over time).</p><br/><p>Since I did \u201ccharge type\u201d when I translated the Crimson Dragon Scale Armor (oops), I decided to just stick with it (I\u2019ll fix the earlier chapters when I complete the series). Just remember that \u201ccharge type\u201d is like \u201crush type\u201d, as in \u201cto rush forward in attack.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

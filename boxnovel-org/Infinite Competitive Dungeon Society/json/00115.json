Avarice Devours Everything (2)</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Kang Shin, an explorer from Earth. It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEarth? Never heard of it before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSame.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, just how did he become a Dimensional Mercenary? From a world without any foundation\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Most of the Dimensional Mercenaries gave me cold glances. Unlike the treatment I had been getting as the Crown Prince, they ignored me after just hearing where I was from. Had they never heard about me before? Did they all have their dungeon explorer communication channels off?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat level do you think he is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis equipment looks pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you stupid? You\u2019re asking for his level as a Dimensional Mercenary? You\u2019re a newbie too, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>There were 13 Dimensional Mercenaries other than me. Two additional people had accepted the request after me. There were only 57 Dimensional Mercenaries in the First Dungeon, and 14 of them had taken this request. Everyone seemed to be very active.</p><br/><p>A young knight with long black hair approached me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Bellode Iraus. As the request said, I am the commander of the Kiros Knights and a Gold rank explorer of the First Dungeon. Thank you for coming, Kang Shin-nim. The first princess has told me a lot about you. If you do your best to save the second princess, you won\u2019t be disappointed by the rewards.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for having me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The knight named Bellode gave a very good first impression. He looked kind and stouthearted. Perhaps because of the pressure to save Shina, however, he had a cloudy expression. After greeting the knight, I turned to the other Dimensional Mercenaries to greet them, but they avoided my eyes. It meant they found it bothersome, even though they talked with each other as if to judge me when I arrived. They seemed to be saying that they didn\u2019t want to waste their energy on useless exchange of greetings. I found it absurd.</p><br/><p>Bellode made a bitter smile, looking at me making a stupefied expression, and said in a quiet voice that only I could hear.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease understand. I hear Dimensional Mercenaries become sensitive before missions.\u201d</p><br/><p>With the danger that came with the job, I wasn\u2019t surprised. Plus, I was new. If I spoke out of line, it was easy for them criticize me as a rookie who didn\u2019t know what he was saying. I sighed and turned my head. Bellode then led us to a large table in the hall.</p><br/><p>Ludia was also nearby. When our eyes met, she humphed and purposely turned her head the other way. At her somewhat expected reaction, I made a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>On the table, there was a large map with the Imperial Palace in its center. Bellode took a short baton and pointed it on the map.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith Kang Shin-nim here, all the Dimensional Mercenaries have arrived. We will do a briefing before we set off. We\u2019ll take the shortest path to lead us to the Demon Lord\u2019s garrison. As he is injured, the Demon Army is hastily pulling their army back, but if we move quickly with our elite forces, we will be able to catch up to them before they arrive at the Demon Lord\u2019s territory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon Lord\u2019s territory, you say. I hear all the peak rank demons are staying there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is true. Until they ascertain their superior position, peak ranked demons prefer not come out of their territory. Since the Hero died\u2026 They might just wait until the world starts to collapse before they appear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, but still, the Demon Lord is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Demon Lord received a critical injury. Everyone on the spot saw it. Although we would be unable to take his life, he won\u2019t be able to hinder our rescue mission. If you\u2019d like, I can even bet my soul.\u201d</p><br/><p>I silently listened to the conversation between Bellode and the Dimensional Mercenaries, and memorized the path Bellode showed us. In case everyone left, I would have to go save Shina alone.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, someone tapped on my shoulder from behind. When I turned around, I saw Ludia whose face was completely red.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF-Father and mother\u2026 want to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe emperor and empress!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>I left the hall with Ludia. I could feel the stinging gazes of the mercenaries behind me. These guys, why were they emitting so much killing intent\u2026!?</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that I think about it, I heard that beautiful princess has a boyfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, I heard it was some damned rookie. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d become a Dimensional Mercenary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish he\u2019d die here.\u201d</p><br/><p>You guys are all single, aren\u2019t you!? And you, why are you glaring at me when you\u2019re a girl!?</p><br/><p>The emperor and empress were both waiting for me together. Plus, the emperor was wearing golden armor and the empress was wearing a golden silk robe for priestesses. They were undoubtedly wearing such eye-catching clothes on purpose. They wanted the enemy to focus on them.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Ludia! Is that young man the one you mentioned?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the emperor caught sight of us, he exclaimed. I was surprised. He looked to be in his late 20\u2019s at most. It felt weird that someone who looked so young was the emperor. Not to mention, he was strong. So he was an explorer before he was the emperor.</p><br/><p>Ludia\u2019s cheeks turned red at the emperor\u2019s words and she shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I didn\u2019t say anything! Shina was the one who blabbered about everything!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut every time she brought it up, you became excited and raised your voice. Can you show me your face?\u201d</p><br/><p>That calm and beautiful voice came from the empress. Just like her husband, she looked like she was only in her late 20\u2019s. She seemed to be a priestess of Mitarus just like Ludia, as her robe had similar design as hers.</p><br/><p>The emperor was also handsome, but the empress was a real picturesque beauty. She and Ludia looked alike so much that I would believe that she was Ludia in 10 years. If there was one difference, it was her empress-like voluptuous\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, there\u2019s a chance for you too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou idiot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, the two of you get along very well. I\u2019m relieved.\u201d</p><br/><p>I snapped out of my daze at the empress\u2019 laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, sorry. I\u2019m\u2026 Kang Shin, an explorer from Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you came for Ludia and Shina even though you\u2019re a Hero. As an emperor who rules a country and is now in charge of this world, I can only say that it\u2019s foolish. But\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The emperor grinned and hammered my shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what a man should do! Your ambition, I like it! So? Who do you want!? Will you take both? I doubt Shina or Ludia will refuse!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD-Dad! I said that\u2019s not it! I don\u2019t know about Shina, but not me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should learn to lie better, my daughter. But I see, you don\u2019t want to share your husband with Shina. Then I\u2019ll just have to leave it to my son-in-law. Do you like Ludia more?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 Both Shina and Ludia are my precious friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was all I could say for now. The empress then spoke with a light smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was also friends with my husband. With my eye, I saw a future with him and said it would never happen, but here I am.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to hold a ceremony for you two\u2026 but as you can see, we aren\u2019t in a situation where that is possible. I apologize, my son-in-law.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before I noticed, he was addressing me as \u2018son-in-law.\u2019 Lost for words, I looked to Ludia, but she was too busy covering her reddened face with her hands. While the two of us were in panic, the emperor gestured at me to come closer. I approached him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to ask you for a favor\u2026 If the situation becomes dangerous, please run away with Ludia. Shina is my precious daughter and I\u2019d like to save her if possible\u2026 but I can\u2019t lose Ludia too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I wanted to say I\u2019d save Shina no matter what, I couldn\u2019t say something I couldn\u2019t guarantee in front of the emperor who had such a serious look. The emperor then said with an even more serious expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso\u2026 don\u2019t trust anyone other than Ludia and Bellode.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think the Demon Lord has only been trying to conquer the world with brute force?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone on this expedition are elites of the elites, but there might be some who might have been coaxed by the Demon Lord. Other than my daughter, Ludia, Bellode is the only one I can trust. Do not forget this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that I had heard about it, it was obvious. The Demon Lord defeated the Hero. Although he was heavily injured, he was still the winner. In such a situation, it would be strange if no one fell to the Demon Lord\u2019s enticement. I couldn\u2019t help but feel bitter at the sudden truth I was made to realize.</p><br/><p>When I backed away after hearing the emperor\u2019s words, he spoke to Ludia and me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Hero died and the world\u2019s power has been stolen. New life can no longer be born in this world. This world will slowly but surely wilt. Even so, I don\u2019t want to give up. There is just too much on my shoulders for me to throw everything down and kneel\u2026 Shina, my precious daughter, is included. I beseech you, my son-in-law and my daughter. Please save Shina.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Dad. I will save Shina.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>The world\u2019s power has been stolen and new life could no longer be born\u2026 I see. That\u2019s why the Hero was the core of a world. I finally understood everything about the Heroes. If new life couldn\u2019t be born, it was equivalent to the end of a world.</p><br/><p>I bit down on my lips and tried to shake off the image of a grim future. The moment the emperor\u2019s words ended, the empress gestured at me. When I approached her, she took out a five-colored object from her inventory and handed it to me.</p><br/><p>After receiving them, I realized it was half of a sword blade along with the rest of the broken sword. Surprisingly, the sword was still emitting a five-colored light. Although I didn\u2019t know what the gem on the sword\u2019s hilt was, I got the feeling I wouldn\u2019t be able to buy it even if I sold my mansion. Although broken, this sword\u2019s value was unquestionable.</p><br/><p>[Mitarus\u2019 Broken Holysword (God)</p><br/><p>Durability \u2013 0/560</p><br/><p>Attack \u2013 15,000</p><br/><p>Equipment Requirement \u2013 Level 90, Hero</p><br/><p>Options \u2013 All stats + 100, Damage against all demons including the Demon Lord x3.

My hands were shaking just holding this weapon!</p><br/><p>\u201cI apologize. It\u2019s broken, so it can\u2019t be used again. However, I believe it can be used in some other way, so I\u2019ll give it to you, a Hero of another world. Will you accept it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I really accept it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, who else other than you would take it, son-in-law?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom!\u201d</p><br/><p>I heard of the saying \u2018lucky to have a good friend,\u2019 but I didn\u2019t think I would get a weapon like this for having one! Plus, when I saw the holysword, I immediately thought of a use for it. After unexpectedly receiving an amazing gift, I bowed to the emperor and empress and left the palace. With her face still red, Ludia followed me like a puppy.</p><br/><p>\u201cD-Don\u2019t mind what Mom and Dad said! It was just that I\u2019ve shown no interest in men, so they\u2019re saying that because I brought you up once or twice!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, of course. I doubt you even see me as a man, anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Crack.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hm? Did I just hear something break? I looked around but everything looked fine. Ludia was only clenching her fists tightly.</p><br/><p>After confirming that no one was around, I took out the Gluttony Spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? What are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe holysword your mother gave me, I can\u2019t just hold onto it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>I took the broken holysword pieces and brought it against the Gluttony Spear without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>The Gluttony Spear then emitted a crazed red aura and swallowed the holysword.</p><br/><p>[Crimson Gluttony Spear absorbed Mitarus\u2019 Holysword. Growth: 47%]</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaak! T-The holysword disappeared!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, Ludia! The holysword is dead! But in my spear! In my heart! It lives on as one!\u201d</p><br/><p>This crazy spear\u2019s growth only went up by 44% after absorbing a God ranked holysword, but I felt like I caught a glimpse of this spear\u2019s future. I let out a satisfactory sigh, and declared to Ludia.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember, Ludia. Avarice swallows everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act cool and say stupid things\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the conversation we had before our departure.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>This chapter was a chapter with Gluttony Spear, for Gluttony Spear, and of Gluttony Spear! Swallow everything! Ah, it can\u2019t swallow other people\u2019s weapons. If that was possible, the moment the spear touched any weapon\u2026 ^^ So Gluttony Spear can only swallow weapons that its master owns or weapons without a master ^^</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Team Revival (8)</p><br/><p>I was shocked, but I wasn\u2019t shocked enough that I\u2019d miss this valuable opportunity. Right now, the drake was almost completely defenseless! When we neared the drake, Ruyue first compressed the ice crystal whirlwind that was protecting us, and shot it toward the drake. Blood spurted out of its face, and even the blood soon froze.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaak!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take an eye!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gale Track\u2019s final blow! I frantically circulated Peruta Circuit and added Gale Track\u2019s wind power to my lightning spear.</p><br/><p>I pulled the spear back. The frozen blood on the drake couldn\u2019t defeat its hot blood and evaporated. At the same time, thrust my spear forward!</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[Kiaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the power of the Skull Breaker!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the lightning spear stabbed through its left eye, tearing through the mana barrier protecting its body. At the same time that I realized a critical hit occurred, its eye exploded into pieces.</p><br/><p>There was already a bonus for charge type attacks. With Skull Breaker\u2019s effect amplifying critical hit damage, not even a SS+ rank boss\u2019 eye was safe. Because of the unexpected effectiveness of the attack, I was once became wet with blood.</p><br/><p>[Kuhuhu, as I thought, Hero is amazing!]</p><br/><p>\u201cFly back for now! This bastard\u2019s going to thrash around again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyahahaha! Cool, you\u2019re so cool! Take me with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I was about to fly back with Lotte, someone suddenly jumped toward us from the drake\u2019s neck. It was Ye-Eun! Holding two daggers flashing with black aura, she easily landed on my back. Not paying attention to Lotte\u2019s struggle to throw her off, she rubbed my back (though it was covered by my armor) and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name? Hm? Tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Ye-Eun\u2019s voice, but something felt different. If Ye-Eun talked like a middle-school girl, her voice currently exuded the charm of a mature woman. In fact, the way she looked at me as she peeked her head over my shoulders was unable to describe with words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you manifested in Ye-Eun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? You know my disciple? Huh? Mmm, I see. No. Can I have him?\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt like I could understand what she and Ye-Eun were talking about\u2026 I lightly pushed her face back and retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let it go since it\u2019s an emergency situation, but you shouldn\u2019t jump on someone else\u2019s wyvern without permission.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Kyahaha, you\u2019re funny! Mm, as I thought, I like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll kill this woman.]</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down, Lotte. Ah, dodge!\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, the agitated drake swung its tail down at us. Lotte quickly dodged it, and the drake\u2019s tail struck the ground, causing even more fissures to spread out. Furthermore, the drake\u2019s body became redder, and a red steam-like gas was shooting out of its body.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think that is? It means it got harder to jump on its neck and attack.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the wyverns were mostly taken care of, it was still difficult for other rankers to fight the drake. The ground was fissured and lava was erupting out of it. The drake\u2019s body was on fire, and although a few long-ranged S rankers were attacking it, the red steam was blocking all of them. \u2018Blocking both close and long-ranged attacks\u2026 That\u2019s a cheat!\u2019</p><br/><p>[Is everyone safe!?]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m safe. That bastard\u2019s tail is as big as a Floor Master.]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m safe too, Hwawoo-nim!]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m\u2026 alive\u2026!]</p><br/><p>As Ludia wasn\u2019t in Earth\u2019s dungeon explorer communication channel, I sent her a separate message. She said she blocked the earthquake with her ability and was now focusing on supporting from the distance. There weren\u2019t many with healing abilities. As such, she would greatly increase the number of survivors.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuha! The bullets just melt when they get near him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pepper\u2019s helicopter flew near me. Although he said it with a refreshing smile, he didn\u2019t look too happy. It seemed his bullets couldn\u2019t pierce through the red steam either. However, after seeing Ye-Eun, Pepper exclaimed in a surprised voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm!? Lady, you look the same, but you somehow look sexier! Did I fall in love?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! As I thought, my appearance can\u2019t hide my charm! But sorry, I already chose him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPepper, can you think of a way to attack?\u201d</p><br/><p>As an SS ranker, Pepper wouldn\u2019t just give up with this. When I interrupted Pepper and Ye-Eun(?)\u2019s small talk and asked, he grinned.</p><br/><p>\u201cI normally would have charged forward with my bazooka, but I think the water drops it shot out earlier broke something. The helicopter isn\u2019t responding well! So, friend, I came to deliver my trump card!\u201d</p><br/><p>He threw something at me. When I received it and looked, it was a black metallic ball with a red button.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fragmentation grenade specially created for me. Only S ranked or above monsters were used to make it, so you should be able to imagine its power! Since it can\u2019t operate without my mana, there\u2019s no safety pin or anything. Normally, if I put mana into it and press the button, it explodes in exactly 3 seconds, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou put all your mana in it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBingo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it looked simple, the mana I could feel inside it was no joke. In detail, all of an SS ranker\u2019s mana was in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s 3 seconds after you press that button, friend! I\u2019ll entrust you with it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, you cool guy\u2026 Leave it to me. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, then I\u2019m going to go save the others. Let\u2019s go out for a drink afterwards, friend! Good luck!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pepper grinned and crossed his fingers over the pilot seat, then turned his helicopter around to go save the other ability users. Damn, that guy was just too cool\u2026 For now, I put the grenade in my embrace.</p><br/><p>Then, the situation changed again.</p><br/><p>[Hero! Hand over yourself to me!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHero this, Hero that! You\u2019re noisy!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the drake shouted, once again erupting lava, Hwaya shouted back. In the next moment, the lava erupting from the ground shot toward her surprisingly. Startled, I was about to charge toward her, when Hwaya raised both of her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my turn now! Army of Flames!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with her hands\u2019 movements, the lava flying toward her fell in clumps and began to take different forms. Eagle, hawk, crow\u2026 All kinds of birds known for their aggressive nature began to appear in thousands. The Animal Kingdom\u2026 No, it was the Army of Flames, Avian Edition! Because of the pouring rain, their bodies continued to sizzle and give off steam, but they didn\u2019t shrink and continued to burn.</p><br/><p>As if that wasn\u2019t enough, the biggest clump of lava formed a giant wyvern. Hwaya got on its back and grinned toward me. Even in the rain, I could clearly see her smile. Ye-Eun\u2019s voice then rang out from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cPtui, big breasted ones should all go to hell.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ye-Eun wasn\u2019t even flat\u2026 I can see your past self\u2026\u2019 Although the thought crossed my mind, I thought she\u2019d break my neck if I said it, so I kept it to myself.</p><br/><p>After Hwaya turned all the erupting lava into her army, the rankers\u2019 counterattack also began.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s group up! Magicians, please protect us with barriers!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake at least one of its scale!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProtect our land! We will protect America!\u201d</p><br/><p>Most of the American ability users burned with determination to protect their home country, and other countries\u2019 ability users did the same as to not smudge their country\u2019s name. The ones who cared more for their lives probably left the battlefield already!</p><br/><p>[Humans always like to gather in mass! They also always died in mass!]</p><br/><p>The drake roared. The steam covering its body transformed to long and thin needles. It then shot them out like it had done earlier with the raindrops.</p><br/><p>Immediately afterwards, Hwaya\u2019s Army of Flames blocked the steam arrows. The few that slipped through would have to be dealt with by the ability users.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>A steam arrow flying toward them suddenly bounced back with a boom. I tilted my head, feeling like I\u2019ve seen that ability before. Then, the protected ability users shouted in thanks.</p><br/><p>\u201cDark Knight! It\u2019s Dark Knight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOoh, both Thunder Knight and Dark Knight are here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Father\u2019s identity was being revealed for the world to see.</p><br/><p>[My flames prey on the sky itself!]</p><br/><p>The drake\u2019s flames continued to get stronger. However, the atmosphere was different than before. The chaos created from the wyvern boss and the ordinary wyverns had settled down, and everyone was now focused on the drake.</p><br/><p>[You insects squirming until death!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuk! New daughter, please!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia used her power of the earth and protected the ability users, while father was in front, shooting out shockwaves and blocking the drake\u2019s attacks. The attacks he could not completely block with his shockwaves were being blocked by Minami.</p><br/><p>\u201cPowered Guardian! Haap!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although father had blocked a portion of them, her defensive capability wasn\u2019t ordinary. However, the drake\u2019s steam arrow attacks seemed to be a disguise for its real attack, as its large tail slammed down on Minami. Although others managed to get away in time, Minami was\u2026 Kuk! When I began to charge toward her, Minami shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cAegis!\u201d</p><br/><p>I twitched my brows. Aegis? Wasn\u2019t that the shield of Athena\u2026? Soon after the thought crossed my mind, the shield in her hand shone with a golden light. At the same time, I sensed a feeling I had grown used to by now. Although it wasn\u2019t my place to say that with my two god\u2019s true names, the Second Dungeon\u2019s Gold ranked Minami was\u2026 a genius!</p><br/><p>\u201cMinami obtained Athena\u2019s true name!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who Athena is, but she must be an amazing god. The feel great power from her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun\u2019s master nodded and remarked. While the two of us were talking, what was happening on the ground was a sight to behold. The moment the drake\u2019s tail collided with the Aegis in Minami\u2019s hand, the SS+ ranked raid boss\u2019 tail began to petrify. It was likely the effect of Medusa\u2019s head, said to be placed on Aegis. It was a bit weird that it petrified on contact rather than sight, but it was certainly effective.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaa! You little bitch!]</p><br/><p>Enraged, the drake swung its tail and broke the petrified part. Because of its resolute sacrifice, the petrification did not continue. Even so, a fourth of its tail shattered and blood spurted out from the wound like a fountain, dying the canyon red. With that, it should have heavily drained its strength and mana. Furthermore, it should now be impossible for it to attack with its tail! As expected of a god\u2019s power\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. The more agitated the enemy gets, the easier it is to stab a dagger in his enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was also thinking the same. When the SS+ ranked boss first appeared, it carried an overwhelming prestige, but now it was just a lizard with one of its eye and tail missing. Though, its magic power was still just as threatening.</p><br/><p>[The rain! I\u2019m drenched in rain!]</p><br/><p>\u201cC-Commence attack!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bolstered by father and Minami\u2019s success, some of the S rankers closed in on the drake and attacked. Although the difference in their strength was clear, the drake wasn\u2019t completely immune to their attacks. It was why the drake was thrashing about.</p><br/><p>[The likes of you dare to approach me! Hero, give me the Hero!]</p><br/><p>The steam covering its body freely transformed and swept out, still carrying its extreme heat. Few rankers who could not avoid it fell back with huge wounds. Seeing how it made S rankers retreat with such a simple attack, I grew tired of its strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou! A mere lizard dares to covet a human!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the ability users he was fighting with falling back one by one, father gritted his teeth and pierced the drake\u2019s foot with his spear imbued with shockwaves. Minami seemed to have lost Aegis\u2019 power with the previous attack, but she still moved around quickly and protected the others from the drake\u2019s attack. It was then that we came near.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll distract it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t just distract it. I\u2019ll kill it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun\u2019s master whispered in my ear, and I retorted lightly as I fixed my grip on my spear. Feeling the Peruta Circuit circulating violently, I glared at the drake. The rain and lightning pouring down strengthened me and weakened the drake. I didn\u2019t matter that it was SS+ ranked or that it was a 100-man raid boss. I could be its opponent. That\u2019s all that mattered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really my style. Good, my name is Duca Eilie. Remember it well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Kang Shin. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll ever see each other again, though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can just ask my disciple! Next time, we should enjoy a heated night!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Duca jumped off Lotte\u2019s back. When the drake noticed us and raised its head, I shouted while drinking a highest-grade Mana Potion.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Crystal Rain!]</p><br/><p>The rain pouring down became fiercer. The streaks of rain became ice arrows strengthened with elemental magic and shot toward the drake! The drake had opened its mouth to attack Duca, but was greeted by countless ice arrows. Not only its mouth, but its head, body, and tail were all attacked mercilessly. My mana was also drained mercilessly.</p><br/><p>[Can I charge now, Hero?]</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Red steam waved from its body. It was to block Crystal Rain, but Duca was able to safely land because of it. The moment she landed on the drake, she struck down at the drake\u2019s neck with her two daggers, giving off a black aura. As she broke the scale on its neck one by one, she shouted excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyahahaha! This is fun, fun!\u201d</p><br/><p>What a crazy woman\u2026 Kuhum. Anyways, now was the time!</p><br/><p>[Grrraaaaaiiaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>As Lotte accelerated toward the drake, birds of flame also flew toward us from all directions. The birds collided with the drake\u2019s flames, preventing them from reaching us. How was Hwaya blocking an SS+ ranked boss\u2019 flame by herself? It was more than just impressive.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew, that was fun! I\u2019ll leave the rest to you honey!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other hand, after scratching off the drake\u2019s scales, Duca stabbed her daggers on its back and jumped down, holding the daggers in reverse and slicing down. Did she think that was a safe way to land? The black aura plucked off the drake\u2019s scales in a line, causing it to let out a bloodcurdling scream.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Lotte\u2019s accelerated more. Scarlet flame erupted out from the drake\u2019s body. It was as if its boundless magic power was going out of control. \u2018I could hear nearby ability users screaming. Minami-ssi, protect them well! I will\u2026!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cAim for its neck, where Duca stripped off its scales!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m going now!]</p><br/><p>My surrounding distorted. The flame birds could not keep up with Lotte and fell behind. In an instant, we were at its neck. If we weren\u2019t this fast, the drake would have counterattacked us easily! Without a shred of hesitation, I used Divine Speed and Heroic Strike. The white lightning spear, crazily accelerated by Divine Speed, pierced through its neck without resistance, widening the hole that was there. Good!</p><br/><p>\u201cEat this!\u201d</p><br/><p>I took out the grenade Pepper gave me and pressed the button. Throwing the grenade inside the gaping hole, I pulled out my spear. Lotte quickly accelerated and flew back. Not even the Flame Drake withstand Pepper\u2019s grenade filled with all of his power\u2026 Eh? Why wasn\u2019t it exploding?</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaa! You dare make a hole in my neck!? I must have you no matter the cost!]</p><br/><p>\u201cP-Pep\u2026! Peppeeeeeeer!\u201d</p><br/><p>You gave me a nonfunctioning grenade, you son of a bitch!!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

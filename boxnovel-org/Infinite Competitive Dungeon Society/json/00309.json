I learned some tricks from the succubi and practiced how to control my charm more efficiently.</p><br/><p>The whole process took a few hours, and while I was at it, I also mastered using Crimson Hell\u2019s power. Since I was back in Earth, I looked over Revival members\u2019 Peruta Circuits and trained Sumire on spearmanship while I was at it. As Sumire was still focusing on concentrating her power into a single point, I showed her how to do it a few times.</p><br/><p>\u201cUuu, I can\u2019t do it well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not perfect yet either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something Shin-nim can\u2019t do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sumire gave me a doubtful look and I flicked her forehead with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you see it just now? I\u2019m still training in this technique.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Sumire rubbed her forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, sorry. Did it hurt? I meant it to be a light flick.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No, not at all. Huhu\u2026 Just show me one more time! Not the forehead flick, but the spear thrust!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGladly.\u201d</p><br/><p>After coaching Sumire, I also coached Ciara as I hadn\u2019t given her much attention for a while. H ability was growing at a monstrous pace after awakening her Evil Eyes, but it was important that she knew how to control her mana if she wanted to display her ability to its fullest extent. At the very least, I wanted to know when and where the Demon Lord would descend.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Peruta Circuit is such an odd technique, Hero-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not talented enough, it\u2019s hard to even realize that it\u2019s odd. So focus and do your best.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Hero-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>I already knew this, but she really was quite talented. Of the ones learning Peruta Circuit from me, Ciara was the most outstanding. In terms of skill levels, her Peruta Circuit would already be level 4.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Hero-nim, A precognition\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it important?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, very.\u201d</p><br/><p>I gulped. Did I jinx myself? Did she just see when the Demon Lord would descend? I asked nervously.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready. Tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Hero-nim. It seems\u2026 In three years, Hero-nim will take in your 17th wife. Ah, I\u2019m one of the seventeen too! This is great!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no dinner for you tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m just telling you what I saw!?\u201d</p><br/><p>In truth, Ciara\u2019s precognition carried an important meaning. No, not the part about the number of my wives (though I\u2019ll try to avoid this future as much as I can), but rather the fact that she saw an event three years in the future.</p><br/><p>Until now, she couldn\u2019t see the future beyond a certain point. The furthest she could see was the Demon Lord\u2019s descent. But today, for the first time, she saw three years into the future where everything would have been resolved.</p><br/><p>Of course, her precognition wasn\u2019t absolute. However, the possibility definitely existed. This meant that we could successfully defeat the Demon Lord and the existence that was controlling the Five Kings. However, I decided not to tell this uplifting news to anyone else. It was most certainly not because I was afraid of their happiness or anger about me having 17 wives.</p><br/><p>Since I was here, I wanted to see Kain\u2019s face before I went back to the dungeon, but surprisingly, he seemed to be in the dungeon. Apparently, he was challenging the 92nd floor after not having done so for a long time. His ability probably had little to do with why he wasn\u2019t climbing the dungeon, but the 92nd floor couldn\u2019t be that easy. Thinking that it would be hard to see his face for a little while, I finally went back to the dungeon. I considered visiting Lin and Leon but decided against it since I couldn\u2019t be of much help.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re back after two days?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I wish I had three bodies.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta, who was waiting for me at the 85th Floor Shop, seemed to have her sanity straight thanks to me controlling my charm.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, I know I say this all the time, but rushing things is the key to making mistakes. You have to make time to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m tired, I\u2019ll come find Loretta to get another massage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta\u2019s ears flapped. She spoke with a face full of anticipation.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould I do it now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot today. I have to go fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf all explorers were like Shin-nim, someone would have conquered the dungeon already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I doubt diligence is enough to conquer the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that Shin-nim realizes Shin-nim\u2019s specialness.\u201d</p><br/><p>She grinned and nodded. Then, she gestured at me to come forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen come receive my blessing before you go. Quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust a blessing, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it the highest grade blessing I can give!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust high-rank blessing is fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>If anything, I could really learn from Loretta\u2019s tenacity. Of course, that didn\u2019t mean I would let things go her way.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the highest grade blessing is reaaaaaally good! I\u2019ve never done it before too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhew, you don\u2019t have to be so strict\u2026 Shin-nim, could it be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Getting Loretta\u2019s blessing ended up being more work than necessary but, in the end, I stepped into the First Dungeon\u2019s 86th floor with high-rank Queen Elf\u2019s Blessing. As always, a message tickled my ear.</p><br/><p>[You entered the 86th floor. Yell \u2018commence exploration\u2019 to start exploring.]</p><br/><p>\u201cNow the environment just openly changes, huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Behind me was the stairway down to the 85th floor, but when I looked back around the 86th floor, all I could see was a vast wilderness.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do here\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Should I have brought Lotte? No, Lotte was influenced by Licorice and went off to train somewhere on Earth. Although I could call her whenever I wanted, if she decided on her path, I didn\u2019t want to bother her.</p><br/><p>Moreover, I knew that breaking through the dungeon alone (with the help of my elementals) would be more beneficial to my growth.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go. Commence exploration!\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as I shouted those two words, something flew straight towards me. I immediately used Divine Speed and got out of the way. BOOM! With a crashing sound, a deep crater formed on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Wow.\u201d</p><br/><p>To think I would immediately get attacked from a distance\u2026 Ah! Another one!</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you at least say hello!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Still, there was no one here. This time, however, the attack came from a different direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cUntil the 80th floor, there were individual enemies. Crimson Hell was a colony, but now the enemies don\u2019t even have real bodies\u2026 Damn!\u201d</p><br/><p>I murmured to myself as I quickly used Divine Speed. Another formed on the ground as a cloud of dust rose up. I had to first find the enemy\u2019s position. I quickly summoned Peika and Dortu.</p><br/><p>\u201cDortu, protect me. Peika, find out where the enemies are.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. Protecting Master.]</p><br/><p>[Huhu, leave it to me!]</p><br/><p>I could tell that Dortu was protecting me as my armor changed. Of course, as I couldn\u2019t just leave Dortu and Pure Black Desire to defend, spread my mana out to detect any movements and prepared myself to jump away at any time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis one must also be a world\u2019s enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. Dortu can feel a familiar energy.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, Peika reported in.</p><br/><p>[Master, there\u2019s no one in this place other than us. Is there really an enemy?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Weren\u2019t we just attacked? \u2026 No, we\u2019re still getting attacked!\u201d</p><br/><p>I dodged the third attack with ease and looked up at the sky. I couldn\u2019t even see a ceiling, only a red sky. Would I be able to touch the ceiling if I kept jumping up? I couldn\u2019t be sure even with my current abilities.</p><br/><p>In a situation where I couldn\u2019t see the enemy but had to keep defending against attacks, it was best to just run forward. Other explorers wouldn\u2019t choose such a stupid method as it might expose them to more enemies and lead to their deaths. It was unlikely that they could do much against an invisible enemy.</p><br/><p>However, I was different. With Divine Speed, I could easily dodge the enemy\u2019s attacks and even if I was hit, the attack didn\u2019t seem strong enough to kill me. Rather than standing still like a fool, running around would probably make the enemy move also. Once they moved, they would surely reveal an opening.</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. An energy is flying this way. It isn\u2019t a life energy.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. That is a metal imbued with mana.]</p><br/><p>A what? Just when I was about to ask Dortu, something flew my way once more. It was almost quick enough to escape my eyes, looking like a laser flying through the sky. That was a metal? I was doubtful, but I also trusted Dortu\u2019s judgment.</p><br/><p>Using Divine Speed, I dodged the flying object and continued to run with great speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, you really don\u2019t feel any life?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t lie, Master!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThen come inside my gauntlet! Dortu, you strengthen my gauntlet too!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un!]</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. Executing Master\u2019s command.]</p><br/><p>I sped up a notch and kicked off the ground. A whirlpool rose up around my body, seemingly pushing me forward.</p><br/><p>As soon as another attack flew out, I quickly detected it and used Divine Speed. In the past, I couldn\u2019t use Divine Speed too freely as it took ten percent of my mana, but now that I understood the principle behind it, the Divine Speed I used was different than the skill Divine Speed. Although the speed amplification wasn\u2019t as good, it was much more efficient, only taking a negligible amount of mana.</p><br/><p>Thanks to Divine Speed, it felt like the world had slowed down. I could see the flow of air and the movement of the enemy\u2019s attack frame by frame. I focused on the flying object and punched out with my gauntlet.</p><br/><p>Dortu\u2019s power made the gauntlet darker and spikier. On the other hand, Peika\u2019s power created fearsome white lightning that seemed capable of ripping apart even a dragon\u2019s scales.</p><br/><p>The enemy\u2019s attack flew in a predictable trajectory and clashed with the center of my gauntlet. I widened my eyes. Someone might mistakenly think that I\u2019m using my Evil Eyes, but in reality, nothing happened. Evil Eyes of Petrification never worked against inanimate objects.</p><br/><p>At the same time, I couldn\u2019t help but think of a possibility.</p><br/><p>If I could properly wield Lilith\u2019s power if I could make the power of my horn completely mine, wouldn\u2019t I be able to petrify inanimate objects as I pleased?</p><br/><p>Evil Eyes of Petrification released charm through eyes and petrified its targets. Lilith could affect inanimate objects with her charm, and if she had Evil Eyes of Petrification, she undoubtedly would have been capable of petrifying inanimate objects.</p><br/><p>Although Dortu could turn inanimate objects into metal, he needed a varying amount of time depending on the state of the object and its momentum. But if I could petrify inanimate objects, Dortu could take the petrified objects and quickly turn them into metal as they would carry my mana.</p><br/><p>If that became possible\u2026 Wow.</p><br/><p>I put away the thought for now. I focused on the attack that seemed to want to break through my gauntlet and grabbed it. The reason I widened my eyes was to better see the flying attack.</p><br/><p>I tightened my grip and fought back against the attack. Peika\u2019s lightning crackled, wearing it down, and Dortu added more pressure in my grip. Soon, I could finally see what the object was.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Sherafina, there\u2019s something I need to ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the object in my hand, I spoke with a stiffened voice. However, before I could receive a reply, another attack flew in with an extreme speed!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026 a bullet!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Let me explain.]</p><br/><p>As soon as I realized what it was, Sherafina spoke out.</p><br/><p>[The world\u2019s enemy of the 86th floor conquered the world, Elpato, but was defeated by the Hero of the world, Zedar, when they invaded them. \u2018Eliminator.\u2019 This world\u2019s enemy has the ability to control and evolve all weapons with its mana. Although they aren\u2019t too skilled in handling cold weapons, they become extremely terrifying with firearms.]</p><br/><p>I flew up into the air to dodge the incoming barrage of bullets and shouted</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, Zedar didn\u2019t have firearms!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[That is exactly so.]</p><br/><p>Zedar\u2019s Hero, you lucky bastard!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Team Revival (6)</p><br/><p>[Your party holds the priority for the Event Raid. Unless you want to reveal its existence, other dungeon explorers will not be notified until 1 hour later!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? How can an Event Raid appear in a Field Dungeon!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEvent Raids don\u2019t only appear when Event Dungeons are cleared! We must have met some sort of a condition!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the heavy rain, Hwaya\u2019s voice reached me clearly. However, it wasn\u2019t the answer I wanted to hear, since it meant there was nothing wrong with that monster being here.</p><br/><p>Of the explorers on Earth, the only one that wasn\u2019t here who could be of help was father. However, we were facing the boss monster of a SS+ rank 100-man raid. Should I prioritize running away? Or should I call father?</p><br/><p>[Shin, make it public immediately! Sumire will come help!]</p><br/><p>[Sumire!? She\u2019s not stro\u2014]</p><br/><p>[She\u2019s Gold ranked!]</p><br/><p>Gold!? She couldn\u2019t climb 20 floors in 2 years, but she managed to climb over 30 floors in half a year!? That\u2019s\u2026 like me! What happened to her!?</p><br/><p>I hesitated for a moment, but soon made the Event Raid public. Now that I thought about it, father would rather come and die than do nothing when his son was in such a dangerous situation.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the drake landed on the ground, causing a tremor. It didn\u2019t have wings like wyverns, and its body was similar to the Giant Iron Boar that appeared in Guangzhou. It had beefy legs, and its front paws had razor-sharp claws. In addition, its front paws looked like they could reach dozens of meters in the air. The dense mana it emitted made it hard to breathe. It seemed stronger than most demons I met in the Luka continent.</p><br/><p>\u201cTurn the helicopter around.\u201d</p><br/><p>I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t fight that guy on a helicopter!\u201d</p><br/><p>The pilot immediately turned the helicopter around. However, the drake seemed to have locked onto us already, as it opened its mouth and breathed fire directly at us. Although the heavy downpour made it hard to see, its giant orange flame wasn\u2019t weakened in the slightest and flew toward the helicopter like a laser.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, I\u2019ll go on ahead!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Hwaya clicked her tongue and jumped out of the helicopter. As she could fly with her ability, she could fight against the drake in the air. Although it might be okay if the drake focused on using magical attacks, if it used physical attacks, it would be hard for Hwaya to deal with it alone. It was why she stayed in the helicopter until now, safely shooting magic at wyverns.</p><br/><p>As such, I prepared myself to also jump out. Looking back at Ye-Eun and Ludia, I spoke.</p><br/><p>[That guy\u2019s extremely strong. We can always run away to the dungeon if it gets dangerous, but there\u2019s still a chance something might go wrong. I\u2019m not going to force you, but\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m confident I can run away if it gets dangerous!\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what I thought they\u2019d say. There was no way Ludia would leave me behind and escape, and Ye-Eun was almost addicted to hunting monsters after she got rid of her monsterphobia. The problem was that she was too careless with her life.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say it clearly. You guys don\u2019t need to risk your lives here. If it gets dangerous, I\u2019m going to take you in my arms and use Return, got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Their eyes were sparkling for some reason. I hoped it wasn\u2019t because I said I\u2019d take them in my arms! It wasn\u2019t the time to be so relaxed!</p><br/><p>\u201cHu, okay. I\u2019m going to go ahead, so come back after you return the helicopter. Talaria!\u201d</p><br/><p>I summoned Talaria and leaped into the air. Hwaya was blocking the drake\u2019s attack with her ability. On the tip of the fingers, a circular ring of fire rose up and absorbed all the fire the drake breathed out. It went without saying that it was thanks to her that our helicopter was still safe.</p><br/><p>\u201cFight me, you lizard! You won\u2019t be able to even touch me with your flames!\u201d</p><br/><p>Standing confidently in midair, Hwaya shouted. Looking at her, I was reminded of the video on TV where she killed the wyvern that appeared in Busan. I thought she looked cool back then and envied her, but now I was fighting with her shoulder to shoulder. I couldn\u2019t be more deeply moved.</p><br/><p>Hwaya ran out to fight the drake without hesitation, even after hearing it was SS+ ranked. She wasn\u2019t being reckless. It was because of her strong mentality, which did not let her fall back in the face of her enemy. It was possible because she believed in herself to be one of the strongest on Earth, who did not allow defeat. Thinking how cool she was, I also thought I should take after her spirit.</p><br/><p>To do that, there was something I needed to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet over here you god damned lizards. All of you come!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You mastered mid-rank Provoke! Your provocation seeps into your soul. You can now provoke deaf monsters!]</p><br/><p>[You learned high-rank Provoke. Existences in the same area as you cannot escape your provocation. Weak monsters might die from having their spirits suppressed by your provocation.]</p><br/><p>My provocation spread through the entire Field Dungeon without being hindered by the torrential rain. It even caught the attention of the ability users who were panicking from the sudden appearance of the Flame Drake and the wyvern boss. It had even calmed their confusion temporarily.</p><br/><p>However, the ones I really wanted to call were the ordinary wyverns!</p><br/><p>[Kiaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>[Kyaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>Countless wyverns as numerous as the raindrops falling down flew toward me! Seeing them, I was delighted. Damn, the world sure chose the wrong guy as the Hero. Why do I smile in such dangerous situations!?</p><br/><p>Regardless, there was one important thing. For the first time since the demon\u2019s Army Commander, I was facing a formidable enemy. I couldn\u2019t worry about hiding my abilities. I had to go all out. Although I couldn\u2019t defeat the Army Commander without Peruta\u2019s help, I didn\u2019t think the enemy in front of me would make me do the same.</p><br/><p>If I could do it with my own strength, I would do so. I could always call Peruta, but that was only as a last resort. If I continued to rely on my master, how could I surpass him?</p><br/><p>I took out Gluttony Spear from my inventory. The moment I firmly gripped the spear shaft, I felt myself becoming more excited. I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, let\u2019s go full power!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Leave it to me, Master. I\u2019m the strongest now!]</p><br/><p>Strongest? The moment I knitted my brows, Gluttony Spear began to shine with a golden light. It was undoubtedly Spirit Aura, but it was much stronger than ever before. Why? The moment I asked in my head, a bolt of lightning fell from the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Mo\u2026 More!]</p><br/><p>I was surprised for a second, thinking the lightning struck me, but that wasn\u2019t it. The lightning was completely absorbed by my spear and was clearly strengthening it. Not to mention, with all the storm clouds in the sky, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if another\u2026</p><br/><p>BOOM! B-B-BOOM!</p><br/><p>My ear deafened. Lightning struck my spear continuously. A few of them even missed their target and struck down incoming wyverns. I finally understood. Elementals were born from nature. They were existences always in line with nature and were greatly affected by nature. In this severe thunderstorm, Peika was at her strongest since the day we met.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Send them flying!]</p><br/><p>The incoming wyverns stopped and flinched at the lightning. Meanwhile, I put them in my spear\u2019s trajectory. To be exact, it was just that they were in the way to the Flame Drake. It was why I gathered them in the first place.</p><br/><p>Kicking off the air, I used Gale Track.</p><br/><p>\u201cUooooooooooh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Using the power of lightning, Peika\u2019s Spirit Aura had enlarged the spear like I was using Sky God\u2019s Rage. The moment my spear even touched the wyverns, they all exploded, and my spear grew stronger each time they died. It was because Gale Track increased my attack power by 5% each time I sent an enemy flying!</p><br/><p>[Kugyaaaaa! Hero, I came for you!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not into bestiality! If you want me, at least try to polymorph to a beautiful girl!\u201d</p><br/><p>17th. 18th, 19th\u2026! I was approaching the drake. Since I was under super-armored state, nothing could stop me. 20th! 100% fully charged! Then, I flew past Hwaya. Seeing her widely opened eyes looking at me, I couldn\u2019t help but think she was cute.</p><br/><p>The drake opened its mouth after seeing me draw closer. Was he planning on swallowing me? I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ask me anything!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp me so that guy will obediently let me attack him!\u201d</p><br/><p>[If it\u2019s now, anything you want\u2026!]</p><br/><p>Then, I suddenly heard the sound of a machine gun. Pepper, who was controlling his helicopter from nearby, had fired at the drake! Imbued with his mana, the bullets seemed to be effective against the drake.</p><br/><p>[Freezing!]</p><br/><p>Ruyue took about 30% of my mana and casted an elemental magic. Although it was for a brief instant, I thought the world would freeze. In fact, our surrounding became completely frozen. The beams of light shining down became arrows of ice, the fire breathed out by the drake froze, and its entire body also frozen.</p><br/><p>[The world is on my side now!]</p><br/><p>So that was it! Usually, she created water from the water vapor in the air, but now, there was water everywhere around us. Even our enemy was completely soaked with water! Even if he was an SS+ ranked boss monster and had fire-attribute, Ruyue could freeze it. Both of my elementals could show their greatest strengths in this environment. I felt at least 50% stronger than my normal self.</p><br/><p>The moment I realized it, I charged towards its mouth and pierced my spear through it.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaang!]</p><br/><p>Its frozen body instantly defrosted, while blood burst out from the top of its mouth like a fountain. Although the heavy rain would wash away the blood in time, the blood that splashed onto me made me feel uncomfortable. Thankfully, it wasn\u2019t poisonous.</p><br/><p>[Herooooo! I\u2019ll eat you!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI already told you, no!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was now as free as a bird! After landing my attack perfectly, I flew back up. I didn\u2019t need to use Divine Speed, and as soon as I backed off, Hwaya quickly blocked the drake\u2019s flames. She was on fire today! Pun intended.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys! Let me join in too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pepper flew toward us, shooting down nearby wyverns with his helicopter. At the same time, the ground lightened up and a few people appeared. The dungeon explorer communication channel became noisy.</p><br/><p>[Son, I came to help!]</p><br/><p>[Unni, Hwawoo-nim! Minami Violet Sumire, reporting for duty!]</p><br/><p>[Shit\u2026 I\u2019m going to really die if I\u2019m not careful\u2026!]</p><br/><p>Besides one, the reinforcing explorers couldn\u2019t be more reliable. I instantly thought, \u2018Walker might die if he\u2019s not careful\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>According to our contract, he had to come help us if we called him for Event Raids or Event Dungeons, but he came without Hwaya or me asking him. Because we thought this battle would be hard for Walker, we hadn\u2019t planned on calling him at all.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, father had caught him and brought him along, but he could have escaped if he wanted to. I was happy that he came on his own accord. If possible, I hoped this raid would end without Walker getting hurt.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu. All the dungeon explorers on Earth are here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya remarked as she flew next to me. I wasn\u2019t sure if she absorbed the drake\u2019s power, but she was emitting strong flames from her body. Since Ludia and Ye-Eun would soon return, she was right.</p><br/><p>Looking at the drake still bleeding from its mouth, I snorted. It could be dangerous to think this way, but I didn\u2019t think I could lose to anyone now!</p><br/><p>The moment after I thought that, a giant wyvern twice as big as normal wyverns appeared in front of us.</p><br/><p>Because of the drake, we had forgotten about it. It was the dungeon boss of the Wyvern\u2019s Nest.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note: N/A</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>In case it wasn\u2019t clear, the Flame Drake is the boss of the Event Raid, and the giant wyvern is the Field Dungeon\u2019s boss.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

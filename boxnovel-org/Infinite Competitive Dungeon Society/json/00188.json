Skill Synthesis (7)</p><br/><p>\u201cShin oppa, here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Elfa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>A rabbit-eared beastman girl, Elfa, handed me a bowl of soup. I gave her head a pat and took a sip. It was a beef cream soup with an excellent taste. After all, I was the one who brought it! All hail instant food!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow mysterious. Just putting some powder in water makes such flavor\u2026 Neither the Floor Shop nor the Residential Area has such items.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s expensive, so be thankful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOoh, as I thought, Crown Prince is really generous. These tiny bits of meat must be expensive too. I wonder what kind of meat it is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>You might be curious what that meat is, but this hyung is worried for your future\u2026 I hesitated on whether to tell him the truth or not but seeing him so happy, I quietly took a spoonful of soup. Then, a light breeze blew next to me.</p><br/><p>[Master, I came back from scouting.]</p><br/><p>\u201cGood work, Sharana.\u201d</p><br/><p>[The sky has really weird creatures. They look lifeless on the outside, but their brains have extremely active mana.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many are there?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Close your eyes.]</p><br/><p>When I did so, Sharana put her forehead against mine. With our extreme intimacy, she could transmit images to me with this.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince? What are you doing all of the sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShh.\u201d</p><br/><p>I put my finger on my lips and silenced Ren. Then, I closed my eyes and looked at the evening sky appearing in my sight. A star similar to Earth\u2019s Sun was setting, dying the sky red, and a few clumps of clouds were scattered here and there. Filling up the sky was a countless number of winged creatures. Trying to count them was useless. I couldn\u2019t help but sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu, there are so many\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou finally understand why we must travel through the mountains?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite overwhelming. Do you think there are other survivors?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure\u2026 but I sure hope so.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was only one mountain range left until the plain. As there would be a rocky mountain in the middle, we would have no choice but to be completely exposed in this area.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce we get through the rocky mountain, The Forest of Tranquility will await us, a forest that was once a holy land. Here, the flow of mana becomes calm, making it hard to fight. More importantly, it becomes difficult to track someone using mana, so we won\u2019t have to worry about pursuers from the rocky mountains.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better to set up a base camp at Forest of Tranquility then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Forest of Tranquility is a holy land, but at the same time, it is also called a graveyard. It is fine to stay there for a day, but if you stay any longer, a grim reaper will come reap your life. It does not matter whether you are a human, beastman, or El Patiz. Staying in the holy land for more than a day would only hasten your death.\u201d</p><br/><p>There sure were strange places\u2026 I grumbled and unsummoned Sharana. Then, I gulped down the soup. Then, I opened a canned coffee while I waited for the children to finish eating when Elfa and another beastman girl asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it food?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beverage. You guys can drink it when you\u2019re adults.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to drink it now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t grow taller if you do.\u201d</p><br/><p>I quickly chugged down the coffee and crumpled the can before one of the children could reach it. Seeing me easily crumple the can with a mermaid drawn in a green circle, the children exclaimed in surprise. It seemed they were just curious. I told myself not to drink coffee in front of children.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been a day, but they really are attached to Crown Prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin oppa is handsome!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s kind and strong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s close to Wolf-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Ren oppa is still more handsome!\u201d</p><br/><p>To be honest, I thought I was more handsome than Ren, but seeing Ren\u2019s happy expression, I stayed silent. If Ren came to Earth, I decided to call Officer Podori[1. The police mascot in Korea.].</p><br/><p>After dinner, we set off again. Even in the dark environment, my Evil Eyes continued to petrify all monsters that attacked us. As I ran, I thought about ways to become stronger to better ensure everyone\u2019s safety. Like in Luka continent, I couldn\u2019t be sure what to expect in a foreign world.</p><br/><p>I was, of course, talking about Skill Synthesis. Although the result was random, the result from the synthesized pocket watch skills was very satisfactory. It was definitely worth synthesizing skills that I didn\u2019t use or skills that overlapped with others in use. I already had some candidates in mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince, we should set up camp here for the night. Once we get through here, we\u2019ll be at the rocky mountain, where we won\u2019t be able to stop to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, let\u2019s set up camp.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, I took something out of my inventory and placed it down on the ground. Ren tilted his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this? A triangular, half-transparent giant crystal\u2026 Is it for some ritual?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo in? You can go in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, it\u2019s so big!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCozy! It\u2019s so comfortable!\u201d</p><br/><p>The children fearlessly ran into the giant crystal. Right, this was none other than Crystal Lair[2. A reward Shin got in chapter 153.]! A high-tech camping tent that even worked underwater! It was large enough to fit 20 people and magically provided fresh water and bread infinitely! It was sitting in my inventory like a useless piece of junk, but I finally found the use for it!</p><br/><p>\u201cOoooh! How revolutionary!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, this would be perfect for staying overnight in the dungeon too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone went inside and began to rest comfortably. As Crystal Lair even had an automatic alert system, it would wake us up when hostile beings neared it. If only it had wheels, it would be perfect!</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince, aren\u2019t you coming in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have something to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>I waved my hand and told them to rest. I walked a little ways away from the campsite. Lotte followed me to guard me.</p><br/><p>\u201cSkill Synthesis.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the circular stone slab suddenly appeared in the air, Lotte flinched and took a step backward. I smiled at her and touched Gale Track from my list of skills. Then, with a strange sensation, a small clump of light appeared in my hand. I placed it in the base skill slot and placed Blade Rush, a good single-target charge skill, into the supplement skill slot. I didn\u2019t want to juggle with two separate charge skills and hoped that a skill that combined their good points would appear.</p><br/><p>Of course, just combining them like this would be boring, so I added the Dash skill, which granted bonuses to my running movements. Feeling that it wasn\u2019t enough, I even added Thunder Beast. The light flashing from the stone slab became brighter. My heart raced as I activated Skill Synthesis.</p><br/><p>[You obtained the unique skill, Wind King\u2019s Rage.]</p><br/><p>[With an unpredictable path and unfollowable speed, you charge forward, carrying a powerful lightning and wind power. When you collide with an enemy, a spear of lightning will appear and pierce through the enemy, after which a powerful wind will blow the enemy away. The enemy\u2019s mana will be absorbed, increasing the charge\u2019s destructive power by 10%. At any point, you can explode out with a powerful energy at a target. Currently, at level 1, the charge\u2019s destructive power can be increased up to 150%. As it is too powerful, after being fully charged, this skill cannot be used again for 3 hours. When uncharged, the skill can be used again after 10 minutes.]</p><br/><p>[You created a unique skill! Unique skills are skills that possess strength on par with a God's powers without receiving the breath of a god! This grand achievement causes all gods to focus on you. Gods related to storm and lightning become especially interested. You obtained 3 skill points. Current skill points: 4]</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I had already created a unique skill before, I wasn\u2019t particularly surprised. Gale Track, Thunder Beast, and Blade Rush weren\u2019t ordinary skills. Dash couldn\u2019t be ignored either.</p><br/><p>In any case, I was happy with the result. Just like I wanted, I would be able to use this skill regardless of whether I was facing one target or multiple targets.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, this skill didn\u2019t have ranks like Thunder Beast, Dimensional Travel, and Peruta Circuit. In such cases, it was much harder to raise the skill level, but each level would show a sharp increase in power. It was a skill that had surpassed the notion of being ranked. It made me feel especially giddy.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, that\u2019s enough rejoicing\u2026 Skill Synthesis.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, I used White Lightning Consecutive Strike as the base skill and put Thunder Tempest into the supplement skill slot. I didn\u2019t put other skills in this time as it would be too wasteful to put any of my remaining skills in to supplement an attack skill.</p><br/><p>[You obtained the skill, \u2018Lightning Spear Storm.\u2019]</p><br/><p>[With a powerful whirlpool of lightning, you draw in nearby enemies, striking out consecutively with a white lightning-imbued spear. Each strike uses 0.1% of your mana, and the final strike uses 10% of your mana to deal a powerful explosive lightning damage to all enemies.]</p><br/><p>Although I didn\u2019t get another unique skill, it became what I designated a \u2018master skill.\u2019 The skill was more than what I expected. Peruta Circuit certainly had such an ability. Now, I was able to draw in nearby enemies near me! It seemed like a skill that would appear in games, but I decided to ignore it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, next\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>To realize a skill I had thought of before coming to this world, I picked a few skills. This was also the reason I decided to wait until night to use Skill Synthesis.</p><br/><p>However, once I placed all the skills in the stone slab\u2019s slots, I canceled Skill Synthesis.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s not enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>If I continued, I felt that I wouldn\u2019t get the skill I wanted. Perhaps it was the effect of Spirit of the Mixer, or perhaps, it was just a warrior\u2019s intuition. Regardless, I felt that it wasn\u2019t wise to synthesize the skill. Of course, before I regretted it, I would have to decide before I finished crossing the mountain range. I shrugged and went back to the tent with Lotte. It would take more energy to climb the rocky mountain. I had to get rest when I could.</p><br/><p>However, what we faced the next day wasn\u2019t the aerial unit of El Patiz, but a completely unexpected massive, terrifying enemy.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>I thought the Skill Synthesis stone slab was rectangular (as slabs generally are), but apparently, it was circular! My imagery!!!</p><br/><p>I hope everyone understands the Wind King\u2019s Rage skill. The word \u201ccharge\u201d is used in two meaning there \u2013 one as in \u201cto rush forward\u201d and another as in \u201cto collect energy over time.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

You Cannot Escape from the Saintess (1)</p><br/><p>The demons remaining in Australia went crazy when Lespina was swallowed by inextinguishable flames. They all charged towards me as if they had lost their minds.</p><br/><p>[Kill him.]</p><br/><p>[Kill him.]</p><br/><p>[Kill him.]</p><br/><p>[Kill\u2026 him!]</p><br/><p>As I faced them, I felt that something was off. Intelligent beings didn\u2019t throw away their lives so easily. Although I didn\u2019t plan on letting a single one survive, in their perspective, it made more sense to retreat and come back later after reorganizing.</p><br/><p>Since the enemy were demons rather than monsters, I thought this would be their natural course of action, but they all charged at me without caring for their lives. Their tenacity even sent a chill down my back.</p><br/><p>As they detonated their mana when they got near, even with Revival members doing their best to stop them, there were many instances where my life was threatened. Since I used Overlord, which was my greatest secret weapon, I only had my physical body left to fight with. However, some two hundred thousand demons left in Australia were already here or were running here.</p><br/><p>[If you\u2019re tired, be honest and go rest at the guild house! We\u2019re free to move back and forth from here now!]</p><br/><p>[If we leave, it\u2019ll get tougher for you, idiot! They\u2019re clearly all aiming for you. Do you think we won\u2019t notice you trying to solve everything by yourself!?]</p><br/><p>When I messaged the guild members with worry, Hwaya shouted back angrily. Her entire body was burning with blazing flames.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, do your best so Shin stops his nonsense! Don\u2019t die either, because if you do, I\u2019ll kill you myself! Agni\u2019s Seven Tongues!\u201d</p><br/><p>When she reached out with her hands, seven giant streams of white flames rose up in the sky. I see, so there was more to Agni\u2019s power than what she showed last time! Just like how Zeus\u2019 power had two forms or how Shiva\u2019s power had three forms, Agni\u2019s power also had multiple forms.</p><br/><p>If the power Hwaya used last time created divine flames, the power she used this time was even simpler. Pure destruction! Seven Tongues flickered from the sky to ground and destroyed all demons in their paths.</p><br/><p>What was more shocking was that these tongues even attacked allies. Worried about a guild member dying, I prepared myself to use Caduceus, when I widened my eyes in shock. Ye-Eun, who was struck by a tongue, had appeared unscathed in flames.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, my wounds disappeared!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, how\u2019s this Unni\u2019s power?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAwesome, Unni! I want it too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right, Ye-Eun\u2019s wounds were healing. In other words, Agni\u2019s flames harmed enemies and healed allies. It was a truly worthy of being a god\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>\u201cHang in there, everyone! No matter how many demons there are, our victory is certain! Guardian and Freedom Wing\u2019s allied troops will come here soon! Other Revival members are coming too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUoooooooh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll save everyone!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Hwaya\u2019s voice filled with divine power rang out in the battlefield, other members cheered in return. Since they seemed so full of energy, I assumed they were fine. With a bitter smile, I fought off the demons in front of me. The Demon Lord must have done something to them. With a far more barbaric and brutal method\u2026 His goal must have been\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll worry about that later! Fight me, you bastards!\u201d</p><br/><p>I fought against powerful enemies countless times as I climbed Beyond! Be it two hundred thousand or five hundred thousand, I\u2019ll fight you all! The whirlpool swirling around me became fiercer than ever as it gathered around my spear and ripped apart three demons in the next instant. Maintaining this momentum, I shouted as I cut down more demons.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are Revival! Damned demons or monsters, let\u2019s fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>From then, it took four days to clear Australia and the rest of Oceania. Two members of Revival lost their limbs and had to be healed by combined efforts of Ilayda, Ludia, and Elixirs.</p><br/><p>As I fought hundreds of demons at the same time, I carelessly had my right arm crushed, but the \u2018Flesh Golem\u2019s Second Finger\u2019, which I had obtained a long time ago, activated and regenerated my arm before anyone worried.</p><br/><p>As Pure Black Desire was indestructible, although my arm was crushed inside it, the armor looked unfazed. Because of it, no one else even noticed that I had lost my arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin\u2026 A part, died. Definitely, died.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, it seemed Daisy\u2019s sixth sense figured something out. I desperately tried to hide my thoughts, but whether it succeeded was another story. Daisy rubbed my right arm a few times and tilted her head before leaving. Daisy, she was truly a mysterious woman\u2026!</p><br/><p>Although Revival suffered little, Guardian and Freedom Wing\u2019s casualties was disastrous. Both in numbers and strength, the demons had overwhelmed them.</p><br/><p>As Australia\u2019s citizens mostly lived in coastal regions, they couldn\u2019t escape from the Demon Army\u2019s sudden attack and died. There were even less survivors than in New Zealand. In the end, it was a victory that no one could be happy about. Since Two Moon, it became one of the top five tragedies, and the worst tragedy since Guardian and Freedom Wing were founded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been two years or so since monsters first appeared, and everyone\u2019s been too relaxed. With this incident, such thoughts will\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I know what you\u2019re trying to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>I embraced Hwaya and consoled her. It was good that humanity became more aware of the danger, but the cost we had to pay was too great. Furthermore, although they may not know it yet, we didn\u2019t have much time left. No matter how much they prepared for the eventual fight against demons and monsters, there was very little they could do given the short time.</p><br/><p>However.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith our power, we can stop it. So just keep doing your best.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we, Shin? We couldn\u2019t stop even a portion of the Demon Army, and this is what happened. There are still incomparably stronger demons and even monsters we have to worry about\u2026 I want to smack my past self. I got too overconfident when I first got my ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can do it. Trust me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya widened her eyes at my confidence, then smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. If Shin says so\u2026 I\u2019ll trust you.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, she got out of my arms and clenched her fists.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t just act like a baby. I\u2019m going back to the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should rest today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not tired physically and\u2026 my mental exhaustion just disappeared. I\u2019m off.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, she made a cute smile. Then, her expression suddenly changed as if she stepped on feces. With a slightly sharp expression, she pinched my cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, the way you think is very cruel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSee!? You know what I\u2019m talking about, so you\u2019re acting like you\u2019re oblivious. If the current situation wasn\u2019t what it was\u2026 Well, it is how it is, so I\u2019ll forgive you. Still, you\u2019re cruel. Making a girl say this first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I seated and turned away from her. This demoness!</p><br/><p>\u201cEhew, I should have made you sign the papers. Because the man I fell in love with is so great, I have to go through all this trouble. Really, it\u2019s not like I can just stop now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya kept complaining, but I figured it was on the lighter side. I stood silently, feeling awkward, when Hwaya said her last words.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m on your side, so cheer up. I think I know what you\u2019re feeling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm? You also have someone else you\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot that, idiot! I\u2019m talking about the current situation between Earth and the dungeon! I\u2019m already upset, do you want to make me even more upset!?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, she hit me. Damn\u2026 If only I stayed quiet!</p><br/><p>First, I returned to the dungeon. It was to fight the First Dungeon\u2019s 80th Floor Master. During the 4 weeks I spent cleaning up Antarctica, I diligently climbed the First Dungeon and Beyond, breaking through the First Dungeon\u2019s 79th floor and Beyond\u2019s 29th floor. After that, I got so busy that I didn\u2019t have the time to fight the Floor Master. I had no choice but to delay the dungeon until everything was taken care of.</p><br/><p>Five months had passed since the first time Loretta talked about the two year time period. Now, however, that time wasn\u2019t certain, and it was better to think I only had one year left. The invaders were breaking into Earth like they were being chased by someone, and the Demon Lord and the other enemies had way too many suspicious things about them.</p><br/><p>To protect Earth and to protect my loved ones, what I needed was absolute power. A power that no one could take away from me, a power that purely belonged to me. I vowed to obtain a power like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? You\u2019re giving up on grinding elixirs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m at a point where a few dozen stat points can\u2019t solve the problem I have. They helped when I was climbing the lower floors, but now, they\u2019re just numbers. What I need more is a more certain league.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim\u2026 You\u2019re right. I wanted Shin-nim to have more time to think about things, but considering Earth\u2019s current situation, that sounds right. Yes, raise your league. I will support Shin-nim to the best of my abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta accepted my idea and nodded. I turned away with a grin. In front of my eyes were the stairs leading up to the 80th floor. The next time I see Loretta will be after I defeat the 80th Floor Master.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, don\u2019t you need to hear about the 80th Floor Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a guess. I\u2019m pretty certain I won\u2019t be wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Starting from the 76th floor, undead monsters reappeared. They were incomparably stronger than the undead I faced in the lower floors. There were giant zombies, ghouls, and even apparition type undead that randomly popped out of nowhere and scared me. Moreover, the chances of elite monsters appearing increased and stopped me from underestimating the First Dungeon.</p><br/><p>An undead monster that would be the boss of them all\u2026 I would have to face 80th floor\u2019s monsters first, but I had a guess in mind.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Loretta grabbed me and asked cautiously. Her face was a bit red.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, do you need a blessing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, but just give me a kiss. Rather than a blessing, I want Loretta\u2019s pure encouragement.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, you changed. You can say something so sly now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you hate it, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate it! I love it, I love it!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, Loretta even gave me a blessing. I didn\u2019t know whether it was the power of Loretta\u2019s kiss or the power of her blessing, but I could easily break through the 80th floor filled with dullahans and skeleton knights. Then, I came to face an unusually big door to the Floor Master battle room.</p><br/><p>\u201cFloor Master\u2026 Alright, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>What reason did I have to wait? I kicked open the door without hesitation, and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>On an incredible dark and cold land, a voice rang out from the depths.</p><br/><p>[Good. Let\u2019s fight.]</p><br/><p>He appeared covered in a black aura, carrying a great sword in one hand, and wearing a black armor. The glow of this crimson eyes shining through the gap in his helmet showed that he was threatening, that he wasn\u2019t just for show.</p><br/><p>The most perfect highest ranked undead monster, the Death Knight, had appeared.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

God's Marriage (END)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>I first looked for Loretta. I had no idea where to start, but Loretta was in her cabin. The way she was crouched down in the corner of her cabin holding onto an axe was cute, but also a bit scary.</p><br/><p>\u201cShi, Shin-niiiiiim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, put that axe down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta came running into my arms with teary eyes. I kindly removed the axe she was holding before I received her in my arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re safe too, Loretta. I knew the axe would help.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at the axe, which still contained the Death Lord.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>[If you want to repay me, make me a cool new body!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll consider it.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I was having a staring contest with the Death Lord, Loretta asked with her face still buried in my chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to Lord?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta let out a small sigh. She must have spent thousands of years with Sherafina. I\u2019m sure she had many things on her mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been long since I noticed Lord\u2019s plan. Even Lin noticed earlier than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou found out after what happened with Kain, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta nodded with a bitter smile. Then, she shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over now so I won\u2019t think about it anymore. I\u2019m just happy that Shin-nim came back safe and sound. I\u2019m happy to have been of help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout Loretta\u2019s pocket watch, none of this would have been possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you obtain the pocket watch?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an artifact that was created in my world. Lin really wanted it in the past, but I didn\u2019t give it to him. Lin said he could beat Lord if he had it, but I didn\u2019t think so. Plus\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlus?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 No, I\u2019m keeping it a secret.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta looked away with a reddened face. As I knew what it implied, I simply made a small smile.</p><br/><p>As we were in a hurry, the seat of the Dungeon Lord was given to Loretta. But she wouldn\u2019t be chained to the seat for eternity. I planned to carry out what I planned to do from the beginning. With the power I had now, it was possible.</p><br/><p>To disconnect all connected worlds and return worlds\u2019 powers to their proper worlds. The number of worlds\u2019 powers wasn\u2019t decreasing at all. They were simply combining with another. Now that I could wield worlds\u2019 powers as I pleased, separating them once more wasn\u2019t a difficult task whatsoever.</p><br/><p>It might be difficult if all worlds\u2019 powers fused together into one\u2026 No, having taken a step further, I felt like I could divide them again even if that happened.</p><br/><p>In any case, once this was done, the dungeon would disappear. There was no need for it to exist. Members of the administrative guilds who were chained to the dungeon would finally be set free. And of course, Loretta was included.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and free me, Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t take long, so just wait a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>I had the confidence in redividing worlds\u2019 powers, but I had trouble giving Sherafina\u2019s power to Loretta.</p><br/><p>What resulted from the fusion of my original power, Sherafina\u2019s power, and Lespina\u2019s power was a shocking power no one could have imagined. Because of the origin of this power, it was hard to isolate Sherafina\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>But that didn\u2019t mean I had to become the Dungeon Lord. I was Loretta\u2019s Partner, so I could give her a blessing, and I could put in a portion of Sherafina\u2019s power into it.</p><br/><p>Once Loretta received my blessing, she could act as the Dungeon Lord for a month. I had to give her the highest grade blessing to have it last for a month, but Loretta had no qualms about it. In fact, she enjoyed it very much.</p><br/><p>\u201cMuhuhu, muhuhuhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop sticking to me and restart the dungeon. Earth is in trouble too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuu, okay\u2026 But you have to come back after you\u2019re done with Earth!\u201d</p><br/><p>After confirming that the dungeon had started operating again, I hurriedly returned to Earth. The moment I sent Kain the signal, he deactivated Kune\u0113</p><br/><p>\u201cCool hair accessory.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was all Kain said, and that was enough. He saw that I had reached my goal, there was no need for me to explain anything to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuk, Shin changed again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe, Son!\u201d</p><br/><p>Revival\u2019s members rushed towards me as they checked for my safety. I became a bit depressed as they reminded me of the ordinary people who came to worship me, but such thought flew away when they all charged into an embrace.</p><br/><p>No, now\u2019s not the time for this!</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys, I know you\u2019re happy to see me but pick your weapons back up!\u201d</p><br/><p>I shouted, pointing at the monsters running around on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can talk after we kill all the monsters!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kain\u2019s Kune</p><br/><p>Postponing the celebration for later, everyone scattered to all sides.</p><br/><p>In the center of it all, I raised my spear and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cFight me, you bastards!\u201d</p><br/><p>My strengthened Evil Eyes shone and the monsters on the ground all became petrified. At the same time, people\u2019s gazes became focused on me.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim!\u201d \u201cShin-nim is back!\u201d \u201cHe came to save us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Whatever, you guys can call me what you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>I decided to give up.</p><br/><p>Cleaning up Earth took four whole days. Sherafina\u2019s final wave of monsters was truly wide-ranged and carefully planned. The fact that it took me four days with my Evil Eyes showed how dire the situation was. But of course, it didn\u2019t matter too much as we ended up killing every monster without leaving even a single goblin behind.</p><br/><p>Once the monsters were annihilated, the world continued to roll along even with the massive damage it suffered. I believed all of humanity was thinking the same thing. That the world continued no matter what happened.</p><br/><p>There was also an unwelcome news.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, it looks like an official church has been established.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the last thing I wanted to hear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yua reported with a happy face to which I retorted with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we get rid of it somehow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice, who knew my thoughts the best, burst into a laughter and poked my cheeks playfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, humans need someone like Dear Husband to get through this dark time. Just bear with it. Dear Husband will leave Earth soon anyways, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhew.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ciara\u2019s legacy ran too deep for me to erase. If I wanted to, I would have to raise my spear against the surviving humans. Since that was obviously out of the question, I reluctantly accepted the situation. At that moment, the light the halo was giving off became thicker.</p><br/><p>Damn, I don\u2019t know anymore.</p><br/><p>I gave Daisy, Kain, and Ren their worlds\u2019 powers back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m currently researching how to prevent Heroes from being burdened with worlds\u2019 powers. Once I get results, I\u2019ll tell you all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, are you abandoning me in Sylon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow Kang Shin until I die. Even after death, we\u2019ll be, together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHah, it\u2019ll be a while before I die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. So I\u2019ll follow you, forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>She sure knew how to throw the right pitches at the right time. Looking at Daisy, who was staring at me intently and asserting her will, I stroked her head once and shrugged at Kain and Ren to hide my embarrassment. The two of them spoke one by one.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince is really amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the number one Casanova under heaven.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWant me to take your powers away?\u201d</p><br/><p>After taking care of urgent matters, I prepared to leave Earth. The amount of blood flowing across dimensions would diminish the faster I went, so I hurried as much as I could.</p><br/><p>Hwaya, who noticed this quickly, cut in strongly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave after we get married.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When I didn\u2019t give a reply, Hwaya\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to hit you if you say you won\u2019t get married until you\u2019re done with all of the worlds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya, I\u2019ve always admired your sharp intellect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone grab him, I\u2019m going to hit him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when I was wondering who could hold me down, Ye-Eun, Ina, and Daisy activated their gods\u2019 powers and grabbed ahold of me. There really was no one you could trust in the world.</p><br/><p>In the end, my wedding was planned at the age of twenty-three. If possible, I wanted to marry Loretta first after freeing her from the dungeon, but that would only mean I was ignoring Hwaya and the rest.</p><br/><p>After careful consideration, I decided to hold two weddings, one on Earth and one in Fairy Garden. That way, Loretta would also become a bride.</p><br/><p>While the wedding at Fairy Garden only had Fairy Garden\u2019s guild members to worry about, the wedding on Earth was God\u2019s wedding, so it was difficult to hold it in peace. Because of it, the brides seemed to be looking forward to Fairy Garden\u2019s wedding more.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta unni, can you make my mom an explorer! She wants to come!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make things more difficult. Also, I\u2019m only seventeen, so don\u2019t call me unni.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta rejected Hwaya\u2019s request to make her family members dungeon explorers. Instead, she created a \u2018one-time guest\u2019 system, which only allowed guests into Fairy Garden. It was a power fitting of the Dungeon Lord. Thanks to her, the brides\u2019 families could visit Fairy Garden too.</p><br/><p>The wedding day arrived in the blink of an eye. For both weddings, we only needed to prepare the wedding hall, since we only needed to invite Revival\u2019s members and the brides\u2019 families.</p><br/><p>As for me, I was hiding in the corner of Fairy Garden.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, why are you hiding?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun, who was in her wedding dress, discovered me quickly. Seeing Ye-Eun in her pure white dress, I realized once again how beautiful Ye-Eun really was.</p><br/><p>\u201cYe-Eun, you look really beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh. Ehehehe. Really? Hehe, you look cool too Shin! Like you always do!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun smiled brightly. She was especially cute when she smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, why are you hiding?\u201d</p><br/><p>But she didn\u2019t let me off. Damn.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m too scared to see my mother-in-laws\u2019 faces.\u201d</p><br/><p>Six brides. I knew what position I was in in the world, but that didn\u2019t make the situation any better. I could only imagine what my mothers-in-law were thinking. For example, if Yua were to marry someone with several wives\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou might be scared, but don\u2019t destroy Fairy Garden because of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I got worked up.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was from rage rather than fear, but thankfully, Ye-Eun didn\u2019t know my inner thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you say mothers-in-law, only Hwaya unni\u2019s mother and my parents are here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia, Loretta, and Daisy had all lost their parents, and Licorice didn\u2019t have one, to begin with. As a result, only Ye-Eun\u2019s parents and Hwaya\u2019s family were in the bride's\u2019 guests. Not to mention, Ye-Eun had not stayed in touch with her parents for a long time and only called them because it was her wedding.</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun\u2019s parents were treating her like a monster since the day Ye-Eun awakened as an ability user, but once they saw Ye-Eun in her dress, I was sure they would change their mind. Though, it might be too late to mend their relationship.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just have a lot on my mind. I\u2019ll be there in time, so don\u2019t worry and go get ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn! Uhuhu\u2026 Eit.\u201d</p><br/><p>After laughing innocently, Ye-Eun gave me a peck on the cheek before turning around and running. She was undoubtedly embarrassed.</p><br/><p>The moment Ye-Eun disappeared, Ludia popped out from the ground like she was waiting.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, there\u2019s a lipstick mark on your face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour ability to control the earth sure improved, huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI had to get stronger to be with Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia said with a small smile, while I wiped the lipstick mark off my face.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you guys do a baton pass?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I came a while ago, so I was waiting for you guys to finish talking. Didn\u2019t you notice?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s too much power concentrated in Fairy Garden right now. If I start releasing my power, it\u2019s sure to collapse, so I\u2019m holding it in. So unless someone bears any hostility towards me, I can\u2019t notice anyone hiding. \u2026Loretta and Hwaya aren\u2019t hiding nearby too, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey wanted to come with me, but I stopped them. It would have been troublesome if all brides disappeared.\u201d</p><br/><p>I laughed out loud at Ludia\u2019s words. She then spoke firmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, thank you for killing the Demon Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only did what I needed to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll think of it the way I want to. That you killed him for me. I\u2019m happier that way and it makes my heart flutter more.\u201d</p><br/><p>For a moment, I became lost for words. Ludia slowly approached me and leaned against my arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for accepting a spoiled girl like me as your bride.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 Is that okay with you? After this, I\u2019ll be traveling countless dimensions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine as long as Shin\u2019s there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia\u2019s voice carried no hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI finally learned to be honest with myself. I\u2019m going to do what my heart\u2019s telling me to. I don\u2019t want to regret anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It feels like everyone is maturing except me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia chuckled at my complaint and dug closer towards my shoulder. Seeing her beautifully arranged hair being messed up, I let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to get your hair done again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. That\u2019s my honest feeling right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m going to start with Luka continent first. I have to transmit back the land that came to Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. Huhu, thanks to my husband, I\u2019ll be able to hold my head up in front of my people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia spoke proudly. After staying still for a bit, she kissed my cheek and got off. Then, staring straight into my face, she asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something you need to do here, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, then I\u2019ll take the others with me. Make sure you come back straight away once you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, wait, Ludia! Dear Husband, me too, me tooooo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also, with Kang Shin\u2026 Ut, don\u2019t grab me. W-With Kang Shin, with Kang Shin\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia dragged away Licorice and Daisy, who were hiding gods knows where. Even if they weren\u2019t resisting at full strength, to be able to drag them away\u2026 Just how strong did she get while I wasn\u2019t watching!?</p><br/><p>[They\u2019ll make fine wives. They\u2019re all so beautiful too.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so too, Peruta.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the voice ringing in my ear, I answered without being surprised.</p><br/><p>[This will be the last time I talk to you like this, huh.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Leaving worlds' powers in their original form, that was a good decision. Because of it, you'll be able take the next step.]</p><br/><p>I shrugged and retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake the next step\u2026 I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s even a foothold to take my step, but\u2026 that\u2019s nice to know.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll look forward to meeting you again someday. Things are interesting over on this side too.]</p><br/><p>\u201cMore interesting than what I experienced in the dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>[You think something like the dungeon is even remotely comparable?]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Ha, there\u2019s just no end to it, is there? Do I have to transcend the physical plane if I want to cross over?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing my complaint, Peruta laughed heartily.</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re most of the way there, so you don\u2019t have to think of it as something so far-off. Well then, I\u2019ll be going now. I\u2019m sure we will meet again one day.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the time comes, spar with me with your real body.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll be looking forward to it.]</p><br/><p>I felt something snap off. I could feel that the connection between Peruta and me vanished completely. It made sense. Now, my body wasn\u2019t too different from Peruta\u2019s. There was no way he could manifest in my body.</p><br/><p>\u201cSherafina and Ciara, they both had a huge misunderstanding until the end\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They had both tunnel-visioned badly. If they had widened their sights by just a bit, they would have been able to grasp what was on the other side. If they did, they would have been able to achieve what they sought isntead of having to resort to their destructive and wasteful plan.</p><br/><p>I let out a small sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, Peika.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un!]</p><br/><p>Peika immediately appeared. Because Fairy Garden empowered elementals, Peika manifested in her beautiful girl form. Today was a joyous day. Peika also looked extremely happy.</p><br/><p>I asked her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you answer Ciara?\u201d</p><br/><p>[What are you talking about, Master?]</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore she died, she was looking for you. Why didn\u2019t you answer her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Peika tilted her head. She opened the parasol she was holding in her hand, covering the sunlight shining down. As she looked at me, she seemed a bit teary.</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t know what you mean, Master.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Suppose there\u2019s a really really reaaaaaaally old elemental. Among the countless stars and countless worlds, she was born in an especially old world at the same time as the stars.]</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Even an existence like that would naturally perish. That\u2019s because eternity isn\u2019t allowed for an elemental without a master.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIs a master required?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un. Elementals are incomplete by nature. They become complete by meeting their master and forming a contract. Just like I did, Ruyue did, Sharana did, and Dortu did.]</p><br/><p>Peika increased the size of her parasol and covered me with it too.</p><br/><p>[The elemental thought, \u2018I want to continue living.\u2019]</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><br/><p>[The best way to achieve that was to make her master live forever, the master that she would be fated to meet one day!]</p><br/><p>\u201cAha.\u201d</p><br/><p>[So the elemental began to think about how to make her master live forever. Eventually, she realized the best way to achieve it.]</p><br/><p>As I already knew what that method was, I gave the answer as I stared at Peika.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo concentrate all worlds\u2019 powers to that master?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un. That was the safest, most risk-free way.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSafest, most risk-free\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Peika continued.</p><br/><p>[That elemental was extremely powerful. In reality, she was no different than the star\u2019s representative. It was the same for other stars\u2019 powers. Right, it wasn\u2019t particularly difficult.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><br/><p>[The elemental set her plan into motion. She connected worlds together and waited for her rightful master to be born. She then picked a suitable person to bestow her power to and made that person connect her with her master.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t that elemental give her power to her master? Why did she go through an intermediary step, Ciara?\u201d</p><br/><p>[The talent of the master the elemental was waiting for was too high. He couldn\u2019t be controlled easily unlike that Ciara girl.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Peika continued.</p><br/><p>[But that only made the elemental happier. Nothing brings more joy to an elemental than having an excellent owner. With all the plans she made, even if a slight miscalculation occurred, she believed she could bring about the result she wanted. So then the elemental formed a contract with her master.]</p><br/><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Peika made a small smile before continuing.</p><br/><p>[But that elemental made one mistake. She had never formed a contract before, so she didn\u2019t know how deep the contractual bond was or how much influence it would have on her. Even if she did, she would surely underestimate it. After being alive for billions of years, she had come to look down on almost everything.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was the problem, huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Her plan continued as planned, but the elemental began to grow weary. \u2018At this rate, Master might become sad.\u2019 \u2018What if Master dies before the plan finishes?\u2019 So she gave him the power of lightning that was only permitted for her and even helped him learn about a powerful mana. \u2026She also bit women who tried to seduce her master. Stupid things like that.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>I ended up just laughing.</p><br/><p>[The elemental was just a fool. She lived for billions of years, but she only really began to live after being connected to her master. Through him, she came to realize many things.]</p><br/><p>\u201cQuite a cute elemental, huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>[In short, the priority of the elemental changed. Between her unhappiness and her master\u2019s unhappiness, she realized her master\u2019s unhappiness pained her more.]</p><br/><p>Peika finished as she reddened her cheeks.</p><br/><p>[An elemental like that would have wanted to hide her true self because she wouldn\u2019t want her master to hate her.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why she ignored Ciara\u2019s dying call.\u201d</p><br/><p>[A psychopathic woman like her wasn\u2019t worth her master\u2019s smile.]</p><br/><p>With that, Peika dropped her head. She looked like a kid who was waiting to get punished.</p><br/><p>Looking at her, all sorts of thoughts crossed my mind. Even though I expected this to happen from the day I fought Lilith, hearing the truth from Peika\u2019s words still shocked me greatly.</p><br/><p>I let out a deep sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need your help a lot from now. So let\u2019s do our best together.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Un!]</p><br/><p>Peika threw away her parasol and jumped into my embrace. All sorts of thoughts filled my mind, but this was the best outcome. Unlike Ciara, I couldn\u2019t just push away Peika because I wanted to.</p><br/><p>Elementals were like that. Just like how I became more important to Peika than herself.</p><br/><p>When I was consoling her silently, Peika carefully lifted her head and asked.</p><br/><p>[Then Master, can I be the seventh bride?]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed my troubles wouldn\u2019t end any time soon.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

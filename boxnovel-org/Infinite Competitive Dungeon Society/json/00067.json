Draconian Lin (5)</p><br/><p>\u201cKugagagaga!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKak!\u201d</p><br/><p>The skeletons followed the Skeleton Knight\u2019s command and attacked me. However, my spear had already left my hand, and the skeletons in its path could not even die meaningful deaths, as their blows scattered in all directions without slowing down the spear in the slightest.</p><br/><p>Naturally, the Skeleton Knight didn\u2019t have the time to dodge it. He hurriedly raised his sword, but the spear was already at his face. His sword bounced off into the air, while my spear pierced through his helmet perfectly and exploded with lightning.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[Kahak! Humaaaan!]</p><br/><p>The Skeleton Knight let out a short scream. His helmet broke into pieces and his skeleton skull was revealed. The Silver Spear was still stuck in along the crack in his forehead as it flickered with lightning. Then, the will-o-wisps in the Skeleton Knight\u2019s eyes burned more violently. He let out an enraged roar, pulling out the Silver Spear and slamming it down on the ground. He then shook his head vehemently and brushed off the pieces of his helmet. At the same time, Peika came out of the Silver Spear and yelled angrily.</p><br/><p>[Kyak! Treating a lady like this, you\u2019re the worst!]</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, come back!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Okay!]</p><br/><p>Gulping down a Middle Potion, I took out the Black Earthen Spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou cowardly skeletons! Stop being scared and come fight me!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You used Provoke! \u2018Almost\u2019 all nearby enemies become hostile toward you!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKugelgel\u2026 Kill Skull Breaker.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show him how hard my bones are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstanding danger and withdrawing is not cowardice, but bravery!\u201d</p><br/><p>While most of the reluctant skeletons started charging towards me with hostility, there was one skeleton that threw out a wise saying as it backed away. Regardless, I used Tempest to take care of them all at once. The sound of dozens of skeletons shattering filled the area.</p><br/><p>[Rise again and kill the enemy! Skeleton Rise!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, when are you going to fight?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kill him!]</p><br/><p>That son of a bitch, he ignored me! Watching the skeletons rise back up like time had just gone backwards, I felt a headache coming. Unlike the zombies, the skeletons could deal damage to me. It meant that I couldn\u2019t just ignore them and go for the Skeleton Knight. In that case\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cTempest!\u201d</p><br/><p>After using a few Tempests to make most of the skeletons incapable of battle, I kicked off the ground where I was standing and charged towards the Skeleton Knight. Shooting away the skeletons getting in the way with my spear, I arrived in front of the Skeleton Knight before he could chant another Skeleton Rise.</p><br/><p>\u201cFight me one on one.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Rise again and\u2026 Kak!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI said, fight me one on one!\u201d</p><br/><p>This bastard, he shuts up when things get disadvantageous for him! I cut off the skeleton mount\u2019s legs, forcing it to kneel. I then stabbed out with my spear consecutively. The Skeleton Knight received my spears with his sword and shouted.</p><br/><p>[Rise again and kill the\u2026 Kak!]</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see how long you can chant for!\u201d</p><br/><p>Every time he swung his sword once, I stabbed with my spear three times. Once at the skeleton mount\u2019s head, once at the Skeleton Knight\u2019s sword, and once at his face! After some time, the skeleton mount, who was unable to withstand the flurry of attacks, scattered into pieces. The Skeleton Knight became speechless as he finally set his foot on the ground.</p><br/><p>Of course, because of the over 60 cm difference in our height, I was like a little kid looking up at an adult.</p><br/><p>[Rise again\u2026 Kuhuk!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of hearing it, you son of a bitch!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even while he was chanting, he managed to block my Heroic Strike with his sword. Perhaps because it was a Floor Master\u2019s weapon, there wasn\u2019t a single crack on his weapon. Even so, he had to take a few steps back from the vast force he had to withstand.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, just keep chanting!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was probably no one who deserved to get his knighthood revoked more than him! I gritted my teeth and assaulted the Skeleton Knight, who was irritating me from the very beginning. Unlike the 25th Floor Master, his skills had a certain depth to them. Even so, he couldn\u2019t win against me with his mindset!</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[Kyak! You, Skull Breakeeeeer!]</p><br/><p>The Skeleton Knight\u2019s armor quickly began to crumble. It was the result of him being unable to completely block my attacks. If it wasn\u2019t for his skeleton body that never grew tired, he would have been knocked out from the exhaustion already.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[Kyak, kyaaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>It was then. Unable to finish chanting Skeleton Rise, the Skeleton Knight, whose breastplate shattered completely, let out a scream like he could no longer endure it. Immediately afterwards, my movements stopped. I wondered if it was a time stopping ability (The World[1. Jojo reference (Dio\u2019s time stopping ability)]), but that wasn\u2019t it. It was just that my movements were slowed to the extreme.</p><br/><p>[Skeleton Knight uses \u2018Undead Roar\u2019! Those with living bodies are slowed to 5 percent of their maximum speed!]</p><br/><p>\u201cO\u2026r\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Argh, even my talking speed got slower! Being relieved that I just now learned how to activate skills without saying their names, I activated Divine Speed. When I noticed it had succeeded, my next action was clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You used Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry! All party members are cleansed of negative status effects. All party members\u2019 attack power increases by 50 percent for the duration. All party members become super-armored, unfazed by enemy attacks.]</p><br/><p>The sense of weakness that enveloped me disappeared. It was a suffocating moment I didn\u2019t even want to think about. I released the tension I felt in my shoulders and aimed my spear at the Skeleton Knight.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>[H-How!? My Undead Roar!]</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u201d</p><br/><p>From then on, I simply beat him up, again and again until his skull shattered. This time, I was completely silent so as to prevent him from doing anything strange. The few skeletons that had remained alive also backed away in order to not get in my way.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just want to quietly commit suicide.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even breathe. He\u2019ll notice!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be beaten to death by him\u2026 let\u2019s just kill each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d</p><br/><p>[A Grand Achievement! You defeated the Floor Master, Skeleton Knight, alone! Amazing!]</p><br/><p>[You became level 31. You obtained the qualification to advance to the 31st floor.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained 5 bonus stats.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained the title, \u2018Skeleton Knight Slayer.\u2019 All stats permanently increase by 1. This effect will apply even if the title is not equipped.]</p><br/><p>[You became Silver Rank 6. Congratulations.]</p><br/><p>[You defeated the Skeleton Knight alone. You obtained the special reward, \u2018Skeleton Knight\u2019s Plate Armor Top.\u2019]</p><br/><p>[You obtained 50,000 gold.]</p><br/><p>[Choose your reward.]</p><br/><p>[1. Riding Magic Book.]</p><br/><p>I looked around and placed the silent wilderness\u2019 scenery in my eyes. All the skeletons had disappeared and everything was still in the moonlit wilderness. \u2018Huu\u2019 Letting out a sigh, I checked the solo raid reward. Riding Magic Book?</p><br/><p>[You learned Riding. You can ride and battle on horses, elephants, Pegasi, cars, tanks, etc., and all disadvantages from riding them disappears.]</p><br/><p>It was an amazing magic. It covered animal riding and even tank piloting! It made sense that it was considered magic rather than a technique. All knowledge and techniques pertaining to \u2018riding\u2019 were engraved into my mind. As long as it was rideable, I knew the way of doing so. Unfortunately, there wasn\u2019t a method of riding a Gundam. Realizing that there were no Gundams in the world, I became slightly disappointed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe solo raid rewards are really all special\u2026 Let\u2019s go back now.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Master, spear!]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>With Peika\u2019s reminder, I picked up the Silver Spear I threw out. Then, I opened the door standing unnaturally in one corner of the wilderness. The Floor Shop was only a few steps away. Lin who was there batted his eyes after seeing me come out. When I closed the door, his mouth opened wide. The cigarette that was in his mouth fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou forgot my name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, pa, passed? In one try?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO-One. One\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin almost seemed out of breath as he opened and closed his mouth repeatedly. His thick lizard tail was spinning around as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many? How many people passed? No, it must have been ten! How did you gather a full party in just one day? It usually takes four days for ten people to gather\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>I really did wonder what he was talking about.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said to clear the dungeon alone. Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I said clear the dungeon, I, of course, meant the ordinary floors. How would you clear the boss raid alo\u2026 alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin shut his mouth tightly. I tilted my head, distributed my level up bonus stats, and stretched my body to challenge the boss again. Then, Lin suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cUntil the 25th floor! Did you do solo raids?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa\u2026 That means the number of skills in your pocket watch is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin took out a new cigarette and put it in his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat woman, she put me with you on purpose\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta did? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe probably expected me to pick a fight with you. Then I\u2019d undoubtedly make a bet and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I thought he was overthinking it and simply laughed it off. Lin, on the other hand, had a rotten expression. He wasn\u2019t even smoking the cigarette in his mouth, only gnawing on it. Finally, he let out a deep sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I suffered such a blow. I\u2019m the one at fault for being tricked but\u2026 you\u2019re not bad yourself, Earth\u2019s Hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said don\u2019t call me that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know anymore. Just go as far as you want. This Lin-nim will watch over you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, that was almost exactly the same thing Loretta said.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Ah\u2026 is that so\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>I thought that was it, but Lin\u2019s expression became even worse. Although I really wanted to take a before-and-after photo of Lin\u2019s pretty face, I unfortunately didn\u2019t have a camera. After all, there was no reason to carry around a camera in my inventory.</p><br/><p>Come to think of it, this boar that was filling up 240 spaces in my inventory, I had to take care of it somehow. If I brought it out on Earth, people would notice it instantly, and it wouldn\u2019t fit on the dungeon floor\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Ei, I\u2019ll have to keep it for now.\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

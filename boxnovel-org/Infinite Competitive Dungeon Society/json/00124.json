You in the World of Sunset (2)</p><br/><p>Hunting the Wendigo by myself was extremely easy, but I could still get Frozen Crystals even if I added a few more people to my party. As such, I decided to hunt the Wendigo in parties. When the explorers stuck on 50th floor saw me, they immediately recognized me as Crown Prince.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince is already on the 50th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA miracle. 50th floor already\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut even Crown Prince should have hard time breaking through the 50th floor. He\u2019ll be stuck here too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re done talking nonsense, we\u2019re going in.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the fight against Wendigo, everyone else had only one job to do. It was to stay as far away from Wendigo as possible. I didn\u2019t know because Ruyue\u2019s power was protecting me, but the freezing energy that the Wendigo emitted was no joke. Even if priests casted protection magic with all their strength, veteran warriors, who had climbed all the way to the 50th floor, still had difficulties.</p><br/><p>[Guaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>[Shin, that\u2019s a cold attack!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, the 50th Floor Master Wendigo also had a special attack skill. With its hand dyed white, it drew a large trace. If one even glazed it, he would be frozen for a moment regardless of his resistance. I did not experience it in my first raid, so I ended up being caught by surprise in my second raid. Thankfully, Ruyue protected me with a barrier while I was frozen.</p><br/><p>Moreover, because of my high resistance, I became unfrozen in 5 seconds. It seemed the Wendigo could not use it consecutively. With a bewildered face, it tried to kick me, which simply led me to beating it up. In truth, this was the first time I wasn\u2019t looking forward to the Floor Master skill.</p><br/><p>However, there were three slots left in the pocket watch to store skills in. Since I felt that the subclass would transform once the skills were filled, I planned to take whatever skills I could get. If getting to the 60th floor would take longer than I expected, I considered putting Crimson Scale Armor\u2019s Crimson Roar into the pocket watch too.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaat.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the Wendigo tried to swipe at me with its whitened arm, I created a plate of ice in the air with Ruyue\u2019s power and leapt up. As the Wendigo looked up in vain, I grinned and shouted, \u201cThunder Spear!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Choose your reward.]</p><br/><p>[1. Wendigo\u2019s Fur Coat</p><br/><p>2. High-grade Health Potion</p><br/><p>3. Frozen Crystal</p><br/><p>4. Frozen Dart]</p><br/><p>Eh? Didn\u2019t I come in with 6 people? When I turned around while swallowing the Frozen Crystal, I saw three explorers hugging each other while shaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cC-C-Crown Prince, h-h-h-how are you completely fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cH-H-H-H-He said h-he had an ele-elemental.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-It\u2019s s-so cold! I-I\u2019m going t-to die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 The other two?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF-Froze to d-death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>My Wendigo party raids generally ended like this. In truth, I wanted to screw grinding and just get it over with.</p><br/><p>Ludia was completely fine when she was next to me. But when I tried to separate from her, she showed signs of mental instability. Thinking that she had gone back to her normal self was only my wishful thinking.</p><br/><p>Whether we were eating, reading books, listening to music, knitting, drinking tea, or whatnot, the moment I tried to go out of her sight, she tried to scream in protest. Of course, I considered it my punishment for killing her sister and accepted it. I was just glad that I could serve as her emotional pillar.</p><br/><p>However, I couldn\u2019t let it stay like this. Right now, it was fine since I had a lot of free time with only hunting the Wendigo three times a day. But once I finished grinding, I planned to go to America. I couldn\u2019t bring Ludia along.</p><br/><p>When I told her, her reaction was extremely concerning.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You\u2019re abandoning me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m coming back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you the only one living here? My parents and Yua are here too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLiar, liar. When I wake up one day, everything will be gone. I\u2019ll be the only one left in this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, it\u2019s that. You\u2019re going to leave me and go fight someone again. the D-Demon Lord chased after us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-Take me with you. Take me with you, please. I don\u2019t want to be left by myself like a fool again.\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t look like she\u2019d listen no matter what I said, so I shut my mouth and held Ludia\u2019s hands. Ludia took the opportunity to throw herself into my embrace and didn\u2019t let go. When I raised my head, not knowing what to do, mother opened the door in the perfect time with a plate full of fruits. Then, she smiled kindly and closed the door. Damn it, I didn\u2019t like that needlessly kind consideration!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go. If you\u2019re going, take me with you. Please?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous if you come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, take me with you. Let me go too.\u201d</p><br/><p>She really didn\u2019t listen! It seemed she wouldn\u2019t let go until I agreed to take her. In the end, I sighed and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are two conditions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, you have to hide your identity. This is easy since you can buy an item called Otus\u2019 Secret from the Floor Shop.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond, you have to get stronger. I can\u2019t take you if you don\u2019t break through the 40th floor at least.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 40th floor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia\u2019s eyes trembled slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m only in the entrance of the 36th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are still 3 weeks until I finish grinding the 50th floor. I\u2019m sure you can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-Then I\u2019d have to be away from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, since I can\u2019t go back to the 36th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I can\u2019t. No. I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m going to leave you behind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, aah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia looked at me like the world just crumbled down. The next moment, she suddenly looked brighter as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anyone to party with me now. Shuna still can\u2019t take a foot out of the Residential Area.\u201d</p><br/><p>I had forgotten about Shuna until now,. Ludia had known about Shuna, but didn\u2019t go back to the dungeon even once, and was only now using her as an excuse. I thought for a moment which of us were worse, but I didn\u2019t say anything, concluding that we were both bad.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Ellos\u2019 party is waiting for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cK-Kasina is\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia retorted as if she\u2019d never imagined it. \u2018So she\u2019s not that close to Ellos\u2026\u2019 Thinking to myself, I nodded. Ellos had actually messaged me recently.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s waiting for your return on the 36th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No. I can\u2019t anymore. I lost my confidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if you can\u2019t clear the 40th floor, I won\u2019t take you with me. I\u2019m not lying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No\u2026 R-Right, I can\u2019t go back to them alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Shuna will be there too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShuna can\u2019t climb the dungeon anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuna had no house nor guild. It was unlikely that other guilds would take her in. That\u2019s what Ludia said.</p><br/><p>Since it came to this, I decided to tell Ludia the truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, you see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking around my Special Mansion, Ludia made a blank expression. She saw more than one hundred rooms, swimming pool and grand bath, basement training room and personal training room, grand dining hall and basement storage room, and finally the Giant Iron Boar ruining the garden\u2019s look. Speaking of the Giant Iron Boar, it was now reduced to 20 meters from 60 meters in size. Ludia shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to live here with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to found a guild.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia made an expression like she just stepped on dung, and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we just make it our home?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we can\u2019t. Weren\u2019t you Miss Shuna\u2019s best friend? What about Miss Shuna?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give my house to Shuna. It\u2019s easy to transfer ownership. That way, Shuna can become an independent explorer too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cW-Well, I\u2019m\u2026 of course\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia\u2019s faced turned red, as she looked down and pulled on my sleeve. I lightly pulled my sleeve back and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee, out of words, right? I\u2019m going to make a guild.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I hate you. I hate you so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, you can hate me as much as you want. Though, I won\u2019t hate you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou big insensitive idiot! I really want to kill you\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Making a guild was easier than I thought. I just had to visit the Residential Area\u2019s administrator and submit the necessary documents. But when I went to see Meladel, he opened his mouth after seeing Ludia linking her arms with me.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You. Who is that lady?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, dear lord. Is this the fate of a Hero\u2026? My poor Master\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop speaking nonsense and take my guild creation application.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Meladel accepted my application, he continued to say incomprehensible things like, \u2018Do you like boats?\u2019 or \u2018I suggest you wear an abdominal belt.\u2019 Then, messages popped up in front of my eyes.</p><br/><p>[You created a guild! You became the guild master of the F rank guild, \u2018Revival\u2019!]</p><br/><p>[Guild member: Kang Shin (Guild Master, Gold), Palludia Gren Ehuir (Guild Member, Silver). Total: 2]</p><br/><p>[You can raise the guild rank by increasing the number of guild members or by making achievements by clearing Event Dungeons or Event Raids. With higher guild rank, your guild will become more well-known in the dungeon, giving you better rewards in Event Raids and giving you more freedom in the dungeon.]</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t much. It didn\u2019t increase my strength. As I didn\u2019t expect anything, I didn\u2019t feel disappointed either.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can request a guild emblem when you become D rank. People from famous guilds usually wear brooches or capes engraved with their guild emblem to show their status.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike a uniform?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMore like empty show.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even while I was talking with Meladel, Ludia stayed still. She must have heard the messages too. Then, she murmured silently.</p><br/><p>\u201cRevival\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 It\u2019s a word from Earth\u2019s language called English. It means resurrection, recovery, or resurgence. I wanted to use the Korean word for it, but it said there\u2019s already a guild by that name.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBhuWhal[1. \ubd80\ud65c (Bhu Whal) = Revival in Korean]. It means \u2018toy\u2019 in Syrnor continent\u2019s language.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would they make a guild with that meaning!? Are the guild members the guild master\u2019s toy? Ek.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, I felt weight on my back. I turned around and saw Ludia who had her face buried in my back. I couldn\u2019t see her face. Flustered, I talked to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cL-Ludia?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia\u2026 Ludia?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia said in a small voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try\u2026 climbing the dungeon. I\u2019ll contact Shuna\u2026 and Kasina too. I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know why she was suddenly so willing. Perhaps, she felt a sense of security at the fact that she belonged to a guild with me. Perhaps, she had been strengthening her determination this entire time. Perhaps\u2026</p><br/><p>I could think of many possibilities, but I didn\u2019t ask her. It was fine the way it was now.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Thanks for taking a step forward, Ludia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn\u2026 Un.\u201d</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>I had a dream.</p><br/><p>The sky burned and dark smoke shot up.</p><br/><p>Morning didn\u2019t wake and night didn\u2019t sleep.</p><br/><p>Fairies that remained in fantasies were chased out to reality. Holding their torn wings, they cursed humans.</p><br/><p>\u201cXXX, I always think why I always go through such hardships when I involve myself with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cX, that\u2019s wrong. Those that can say they went through hardships after involving themselves with X are those that survive. It\u2019s usually hard to survive after involving oneself with X.\u201d</p><br/><p>Under a bloodstained sunset, a giant and a handsome young man were exchanging jokes. One held an enormous claymore and the other held a longsword, which were both suitably big for their masters size.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all noisy. Go out and kill the monsters. Be careful so blood doesn\u2019t splatter onto me. Also, if you curse X, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWitch, shut up and prepare your flames. Because of your laid-back attitude, I thought I\u2019d see the afterlife today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys[2. \u2018Guys\u2019 was in English.], I just thought up an extremely funny joke. Don\u2019t fight and calm down! Lizard King is the king of the lizardmen, right? But if you look, there are 5 Lizard Kings running at us! What do you think this is? The small kingdoms have joined!\u201d</p><br/><p>A red witch, black assassin, cheerful gunner, and several others. Although there weren\u2019t many, each of them were incredibly strong allies.</p><br/><p>\u201cXa, are you ready?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXX, your armor is really cool!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, it really is. At least it\u2019ll garner full attention. I praise thy courage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone wearing an armor radiating five-colored brilliance stepped forward, setting them all side. Even though it was my first time seeing him, my heart dropped a beat. I had the same reaction every time. From the first time I saw him to even now.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have the strongest body here anyways. Really, there are probably no other guilds where the guild master is treated like a punching bag. Alright\u2026 Revival, we\u2019re going.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cX!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, right. XXX\u2026 Can I leave it to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Standing tall in a world of sunset alone, he turned and smiled at me. I held myself back from mixing up business and private affairs, and shouted confidently, \u2018Of course!\u2019 Along with a prayer in my heart, hoping to be of help to the one I love.</p><br/><p>\u201cO Power, O Blessing vested in the Earth! We will fight to protect thee, let us borrow thy power! O Mitarus, bless and sublimate this power!\u201d</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Just because I kept the narration in first person POV, it doesn\u2019t mean it will always be that way!</p><br/><p>Also, I already warned that you\u2019d regret it if you read the last chapter half-heartedly!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>It\u2019s hard to show it in English, but each of the Xs is one syllable. Xa = Yua (I think); just mentioning that one because X is English, making Xa look weird\u2026</p><br/><p>You guys can do the detective work for the other ones if you\u2019d like :P</p><br/><p>There are enough clues to figure out all the names and whose POV the dream was in.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He had returned to the dungeon when the fight at the Vatican City ended, and now he had come to Marianne\u2019s Garden after I requested him to. When I called him to the reception room and sat him down, he suddenly asked an unexpected question.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have too many women?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about other things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have Loretta, but you sure are greedy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about other things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Greedy\u2026 I couldn\u2019t say I wasn\u2019t greedy, but this was the best for everyone! \u2026 Still, saying that pricked my heart.</p><br/><p>Was it wrong to want to make everyone happy!? \u2026 Well, maybe it was.</p><br/><p>Damn it! I can\u2019t even come to my own defense! I still hadn\u2019t gotten myself out of Korean mindset. Who could blame me? I was Korean after all!</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. I\u2019ve experienced similar things. Still, it\u2019s your fault for being born this way. It shouldn\u2019t have been hard to reject them early on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know things would turn out this way. Besides, I wasn\u2019t born like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t invite him to ask for romantic advice, so I changed the topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you make up your mind?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was genuinely surprised. Compared to your enemies, you and your allies are shockingly strong. I was even doubting whether the dungeon set its mind to develop you all.\u201d</p><br/><p>I grinned. If that\u2019s what it looked like, it was probably because Earth\u2019s power was distributed to select ability users when monsters first invaded Earth. Unlike in other worlds, these abilities let many of us grow stronger more quickly.</p><br/><p>That said, since mana cultivation methods weren\u2019t widespread on Earth, this couldn\u2019t be called a huge advantage. Moreover, this wasn\u2019t the work of the dungeon, but the work of someone else, who wielded Earth\u2019s power and gave it to us.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe pretty much cleaned up most of the monsters\u2019 forces. Unfortunately, there are hundreds of thousands of demons, or perhaps even more. We haven\u2019t even met the most important Demon Lord yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon Lord\u2026 I might have fought against demons in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he made a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you know, I don\u2019t really fear many things. Let us cooperate\u2026 For what lies beyond.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before I noticed, Kain was holding two glasses in his hand. For a moment, I thought he took them out from his inventory, but that wasn\u2019t it. It was a spatial magic. Using his magic power, he created an external space connected to him that allowed him to store and take out items. The inventory would be an evolved version of this magic.</p><br/><p>I knit my brows.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you learn that from Loretta?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to get jealous. You\u2019re the one she loves now, and for me\u2026 she was just a kind shopkeeper noona and a teacher that taught me many things. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shopkeeper noona. To be honest, hearing that from someone else made me feel strange. Not to mention, the look in his eyes and his manner of speech\u2026</p><br/><p>I snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie. I didn\u2019t come all the way here being a child.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Regardless, she wasn\u2019t my lover.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t deny my accusation and evaded the topic. Then, he took out a bottle of liquor with an unknown label.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need any more love. Revenge. That\u2019s enough. For that, I will cooperate with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe last bottle. It\u2019s from my world. Consider it honor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This bottle had to have a special meaning for him. I took the glass from him without a word and let him pour the bottle\u2019s content in it. I then took the bottle from him and poured it into his glass. With that, we toasted.</p><br/><p>As I gulped down the liquor, an indescribably pungent smell of a strong liquor invaded my nose, and as if to appease this feeling of suffocation, a spicy sweetness spread down my throat. My chest felt heavy. Something seemed to fill up my insides and in an instant, it burst.</p><br/><p>I remained calm with my eyes closed and savored the shock this single glass of alcohol gave me. Soon, I opened my eyes narrowly and asked him.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Can a drink\u2019s alcohol content go over 100%?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Don\u2019t be stupid and take another glass.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt relieved that Father and Walker wasn\u2019t here. Eventually, Kain and I emptied the bottle of liquor, and I went straight into the dungeon. If Father found out, I was afraid he would attack me.</p><br/><p>Monsters appearing in Beyond\u2019s 31st floor was none other than Succubus Queens. Compared to the Succubus Queen appearing as the First Dungeon\u2019s 65th Floor Master, Beyond\u2019s Succubus Queens seemed to have higher charm on top of appearing by the hundreds. For ordinary men, this place was worthy of the name Heaven. Though, of course, they would get chased out soon after having their vitality sucked out.</p><br/><p>For me, however, this place was one of the easiest floors of Beyond.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could this be!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAah, strength is leaving my body.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the Succubus Queens saw me, most of them used Sweet Nightmare and with my charm being absurdly high, they received the penalty for their skills failing and blanked out. I simply had stabbed them with my spear and moved on.</p><br/><p>The purpose of Beyond\u2019s 31st floor was most likely learning how to attack the Succubus Queens while dodging their Sweet Nightmare attacks. For me, none of this mattered. I swung my spear practically randomly as I charged towards the Succubus Queens.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it, but that man is well beyond our capabilities!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of our first customer!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCurtain of Night!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKiss of Death!\u201d</p><br/><p>About half way through the 31s floor, the Succubus Queens began attacking me with different methods. I knew from Licorice that Succubus Queens were also skilled in normal magic. However, Licorice was special even among Succubus Queens, and even though they were strengthened by Beyond, their magic wasn\u2019t capable of reaching me. Absolute Soul perfectly defend against any of their mental attacks, and their attribute magic could be easily blocked with Ruyue\u2019s power. Even in the worst case, I just had to use Sharana\u2019s power to strengthen my defense.</p><br/><p>\u201cAah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not strong enough to fight him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if we try to hold him back, we\u2019ll only be wasting our time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can feel his aura is similar to ours.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I seemed close to breaking through the 31st floor, Succubus Queens began to step back like they lost their spirit. It wasn\u2019t like they used Sweet Nightmare, so what was happening? Just when I was thinking that and tilting my head, one of them stepped forward towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy any chance, did you form a contract with another Succubus Queen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d</p><br/><p>When was the last time I had a conversation in Beyond instead of fighting? Slightly taken aback, I replied obediently. To show that my guard wasn\u2019t down, I gripped my spear tightly and spun it in my hand. I then stared at her and asked my own question.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose of us called to Beyond are lacking in purity, but most of our abilities and memories are remaining.\u201d</p><br/><p>She smiled lightly. There were others who smiled at the same time as her, and I noticed that the Succubus Queens looked similar. The Succubus Queen in front of me seemed to have noticed my eyes shining, as she nodded her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, they\u2019re all me. After all, how could there be so many Succubus Queens in Enesis? To be precise, they\u2019re fakes created with mana and slightly altered souls. If you ask which one is real, we can\u2019t answer you because even we don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The price the losers had to pay was even more cruel than I thought. That said, I imagined it would be something like this. Even though I knew Enesis was the one that invaded Elesia, I couldn\u2019t help but sympathize with them. Of course, if they showed any sign of hostility, I was fully prepared to smash their heads with my spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cThankfully, we\u2019re on a high floor, so we haven\u2019t regenerated yet and our thinly scattered soul is preserved. I think someone might have mentioned it before. You see, you\u2019re our first customer.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time I was officially notified that I had achieved the highest level anyone has ever climbed to in Beyond. Of course, as I didn\u2019t expect another explorer to have surpassed Kain, I wasn\u2019t too surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to cut to the chase. Does the Succubus Queen you\u2019re contracted to have pink hair?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>A strange air flowed among the succubi, but that was only for a moment. Soon, all succubi nodded altogether and stepped back.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen as we thought, you can\u2019t be measured with our abilities. Go to the 35th floor. She\u2019ll be waiting for you there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ruler of us all.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Succubus Queen sparkled her eyes and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cLilith. The one you guys would call world\u2019s enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>I flinched. I was caught off guard in the most unexpected place. I already had a skill called Lilith\u2019s Temptation. If I could meet her in Beyond\u2019s 35th floor and defeat her\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell the incubi about it, so you can just pass through them. Though\u2026 some of them might not accept it and attack you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I thought you\u2019d say. You can go now, charming boy.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it was the past me, I would have hunted down even the monsters that didn\u2019t resist. But now, I was different. Knowing that these guys were once Licorice\u2019s comrades and the tragic fate they had to endure, I didn\u2019t really feel like fighting. After talking to them, I didn\u2019t feel like it even more.</p><br/><p>Most importantly, I wasn\u2019t so rich in time to fight ones that didn\u2019t pick a fight with me. Not to mention, succubi and incubi were monsters with extremely high attainment in charm rather than martial arts. I didn\u2019t think fighting them would let me surpass my limits in any way. That said, I was looking forward to meeting this Lilith on the 35th floor.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, it seemed there really were worlds\u2019 enemies waiting on the higher floors of the dungeon. At this point, I had a suspicion that the dungeon wasn\u2019t made for explorers to climb fully. It felt like unpassable floors were created just for the sake of having more floors.</p><br/><p>As I thought of these useless things, I bid my farewell and passed by the Succubus Queens.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, can you do us a final favor and sleep with us just once\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>With one Succubus Queens being knocked down and dragged away by the others, all monsters slowly disappeared from my sight.</p><br/><p>Then, the gate to the First Dungeon opened.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go again.\u201d</p><br/><p>First Dungeon\u2019s 82nd floor. Waiting for me there should be an even stronger version of 81st floor\u2019s Crimson Hell.</p><br/><p>The peak of the dungeon, what once felt so out of touch, was now fully within my grasp. Day by day, I could feel myself getting closer to it. It wouldn\u2019t be long. Until I reached that place and until they reached me.</p><br/><p>I stepped forward.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

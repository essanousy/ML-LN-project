(1)</p><br/><p>[You have consumed the Succubus Queen\u2019s Tattoo Invigoration Elixir to the limit. The Succubus Queen\u2019s Tattoo became enhanced to its peak performance. Magic and charm increases by 14. The power of all skills and Authorities is multiplied by 1.5 times.]</p><br/><p>[You equipped the Succubus Queen Set. Your magic and charm increases by 35. When the Succubus Queen Set is equipped, you can use \u2018Sweet Nightmare\u2019 once per day.]</p><br/><p>[When Sweet Nightmare is used against a target with lower charm than you, you will steal half of the target\u2019s health and inflict \u2018critical charm\u2019 status effect to the target. When Sweet Nightmare is used against a target with higher charm than you, you will lose half of your health and mana, and fall into \u2018inescapable avolition\u2019 status effect.]</p><br/><p>The day I made Ren fall into that hellish trap, I successfully completed my Succubus Queen grind. As magic and charm increased by 4 points every time they increased by invigoration elixirs, with the 14 points that went up at the end, my magic and charm had increased by 50 points total. In effect, the Succubus Queen\u2019s Tattoo was increasing my magic and charm by a terrifying 100 points.</p><br/><p>Plus, the tattoo\u2019s effect didn\u2019t just increase my stats. In addition to doubling the effect of my charm against the opposite sex, I could double my mana once per day.</p><br/><p>Although the hidden meaning behind it was incredibly disturbing, I had no choice but to use it since it was undoubtedly helpful. Within my skill arsenal, there were quite a few skills that were affected by charm. Provoke, Overwhelm, Absolute Soul, half of the Elementalist skills, half of the Tamer skills, and so on. In fact, it might be easier to say that only my Spear Technique was unaffected by charm. I couldn\u2019t tell if charm was that important, or if my skills were just strange.</p><br/><p>\u201c50% increase to skills is one thing\u2026 but Authorities\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Evil Eyes of Petrification might be included.</p><br/><p>My Evil Eyes were arguably the ability that was most sensitive to my magic and charm stats. While the result of its effect was based on my magic stat, it was also amplified by the difference of league between me and my target, and the negative emotions the target had toward me.</p><br/><p>With how things were turning out, it was almost as if the Evil Eyes of Petrification was created to become mine.</p><br/><p>After all, just obtaining the Succubus Queen\u2019s Tattoo had nearly increased my Evil Eyes\u2019 strength by half, but now that it was fully upgraded, it gave another 50% boost. I was itching to test it out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill I be able to petrify monsters in Beyond now? No, that\u2019s probably wishful thinking\u2026 Well, let\u2019s go clean up monster territories on Earth later and test it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it had only been a few days, the succubi battle units had swiftly taken care of a countless number of monsters. No matter how stealthy they were, with the discernible results they produced, it was difficult to remain hidden. After all, satellite observations revealed the number of monsters clearly dwindling.</p><br/><p>As if to satiate the hunger they\u2019d be holding in all this time, the succubi sucked all monsters\u2019 seeds dry. As monsters absorbed by the succubi\u2019s magic didn\u2019t leave behind their corpses or even Mana Stones, such an expression wasn\u2019t an exaggeration. Just like that, Earth slowly began to contain fewer monsters. Although now wasn\u2019t a good time, Revival\u2019s members should soon be able to join the succubi in sweeping the monsters away.</p><br/><p>Soon, countries that lost their lands to monsters after Two Moon would be able to reclaim them. Soon. As soon as I thought that my heart began to pound. I, a single dungeon explorer, would come to command such a large-scale operation. The past me who just found out about the dungeon would never have imagined it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we can do it. In fact, we could even exterminate all monsters and demons before the worlds\u2019 enemies arrive.\u201d</p><br/><p>I murmured with a smile. Thinking about what kind of an expression the Demon Lord would have upon our reunion, I began to look forward to the future.</p><br/><p>Thanks to toiling away for ten days, I could now somewhat naturally conceal my charm. As the charm stat was related to the magic stat to a certain degree, I could block the release of charm by circulating Peruta Circuit.</p><br/><p>Although the process was easily described in words, with how much charm I came to exude, completely containing it took some effort. Regardless, there was no longer any problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, seeing as how happy you are, you must have finished grinding.\u201d*</p><br/><p>\u201cYep. Floor Master skills really are amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, come to think of it, the 65th Floor Master\u2019s skill wasn\u2019t the type of skill I hoped for. I was hoping I could synthesize it with the skills I got from the 60th Floor Master and 10th Floor Beyond Master\u2026 Of course, Sweet Nightmare was still a powerful skill, just that it was nothing more than a suicide skill without high charm.</p><br/><p>All this time, I wondered why the Succubus Queen blanked out when I had yet to do anything. I thought it was a bug of some sort, but it turned out that they were dazed from their failed skill. As for me, since my charm was higher than even the Succubus Queen's, it seemed I didn\u2019t need to worry about the skill\u2019s penalty too much.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m off then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeyond\u2019s 15th floor, of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRest a bit. Rest! With me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta shouted, but I shook my head with a grin.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can play after I clear Beyond\u2019s 15th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta shot up her arms in pure happiness. After smiling at her one last time, I headed to the gate leading to Beyond\u2019s 15th floor. At that moment, Loretta suddenly shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! Beyond\u2019s 15th floor!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, what about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaaak, that place\u2026 not even Beyond explorers had succeeded in breaking through on their first try! Wait, I\u2019ll threaten Old\u2026 Lord and give some advantage to Shin-nim\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, it\u2019s\u2026 already too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>Half of my body was already through the gate. Loretta frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cGeez! When you die, come to Fairy Garden! Then we can play together!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt sounds like you're sentencing me to death!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I shouted at Loretta who seemed to be certain that I would die. The next moment, the surrounding scenery changed. I had entered Beyond\u2019s 15th floor, where even the mighty Beyond explorers had failed to break through on their first try.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince I\u2019m here, it\u2019s not like I can run away\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>With a hint of anxiousness, I murmured as I stared at the door in front of me. Not a single Beyond explorer succeeded on their first try? Did that include Ren\u2019s father and \u2018that person\u2019 from Beyond\u2019s Residential Area?</p><br/><p>At that moment, I remembered that Revival had a reliable senior Beyond explorer. I immediately messaged her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaisy.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un.]</p><br/><p>She replied extremely quickly. She also sounded energetic.</p><br/><p>[At the mansion. Sumire made me food. Delicious.]</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, that\u2019s good\u2026 There\u2019s something I need to ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m eating. Busy.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you cleared Beyond\u2019s 15th floor?\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Still on the 82nd floor. Beat Beyond\u2019s 14th floor. Kang Shin, you\u2019re at 15th?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I was going to ask you about it\u2026 but never mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Wait for me. 15th floor, together.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un. Form a party, then enter. Same floor, possible.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 But I\u2019m already inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Master doubting guild member\u2019s potential, not good.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t think we could challenge Beyond as parties. We can challenge the 16th floor together then.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m back to eating.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>I finished my conversation with Daisy, who seemed to be sulking. It would have been nice if she told me about it beforehand\u2026 Looks like she didn\u2019t think I would arrive at the 15th floor so quickly.</p><br/><p>Daisy seemed to have wanted to challenge the 15th floor with me. It made sense why. Although we were far apart in the First Dungeon, since our progress in Beyond was about even, it was undoubtedly better to challenge the Floor Master together, especially since there was a high chance of dying. No matter how important the solo-clear reward was, it wasn\u2019t worth wasting a month\u2019s worth of time.</p><br/><p>That said, even if we cleared the 15th floor together, Daisy\u2019s Dungeon clearing speed was different compared to mine. After all, she was around the 80s level and I was around 60s. I could climb the First Dungeon in just a few hours. Although I didn\u2019t think this would continue forever, I would still be faster than Daisy for a while. If we tried to match our speed, we would end up wasting more time than necessary.</p><br/><p>Of course, it still would have been nice to clear the 15th floor together\u2026 Damn.</p><br/><p>\u201cEeei, it\u2019s too late. Let\u2019s just go in.\u201d</p><br/><p>I held my crossbow. The moment I saw the Floor Master\u2019s weapon, I planned on firing dozens of bolts and instantly using Weapon Swap. That way, my spear would get the bonus from Weapon Swap.</p><br/><p>I also summoned my elementals. As I wanted to place more emphasis on power than speed, I infused Peika into my weapon. To bolster my defense and create chances to counterattack, I infused Ruyue in my armor. Finally, to further increase my already quick speed, to gain the ability to fly, and to increase my overall ability, I infused Sharana into my body.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, I released the charm I was suppressing. Most likely as a result of Spirit of the Tamer, a sweet scent began to spread out. Uuu, although it was my own ability, I found it unpleasant.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis might be the perfect chance to use Sky God\u2019s Rage. In fact, I may have saved it for this very moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>I kicked open the door. Then, as always, I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cFight me! You\u2026 huk.\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t help but gasp. A large, truly humongous space was waiting for me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The 15th floor\u2019s Beyond Master should have the traits of the Skeleton Knight and the Giant Ghoul. That is to say, it should be made of bones, have rotting flesh, be an undead, have great regeneration ability, and have terrifying charging ability\u2026</p><br/><p>[Guoooooooooooo!]</p><br/><p>It roared. Several spots where chunks of flesh were missing revealed its eerie black bones, while its tail was only made of bones as it swayed in the air threateningly. Its skin was certainly rotting, though most of its body was made of bones. Although I couldn\u2019t be sure, I had the feeling it had an incredible regeneration ability and possessed an unavoidable charge skill. Of course, it was undoubtedly an undead.</p><br/><p>[Guaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>[Dragon Zombie used \u2018Roar of Resentment\u2019! All living beings fall under a powerful curse and have their bodies mutated by resentment of evil. High-ranking chaos and fear permeates the area.]</p><br/><p>[Your pure soul perfectly countered the curse! You nullify all mental status effects. Your immunity to mutations prevents your body from mutating!]</p><br/><p>The fact that I could counter this terrifying roar was certainly a good thing. However, there was something more important.</p><br/><p>\u201cRather than looking down on explorers that failed on their first try, don\u2019t I need to look up to the explorers that defeated this damned guy!?\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t anyone else. I, Kang Shin, had to fight this 200-meter long Dragon Zombie!</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, it\u2019s a dragon! And a zombie! Of course, actually dragons can\u2019t be compared to mere zombies, so don\u2019t think Dragon Zombie = dragon! Don\u2019t get all excited thinking \u2018dragon slayer!\u2019 Of course, even if I say this, there are going to be readers commenting something about God's true name related to dragon slayers.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

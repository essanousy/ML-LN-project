The Last Member (5)</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya? What do you mean!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband was the only one that went in, and Hwaya followed in right after. After that, the gate closed and no one could enter\u2026 Eh? D-Dear Husband!\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice who was recounting what happened after I entered the dungeon suddenly pointed behind me with a shocked expression. When I turned around, a grey shadowy circle made its appearance.</p><br/><p>It was a gate.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening now?\u201d</p><br/><p>I murmured astonished. Next to me, Licorice asked carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, did you really clear the dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t just clear the dungeon. For a moment, I even had the right over it! I killed one of the kings and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, I felt thunderstruck. I recalled what the Beast King said, that all kings had come out this time. In that case, there could only be one answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a different dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, I quickly reached out to the gate. However, an unbelievable power flung my hand back. Daisy approached me silently.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo use. Not even a god\u2019s power, could break it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou used yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust one. To fight the King of the Dead, I saved the others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy\u2019s had an unusual worried tone. She touched my arms and face, then spoke with a relieved face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you and Hwaya were both trapped\u2026 I was worried.\u201d</p><br/><p>It felt like this was the first time Daisy ever said something like this. If she used a god\u2019s power to try to break in, I could understand how worried she was. When I thought about how Daisy might be more concerned about us than I previously thought, I suddenly felt touched.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Daisy. I\u2019m safe and I even killed a king. Though\u2026 There weren\u2019t any survivors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about, Hwaya?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like she\u2019s in another dungeon. There were two gates in the same location.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once I entered the Beast King\u2019s gate, it shut itself off to prevent anyone else from entering. Hwaya quickly jumped into the gate in front of her, but that gate had been a different gate all along.</p><br/><p>Did they plan on separating me and Hwaya from the very beginning? When the thought crossed my mind, a chill went down my back. The Beast King underestimated me and was taken out, but there was no guarantee that the other kings would do the same. More importantly, I could see the prudence of the existence controlling the kings. He was undoubtedly the one who came up with this plan to separate our forces.</p><br/><p>When the day I had to face him came, I\u2026 No, now wasn\u2019t the time to be thinking about this.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 No, sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was Hwaya safe? How much time passed since she entered the dungeon? How strong was the other king? I just had too many questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWorried about Hwaya?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cObviously! \u2026 Sorry for shouting. I\u2019m just thinking about something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn, it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy was staring at me calmly and that helped me calm down. Meanwhile, the plane carrying other Revival members came down above the gate. Ina who was waiting inside jumped into my arms with a teary face.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMommy went\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, Mommy\u2019s in the dungeon, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn! But I can\u2019t go in. I tried to use Skadi\u2019s power, but Daisy said not to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy knew it would be of no use. I consoled Ina who was tearing up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did Hwaya go in exactly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c13 minutes 27 seconds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s Hwaya, she should be holding on\u2026 Damn it, we don\u2019t even know who\u2019s inside!\u201d</p><br/><p>I examined the gate again and saw several traces of Daisy\u2019s power. Did she use a decomposing ability? A part of the gate was dug in. If a god\u2019s power could only do this much, how were we supposed to force this gate open? How?</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe with Shiva\u2019s Eye\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s find another method. If Kang Shin uses that, we\u2019ll save Hwaya, but we\u2019ll all die to the Demon Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ciara\u2019s prophecy wasn\u2019t absolute. Still, with her eyes open, Ciara\u2019s ability was incomparable to before. Although she didn\u2019t know all kings had come out, she still saw the existence of two kings and their identities. It was likely that I really needed Shiva\u2019s Eye to fight the Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>Damn it! What use was there to obtaining the power of the Destruction God Shiva!? Once per year? How was I supposed to use something like that!?</p><br/><p>\u2026 Wait.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to go to the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>I suddenly thought of something. Without a moment of hesitation, I opened the gate to the First Dungeon. Before I entered, however, Daisy shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI already went. Right now, can\u2019t contact other administrative guilds. Dungeon is very busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you gone to Fairy Garden?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFairy Garden? I don\u2019t know, how to get to that place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll tell you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>I left Ina to Licorice and jumped into the dungeon. Then, I rushed to Fairy Garden.</p><br/><p>[Prince-nim!]</p><br/><p>[He\u2019s gotten even stronger!]</p><br/><p>[That day must be coming closer!]</p><br/><p>[Ah, he\u2019s coming here!]</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys, where\u2019s Loretta?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Pavilion!]</p><br/><p>[She\u2019s at the Pavilion!]</p><br/><p>The elements seemed to have noticed that I was in a hurry, as they answered quickly without joking around. I pictured Fairy Garden\u2019s pavilion in my head and walked forward. Soon, Loretta and over ten other Fairy Garden members appeared in front of me. Loretta\u2019s ear perked up, somehow realizing I had arrived.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, do you know what\u2019s happening on Earth right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, r-right now, a world is on the brink of ruin, so we\u2019re pressed for time\u2026 Did something happen on Earth?\u201d</p><br/><p>I held myself back from letting out a deep sigh. This wasn\u2019t Loretta\u2019s fault. We were just unlucky! Meanwhile, Loretta stealthily passed the document in front of her to the man sitting next to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cNoonim! I already have my hands full!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake care of it, Guild Master. Noona\u2019s got a business to take care of.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuuuk, fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta quickly pushed her work away and approached me. I felt like I should apologize for bothering her, but I was too much in a rush to waste time with small talk. I explained the current situation as quickly as possible. Event Dungeons that completely surpassed Sherafina\u2019s control, dungeons that trapped one person inside and how to break into them.</p><br/><p>After hearing about the full story, Loretta\u2019s expression stiffened.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible, there\u2019s no way they can ignore the dungeon\u2019s power to that extent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth, Loretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t just ignoring the dungeon\u2019s power, that\u2019s using the dungeon\u2019s power for themselves! Whether it\u2019s demons or Five Kings or whoever, there\u2019s no way that\u2019s possible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cS-Sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I called her voice solemnly, Loretta drooped her ears and head. But right now, I didn\u2019t even have time to accept her apology.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we need to do to go in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo in? The dungeon\u2019s power doesn\u2019t work against them. Not even Lord can do anything about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if we\u2019re not using the dungeon\u2019s power? For example, will Shiva\u2019s Eye be able to open the gate?\u201d</p><br/><p>After thinking about it for a bit, Loretta placed her hand on my forehead. As I knew what she was trying to do, I recalled what I felt from touching the gate and transferred it to her. Loretta then nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cMost likely yes, but if what Shin-nim says is true, that power is needed to fight the Demon Lord\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let me ask again. Is there an explorer in the dungeon with a power rivaling Shiva\u2019s Eye?\u201d</p><br/><p>When she heard this, Loretta seemed to freeze. Not even a second later, she glared at me sharply.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Shin-nim had this in mind before coming here, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to see him again\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let me go alone. I just thought I should tell Loretta before going over.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t have time. Since Loretta affirmed my plan, I just needed to act. When I turned around to head off, Loretta grabbed my shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me go too. I can help convince him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Loretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m indifferent now. I just didn\u2019t want to see his face again. Or, do you doubt me, Shin-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not. I just didn\u2019t want to force Loretta to see someone Loretta didn\u2019t want\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me go. It\u2019ll be better that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta spoke with a stiff expression. I looked into her eyes and lightly nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, are you leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sikatra asked Loretta. Loretta held up her hand holding onto mine and retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI already passed my official authority to Lin. You\u2019ll be fine without me, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be any problem to our work, but that still goes against Lord\u2019s rule. Master, are you prepared for her punishment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I am, so let me do what I want for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. Tell that person I said hi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps Sikatra wanted to create this series of events. Somewhat understanding her intentions, I lightly bowed to Sikatra. She also smiled and nodded back. Immediately afterwards, Loretta and I left Fairy Garden and headed to Beyond\u2019s Residential Area.</p><br/><p>Right, there was one candidate I had in mind as someone with equal power to Shiva.</p><br/><p>Beyond\u2019s first explorer.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you might already know, he has Odin\u2019s power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOdin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOdin isn\u2019t just famous on Earth. He has great influence in other worlds, just like Greek gods do on Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGungnir should have enough power. If he sets his target to the king, it can probably deal critical damage to him even after breaking through the gate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice to know.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, we both saved our breath. It was enough to know what power he had. Not long afterwards, we arrived in front of a giant castle. It was still the eerie place it was before, letting out fluffy ominous aura.</p><br/><p>When we neared the castle\u2019s gate, a message rang out in my ear. He had detected our presence.</p><br/><p>[You didn\u2019t bother me all this time. Why have you come again, Third Explorer?]</p><br/><p>His voice was still dark, but it carried a calamitous charm. I could tell now that his charm was on a similar level as mine.</p><br/><p>Wait, then did my voice also sound like this to others? I held back my uneasiness and spoke.</p><br/><p>[I have a favor to ask of you.]</p><br/><p>[The answer is no. Go back.]</p><br/><p>He cut down my request instantly. This rude little bastard\u2026 I gritted my teeth and was about to ask again, when Loretta placed her hand on the metal gate and asked.</p><br/><p>[I came to ask you for a favor, Kain Zerahard.]</p><br/><p>Even though she wasn\u2019t a Beyond explorer, her voice was ringing out in Beyond\u2019s explorer communication channel. It was to be expected from Fairy Garden\u2019s guild master.</p><br/><p>The moment the first explorer heard Loretta\u2019s voice, his voice trembled.</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re\u2026 Loretta?]</p><br/><p>[Yes, I\u2019m Loretta\u2026 Shin-nim needs your help. Please listen to him.]</p><br/><p>[No, I\u2019m\u2026 Go back.]</p><br/><p>[You must listen to him\u2026 I hope you remember, you are indebted to us, to me.]</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t raise my head. I knew things were going to turn out this way, but I was too embarrassed to face Loretta. Uuu, to save Hwaya, I was forcing Loretta to threaten her first love. If I die, I was sure to go to hell\u2026!</p><br/><p>[\u2026 I see, he is your\u2026]</p><br/><p>[Yes. I have never resented the fact that I have to stay in the dungeon this much.]</p><br/><p>[I see\u2026 In that case, there\u2019s no other choice.]</p><br/><p>That was it. We didn\u2019t need to convince him anymore. He accepted my request just by Loretta asking for a favor. I was too afraid to think about what debt he owed to Loretta, or how much burden this put on Loretta.</p><br/><p>The iron gate, which had stayed closed for hundreds of years, opened this easily. A wide garden appeared beyond it, and we could see the door to his castle.</p><br/><p>[Come in. I\u2019ll at least hear you out.]</p><br/><p>The dungeon\u2019s strongest explorer was welcoming me.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

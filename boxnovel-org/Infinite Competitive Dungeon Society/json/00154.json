Crimson Chaotic Spear (4)</p><br/><p>For a month, Hwaya led the other guild members to clear Event Dungeons, and 20 days passed since I joined in. There were now only 48 Event Dungeons left in the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust my bonus stats are over 150. I have a lot of skill points saved up, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sitting in a New York hotel, I looked at my status.</p><br/><p>[Name: Kang Shin Race: Human Sex: Male</p><br/><p>Class: Elementalist (Sub \u2013 Skill Collector, Tamer) Title: Zeus Rank: Gold 9</p><br/><p>Level: 54</p><br/><p>HP \u2013 43,820/43,820 MP \u2013 35,460/35,460</p><br/><p>Strength \u2013 215(+111) Dexterity \u2013 205(+79) Constitution \u2013 194(+66)</p><br/><p>Intelligence \u2013 32(+59) Magic \u2013 200(+109) Charm \u2013 87(+99) Luck \u2013 39(+49)</p><br/><p>Normal Skills \u2013 High-rank Martial Arts (Lv 6), Peruta \u2013 Mad Typhoon (Lv 1), Mid-rank Crossbow Marksmanship (Lv 9), Mid-rank Gale Track (Lv 2), Mid-rank White Lightning Consecutive Strike (Lv 4), High-rank Heroic Strike (Lv 2), High-rank Provoke (Lv 5), Divine Speed (Master), Return (Lv 4), Heavy Armor Mastery (Lv 5), Mid-rank Dash (Lv 7), Peruta Circuit (Lv 8), Soul Guard (Lv 8), Dimensional Travel (Lv 1), Overwhelm (Lv 2), Deific Manifestation, Death Counter, Riding</p><br/><p>Class Skills \u2013 High-rank Spirit Mastery (Lv 2), High-rank Spirit Aura (Lv 9), Mid-rank Elemental Control (Lv 9), Mid-rank Elemental Contract (Lv 9), Mid-rank Thunder Tempest (Lv 2), Mid-rank Elemental Blade (Lv 8), Mid-rank Elemental Tempest (Lv 8), Thunder Beast (Lv 3).</p><br/><p>Subclass Skill \u2013 Endow Skill, Taming (Lv 3), Spirit of the Collector, Spirit of the Tamer (Lv 3)]</p><br/><p>[Speed +45%, Strength +40%, Charm +15%]</p><br/><p>[148 Event Dungeon clears, 9 Event Raid clear. Accumulated bonus stats: 195]</p><br/><p>[Current skill points: 21]</p><br/><p>No matter how generous I was, these were not the stats a level 54 explorer should have. Walker, who had cleared Event Dungeons with me for the past 3 weeks, only had half of my total stats. In addition, I currently could not bring out the full potential of my stats. After all, my stats had gone up by over 150 in the past few weeks. I could constantly feel my body getting stronger and adjusting itself, but I did not know when it would end.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you sleep well, T.K.?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Pepper.\u201d</p><br/><p>I put my mask on just in time and replied to Pepper with a sigh. Then, I got up from my bed. Pepper was standing in front of the opened hotel room door.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so bland! It\u2019s our reunion! Then again, it\u2019s been too soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d see you again so soon either.\u201d</p><br/><p>I retorted unenthusiastically and drank some water. Pepper looked around the door and blurted out in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, the blonde miss isn\u2019t here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think Ludia is always sleeping with me. She\u2019s calmed down a lot. Plus\u2026 Wouldn\u2019t it be more of a problem if she was here? You would have just walked into the two of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right! I was just too excited for today! It\u2019s today, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s today. I don\u2019t know who, but you sure have a good informant.\u201d</p><br/><p>After finishing my water, I slammed down the cup on the table and twisted the corner of my mouth up.</p><br/><p>Right, today was the day we entered the SS ranked dungeon in Lower Eastern Manhattan.</p><br/><p>\u201cT.K., as you already know, America suffered a lot from Antelope Canyon\u2019s dungeonification. Because of it, they\u2019ve thought a lot more about gates than other countries. This time, when the gates appeared in mass, they already decided to destroy all gates, even the lower-ranked ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pepper explained as the two of us went on the hotel\u2019s elevator.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fact that Team Revival was working to destroy gates also influenced them. You know about it, right? That day\u2026 we owed a huge debt to all of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDebt, you say\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I naturally thought about Ciara, but that wasn\u2019t what was currently important. I let Pepper continue.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see, America actually has this amazing ability user. She\u2019s a daughter of an esteemed family, and she can tell if a large monster will appear when a gate disappears.\u201d</p><br/><p>He began to talk about her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith her help, we began destroying the gates where giant monsters wouldn\u2019t appear. Guardian, Freedom Wing, and rogues all worked with the same goal in mind. Of course, we didn\u2019t have the time to destroy all of them. We really have to thank you for helping us destroy them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor such a large country, America didn\u2019t have that many gates. Plus, monsters appeared from two of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thankfully, America\u2019s Guardian had already told us about it. As thanks, we sold them monster corpses for a cheap price. This way, it would be a fair give and take.</p><br/><p>When they told us that they knew where boss monsters appear, I already suspected Ciara had a hand in it, but I didn\u2019t think she was so deeply involved. It seemed she was doing her best for her country as well.</p><br/><p>\u2026 If only she would continue to do so.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood morning. Eh, Pepper\u2019s here too? Don\u2019t tell me, he really is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was surprised seeing his face so early in the morning too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGlad to see you\u2019re healthy, Flame Witch! Anyways, T.K., to cut to the chase, America is very supportive of you guys. We empathize with your cause and we want to help you! Many Americans are touched by your bravery to go into an SS ranked dungeon, too! So, as an SS ranker, I can\u2019t miss out, can I? If I did, I would be losing my honor as a Guardian! That\u2019s why I\u2019m here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just doing what we can.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKu, how cool, T.K.!\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Pepper\u2019s somewhat sarcastic praise, I joined the others. As we didn\u2019t want to go into an SS ranked dungeon when we were tired, we each took some time to rest and check over our equipment and potions. We also cleanly used up the bonus stats we got. After a day, we were in our peak condition.</p><br/><p>Even Shuna, who was the weakest among us, could just barely be considered an SS ranker in terms of physical ability. On the other hand, Hwaya and I, who were the strongest, could\u2026 probably only be described as SSS rank.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs everyone ready?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI got changed and I\u2019m all ready to go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I feel like I won\u2019t die anytime soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone seemed to have done maintenance on their equipment, as they were shining. As for me, I looked incredibly suspicious with Otus\u2019 Secret, ordinary shorts, and a t-shirt. However, I had several rings on my fingers and a bracelet that changed into a sturdy set of armor whenever I injected mana into it. On my ears were fancy earrings, and two chokers on my neck. It was then that I realized something\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Don\u2019t I look like a delinquent?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, thanks to your mask, you only look like a weirdo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut with your handsome face and good body, you look okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a compliment!\u201d</p><br/><p>The SS ranked dungeon was located in a park in Lower Eastern Manhattan. Because the gate appeared right at the entrance of the park, the entire area became off limits and the most elite Guardians were protecting it. Although Guardian and Freedom Wing rankers planned to enter it initially, they gave up after we stepped in.</p><br/><p>To be honest, even if we didn\u2019t come, it was uncertain whether they would actually get organized enough to go in. After all, they were still having trouble clearing S ranked dungeons. Only two S+ ranked dungeons had been cleared by groups other than Revival. It went without saying that the other SS ranked dungeon in Russia was also left alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe dungeons\u2019 difficulty is growing faster than ability users.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya said bluntly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know when another wave of Event Dungeons will come, but at that time, an SS+ ranked dungeon might appear. One day, even an SSS ranked dungeon might appear.\u201d</p><br/><p>To prevent that from happening, we had to let ability users grow. The easiest way to do that was\u2026 I glanced at Pepper. If it was him, I felt like I could trust him.</p><br/><p>I asked Hwaya for her opinion through eye contact, and she shrugged in response. It meant it wouldn\u2019t hurt to try. I immediately asked Pepper.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Pepper. Do you want to join our team?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? You guys are recruiting? Sorry, T.K. America would be in danger without me, hahaha! But I like you and your friends, so we can talk about it again when another SS ranker appears in America!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, take your time.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I expected, Pepper refused my offer. I didn\u2019t blame him. He should prioritize his country. However, if he didn\u2019t become our ally completely, we couldn\u2019t appoint him as a dungeon explorer\u2026 Mmm, how troublesome. At that moment, Sumire stepped up.</p><br/><p>[If you\u2019re hesitant to appoint him to the First Dungeon, how about the Second, Shin-nim?]</p><br/><p>[No, Sumire, that\u2019s\u2026]</p><br/><p>[I feel like he\u2019s trustworthy. Shin-nim thinks so too, right?]</p><br/><p>[I do\u2026 but\u2026]</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t many ability users like Pepper, who was pure and strong. He had a good personality. Even so, we didn\u2019t watch over him for a long time, and if he decides to say anything about it\u2026</p><br/><p>Hwaya then spoke.</p><br/><p>[Soul Contract.]</p><br/><p>[Ah!]</p><br/><p>[Uuuk\u2026 You cruel bastards, kuk! I remembered it again, kuuk!]</p><br/><p>Soul Contract cost 500,000 gold. Although it originally cost 1,000,000 gold, neither were prices I couldn\u2019t afford. I couldn\u2019t say it was a small amount, but with the First Dungeon and Beyond, it would be easy to make that much.</p><br/><p>\u201cPepper, I want to make an offer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMan, thank you for thinking so highly of me, but persistent men are hated!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to give you something as a temporary member.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Temporary member?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, we can talk again after the dungeon. How about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pepper looked to be in thought. Soon, he nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, since my friend is thinking about me so much, I can do that much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Then let\u2019s focus on the dungeon from now.\u201d</p><br/><p>I smiled and led the crew to the dungeon. However, my mood soon plummeted. The met the one person I didn\u2019t want to meet.</p><br/><p>[Hero-nim, I wanted to see you!]</p><br/><p>This person that called me Hero. Plus, she was the only one on Earth who could randomly contact people with telepathy. Ciara Kenex. Wearing a see-through dress and surrounded by countless guards, she was waiting for us near the SS rank gate. I wanted to go back home immediately, but I held myself back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t really want to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Can you make some time for me? We can talk over a cup of tea.]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Then I\u2019ll be rude and steal a bit of Hero-nim\u2019s time here. Please forgive me.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even at my blunt rejection, Ciara didn\u2019t even blink. No, she had her eyes closed anyway. Her voice didn\u2019t shake at all. No, it was telepathy. Mm. She used telepathy as if she wasn\u2019t fazed at all.</p><br/><p>[You became more reliable and imposing since the last time I saw you. You also became extremely strong. In such a short time\u2026 Although I can\u2019t see with my eyes, I can tell.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHow sad.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I heard about Hero-nim\u2019s accomplishments. They were truly hero-like. My eyes weren\u2019t wrong. You really are perfect!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKnowing that what I did is to your liking makes my stomach churn.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was hard to refute what she was saying. I had to use the influence my name had in America. Even though I told Ciara I wouldn\u2019t do as she wanted, I ended up using the fame she helped create.</p><br/><p>However, I also couldn\u2019t deny that it was the best choice. At the very least, I was confident that the method I chose produced the least amount of sacrifice.</p><br/><p>[Hero-nim created conflict within Guardian and is becoming renowned throughout the whole world. Even without my help, Hero-nim could create a worldwide organization of ability users!]</p><br/><p>\u201cTheir conflict has nothing to do with me. In addition, I\u2019ll refuse anyone who asks to work for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I was too insolent. I acted as if Hero-nim needed my help when Hero-nim is already outstanding\u2026 I finally understand. I just want to do what I can by Hero-nim\u2019s side. I only want to protect Earth against the danger it faces, and unite ability users to a single organization. That is all I want. Though, if Hero-nim would let me give birth to a child, I would be extremely happy\u2026]</p><br/><p>This girl was insane. Completely insane. She wasn\u2019t even listening to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to say it again. I have no plans to accept such heavy responsibilities. I\u2019m going to continue doing what I can, protecting myself, my family, and friends. I can\u2019t confidently say I\u2019ve been doing that, but at least from now, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Though, the number of friends I have to protect have been increasing recently\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>When I was done talking, it seemed Ciara had paid attention to me this time, as she smiled. Even though she couldn\u2019t see, she looked at me accurately. It was kind of frightening.</p><br/><p>[Huhu, I can\u2019t wait. The world will be saved by Hero-nim, and dirty humans\u2019 conflicts will disappear under Hero-nim\u2019s rule. And I\u2026 Yes, I would like to think of our child\u2019s name beforehand!]</p><br/><p>It seemed world domination was the goal she had in mind for me. I was sincerely disgusted by Ciara\u2019s ecstatic expression and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will never, ever, never, ever, never get in a relationship with you, not even if the world ends and we\u2019re the only two people left in the world. If you want me to be more straightforward, I will. Nothing will happen between us even if I have to die!\u201d</p><br/><p>At my shout, people began to clap. Other than Pepper, all of the members of Revival were clapping.</p><br/><p>\u201cYep, I recorded it. I\u2019ll make Ludia listen to it while she\u2019s sleeping.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it!\u201d</p><br/><p>I took the recorder from Hwaya and also shouted at Ciara.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re done, screw off!\u201d</p><br/><p>[C-Can I have your contact information?]</p><br/><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><br/><p>[But sometimes, I want to hear Hero-nim\u2019s voice\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk like a kidnapper and screw off!\u201d</p><br/><p>[T-Then, can I call you next time? Thank you! You really are kind!]</p><br/><p>Now that I thought about it, she already knew my address! This girl only asked me to get my permission, and she was pretending that I did when I didn\u2019t! For a moment, I got curious as to how she\u2019d call me since she wouldn\u2019t be able to use her telepathy over the phone, but I felt like asking her would only make the situation worse. As such, I chased her and her guards out with a little show of force.</p><br/><p>[Ah, if you destroy this gate, a giant monster will appear! Be careful, Hero-nim!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not thankful at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like that, the nine of us (with the addition of Leon Pepper) came to challenge the SS ranked dungeon. Although my physical condition was best, my mental condition was\u2026 This was all Ciara\u2019s fault!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

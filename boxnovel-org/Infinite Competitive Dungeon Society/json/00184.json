Skill Synthesis (3)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Chapter 184. Skill Synthesis (3)</p><br/><p>From what I\u2019ve seen in the dungeon so far, the dungeon was designed for party play. The width of the passageway and the number of monsters that appeared together were the biggest examples. There was no consideration for explorers climbing the dungeon alone.</p><br/><p>However, the traps and rewards were also party-based, meaning that solo explorers had more to gain. Traps were more dangerous when a large number of people tried to cross them. There were traps that activated when a certain number of people stepped over an area. For example, there were traps that caused the ground to collapse or traps that rained down arrows. For ordinary explorers in parties, it became even more difficult to dodge these traps as others would panic. Of course, for me, it was hard to say whether these traps could even deal 1 HP worth of damage.</p><br/><p>In any case, parties were weak to traps! It was quite clich\u00e9 for trap experts to die because their party members got in their way!</p><br/><p>I had a lot to say about traps, but I had even more to say about rewards. The most common situation explorers would face while climbing ordinary dungeon floors was deciding who the reward from named monsters would go to.</p><br/><p>There were also conflicts as to who would rest, who would get the few high-grade herbs and materials, and who would get the extremely rare Epic-grade items dropped by bugged monsters.</p><br/><p>The 56th floor was filled with mimics. Just like their name suggested, they mimicked weapons, treasure chests, wardrobes and the like to trick explorers. They devoured unsuspecting explorers that touched them or simply just passed by. Because of their outstanding disguise, it was extremely difficult to tell them apart, and even if one did, they were quite strong so it was hard to face them.</p><br/><p>As such, the best way to deal with them was to identify them and quickly attack them while they were still thinking about how to eat you. Of course, this was easier said than done. Fortunately, as everything on the 56th floor were mimics, it was quite easy. If I was suspicious, I just had to stab my spear through it.</p><br/><p>If I was in a party, someone might have gotten caught off guard, but there was no problem for a solo explorer like me. I almost didn\u2019t even need a Magic Detector.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, but even I can\u2019t help it sometimes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After I killed a named monster, I instinctively reached out to grab the fancy sword that replaced it. The sword then opened its mouth and bit down on my gauntlet. It was only then that I realized the mistake I made and burnt it with my lightning.</p><br/><p>These mimics provoked people\u2019s instincts. People instinctively grabbed treasures, dodged traps, opened doors, opened boxes, climbed stairs, went into holes\u2026 Kuhum!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s making me grab things when the Magic Detector is ringing?\u201d</p><br/><p>I despaired at my patience. Initially, I was going slow, being wary of any traps, but I decided to change my method. I left Sharana to destroy any traps and charged forward on Ruyue. With that, I escaped from my desires. I was going so fast that I couldn\u2019t see anything!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a stone decoration popped out in our path. Thinking that it was a mimic, I swung my spear to cut it, but the stone decoration grabbed my spear and put a stop to our charge.</p><br/><p>[Guaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, it\u2019s a golem!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mimics had excellent disguising ability, but poor durability. Golems, on the other hand, were magical creatures made out of stone or steel, and were naturally tough. Of course, toughness was rather subjective. I clicked my tongue and burnt the golem with chaos flames.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but both mimics and golems are weak as hell\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018What if the entire passageway was a mimic? Would it even hurt me if it devoured me?\u2019 The moment I thought that, the Magic Detector vibrated and the passageway began to narrow. So there really was a mimic like that!? Wait, I paid 150,000 gold for this thing, but it noticed even later than me! Loretta cheated me!</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Do I burn it?]</p><br/><p>Peika immediately shot powerful bolts of lightning left, right, up, and below. When they crashed with the walls that were closing in, a loud boom rang out. The mimic was dead. Before its body scattered into particles, Ruyue accelerated and got out of the passageway.</p><br/><p>Immediately afterwards, however, a mouth opened up on the floor to devour Ruyue and me. I raised my spear and struck down on the ground. As the Magic Detector continued to ring, I didn\u2019t know exactly where the mimics and golems were. To put it bluntly, it was useless.</p><br/><p>In the end, I acknowledged that it wasn\u2019t the best idea to charge forward on Ruyue. I drank a Mana Potion and decided to take a special measure. I dematerialized Ruyue and flew up by using Sharana\u2019s power. I didn\u2019t want to resort to this method because of its large mana consumption, but there was no other choice. Since I couldn\u2019t trust the floor or the ceiling, I could only trust the air!</p><br/><p>Even after that, I faced golems pretending to be walls, treasure chests that smacked their mouths, mimics that disguised themselves as the ceiling, which then got out of the way, revealing traps then rained down arrows. Of course, these arrows were also mimics in disguise. In the end, it took me 3 hours to break through the 56th floor. It was quite slow compared to my recent times.</p><br/><p>[You became level 57! You obtained the qualification to challenge Beyond\u2019s 6th floor.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained 5 bonus stats.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you broke through the 56th floor in just 3 hours! How amazing! \u2026 But why are you so out of breath, Shin-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst\u2026 Huk\u2026 Huk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I glared at Loretta and demanded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want a refund.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta didn\u2019t refund the 150,000 gold at all. She instead said she would give me a Queen Elf\u2019s Blessing and tried to kiss me. I of course blocked it with one hand and jumped into Beyond\u2019s 6th floor.</p><br/><p>Beyond\u2019s 1st through 5th floors had the First Dungeon\u2019s Orc Lord and Wraith Queen, the 5th and 10th Floor Master respectively. I suspected that Beyond\u2019s 6th floor would have the 15th Floor Master, Dark Ratmen, and my suspicion was spot on. The moment I entered the first hallway, I faced dozens of Dark Ratmen glaring at me.</p><br/><p>To be honest, I was reluctant to fight the Dark Ratmen. I had been killed once by a Dark Ratman, and they also used the extremely cheaty Dark Thunder Explosion skill. I still vividly remembered being hit by Dark Thunder Explosion. Now, they appeared in groups!</p><br/><p>[Gigigigi!]</p><br/><p>[Human meat! Human meat is here!]</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s time for a lightning festival!]</p><br/><p>Seeing the Dark Ratmen flickering with black lightning, I swallowed my saliva. If they got me, that would be it. With that, I prepared myself to use Divine Speed. If I used Dragon Skin, Diehard, and Divine Speed well, it was probably possible to break through the 6th floor within a few days.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s\u2026 go!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Gigigigi! Dark Thunder Explosion!]</p><br/><p>They used Dark Thunder Explosion at the same time. I didn\u2019t even think to avoid their attacks. I first summoned Peika and gave her ample mana. I then formed chaos flames and prepared myself to combat any lightning that flew toward me. At the same time, I prepared myself to use Dragon Skin if I received too much damage. After I was done with all the preparation, I charged toward them.</p><br/><p>\u2026 And in 5 hours, I safely broke through the 6th floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim!? You died, right? You must have died, right!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say \u2018die\u2019! Say that my vitality hit zero! Plus, if my vitality hit zero, I wouldn\u2019t have returned to the Floor Shop!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was still dumbfounded, but\u2026 the Dark Ratmen in Beyond\u2019s 6th floor didn\u2019t hurt at all!</p><br/><p>Originally, Dark Ratmen\u2019s strong points were their speed, strength, and their powerful skill, Dark Thunder Explosion. Even though the Dark Ratmen on Beyond\u2019s 6th floor was stronger than the one I faced on the dungeon\u2019s 15th floor, they were still slower than me and had paper-like bodies. They died like flies every time I swung my spear clad with chaos flames. Even when they used Dark Thunder Explosion, my absurd lightning resistance easily shook it off. In fact, Peika became ecstatic and absorbed the lightning. Rather than calling it Beyond\u2019s 6th floor, it was better to call it a power plant for Peika.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t have to worry about the Dark Ratmen\u2019s attacks at all, and Peika destroyed all the traps with all the lightning she absorbed. It was the first time I simply marched through a Beyond floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cElemental-nim is strangely shiny\u2026 Shin-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta\u2019s imagination shocks me from time to time, but she only filled her belly with lightning!\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, I spent a few days clearing the First Dungeon\u2019s 57th floor, Beyond\u2019s 7th floor, First Dungeon\u2019s 58th floor, and Beyond\u2019s 8th floor. Beyond\u2019s 7th floor had Lizard Knights. As their main method of attack was striking the ground with their spears while they were Dragon Skinned, I simply flew up and charged past them. Unlike in Floor Master battles, I didn\u2019t have to kill all the monsters in Beyond.</p><br/><p>The Orc Lords were scary because Warcry affected other Orc Lords and lasted indefinitely with their low cooldown. On the other hand, the Lizard Knights\u2019 Dragon Skin did not affect other Lizard Knights and had long cooldown time. If needed, I just had to wait out Dragon Skin\u2019s duration and kill them off one by one.</p><br/><p>Beyond\u2019s 8th floor was even easier. When Lizard Knights used their ground-based attacks, they damaged Dark Ratmen, and when Dark Ratmen attacked, I was fine but the Lizard Knights went epileptic. While they inadvertently fought each other like idiots, I leisurely took care of them one by one.</p><br/><p>Climbing the dungeon couldn\u2019t have been easier. If things continued like this, it was entirely possible to conquer the dungeon in 2 years! I became intoxicated in this feeling. I was getting stronger by the day and climbing the dungeon was extremely smooth. Even if I tried to stay humble, I couldn\u2019t help but feel that I could do anything.</p><br/><p>[Crown Prince\u2026 Please, help me.]</p><br/><p>Until one day, I got a message from a friend.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Toika\u2019s main skill is skipping through all the uninteresting parts!

Third Season (8)</p><br/><p>\u201cShim-nim, are you okay!?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I came back to the mansion all tattered from breaking through the 81st floor, I was caught by Sumire.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Sumire, this is\u2026 Mm, I just had a pretty long fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou look tired. Please wash up and sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I will.\u201d</p><br/><p>I retorted half-heartedly and wondered why Sumire was out in the garden. Before I could continue my thoughts, however, Sumire clapped her hands and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWould you like me to wash your back? I often did it when my father was still alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to refuse. For the record, don\u2019t do that to a man unless you plan on marrying him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hm? Don\u2019t tell me Sumire was treating me like I was her father? Rather than that, Sumire\u2019s father made a grown up girl wash his back!? I fell into stupor. At the same time, I saw a piece of the garden land flipped over from the corner of my eyes. No, it wasn\u2019t just flipped over. Since there were some plants growing on it, it looked like someone was growing some vegetables.</p><br/><p>When Sumire saw what I was looking at, she smiled sweetly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, those things. You see, vegetables from the Residential Area don\u2019t grow well on Earth. But when I tried growing them here, they magically grew well. Isn\u2019t the dungeon amazing?\u201d</p><br/><p>I immediately thought back to Iana and Pookie, the two corpses fermented by the elementals in the garden. It was likely Marianne\u2019s Garden being special rather than the dungeon itself, but I didn\u2019t tell Sumire my thoughts. I figured she wouldn\u2019t need to go into other mansions or residences of the Residential Area.</p><br/><p>I also just realized that Sumire was wearing a comfortable clothes, an apron, and a pair of work gloves stained with dirt. Among the guild members, she was probably the most family-oriented girl.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think Hwaya would be the type to do something like this, and Ye-Eun confidently said she was good at cooking ramen, which meant she wasn\u2019t good at cooking anything else. Only Ludia, who helped Mother with chores around the house, had the potential to surpass her. Still, to think Sumire was growing vegetables here\u2026 I spoke with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou could just buy them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, I\u2019m just taking care of them whenever I\u2019m taking a break from training. I don\u2019t plan on climbing the dungeon until I learn the technique Shin-nim taught me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErm\u2026 It\u2019s a bit embarrassing, but after I saw Shin-nim\u2019s spear attack, I subconsciously kept trying to use it whenever I held a spear. I figured it was better to climb the dungeon after I learned it to a usable level. I became a First Dungeon explorer, after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, right, Sumire entered the First Dungeon too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s been a bit under a month!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 I only showed it to her once. Did it get stuck in her mind? If she wasn\u2019t talented, I might have scolded myself for stunting her growth, but Sumire was a genius even amongst all the geniuses I\u2019ve seen, so I probably didn\u2019t need to worry. I believed she would learn this technique even quicker than I imagined. With that in mind, there was only one thing I could do to help her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to spar after I take a shower? I have to impart Peruta Circuit to you in the afternoon, so it\u2019s a good opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Ah, n-no\u2026 Shin-nim should rest. We can spar afterwards\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine once I take a bath. I\u2019ll be back in a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes!\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t refuse a second time. With a grin, I waved my hand and headed to the bath. The grand bathroom on the first floor was big enough be a public bath from Rome. Although it wasn\u2019t used often, it was the best place to relieve fatigue after a tiring day. After walking to the men\u2019s bath, I realized there was another visitor. It was Father.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re back? It took a while this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, I\u2019ll chase you out if you fart in the bath.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that the first thing you say to your father?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you blame me with how many times I suffered from it?\u201d</p><br/><p>I threw a bucket of hot water over me and stepped into the hot bath. Father retorted as he snickered.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, my body isn\u2019t what it used to be. I can control most physiological phenomenon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>With what he said, I scanned over Father\u2019s body. He always had a tough build and his face was always younger than he actually was. Looking at him now, however, he didn\u2019t just look younger. He was practically a handsome man in his mid-30\u2019s!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Did you remold your body or something, Father?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, I only made a slight breakthrough in my spearmanship.\u201d</p><br/><p>I flinched. I remembered the moment I mastered Peruta Circuit when my body broke down once and reforged itself. Just in case, I asked him.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, did your body break down and reappear, or anything like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, no, not really.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Father flinched. His leisurely face had a slight tension to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI did feel my body being renewed. It felt like my mind was clearing up, and I had an epiphany or some sort. I felt like I finally understood what mana was and the nature of the power I had. But you\u2026 Your body broke down?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe that was because I learned Peruta Circuit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father really hated losing to his son. What he said next made me blank out for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to teach it to your mom?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour mom. Shouldn\u2019t you teach her something? Even if she doesn\u2019t become an explorer.\u201d</p><br/><p>After blanking out a bit longer, I shook my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeruta Circuit isn\u2019t that easy to learn. Still, it\u2019ll be nice to teach her a mana cultivation method. I think you should teach her yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, I fell in thought. I neglected Mother recently, and with everything that\u2019s going on with the dungeon, Earth, monsters, and demons, the number of times I saw her could be counted on one hand. I felt sorry, then I felt relieved that Father was so devoted to Mother.</p><br/><p>How enticing was the dungeon? If you were skilled, beautiful female explorers lined up to receive your help. With Father\u2019s skill, even if he had a face that would make an orc call him elder brother, there would still be explorers that would jump at him. Mother was also a beauty when she was young, but compared to the dungeon where beauties of all races gathered\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see, this woman keeps scolding me for eating good things by myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRather than waiting for Mother to get younger by mastering a mana cultivation method, it\u2019ll probably be quicker to bring her items that do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI doubt items that make you younger are common. Don\u2019t say such absurd things.\u2019</p><br/><p>I could understand how Mother would feel excluded. Other than her, everyone in the family became dungeon explorers. Now that her husband suddenly looked much younger, even I felt a bit guilty.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to look for it too, Father. If I have time while saving the world, that is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou might as well just say I should solve it on my own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father slapped the surface of the water, creating a vibration that shot a water bullet towards me. I put the tip of my hand underwater and created a small whirlpool to block it. It was a playful water fight between a father and a son, but if an ordinary person was hit by that bullet, he would most certainly die.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, I heard you\u2019re here. There\u2019s something I need to tell you!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, someone rushed into the bath. The only person who would call me like this was Hwaya. Even knowing that I was in the bath, she barged in confidently and stared at me brazenly. Thankfully, both Father and I had our underparts covered. When she saw that Father was here, she made a face that easily read \u2018what a shame.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Ajusshi was here too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you act more embarrassed? Actually, don\u2019t come in here! Can\u2019t you just send a message!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I do that? We\u2019re in the same house, so isn\u2019t it better to talk face to face? It\u2019s not like you and Ajusshi are naked.\u201d</p><br/><p>With Hwaya acting shameless, I became lost for words. While I was thinking hard about what to say, Hwaya stuck out her tongue and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, my bad, I didn\u2019t think Ajusshi was here too. I\u2019ll apologize. I\u2019m sorry, Ajusshi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Hwaya. Like you said, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m naked. Plus, you\u2019ll be my daughter soon anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, I knew Ajusshi was on my side! I\u2019ll serve you well later!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dear god, Father was already compromised! When I sighed with my hand on my forehead, she apologized to me again and added.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought it was the perfect chance to take you out and I ended up being let down, so aren\u2019t we even?\u201d</p><br/><p>This woman just revealed her intention of trying to attack a son in front of his father.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, she\u2019s like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it wonderful? Your mother keeps saying she wants to see her grandson, and I\u2019m perfectly fine if it\u2019s Hwaya. I feel a bit bad about Ludia, but can\u2019t you take them both? There\u2019s a huge decrease in population because of monsters, so you should do your best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since when did Father and Mother become so progressive? Or was I just too conservative? I first gestured at Hwaya to go\u2026 No, go out, not come in!</p><br/><p>\u201cI was kidding. I really just ran in because I was in a hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you really were in a hurry, you could have just messaged me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya whistled and avoided my gaze. So she was in a hurry but had other intentions too? Trying to achieve two goals with one move, a true tactician! Since she was cute, I forgave her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t plan on leaving, just tell me what you came for.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, we found another king. Including an SS rank ability user we made into an explorer, a total of 150 people went missing. The succubi managed to capture a video they barely sent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn, can\u2019t I relax and take a bath!? I shot up and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what happened, say it earlier!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you I was in a hurry\u2026 Oh, how nice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nice my ass! \u2026 was what I was going to yell, but I realized that my lower body felt breezy. Although my body was tougher than steel, the towel wrapped around my waist wasn\u2019t, and it couldn\u2019t hold its position against my abrupt movement.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After realizing what happened, I sat back down and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Shin, that\u2019s the wrong reaction.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya added as she continued to stare at me fixedly. I didn\u2019t think that was the correct reaction either. But hey, can you look away!?</p><br/><p>In the end, another 5 minutes passed before I put my clothes back on and returned to Earth.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

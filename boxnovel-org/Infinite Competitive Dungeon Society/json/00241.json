What Happened Twice Will... (1)</p><br/><p>Lin immediately headed off to work on the rewards. Since the accessories weren\u2019t something that he could make in a day or two, Daisy and I had to give up on seeing them for a while.</p><br/><p>For the record, although Sipua had committed grave sins of escaping the dungeon and cooperating with a world\u2019s enemy, considering the situation, she was simply given a punishment of 500 years in confinement. When she heard the punishment, she looked at me with longing eyes, but I just ignored them. It seemed it would be an effective punishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back, Daisy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn\u2026 Aren\u2019t you reproducing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I a bacteria!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, I\u2019ll see you in a bit!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, don\u2019t ever come\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>We left Fairy Garden and returned to the guild house. The guild members, who had been waiting for us to return, felt relieved when the dungeon started operating again, and asked us what had happened. However, as it was too dark to tell them, I gave an evasive answer. Not knowing the truth wouldn\u2019t hurt them anyways.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew, it\u2019s finally over\u2026 What\u2019s your plan, Daisy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to, sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy yawned. Now that she mentioned it, I hadn\u2019t slept a wink. Just when I was thinking about going to sleep too, Daisy took off her beret in the middle of the hallway, then threw off her coat. Then, she suddenly tilted her head and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSleep together?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! And if you\u2019re going to undress any more, do it in your room!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou wanted to sleep\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut not with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Are you going to sleep, with that elf queen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that even if you\u2019re joking! Do you know how scared I was!? I\u2019m going to sleep alone, a.l.o.n.e.!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I was exhausted, this whole incident had only taken a day\u2019s worth of time. Other than the fact that Revival had become an A ranked guild, nothing had changed from the day before. Earth was still peaceful, and neither the four remaining kings nor the demon race had appeared.</p><br/><p>Since I didn\u2019t want to go back to the dungeon and fight, I decided to just sleep.</p><br/><p>I had used Overlord and Hermes\u2019 power\u2026 It seemed my body was waiting for a rest after a severe physical labor. After I took a shower, I went to my room in the guild house and fell on my bed like someone who had just finished a marathon. Then, I fell asleep. It felt warm.</p><br/><p>When I woke up, Ina was sleeping next to me.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I sat up, Ina mumbled softly. I patted her and kept her sleeping. But why was Ina in my room? I didn\u2019t need to think for long as I could clearly see the door I had left wide open.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank god it\u2019s Ina\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I murmured instinctively and trembled. It seemed the trauma wouldn\u2019t go away for a while. I got down from the bed and got changed. I looked at the clock. It seemed I had been sleeping for 15 hours straight. Considering the fact that I usually only needed 3 hours of sleep, it was a surprising amount.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, I might as well go to the dungeon now.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was the only way I knew how to spend my free time! Despairing at my battle-ridden lifestyle, I left the room. When I closed the door silently so that Ina could sleep peacefully, Daisy was standing in the hallway.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy stared at me fixedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said you would, sleep alone. But you slept, with another woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIna\u2019s my daughter!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Will the daughter, also think that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Daisy was the one saying it, I couldn\u2019t help but worry slightly\u2026 No, she was just trying to tease me! As if to prove that this was the case, the corner of Daisy\u2019s mouth curled up.</p><br/><p>\u201cKidding. I didn\u2019t read, her thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf possible, don\u2019t make jokes that are going to give me heart attacks\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is something, I want to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>I noticed that Daisy was wearing her formal battle attire which she took off when she went to bed. When she wasn\u2019t going out for battle, she usually wore loose clothes that made the guild\u2019s male members glance at her, so her current attire somewhat stood out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou kept your promise, very quickly. So from now on, I will work, for Kang Shin. I will pay back, this gratitude.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it\u2026? You did your best ever since you entered the guild. Like you did in the Philippines, for example.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Daisy shook her head and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat Kang Shin is doing, I want to do it too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat Kang Shin plans on doing, I will do as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>I barely understood what she was trying to say. She had seen through my plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour goal, I like it. So let\u2019s do it, together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who came up with it\u2026 But it\u2019s going to take a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. Let\u2019s do it, together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you know, the motive isn\u2019t pure either\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I scratched my head, and Daisy tilted her head in response.</p><br/><p>\u201cMotive doesn\u2019t matter. Let\u2019s do it, together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really understand you\u2026 but for now, let\u2019s focus on Earth. We have plenty of time to talk about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. I just wanted to, say it early. I wanted to become, your first ally.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Daisy smiled lightly. Her waning eyes looked beautiful and her smile also brought a smile on my face. I felt like I had obtained an unexpected, but reliable friend.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, do we sleep together, now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sleep with your daughter, but not your ally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just wanted to tease me, right!?\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, I chased away Daisy who started taking her clothes off to go to bed, then returned to Earth. Now that I thought about it, I had to face Beyond\u2019s 20th Floor Master now. Since it hasn\u2019t been a day since I used Overlord, I was a bit hesitant to fight him. Just thinking about a monster that was a mix of Dullahans and Grim Reapers made my stomach churn.</p><br/><p>In addition, I realized that I had not seen my family since I came back from the Sylon continent. Mother was complaining recently about never being able to see her son\u2019s face, so I planned on using this opportunity to show my face more.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Shin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia.\u201d</p><br/><p>The first one I met after coming home was Ludia. The scene of her in her white priestess robe vacuuming the floor was a bit ironic. The fact that she looked so used to it was also a bit sad.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you were going to come back home immediately. Did you end up going to the dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I just crashed in the guild house.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter making me worry to death, really\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t try to make any excuses. Ludia snorted at my honest apology and went back to vacuuming the floor. As she moved the vacuum cleaner forward and backward with as much skill as my mother, she murmured in a voice that barely went through the vacuum noise.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine as long as you\u2019re safe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for worrying about me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I can do for you, always.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice carried a self-deprecating tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cEver since I met you, there hasn\u2019t been a day I haven\u2019t thought about you. You\u2019re really annoying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were annoying too when we first\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I quickly dodged a vacuum cleaner swinging at my face. Ludia spoke as she glared.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow you hate losing an inch annoys me too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying what\u2019s right\u2026 No, sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia, who was preparing for a secondary attack, widened her eyes when I apologized. Then, she laughed and went back to vacuuming. She seemed to be finishing up, but it seemed she had more to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cI keep thinking about it recently\u2026 I\u2019ve gotten calmer now, and I\u2019ve got the ease of mind to look back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 good.\u201d</p><br/><p>At first, she didn\u2019t want to even move if I wasn\u2019t around. Now, however, it was fine even if I wasn\u2019t around her for several days, and she didn\u2019t even look for me as she climbed the dungeon with Shuna all day. It was a true improvement. It\u2019s been a month since she last crawled onto my bed as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike when I first met you, when we reunited\u2026 or when you killed Shina.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Ludia.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was very rare for Ludia to talk about that incident. Before I noticed, the vacuum cleaner was turned off.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt must have been because I was overwhelmed with so many emotions. I didn\u2019t know what the emotions I was feeling were. At that time, I thought I was working for revenge\u2026 but it seems that wasn\u2019t it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I imagined myself on the other side. What I would have done if it was you who died, not Shina. Then, the answer was simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia returned the vacuum cleaner where it belonged. It seemed we were the only ones in the house as it was completely silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow I behaved back then\u2026 must have been a desperate evasion.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt like I understood. Seeing her sorrow expression, that was the only thing I could do.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was relieved that you didn\u2019t die. Even when my younger sister died\u2026 I was relieved that it was Shina who died, not you. If it was the other way around, I would have killed Shina with my own hands, regardless of whether she was the Demon Lord\u2019s spy or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, you can stop there.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t forgive myself for how I felt back then. I didn\u2019t want to admit it. That\u2019s why. Even though the answer was so simple\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She sighed and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, back then\u2026 No, maybe even before, I must have been in love with you. You must have been more important to me than anything else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As I had just experienced a potentially catastrophic incident that stemmed from love, Ludia\u2019s confession didn\u2019t feel so light. While I was hesitating to say anything, Ludia made a ligh smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a reply. I already know you don\u2019t love me back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said I don\u2019t need a reply. Do you need to reject me thoroughly to be satisfied?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, her usual way of talking was back. Seeing her frown, I swallowed my words.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo the promise is null. It was just me being stubborn anyways, you don\u2019t need to take responsibility for me forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said don\u2019t reply, you orc.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia\u2019s hand slapped my arm. Then, she gently held my arm. A smile had returned to her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can stay just the way you are. I\u2019ll love you on my own and chase you on my own.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be painful for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be, stupid. Being able to stay with someone you love is a blessing in itself\u2026 Even if that person is in love with someone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>She let go of my arm, then put her hands on my shoulders. She fixed her sapphire-like blue eyes onto me and spoke as if to engrave her words on my mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan on ever letting go of this love. It might be burdensome and awkward, but just let me be. Being loved by a persistent girl like me is your misfortune, so\u2026 continue taking care of me from now.\u201d</p><br/><p>I had the feeling things would be exactly like how she described it. That I would be with her forever. I had no way of distancing myself away from her. Could Loretta do it? No, I was certain Loretta couldn\u2019t, and neither could Hwaya, Ye-Eun, or anyone else.</p><br/><p>The day I came to know my love, I obtained a life-long ally and a lovable burden that would follow me eternally.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

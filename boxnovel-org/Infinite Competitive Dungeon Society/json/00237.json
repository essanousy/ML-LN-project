Guardian (7)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Chapter 237. Guardian (7)</p><br/><p>Chapter 237. Guardian (7)</p><br/><p>Even as I was perplexed by the sudden change in scenery, I immediately spread my mana out to detect the surrounding terrain and potential enemies. By the time I understood what had happened, Daisy pulled my arm down and explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderground base, safe\u2026 close to safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the Book Walkers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMagic underground, maintains darkness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does darkness have to do with anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDragon Horn, ignite fire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard, don\u2019t call me Dragon Horn\u2026 Ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin barked at Daisy and opened his palm as if to ignite a fireball. Then, he exclaimed in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit, I\u2019m impressed. Putting this much restriction on me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnder the assumption we couldn\u2019t win, the base was created. Here, very hard to ignite fire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what does being unable to ignite fire have to do with Book Walkers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf dark, can\u2019t read books.\u201d</p><br/><p>I instantly remembered sneaking a spearmanship training manual into my bed to read it at night. When Mother discovered it, she smacked my back. Good times\u2026 Wait!</p><br/><p>\u201cBook Walkers aren\u2019t ordinary humans! How does darkness stop them from reading books!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you, see me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, but considering your level, I can clearly feel your presence and even the outline of your body\u2026 Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was strange. I was now level 71. Physical darkness should pose no hindrance to my sight. Wait, what did Daisy say at first?</p><br/><p>\u201cA magic that maintains darkness\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, Book Walkers can\u2019t read books. Book Walkers that can\u2019t read books, resistances disappear. Also, cannot be recorded.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy nodded as if she had been waiting for me to come to this conclusion. I realized that the magic in this place wasn\u2019t simple and voiced another question.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why a perpetually dark base was created?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo leave behind, Resistance Army. If Hydelcyon didn\u2019t die, he must be here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why those Book Walkers aren\u2019t coming in here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCreating fire through darkness magic, weakens Book Walkers extremely. Resistance Army wins easily. Their mission of first priority, annihilating invaders.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Daisy pointed to the side. It was at this point that I realized we were surrounded. It was partly because they were concealing themselves so thoroughly without exerting any signs of their presence, but also because Daisy had interrupted me before I could spread my mana out that far.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, a magic that dulled one\u2019s senses seemed to be included in the darkness magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are so many, much more than I thought. Surprising.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis voice\u2026 Daisy Ectradion!?\u201d</p><br/><p>A deep voice of a man cut through the darkness. Daisy lightly nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cFourth Dungeon explorer, race of long lived fools, a grunt, Sinan Kingdom\u2019s knight.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed the voice belonged to a Fourth Dungeon explorer who was the knight of a ruined kingdom and a member of a race with high life expectancy.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you just say my name!? I am\u2026 I was Sinan Kingdom\u2019s knight, Beren Matiz. And you are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy allies. Any more, secret. We require information.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, both you and Hydelcyon come to visit after a long time and that\u2019s all you guys can say? You\u2019re making me cry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, Hydelcyon, information.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy threw something to him. The knight received it and shouted in a shocked voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026 gold!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrunt, now, what floor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c21st. I can barely enter the Residential Area now. Don\u2019t tell me, you\u2019re still climbing the dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, still a beggar. In exchange for gold, Hydelcyon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The grunt\u2026 Beren Matiz audibly gulped.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Are you still on bad terms with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInformation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy filled a leather pouch with gold coins and shook it flamboyantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHydelcyon, a kite with string detached. Lost his explorer qualification. But me, promising future. Fat guild\u2026 Choose wisely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re straightforward as always\u2026 Everyone, put your weapons down. They aren\u2019t our enemies.\u201d</p><br/><p>In truth, I had already realized why I hadn\u2019t felt their presence before. There were the reasons I mentioned before, but it was also because they simply didn\u2019t have the skills to make me wary. Most of them were as good as that Beren Matiz, if not slightly weaker. Simply put, even a melting tuna could send them all to hell.</p><br/><p>\u201cEctradion, I don\u2019t know what happened, but don\u2019t hate him too much. He didn\u2019t look good. He\u2019s even spending his days quietly here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA woman, came to find him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. She seemed extremely beautiful, but it was almost as if she was bewitched by something. I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s so obsessed to that Hydelcyon who lost everything\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What are they, scheming?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScheming? Please.\u201d</p><br/><p>He replied with a smirk.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone here is barely living on buried in darkness. How can someone be scheming anything here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s fine. Location.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The underground base seemed to be bigger than I initially thought. After listening to the information Beren Matiz told for a long time, Daisy nodded and sent me a message.</p><br/><p>[They are, not lying.]</p><br/><p>[Couldn\u2019t you have just read everything with your Evil Eyes to begin with?]</p><br/><p>[Few people know, about my Evil Eyes. Only Hydelcyon and maybe couple others. Process of obtaining information, more natural to exist\u2026 Also, money, I wanted to give regardless.]</p><br/><p>Right, since Hydelcyon and Daisy have fought together in the front line, Hydelcyon undoubtedly knew about Daisy\u2019s Evil Eyes. However, grunts like Beren Matiz and the others likely didn\u2019t even know Daisy\u2019s abilities.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, as Daisy said, her intention was to give gold to any explorers who could enter the Residential Area. That way, he would be able to buy food for everyone else\u2026 I nodded silently and watched Daisy and Beren Matiz\u2019s exchange.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith this much\u2026 Everyone at the base will be able to eat fully for a few years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExplorers, how many are left?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have two in the Third Dungeon, three in the Fourth. We\u2019re all in the lower levels and barely make enough silver to feed everyone. Ectradion, you saved us. We were in a pinch because we can\u2019t even fight monsters in the dungeon right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe came, to solve that\u2026 Sorry we couldn\u2019t come earlier. One day, we\u2019ll come back. Everyone will be saved\u2026 by this person.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Daisy calmly apologized calmly, she pointed towards me. Beren Matiz asked with a curious voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHim? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you need, to know. We\u2019ll leave, now. Soon, you\u2019ll be able, to enter the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yeah. Since you said you\u2019ll take care of it, thanks. This place might be dark and gloomy, but I hope you have a nice time\u2026 Please, don\u2019t fight here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The underground base was huge, but quiet. There was no one walking around, and we could only hear faint moans occasionally. Daisy spoke without even blushing slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, dark and quiet. No matter how many times you do it, you can\u2019t make babies. The only thing they can do, is that. For a long time, it\u2019s been like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI get it, you don\u2019t have to comment on everything\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I despaired, wanting to shut my ears. At that moment, Daisy grabbed my arm and asked as she shook it meekly.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, is that fun? Why do men and women, when alone, always do that? The goal, is it not to reproduce? The reason sex slaves are expensive, is that. Why are men so crazy about that? Why do women love it so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said you don\u2019t have to comment on everything. Do you think I\u2019ll comment on everything instead!? Unfortunately, I don\u2019t know either! Unfortunately!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, can you stop being such a virgin and shut up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kuuuuu! I knew it, I shouldn\u2019t have come with these two! I clenched my fists and followed them. The desolate stillness and occasional moans seemed to drive me insane. At that moment, thankfully, Lin, who was leading the way after hearing the approximate location from Daisy, came to a stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you really were here, Sipua\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although we were still enshrouded in darkness, we had gotten close a person\u2019s presence. This powerful presence was telling me that she wasn\u2019t an ordinary person.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin, did you come to take me back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, you thought we\u2019d just leave you be?\u201d</p><br/><p>To be honest, as the aura she was giving off was similar to my level, it made me question whether she really was an administrative guild master. However, it was probably that Lin and other members of Fairy Garden were strange. After all, Loretta mentioned before that I would be able to defeat the administrative guild Lost Valley\u2019s guild master, Eleine, when I became level 80.</p><br/><p>Although I felt a bit sorry saying this, I somewhat understood why they couldn\u2019t beat their worlds\u2019 enemies even after receiving great powers from the dungeon. Although I thought all administrative guild masters were monsters like Loretta, now that I thought about it more carefully, rather than their personal strengths, the share of the dungeon\u2019s power they received when they became an administrative guild master seemed to be more important.</p><br/><p>\u201cSipua, you should know what situation the dungeon is in right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid the dungeon fall, Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything stopped. A place that must help train the Heroes and Guardians of countless worlds stopped just because of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, that\u2019s it? I was bound to the dungeon for over 2,500 years. Compared to that, the dungeon only had a day\u2019s worth of damages.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sipua\u2019s cold tone pierced Lin. Then, she turned her sharp gaze towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou came too, Earth\u2019s Hero. I thought you would come. Loretta, that wicked bitch! I apologize, but it had the opposite effect. I can\u2019t forgive everything that\u2019s happened because of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason Loretta sent me? She had done so simply because there weren\u2019t enough people, but it seemed Sipua was gravely mistaken. Not to mention, she sure was shameless. Only a short time had passed since the incident, but the positions of the victim and the assailant was completely flipped in her mind. To her, it seemed everything she had done for Hydelcyon was justified.</p><br/><p>Even if I explained, she would interpret it as she wanted, and it would only be counterproductive. As such, I stayed silent. However, Lin snorted and rebutted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey say if you save a stranger, he\u2019ll turn into your enemy. You sure are audacious, Sipua. He\u2019s a Hero, someone you should support\u2026 And that Lodert Hydelcyon is a brainless fool who tried to bully a Hero for his own benefits.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to spare, so I won\u2019t be giving you any time to say goodbye. We\u2019re leaving. Now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin! Please!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin gritted his teeth. His handgun was firmly grasped in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should know my personality. You should have been satisfied that Lodert Hydelcyon got off by just being kicked out to his continent\u2026 Our patience ends here. Sipua, this is it.\u201d</p><br/><p>A volatile tension filled the atmosphere. Lin\u2019s change in demeanor was so intimidating that I was even having trouble breathing. Daisy buried her face behind my back to avoid his killing intent.</p><br/><p>Sipua was also affected. Lin\u2019s killing intent caused her to freeze completely. When his killing intent diminished slightly from its peak, she barely managed to mutter some words.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease\u2026 Lin. Look at me. I love him\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs your determination to annihilate all worlds\u2019 enemies so weak that it\u2019ll crumble because of a single fool?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the first place, I was pressured by the other four into forming an oath to the Lord! I\u2019ve already done so much. Lin, please\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you one day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin gave a cut-throat answer as if to say it was his last bit of kindness.</p><br/><p>\u201cWrap everything up within a day. You can strengthen him with the power you have left too. As long as he\u2019s alive, a day will come when he\u2019s freed. Again, you have one day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn 24 hours, you\u2019ll be going back with us. I won\u2019t agree to any other requests, and the moment you protest, I\u2019ll drag you back myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Uk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sipua immediately ran back as if she didn\u2019t want to spend even a single more second with us. At first, I thought she was going back to spend what little time she had left with Lodert Hydelcyon. However, that wasn\u2019t it. Not long after Sipua disappeared, he appeared in her place. His entrance was so smooth that I thought they were playing some tag battle!</p><br/><p>\u201cDaisy Ectradion\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>He shouldn\u2019t have been able to see her face, but it seemed he realized who she was from her presence as he muttered Daisy\u2019s name emotionally.</p><br/><p>\u201cLodert, Hydelcyon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy spoke. As always, she was calm to the extreme.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour mind, it clear up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou refused me so adamantly, and the one you chose is him? That Hero? You chose a reckless fool who can\u2019t makes heads nor tails of the situation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. You're not, my type. Your face is, dirty. Your actions are, dirty. Your personality is, dirty. Your mind is, dirty. Though strangely, your mind is better now.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed he didn\u2019t have much to say in response as he simply glared in our direction. Although I couldn\u2019t read his expression in the darkness, I could tell from his voice that he was glaring at me with killing intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, didn\u2019t I tell you not to involve yourself with Daisy Ectradion\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, thanks to your advice, I got myself an excellent guild member. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m thankful to you for. Also, I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t want to breathe the same air as you, so can you screw off, please?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>As I felt sorry just telling him off, I also kicked casually. Seeing him flying back through the darkness, I asked Daisy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c12, out of 10.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about my shot. Thanks though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis mind, quite clear\u2026 Power of love?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you even know what love is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. In darkness, what man and woman do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>I burned with a sense of duty to fix Daisy\u2019s distorted knowledge. Lin then stopped me with a head smack.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should go rest too. I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you give her a day, Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sad not having a single day off in 2,500 years\u2026 Also, if we bring her back as she is now, she\u2019ll remain a lit ember ready to burst into flames. But if we give her more than a day, the dungeon and many of its explorers will receive critical blows. That was the best I could do for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Words that were completely unexpected from the way he talked to her earlier was coming out of Lin\u2019s mouth. I was so surprised that I imagined Lin\u2019s current expression and murmured.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just my whim. Noonim will beat me to death if she found out\u2026 but I couldn\u2019t help it because I remembered Loka\u2019s face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious about what happened between Lin and Lokanyan. There\u2019s also something I want to talk about with Lin\u2026 Since we have time, why don\u2019t we go drink together? I secretly snagged a whiskey that Father had been saving.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best offer you've made since we met. Good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy shook my arms fiercely and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, Kang Shin likes men\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNO!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the two of you, I will leave\u2026 I want to check, those that I knew, alive or dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome back before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy hopped away into the darkness and her presence eventually disappeared. Lin and I also began to wander in search of a nice place to drink. In this dark space, where one couldn\u2019t tell day apart from night, only time was passing steadily.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>What happened between Lin and Lokanyan?

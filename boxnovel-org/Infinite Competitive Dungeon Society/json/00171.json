What Is Not Allowed for Her (2)</p><br/><p>With its right leg\u2019s carapace broken off, the basilisk let out a furious roar that reverberated across the entire hilltop. Several of the people who heard the terrifying roar then became stiff, and signs of petrification could be seen on their bodies. I also halted for a moment, but I soon snapped out of it with the help of Soul Guard and my mana resistance. I then immediately saved Sumire, who had frozen stiff.</p><br/><p>[You can use Athena\u2019s power if you want.]</p><br/><p>[Really, Shin-nim?]</p><br/><p>[Yeah. Let\u2019s show them our strength. You also don\u2019t want to be looked down on, right?]</p><br/><p>[Yes, Shin-nim! I understand!]</p><br/><p>I fanned some wind toward Sumire, who was looking at me with respect and flew back into the air. After roaring, the runic patterns on the basilisk\u2019s carapace began to shine, and it shot small rock-like things everywhere. These rock-like bullets also petrified whoever they touched.</p><br/><p>[Kyaaooooooooo!]</p><br/><p>The basilisk\u2019s roar continued. Unless there was continued healing, it was easy for people to die. Long-ranged attackers were pouring attacks at the basilisk\u2019s exposed face, but the basilisk swung its massive tail and blocked the attacks before they could hit its face. His tail then fired more bullets at all the explorers. I charged toward him as I dodged these bullets.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlade Rush!\u201d</p><br/><p>Massive monsters had a boundless life force, making them difficult to kill. However, their size also made them easy targets. I easily dodged the basilisk\u2019s tail swing and weaved through the rain of rock bullets. Then, I stabbed my spear into its left leg with full force. Chaos flame once again flared up above its carapace, and the blades from Blade Rush also hammered on its carapace. Of course, just this wasn\u2019t enough to damage him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDark Thunder Explosion!\u201d</p><br/><p>The basilisk\u2019s body twitched for a moment, after which black lightning shot up from my body and poured into its carapace. The communication channel instantly became noisy.</p><br/><p>[What\u2019s that!? Isn\u2019t that the 15th Floor Master\u2019s skill!?]</p><br/><p>[I haven\u2019t seen that in 40 years!]</p><br/><p>[Can someone explain what happened? That guy isn\u2019t wearing something like the Dark Ratman Set in an SS+ rank raid, right?]</p><br/><p>[Oi, once that skill hits, it paralyzes its target regardless of the target\u2019s strength. Attack now!]</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Dark Thunder Explosion\u2019s duration wasn\u2019t that long! The moment the skill ended, I once again struck down at the carapace on its leg, then backed off. Immediately afterward, its tail swung past where I was standing just a moment ago.</p><br/><p>If it were to hit me, it would petrify the part of my body it hit, which would then be shattered by the following shock. It would be a fatal damage. In fact, one of the other explorers was hit and instantly died. These Platinum ranked explorers weren\u2019t all that much! How could they not read such a giant monster\u2019s movements?</p><br/><p>Regardless, once people began to die left and right, the surviving explorers became more spiteful and poured more attacks toward the basilisk. Almost everyone was attacking its left leg instead of its frozen right leg.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kugyaaaaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>At that moment, its carapace emitted a brilliant light. I instinctively flew up and avoided the light. Most of the flying explorers did the same. However, several of the explorers on the ground couldn\u2019t do so.</p><br/><p>These explorers then perfectly turned to stone.</p><br/><p>[Damn it, its armor\u2019s activating! Priests, hurry!]</p><br/><p>[Malph!]</p><br/><p>[Its eyes are shining! Attack! Stop it!]</p><br/><p>[Damn, was it too hard with 100 people\u2026!?]</p><br/><p>[Stop being defeatist and use your damned skills!]</p><br/><p>Thanks to someone\u2019s shout, bright lights began to shine from the ground. Among them was one particularly brilliant light. A beautiful girl holding an ornate shield was making the basilisk scream in pain\u2026 Wait, that\u2019s Sumire!</p><br/><p>[Look, the basilisk is petrifying!]</p><br/><p>[What!? Someone\u2019s petrifying the basilisk?]</p><br/><p>[A god\u2019s power! That girl must have a god\u2019s true name!]</p><br/><p>[An unknown explorer with a god\u2019s true name? What guild is she from? She must be the guild master, right?]</p><br/><p>[She\u2019s even young and pretty. She\u2019s just my type!]</p><br/><p>[Hey, you son of a bitch. Who the fuck are you? If we fail this raid, I\u2019m going to kill you. What guild are you from?]</p><br/><p>Good, Sumire! Well done!</p><br/><p>Sumire had undoubtedly created an opportunity for us to overturn the situation. Although the basilisk possessed a petrifying ability, it was pushed back by the Medusa\u2019s head on Athena\u2019s shield. Starting from its eyes, which were about to do something, it became partially petrified. The experienced explorers present did not miss this opportunity, shooting powerful attacks at the basilisk. Of course, father and I were among them.</p><br/><p>Father contained a powerful shockwave in his spear and successfully dealt a blow that the basilisk could not ignore. He had aimed for its petrified face. Although the petrification was done by a god\u2019s power, since the basilisk possessed a petrifying ability, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if it broke out of it sooner. It was better to shatter the petrified parts of its face before it recovered on its own.</p><br/><p>However, I aimed for a different place. Several long-ranged attackers were focusing its face, and as its one unpetrified eye began to shine, I avoided its face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaaaaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>I descended from the sky like an arrow and surged up the energy of Mad Typhoon. A whirlpool of chaos flame became compressed and gathered at the tip of my spear. With a spirited shout, I struck down at the basilisk\u2019s massive tail.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[Kyaaaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>Good, it was effective! With Twin-headed Ogre\u2019s Tattoo, I had gotten much stronger. With the momentum created by my quick descent, my attack successfully shattered the basilisk\u2019s tail armor!</p><br/><p>[The tail armor broke!]</p><br/><p>[There\u2019s a crack in its back armor! Attack there!]</p><br/><p>[Ah, wait! Stop!]</p><br/><p>Two flying attackers charged toward the basilisk\u2019s back despite the dissuasive shout. They were both warriors holding a hammer and an axe respectfully. They seemed to be from the same guild, as they simultaneously struck down on the basilisk\u2019s back with their weapons filled with aura. Immediately afterward, the basilisk\u2019s back emitted a bright light. A message then rang out in my ear.</p><br/><p>[Sage Time guild, annihilated!]</p><br/><p>\u201cA-Annihilated\u2026 They\u2019re going to get sage time for sure\u2026\u201d[1. Read the translator\u2019s note.]</p><br/><p>I was curious as to who came up with that guild name, but unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t all that important right now. I broke out in a cold sweat as I checked the basilisk\u2019s back. What took away the Sage Time guild members\u2019 lives was none other than a group of flying snakes. There were hundreds of mini-basilisks shooting out from the basilisk\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>[Damn, this never happened before!]</p><br/><p>[They\u2019re going to split! Hurry up and kill them!]</p><br/><p>The communication channel became noisy with shocked voices and curses. The magicians\u2019 attacks became focused on the mini-basilisks, but their magic resistance was annoyingly high. In other words, warriors had to take care of them. The one who stepped up was the man who froze the basilisk\u2019s right leg before.</p><br/><p>[Magicians, focus on stopping the basilisk\u2019s movement! Focus especially on its head! Warriors, kill the small ones and break the basilisk\u2019s dorsal armor!]</p><br/><p>He was most likely Desert Scorpion\u2019s guild master. After shouting out his orders, he charged toward the group of mini-basilisks, followed by about ten flying warriors, all wearing the same fluttering Desert Scorpion cape. As I also didn\u2019t want to miss this opportunity, I hurriedly charged forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cSharana, we\u2019re going full speed!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes, Master!]</p><br/><p>\u201cGale Track!\u201d</p><br/><p>There were finally guys that could boost my attack power. There was no way I would let others have them! I frantically accelerated and shot past the others.</p><br/><p>\u2018No matter how high leveled you are, you won\u2019t be able to catch up to my speed! I am the owner of Hermes\u2019 true name and the contractor of the unique wind elemental, Sharana!\u2019</p><br/><p>[Who\u2019s that!?]</p><br/><p>[He\u2019s that Gold ranked guy.]</p><br/><p>[Gold rank? With that speed? You\u2019re kidding, right?]</p><br/><p>A trail of chaos flame was left in the path I took. I charged toward the mini-basilisks like a comet. The first mini-basilisk that faced me blew up after being hit with my spear. Great! With this\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cCome!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You used Provoke! All enemies in the area will attack you with great hostility!]</p><br/><p>In an instant, I was surrounded by mini-basilisks. They seemed to be capable of petrifying people with their gazes as I could feel a ticklish sensation of resistance from parts of my body they were glaring at. Of course, they weren\u2019t strong enough to penetrate Soul Guard. I smirked and sent them flying. Most of them were killed in a single strike.</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaaaaaaaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Looks like we won\u2019t be needed. Turn! We\u2019re attacking its dorsal area!]</p><br/><p>[Hm\u2026]</p><br/><p>Magic flashed from all sides, while the basilisk\u2019s attacks shook the earth. Of course, its armor was being broken by the explorers even now. Everyone present had the strength to threaten the basilisk\u2019s life. Perhaps, it was why this battle seemed especially exhilarating. After all, this was the first time fighting with explorers stronger than me!</p><br/><p>However, I still wanted to defeat that guild master.</p><br/><p>[Master, the wind energy is getting stronger!]</p><br/><p>\u201cGather as much of it as you can! We\u2019re going to make a huge attack!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as I ordered Sharana, I constantly changed the direction of my charge and pierced through the mini-basilisks with my spear. Ten, twelve, fifteen, twenty\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cA bit more\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA god\u2019s power!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, is that guy a monster!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, along with the shocked exclamations of a few explorers, the basilisk stopped moving. It's over 300-meter long armor was completely frozen white! It was undoubtedly that guild master\u2019s attack\u2026 For a desert scorpion, you sure like using freezing attacks!</p><br/><p>[Attack while Scizarnath\u2019s power holds it back! It\u2019s almost out of stamina! If we can properly break its armor, it will be our victory!]</p><br/><p>His confident voice reached all the explorers through the communication channel. The explorers then used their most powerful skills they were saving to break the basilisk\u2019s armor bit by bit. The armor that once covered its giant body perfectly was now in a pitiful state.</p><br/><p>It was then that I finished the thirtieth mini-basilisk and prepared for Gale Track\u2019s final blow. I could feel the wind energy gathering around me from Peruta Circuit\u2019s powerful rotational force forming a storm-like whirlpool. With a grin, I shot up. Although I didn\u2019t obtain Ogre Power yet, Twin-headed Ogre\u2019s Tattoo gave me just enough strength to try this.</p><br/><p>[What\u2019s that whirlpool? It\u2019s flying up!]</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s that guy.]</p><br/><p>[Does he also have a god\u2019s true name?]</p><br/><p>[No way. It\u2019s already surprising that a new holder of a god\u2019s true name appeared today. Throughout the entire First Dungeon, there are less than 20 people with a god's true name!]</p><br/><p>\u2018Yeah, keep talking!\u2019</p><br/><p>I was already hundreds of meters up in the air. The mighty wind whirling around my spear and body was so powerful that it was hard to see with the naked eye. However, I wasn\u2019t done yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cGigant!\u201d[2. The author changed the skill name from Gigantic to Gigant. The pronunciation is easier to see now too.]</p><br/><p>The pressure on my arms instantly became stronger. Even with the stats, gods\u2019 true names, tattoos, and strength from Chaotic Spear, it is hard to use Gigant. I could tell that I could only last about 2 minutes with this enlarged spear.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, that was more than enough to finish off the basilisk.</p><br/><p>\u201cSky God\u2019s Rage!\u201d</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>A golden lightning descended on the long and thick Chaotic Spear. The wind energy gathered from Gale Track changed its property through Sharana\u2019s influence and began to empower Sky God's Rage further. The lightning energy instantly became amplified, dying the clear sky in a golden hue. The lightning spear immediately grabbed everyone\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>[I knew it, he\u2019s a holder of a god\u2019s true name!]</p><br/><p>[Who is that bastard!? No, what is this guild!?]</p><br/><p>[E-Eh\u2026? Wait\u2026 The 1st place for guild contribution! It might get stolen!]</p><br/><p>[Hey, stop! Getting 1st place over the host?]</p><br/><p>[Did anyone tell them?]</p><br/><p>[They said they were all Gold ranked! Would you have told them!?]</p><br/><p>[Hurry up and kill the basilisk before he attacks!]</p><br/><p>[Please, if it were that easy, god\u2019s power wouldn\u2019t have been necessary!]</p><br/><p>It was already hard to just kill it together, but it seemed there was some rule. Explorers sure liked to make things difficult\u2026 Of course, it was none of my business.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, come into the spear!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kyahaha! It has an incredible energy, Master!]</p><br/><p>The lightning was strengthened once again. I found it hard to keep my eyes open. However, I couldn\u2019t stop now. I forced my eyes open and tightened my grip on the enlarged Sky God\u2019s Rage spear. Then, as I descended toward the roaring basilisk, I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be the one to take its head!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You used Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry! All party members are cleansed of negative status effects. All party members\u2019 attack power increases by 50 percent for the duration. All party members become super-armored, unfazed by enemy attacks.]</p><br/><p>Then, I activated the effect of Twin-headed Ogre\u2019s Tattoo, which boosted the damage of a close-ranged attack skill by 50% once a day. Even though I was wearing armor, Twin-headed Ogre\u2019s Tattoo appeared above it and glowed with a crimson light. Feeling the incoming threat, the basilisk shot a petrifying breath toward me, but it was blocked by the force of Sky God\u2019s Rage.</p><br/><p>I became a streak of a crimson comet and shot down toward the basilisk.</p><br/><p>As it was the final blow of a charge skill, my armor, and Giant Wolf\u2019s Tattoo boosted the damage by 110%, Gale Track boosted the damage by 200%, Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry boosted the damage by 50%, and finally, Twin-headed Ogre\u2019s Tattoo boosted the damage by 50%. In total, the attack just now was increased by 410%. Of course, as that was just the increase, the actual damage I did was 510%. There was no need to describe its destructive power.</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t done. I added Heroic Strike on top of everything. I scraped together every bit of mana in my body and poured it into my spear. As I swallowed the Mana Potion I had prepared in my mouth, I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine Speed!\u201d</p><br/><p>My already unfollowable speed became not three times, but ten times faster. There was no chance for the basilisk to dodge my attack. I took the basilisk\u2019s petrifying gaze without being fazed, and struck my spear down on its forehead!</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>It was very fortunate. After all, the basilisk undoubtedly had bones! With Skull Breaker\u2019s effect, all critical damage was increased by 50%. As critical hits normally dealt 200% of the normal amount, with the Skull Breaker title\u2019s effect, the attack was amplified to 300%! I found it funny that I was playing with numbers so much, but the result wasn\u2019t funny in the slightest.</p><br/><p>[Kugyaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>Once the spear collided with its forehead, it discharged the lightning of ultimate strength and pierced through its head. The spear, which was dozens of meters long, split the basilisk\u2019s head into two! The basilisk barely squeezed out its death throe before it became silent. From its split head, it no longer emitted the petrifying breath or gaze.</p><br/><p>Immediately afterward, the armor left on its body detonated. Its body became dust and disappeared.</p><br/><p>The SS+ rank 500-man raid boss was finished.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>What is a sage time?</p><br/><p>It is the short period of time given to the Braves who toiled through hardships and agony, where their brain functions the most rationally, allowing them to answer the most philosophical questions!

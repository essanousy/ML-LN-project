This achievement increases the reward!]</p><br/><p>[You received 2 stat points for completing the Event Raid.]</p><br/><p>[Rewards will be distributed in order of contribution. All guilds other than the annihilated guilds achieved the necessary minimum contribution! Guild masters will be rewarded in order of guild contribution. Leftover rewards will then be distributed among non-guild master explorers.]</p><br/><p>[Guild Revival\u2019s contribution is the highest! Its guild master may choose a reward.]</p><br/><p>[1. Evil Eyes of Petrification (Legend)</p><br/><p>2. Mega Rock Breaker (Epic)</p><br/><p>3. Rock Tail</p><br/><p>\u2026]</p><br/><p>[Guild \u2018Revival\u2019 became C rank! When challenging Event Dungeons or Event Raids, when 5 or more guild members are present, all guild members\u2019 abilities will be increased by 7%!]</p><br/><p>I raised my head. All the surviving members were staring at me. Then, the man who talked down to us in the beginning, Ralph, flew over to me with his cape fluttering.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Pass over the picking right! You can\u2019t be thinking of taking the reward before the host, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShould the host always get the first pick?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what the dungeon\u2019s system seems to think.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFool, it\u2019s a regulation! The host lets others participate in an Event Raid, and in exchange, the host chooses the reward first. It\u2019s a basic courtesy in the dungeon!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was an interesting claim. I felt like I had experienced it before. The part where some fools are trying to press an unwritten rule!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you requested for help because you couldn\u2019t have taken care of it alone. We accepted it because we had something to gain from it. There\u2019s no reason for us to hand over what\u2019s rightly ours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to defy Desert Scorpion, the First Dungeon\u2019s strongest guild? Do you need me to explain why one plus one is two?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone understands that one plus one is two, but no one understands why we have to give up something that belongs to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, I turned and stared at Desert Scorpion\u2019s guild master, who was standing in mid-air without looking our way.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? My guild was acknowledged as the first place in the contribution by the system, and probably by everyone else here. Will you not accept this result?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was silent. Meanwhile, Ralph tried to grab me by the collar but backed off after seeing Peika discharge a bit of lightning. Then, he shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe system is weird, too. Without Master, it would have been impossible for you to deal the final blow to the basilisk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour guild master raised contribution thanks to me too. Regardless, I want to hear his thoughts. No, before that, I want to know. Did this \u2018regulation\u2019 apply to you when you weren\u2019t hosts?\u201d</p><br/><p>No one responded. The communication channel buzzed.</p><br/><p>[Hey, Newbie. Desert Scorpion is an S ranked guild. Simply put, it\u2019s one of the strongest guilds in the First Dungeon. I like what you\u2019re trying to do, but if you don\u2019t follow the rules they created, you won\u2019t have a good future.]</p><br/><p>[Isn\u2019t it obvious that this rule only applies when they\u2019re the host? Do you know how much crap they spout in the raids they\u2019re invited to? Everyone tries their best to get the first place contribution, so who\u2019d want to give it up? Tsk, those bastards.]</p><br/><p>[I was impressed with your spearmanship, do as you want. With your guild\u2019s strength, I doubt the Desert Scorpion will be able to do much. Plus, I\u2019m looking forward to it\u2026 The day you overtake them will be the day the dungeon\u2019s caste system changes.]</p><br/><p>[Let me add something. Can you give one of your guys to our guild? Just one. Honestly, Just one.]</p><br/><p>[Where is your confidence coming from, you pervert? Who are you? Don\u2019t change your voice and use your real voice. Come on.]</p><br/><p>I looked at Desert Scorpion\u2019s guild master once again. He finally opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI witnessed your strength. To be honest, I was impressed\u2026 My guild can make you even stronger. Throw away your title as a guild master and come to us. If it\u2019s you, we can even make you the vice-guild master. Since you came this far on your own, you should know what the wise thing to do is.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a complete non-sequitur.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><br/><p>I threw away any hesitation I had and picked the Evil Eyes of Petrification. Immediately afterward, my eye stung with a burning sensation. I could barely hold in my scream.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuuuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe chose the reward\u2026! Damn, is that\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[The Evil Eyes of Petrification tests your capability as its wielder. Peruta Circuit rotates strongly! Mad Typhoon activates! Soul Guard activates! High-rank Spirit Mastery activates! Overwhelm activates! The power of all elementals connected to you undulates!]</p><br/><p>[The Evil Eyes of Petrification acknowledges you as its rightful owner. The power of petrification is vested in your eyes. You can draw the full strength of Evil Eyes of Petrification.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained the Evil Eyes of Petrification! Your magic stat increases by 100. With just your will, you can petrify all targets with magic resistance under S rank. You can also turn petrified targets back to normal. You can remove petrification status effect from targets petrified through other means. At your current level, depending on the amount of mana you imbue, you can petrify targets up to SS+ rank. Even if a target cannot be petrified, its movement speed will be decreased if exposed to your gaze! Overwhelm skill strengthened the Evil Eyes of Petrification! It will increase further through intelligence stat, magic stat, and Overwhelm\u2019s skill level.]</p><br/><p>[Your resistance to all types of Evil Eyes increases.]</p><br/><p>[You become the focal point of gods with inheritances related to the eyes.]</p><br/><p>When the pain disappeared, and I regained my senses, I blinked my eyes as I thought over the messages I had heard. My eyes didn\u2019t hurt anymore. In fact, they felt extremely refreshed. I felt like I could see all the mana in the world.</p><br/><p>A thought crossed my mind; I immediately asked Ruyue.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you make me a mirror?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un!]</p><br/><p>A large mirror of ice instantly appeared, reflecting my entire body. I put up my helmet\u2019s visor and checked my eyes. I spat out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, shit.\u201d</p><br/><p>My black Korean irises had become golden. Although the center of my irises took a hint of gold after contracting Peika, it had been barely noticeable. Now, however, it was easy for anyone to see.</p><br/><p>Plus, almost as if the entire milky way had been stuffed inside my eyes, countless particles of light were sparkling within.</p><br/><p>No, my eyes became anime! It looks like I have eighth-grade syndrome! What am supposed to do when I use these eyes!? Yell, \u2018Banishment, this world!\u2019???</p><br/><p>[Master became like me!]</p><br/><p>Peika deactivated Spirit Aura on her own and coiled around my arm. It seemed she was thrilled. Wait, this meant my eyes were like Loretta\u2019s. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t so bad\u2026</p><br/><p>In any case, the members of Desert Scorpion didn\u2019t look so happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat bastard got Evil Eyes\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. Evil Eyes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe must have our revenge! What guild was he from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRevival! From here on now, guild Revival is banned from the Residential Area!\u201d</p><br/><p>After realizing what I obtained, Desert Scorpion\u2019s guild members became enraged and caused a ruckus. Meanwhile, the guild master slowly descended from the sky toward me. I could see his eyes flashing with subdued anger.</p><br/><p>However, what he said next was completely unexpected.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, are you an explorer of Beyond?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 How did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause Revival isn\u2019t a guild within the First Dungeon. I looked at the list of guilds this afternoon, so I\u2019m sure. The only way your guild could be here is if your guild was of Beyond\u2019s affiliation. After all, only Beyond\u2019s guilds can be invited to the raids from all dungeons.\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s\u2026 amazing! I thought we could participate in the First Dungeon\u2019s raid because I was originally from the First Dungeon, but it seemed that wasn\u2019t the reason. However, after confirming that I was from Beyond, he continued with an even more enraged voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Beyond explorers always act so rampantly. Evil Eyes\u2026 You dare take Evil Eyes from the Event Raid I hosted!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but this belongs to me. I\u2019m just saying this in case you somehow believe otherwise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow arrogant. Even if you came to possess Evil Eyes, do you think you could wield it properly with your low level?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, if you want to continue talking, can you pick your reward first? Other people are waiting to pick theirs, you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>I then added.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, can you get out of my face? You\u2019re even uglier up close.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou and your guild won\u2019t be able to enter the First Dungeon\u2019s Residential Area. You\u2019ll pay for taking Desert Scorpion lightly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><br/><p>He snorted at my innocent question.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to use any shops or auction houses. My guild has the power to make that happen. Also, you won\u2019t be able to see Event Dungeons or Event Raids for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s quite surprising!\u201d</p><br/><p>I wondered since when non-administrative guilds could do such a thing. I suspected that an administrative guild was backing them up.</p><br/><p>However, even if what he said was true, we could simply use other dungeons\u2019 shops and auction houses. Event Dungeons and Event Raids? We could simply go to other dungeons\u2019 Event Dungeons and Event Raids. At this moment, I became certain. That was, becoming a Beyond explorer had freed me from the conflicts between the explorers and guilds of the First Dungeon.</p><br/><p>Since I knew that, I smiled lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk\u2026! Know that no explorers will participate in any Event Dungeons or Event Raids, you host. Let\u2019s see how long you can continue to climb the dungeon alone\u2026 One more thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>He grimaced.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t become involved with Daisy Ectradion. Otherwise, what I just said will only be a child\u2019s play compared to what you\u2019ll go through.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he turned around and left. I grabbed the Chaotic Spear, which had fallen after the effect of Gigant wore off, then tilted my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaisy Ectradion? Who\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>His words remained in my mind. My intuition told me that the name would come up again. I looked over at the explorers, who were talking amongst themselves to choose their rewards, while I thought I should go back and ask Loretta about it.</p><br/><p>That very night.</p><br/><p>[An announcement to all explorers of the First Dungeon. It has come to light that the First Dungeon\u2019s S ranked guild, Desert Scorpion, violated the First Dungeon\u2019s rules and bribed an administrative guild to oppress other explorers for personal reasons. Four out of five administrative guild masters have testified. Thus, Desert Scorpion has been demoted to D rank, and will eternally be restricted to 10 maximum members.]</p><br/><p>[Please hurry. Unless guild members withdraw until the maximum member limit is met, guild members, including the guild master, will be randomly kicked out. Also, all members that withdrew will be unable to enter another guild for ten years, and will forever lose the right to become a guild master.]</p><br/><p>[The guild master and members of Desert Scorpion will be unable to participate in Event Dungeons and Event Raids for 50 years. They are also forbidden from hosting Event Dungeons or Event Raids. Furthermore, their contribution points in Floor Master battles will be deducted, and they must pay 1.5 times the average amount for all items in the Floor Shop.]</p><br/><p>[Desert Scorpion members who withdraw within the next one hour will only face the first penalty.]</p><br/><p>That night, Desert Scorpion completely collapsed. From what I heard, the vice-guild master was the first to leave.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t this too much, Loretta!? I appreciate the sentiment, but\u2026 the love is too much!</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>If you touch small Loretta, you just die. It\u2019s game over.</p><br/><p>The conflict between First Dungeon\u2019s explorers and guild, and a little foreshadowing was shown this chapter. Desert Scorpion isn\u2019t the only S ranked guild, so you don\u2019t have to be disappointed!</p><br/><p>Also, I\u2019m sure most readers figured out who Daisy Ectradion. In that case, you should know who this chapter title refers to! Shin, let\u2019s go sell things!</p><br/><p>Popularity contest is here! The following are the categories:</p><br/><p>1. Favorite character from the entire series</p><br/><p>2. Favorite heroine (from Loretta, Hwaya, Ludia, Ye-Eun)</p><br/><p>3. Harem or pure-love? (I know some people might say that harem can be pure-love, but you know what I mean).</p><br/><p>Answer here:</p><br/>\n</div>"}

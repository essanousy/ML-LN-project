Breakthrough (3)</p><br/><p>\u201cThese guys don\u2019t shoot nukes or anything, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Of course not. Though, it would have been a disaster if they invaded Earth.]</p><br/><p>Sherafina\u2019s calm tone made my head hurt. Using Talaria, I made an instant acceleration and shouted as I dodged more bullets.</p><br/><p>\u201cDortu, they\u2019re all metallic, can\u2019t you do something?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. They are too fast. If Dortu touches the main body, Dortu can do something.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI can do something too if I can get to their main body.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu\u2026]</p><br/><p>Dortu seemed sad, so I asked to console him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about defending?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. I am confident in defending.]</p><br/><p>\u201cPerfect, then I\u2019ll leave it to you. Peika, let\u2019s hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes!]</p><br/><p>I felt Peika\u2019s energy filling me up. Using Lightning God\u2019s power, I amplified Peika\u2019s power as I increased my speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to stop me, you\u2019ll have to show yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Breakthrough, even quicker!</p><br/><p>With Peruta Circuit sucking in surrounding mana, I could maintain Divine Speed to a small extent. When my speed became incomparably quicker than before, the barrage of bullets couldn\u2019t even hit my shadows.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the 86th floor was unlike previous floors in that it was a vast wilderness. I didn\u2019t know where I needed to go to find the stairway to the next floor, where Loretta should be waiting to greet me with a smile.</p><br/><p>In Beyond, the pathways were so narrow that I didn\u2019t really need to search for the correct path. Only from the 86th floor did this dungeon start to feel like an actual labyrinth.</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. Large metallic objects are appearing.]</p><br/><p>It seemed the enemy realized bullets couldn\u2019t do anything against me, as immediately after Dortu warned me, giant metallic balls shot up from the ground. Coming out of the ground like that is the special right of robots in Hero shows!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>The enemies all looked extremely boorish, almost as if an unskilled blacksmith melded metals to resemble humans. But they were undoubtedly moving, and their hands held threatening bazookas. Bazookas!?</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. One of those will make it easier to shoot bullets carrying Dortu\u2019s power.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. It will also let Dortu interfere and dominate them.]</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you just shoot tiny metals like last time? Normal monsters don\u2019t drop weapons that often!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. That uses too much mana. Dortu believes in Master.]</p><br/><p>\u2026 This guy\u2019s trying to get back at me, right? Because I hurt his feelings before, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, it\u2019s coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>Because I was charging through the air without much thought, dozens of bullets were already stuck in my armor. Even with Dortu\u2019s power protecting me, the force of their impact was huge. They carried overwhelming mana which well surpassed what Earth\u2019s firearms were capable of. If Leon saw them, he might go mad from happiness. Though, he might not live for long.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t the point. What was important was how much bazooka shells would hurt if even these tiny bullets hurt so much.</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. They\u2019re coming.]</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine Speed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that things had come to this, I used the dungeon\u2019s Divine Speed even if it used more mana. With my already quick speed increased by more than five times, I shot up just before the bazooka shell could reach me. Immediately, I shot my spear out carrying a hefty amount of lightning.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, the spear carried more than just lightning. It easily pierced through one metal robot, and as the spear flew back into my hand, the metal robot fell to the ground helplessly.</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. Commencing Analysis.]</p><br/><p>Dortu\u2019s trusty voice immediately rang out in one ear. The spear had obviously carried Dortu\u2019s power as well. Since I couldn\u2019t take their weapons and fight with them, I had thrown Dortu towards them.</p><br/><p>Although the pierced robot burned up from the lightning and stopped functioning completely, once Dortu\u2019s analysis ended, he would be able to make use it. The only downside was that my armor\u2019s defense would decrease slightly while Dortu was focusing his energy on analyzing the enemy.</p><br/><p>Once the spear came back into my hands, I quickly threw it once more. The robots\u2019 formation broke down as another robot plummeted to the ground. Feeling their bodies changing slightly, I grinned.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank goodness I have Dortu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thanks to Dortu, I could approach this world\u2019s enemy in a completely different angle. Without Dortu, my only choice would have been fighting them head-on.</p><br/><p>Considering how more bullets and cannon shells were coming my way as time went on, I was naturally worried about having to fight a fully-armed army. Fighting an army with such firepower head on? That would be suicide unless my luck stat was over 10,000. I would rather fight against all of Earth\u2019s soldiers. These mana-reinforced bullets just hurt too much.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, it seemed Peika was angry that I only praised Dortu. The spear in my hands crackled noisily with lightning as Peika complained.</p><br/><p>[What about me, Master? Am I useless to Master?]</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika\u2019s always amazing. I shouldn\u2019t even need to say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Huhu, that\u2019s right!]</p><br/><p>Damn, if I didn\u2019t have to please my elementals from time to time, I could proudly say an Elementalist was the best class. Though\u2026 I guess it\u2019s fine since elementals are cute.</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. They\u2019re increasing in number.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIncreasing in number? What do you\u2026 Wow.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stopped in the middle of accelerating through the air. Although I was somewhat expecting it, I didn\u2019t expect to encounter such a situation so quickly\u2026</p><br/><p>From the round, hundreds of robots were shooting up into the sky carrying what looked like machine guns, sniper rifles, bazookas, and all sorts of firearms. I had to ask Sherafina.</p><br/><p>\u201cSherafina, am I also the first one fight these Eliminators?\u201d</p><br/><p>[That is so.]</p><br/><p>Sherafina\u2019s answer couldn\u2019t be more clear-cut. Sherafina, just how far do you plan on pushing me! Are you just forcing all the troubling monsters onto me!?</p><br/><p>\u201cArgh, whatever! Let\u2019s just fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You used Provoke! It was ineffective against the enemies.]</p><br/><p>Even the Provoke I resolutely used was nulled. Thinking about it now, these guys weren\u2019t really living beings. That also meant killing them wouldn\u2019t result in death energy.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, I had many skills that used blood, charm, and other concepts that worked against living beings. Against these guys, I couldn\u2019t use any of them!</p><br/><p>I felt my blood pressure rising.</p><br/><p>\u201cDortu, are you done yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. One day is not enough.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I jumped in surprise at Dortu\u2019s words. However, I was only greeted with bullets from all sides.</p><br/><p>\u201cGod, to think I\u2019d actually have to fight under raining bullets.\u201d</p><br/><p>I grumbled and shot out my spear. Using Divine Speed and injecting mana into my arm, I cut, blew, and smashed away all bullets flying towards me. Although a powerful resistive force pushed back against me, I decided to charge forward. I just hoped I was going in the right direction!</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>I was wrong. Because of the sheer vastness of this flow, I ended up wandering around for a whole day.</p><br/><p>\u201cDortu?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Just a bit more time.]</p><br/><p>I was talking with Dortu over a long distance. He had remained where we took out the first robot and was focusing on his analysis. Because of the limitation on the number of elementals I could summon, I only had Peika to help me break through this battlefield of bullets. Strangely, these robots kept appearing without end.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust how did they lose if there are so many of them left? Aren\u2019t there stronger guys on the upper floors too?\u201d</p><br/><p>[The Hero attacked the main body alone.]</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the main body isn\u2019t here, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Right.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaah, I\u2019m doomed.\u201d</p><br/><p>No hopes and dreams. With nothing else to do, I simply wandered around the vast wilderness and continued to fight the robots.</p><br/><p>After some time passed, Dortu finally succeeded in controlling two robots.</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. Fire the signal for the counterattack.]</p><br/><p>As Dortu was contracted to me, he instantly located me and started flying towards me with his two robots. The only problem was that Dortu needed almost a day to reach me as I had traveled a day\u2019s distance. As a result, I mostly waited in place during this time and focused on completely breaking all robots I came across.</p><br/><p>As these robots reformed from even a tiny fragment, I utilized elementals existing in this place and wiped the robots away completely.</p><br/><p>\u201cElemental Tempest! Elemental Blade!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Uweeeeeek!]</p><br/><p>[Whoooooooo!]</p><br/><p>[They\u2019re not living nor dead! Let\u2019s break them all!]</p><br/><p>[But how are these guys moving?]</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t know!]</p><br/><p>[You don\u2019t know?]</p><br/><p>[Uweeeeeeek!]</p><br/><p>Although I could only use two of my contracted elementals, there was no limit on using the free elementals. The elementals\u2019 incessant chattering kept me awake as I broke through this boring wilderness.</p><br/><p>That said, one of these elementals just might have to go\u2026</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. I reached Master.]</p><br/><p>Dortu finally joined up with me. The two robots I initially shot down were now dyed black, and they showed no signs of ever having been pierced through.</p><br/><p>For the record, these two were each armed with a bazooka and a minigun, and couldn\u2019t be more frightening if they tried.</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. Now, it\u2019s Dortu\u2019s time to shine.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. I\u2019ll leave it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dortu immediately followed up on his confident speech. The robots held up their blackened weapons and began shooting in all directions.</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. I can control more with Master\u2019s mana.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best news I\u2019ve heard all day!\u201d</p><br/><p>I retracted Elemental Blade and poured my mana into Dortu. Immediately, the shooting speed of his robots went up. It felt like they were shooting laser beams rather than bullets.</p><br/><p>However, it was still only two robots against many. As I said before, the other side had thousands of robots scattered about the wilderness, and there was still one enemy that I couldn\u2019t detect shooting me from far away.</p><br/><p>\u201cDortu, how long do I have to wait? Another day!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu.]</p><br/><p>Dortu didn\u2019t say anything beyond that. I clenched my teeth and shot my spear at a bazooka-carrying robot. Then, I fell in thought. If I use Overlord and wipe these guys out, won\u2019t Dortu need less time to dominate them? No, will using Overlord guarantee that?</p><br/><p>At that moment, the enemy formation seemed to break, and a small explosion erupted from the middle. A few robots blew up followed by more robots.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s only now starting.]</p><br/><p>Three blackened robots were flying towards us. I aimed my spear at them but realized what was happening before it was too late. Dortu had taken control of them!</p><br/><p>Dortu had initiated his counterattack against the weapon-controlling Eliminators.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What It Means to Climb the First Dungeon (1)</p><br/><p>How much time passed? When I noticed Ellos\u2019 message that he arrived in front of the door, I was dripping with sweat.</p><br/><p>[Thanks for waiting, friend.]</p><br/><p>\u201cNah, I didn\u2019t wait that long.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll make a party right away.]</p><br/><p>When I found the party Ellos made and tapped it with my finger, the scenery warped. In front of me was Ellos, who I now saw for the first time in 4 years.</p><br/><p>\u201cEllos!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Who are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos had grown a lot since the last time we met. His slightly frail body now had muscles, and his pretty boy face was a lot manlier. If I were to bring him to Earth, he could even debut as an actor straight away.</p><br/><p>However, Ellos was tilting his head as he was staring at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but this party is already full. Can you look for another\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Kang Shin. What are you saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, you kid\u2026 Eh, you have the same voice!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos\u2019 expression went stiff. The shield warrior behind him, who I believed was named Paul, stepped forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way, the monster from back then became this handsome? What did you pick up and eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell I did technically pick and eat things, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Handsome? He was flattering me too much. It was simply a monster becoming human again. Taking out Flesh Golem\u2019s Giant Toe from my inventory, I placed it in Ellos\u2019 hand and said, \u201cHere\u2019s a reunion gift, Ellos.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEck? What\u2019s this, a toe? Eh, an install item? How creepy!\u201d</p><br/><p>I got the reaction I wanted and was satisfied. I then looked at Ellos\u2019 companions. There was Paul who I met on the 5th floor and a woman I had not seen before. If my memory served correctly, there should a man named Celtine\u2026 Eh? He wasn\u2019t here?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to Celtine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe died. It was a heroic death in battle against dozens of invaders.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos\u2019 calm expression while talking about the death of his comrade gave me chills. Ellos then showed a bitter smile and tapped my shoulder lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. The moment we became warriors, we prepared ourselves for death. He used his life to protect everyone. Even though he\u2019s no longer here, he lives on in our hearts. I decided to honor his death by chasing the invaders away from our continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re okay with it, I won\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, thanks. Anyways, it\u2019s great meeting you again, Shin. The aura coming off of you surprised me. I had heard the rumors, but you really were a Hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but I don\u2019t really know about that Hero thing, though I\u2019ve heard it a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>I proceeded to shake hands with Paul, then faced the woman standing behind Ellos. It was my first time meeting her. She was a beautiful woman with deep-violet hair which was tied down, and a pair of calm eyes matching her hair\u2019s color. She wore light clothing that made it easy to move, had a large bow in one hand, and wore a quiver on her back. Strangely, a silver ring on her ring finger stood out.</p><br/><p>I looked at Ellos. He was also wearing a ring on his ring finger.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this is your fianc\u00e9e!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re unexpectedly not dense. Right, this is my fianc\u00e9e, Baruela Atuna. Isn\u2019t she pretty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, I\u2019m Baruela Atuna. I\u2019ve heard a lot about you from Ellos.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baruela put her free hand (sorry, but it looked frail) on her chest and lightly bowed. At her formal greeting, I couldn\u2019t help but return the same greeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both from the Resistance Army.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell done, Ellos. You managed to snatch up a beauty like her\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At my words, Ellos made a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk. You have the undivided attention of the crown princess, who\u2019s famous even throughout the First Dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about Palludia, I can only be disappointed in your eye for people\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, an area became warped and four dungeon explorers appeared. Ah, two of them were faces I\u2019d seen before. One was the long-eared woman, who I now knew to be an elf, carrying a bow and quiver like Baruela, and the other was the rapier warrior woman who said I had a cute face. Even after all these years, the two of them had the same faces. I knew elves lived for a long time and aged late, but I was shocked the rapier warrior didn\u2019t change at all.</p><br/><p>However, I had never seen the other two before. They were both extremely beautiful. One of them had a shield long enough to cover her body entirely, and was about 175 cm.</p><br/><p>She had pink hair that curled down her shoulders, and had moist, pink eyes that were strangely charming. However, the way she held her shield or the way she trembled like a baby deer unlike how mature she looked, both looked somewhat familiar.</p><br/><p>Where did I see her before\u2026? Ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, it\u2019s Miss Shuna! You became so pretty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cH-Hello, Crown Prince-nim! I-It\u2019s an honor. Crown Prince-nim is really handsome too. \u2026 Uuu, what do I do, I talked to him. Ludia, I talked to Crown Prince-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you only recognize Shuna!? I\u2019m the one you have friended!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I was exchanging greetings with Shuna, Palludia, who was standing next to her, hit me. Because it was within my expectations, I blocked her with my arm. Seeing Palludia rolling on the ground in pain, I felt very satisfied.</p><br/><p>Although I didn\u2019t recognize them, I realized who they were when I saw the other two. If four people from Luka continent were here, Palludia and Shuna would naturally be among them. I was simply embarrassed to face her. That\u2019s why I acted that way.</p><br/><p>Palludia got up, holding back her teary eyes. She was vastly different than before. 4 years ago, she was a little kid who had not even been 140 cm, but she had now become a fairly tall, 170 cm lady.</p><br/><p>Her once child-like, twintailed blonde hair was now flowing down to her waistline, glistening a lustrous gold. Her sapphire eyes were deep, like they contained countless years. Furthermore, her white skin looked smooth enough that water droplets could flow down seamlessly. She had a not too large and not too small nose, which a sculptor seemed to have devoted his heart and soul to creating. Finally, her moist lips glowed with a peach-like light pink.</p><br/><p>Her appearance was terrifyingly beautiful, to the point that it seemed to suck in anyone that laid their eyes on her. It was the type of peerless beauty that I never would have imagined myself seeing. If anyone with a weak heart was watching, his heart would undoubtedly stop at this breathtaking beauty. Just what did she eat for 4 years to grow so much? I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes.</p><br/><p>Wait, no. I remembered Shina saying that people from Luka continent had a sudden growth spurt. Although I had not paid much attention to it before, Shuna and Palludia were both from the Luka continent. I couldn\u2019t believe my stupidity. So that\u2019s why Palludia was saying she wasn\u2019t a little kid.</p><br/><p>That said, it was slightly iffy to say she was fully grown. As her robe that stuck to her figure showed, her chest area was more or less the same. Had they not fully grown yet? Or was that how they were when they were fully grown? If I were to make a hasty judgement, she was like Yua!</p><br/><p>Of course, even without much of a chest, her slender arms and legs, and elegant curves made her figure extremely charming. However, I did not say any of this out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhahaha, you grew a lot. In height.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is that the first thing you say, you O\u2026 Or\u2026 Orc?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although her beauty made it hard for me to stare at her, I remembered the Palludia from 4 years ago and barely met her eyes. At the same time, Palludia, who was looking at me from head to toe, made a blank expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You, are you really Orc?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not Orc, but I am Kang Shin. You still say rude things so easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I-It really is you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Palludia was frozen in place like she was hit by an ice magic. For some reason, Shuna, who was standing next to her, kept covering her face with her shield. I turned to face the rapier warrior, and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid they eat something strange while growing up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhaha, Crown Prince-ssi is the bad one. I heard stories, but what happened to turn you into such a\u2026 Mm, how fine. My eyes weren\u2019t wrong. Wow, look at this toned chest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, can you not approach me? Also, please stop touching me like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I asked her as I slowly backed away, the elf archer pulled the rapier warrior by her ears and pulled her away. As I thought, all elves except Loretta knew manners!</p><br/><p>\u201cW-Wait. Don\u2019t you have anything else to say? To me!?\u201d</p><br/><p>After finally snapping out of her frozen state, Palludia asked me. It seemed she only grew up in appearance, as her way of talking had not changed in the slightest. If she didn\u2019t open her mouth, she really was like a princess from a fairy tale. How unfortunate.</p><br/><p>Looking at her, I tilted my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm\u2026 Like what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA-A lot! Like how much you wanted to see me, or how much prettier I became!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm? Well, I did wonder how you were doing occasionally, and I do think you became really pretty. But what about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Palludia became silent. Her face was bright red to the point I was afraid it would blow up. What should I do about this awkward atmosphere? Did I do something to irritate Palludia again?</p><br/><p>Then, I suddenly remembered. The Headband of Wisdom I got from the 19th floor\u2019s named lizardwoman! I had planned to give it to Palludia. Hoping it would ease her anger, I took out the Headband of Wisdom from my inventory. When she saw it, her eyes became wide as she asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn accessory. I happened to pick it up. I thought it\u2019d suit you well. It\u2019s a gift. You know, a reunion gift.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cG-Gift?\u201d</p><br/><p>Palludia\u2019s face became redder than the Headband of Wisdom. Did I do something wrong again!? Did she hate headbands? I thought it was perfect for her class, since it raised magic and intelligence. I didn\u2019t understand where I went wrong.</p><br/><p>Even so, when I put the headband in her hand, she calmly took it and slowly put it in her hair. Mm, it seemed she didn\u2019t hate it that much. When I smiled with satisfaction, Palludia covered her face with her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cUuu, y-you\u2019re just, Orc\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEllos, he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it, Paul. Don\u2019t say it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh\u2026? This was different from the reunion I imagined\u2026 Looking at Ellos and Paul shaking their heads as they looked at me and silent Palludia, who was still looking down while covering up her bright red face, my mind fell into chaos. This, did I need to use Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry? Seeing that Baruela-ssi seemed fine, I went and talked to her. She simply covered her mouth with her hand as she snickered. After hearing what I said, the other party members looked at me with cold eyes and each said a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cFool.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince-nim is stupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuu\u2026 you stupid Orc.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey, I\u2019m not stupid anymore! My intelligence is above 20 now! I\u2019m not an orc either!\u2019 Unable to figure out just what I did wrong, my mind fell into chaos yet again.</p><br/><p>Edias continent, Luka continent, and two more from Pilos continent. A total of 10 people including myself stood in front of the 25th floor\u2019s door. Other than Baruela, who replaced Celtine, all 9 members were the same as 4 years ago. It didn\u2019t feel different in particular. Ellos seemed to have thought the same thing, as he only made a short speech as the party leader.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think it will be as easy as it was 4 years ago. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all had your fair share of experiences as you climbed to the 25th floor, but Floor Master battles only get harder. This was especially true for the 20th Floor Master, Lizard Knight. However, I believe that with the members present, it is fully possible to defeat the Floor Master within 5 tries.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was blabbering some weird things.</p><br/><p>\u201cFive tries? Wouldn\u2019t it be hard to succeed in five tries even if we know the strategy beforehand?\u201d</p><br/><p>An axe carrying warrior from Pilos continent said with a bitter smile. Although he wasn\u2019t that close to me, it seemed the two people from Pilos continent kept in touch with Ellos. It was why they could meet us here today. However, he was blabbering even weirder things.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, but this time, we have Crown Prince!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, right, Crown Prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we clear it within five tries, we can really jump ahead of others.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, we are so bad ourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other party members began blabbering. Everyone was only saying things with an overwhelming sense of defeat. I thought this was a dream team of sorts, but what was this feeling of helplessness!?</p><br/><p>\u201cEllos, is the 25th Floor Master hard?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hear it\u2019s a Giant Ghoul.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this is where he appears!\u201d</p><br/><p>Was he trying to vent his anger for being unable to appear in the Event Dungeon? At my shout, the other party members tilted their heads. I figured I would only receive looks of envy if I told them about the Event Dungeon, so I didn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you can expect from what you\u2019ve been experiencing since the 21st floor, tons of zombies are said to appear. Since Miss Palludia, Mitarus\u2019 priestess, is here, we won\u2019t have to worry about being infected, but be sure to have Holy Waters handy in case something goes wrong. Also, the zombies are known to act without set patterns so always stay on your guard and help each other out. Paul, Miss Shuna, can I trust you two to tank the Giant Ghoul?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, blocking is one thing I\u2019m confident in!\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know about Paul, but seeing Shuna, who was an untrustworthy little girl just 4 years ago, now nodding her head confidently with her slender figure and curly pink hair, I did feel rather touched. However, her eyes still had a hint of uncertainty... Ah. When she met my eyes, her face became red, and she dropped her head. It was rather hurtful.</p><br/><p>I thought I wasn\u2019t ugly enough to hurt anyone watching anymore\u2026 What was it? My face? But mother said my face took after hers and was very handsome\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of the minions. I don\u2019t need support so you guys can focus on the Giant Ghoul.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cH-How reassuring.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos seemed a bit taken back by my confident speech. Everyone else showed signs of anxiety, but Palludia was silent unlike herself 4 years ago. Rather than having no complaints, it seemed she respected the name I had built up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere must be a reason you\u2019re called Crown Prince. You better do your job properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou better heal people properly too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! I\u2019ll be focusing on the tanks, so don\u2019t you get hurt while you\u2019re distracted!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Palludia, how cute. Huhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree. How cute. Kuku.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What! Why is everyone snickering!? Look away!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just what was cute about Palludia there? I could only see her acting grumpy\u2026 These guys, as I thought, they\u2019re all weird!</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, we\u2019ll focus on getting used to the Giant Ghoul\u2019s habits and skills. We want to avoid dying without any gains. Let\u2019s do our best. I believe in everyone\u2019s ability that helped us climb to the 25th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Ellos looked at me. In response, I confidently nodded my head. I mean, I could kill it alone, so why wouldn\u2019t I be able to kill it with 9 other people?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, let\u2019s go in!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos opened the door to the Floor Master. What greeted us was a large graveyard.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

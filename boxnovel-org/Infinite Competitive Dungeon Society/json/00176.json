What Is Not Allowed for Her (7)</p><br/><p>Hwaya stood on Ludia\u2019s side for once and glared at Loretta. It was because Loretta was standing right next to me. Ye-Eun was still in a panic, while Daisy was busy with moving the corpses and didn\u2019t care about what was happening here.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, who\u2019s that woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Loretta, the Floor Shop shopkeeper and a guild master of one of First Dungeon\u2019s administrative guilds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, my name is Loretta. You\u2019re members of Shin-nim\u2019s guild, right? It\u2019s nice to meet you all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAdministrative guild master\u2026? She\u2019s not an explorer?\u201d</p><br/><p>The girls looked flustered. Hwaya then said with a more relaxed voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI misunderstood. It looks like my intuition\u2019s not working well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m also Shin-nim\u2019s future wife!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn enemy\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>At Loretta\u2019s bold statement, Hwaya and Ludia immediately entered battle mode! Loretta most likely said that to keep them in check, but it seemed Hwaya and Ludia took it as a provocation. Balls of flame appeared in mid-air and the garden\u2019s ground began to crack. I was afraid they would really turn this mansion into a battlefield if left alone, so I stopped them with a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, don\u2019t spread lies. You guys too, stop using your power for useless things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLies? Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not useless. It\u2019s justice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD-Don\u2019t be angry, Shin-nim. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta was eventually going to meet the others, and I knew Hwaya and Ludia would react this way. But if they really fought, it would only end with Hwaya and Ludia getting punished by the administrative guilds. Regardless, since Loretta was the one who provoked them, I warned her.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, I\u2019m sure you were kidding, but don\u2019t cause trouble. Got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cB-But I wasn\u2019t kidding\u2026 I was being honest\u2026 Shin-nim got mad at me. Shin-nim\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta drooped her ears and sulked. It seemed she was shocked quite a bit as her eyes were slightly teary. I wanted to hug her, but I wasn\u2019t done talking. I turned to face Hwaya and Ludia.</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya, Ludia, Loretta isn\u2019t an enemy. She\u2019s a benefactor who helped me for a long time. You guys are being rude to her. She didn\u2019t do anything wrong, she was just kidding. Plus, I should be the one angry at her joke, not you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, I told you how I felt about you. It\u2019s normal for me to get angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cM-Me too! I\u2019ll be troubled if you go to someone else!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me say this clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>I breathed in and breathed out. Then, I continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cUntil I solve the danger Earth is facing, I won\u2019t date anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>The atmosphere chilled, but I didn\u2019t stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I said before too, but I don\u2019t have the time for it. I\u2019m already busy breaking through the dungeon and fighting Earth\u2019s monsters, so how am I going to find the time to have a relationship? Even if I had the time, I wouldn\u2019t have the peace of mind to do so. Even now, I\u2019m confused because of all of you. You\u2019re all charming and out of my league, but you all said you like me! I can\u2019t just choose one of you like choosing a college course! I have to think about it over and over again, but I don\u2019t have the time for that right now! Even if I have to miss this golden chance that might never come again in my lifetime and have you all come to not like me. Even if I have to remain single for the rest of my life! I still can't make a decision! Romantic relationships aren\u2019t allowed for me right now! Understood?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPuhahahaha! So my son can say that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cG-Gol, Golden chance, kukukuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Un.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father and Walker burst into laughter, while Hwaya nodded and the others drooped their heads. Hwaya\u2019s cheeks were flushed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was a pretty good effort. I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m happy that you can\u2019t decide on me, but I\u2019ll let it slide.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sure are confident.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019m the best woman in the world. But, since she isn\u2019t from our world, I\u2019ll still leave some space for deliberation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like Shin too\u2026 I was the first to confess too\u2026 I hate unni.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut remember, I won\u2019t let you go until you fall for me. I told you last time, right? What\u2019s important is that I like you, so be prepared. Ina, let\u2019s go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, Mommy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, unni, me too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya took her flame back. Then, with a slightly uneasy expression, she took Ina from me and went into the mansion. Sumire looked at me for a moment, then ran after Hwaya.</p><br/><p>While Hwaya\u2019s words were weighing down my head, Loretta flapped her ears and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2019m used to waiting too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou say that, but you take out your axe whenever I talk about other women.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-That\u2019s\u2026 Sorry. I know I shouldn\u2019t, but I get worried about thieving cats\u2026 I apologize for today. I\u2019ll go back and reflect on it, so come console me kindly later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think if you can say you\u2019re reflecting when you\u2019re asking me to come console you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later then, Father.\u201d</p><br/><p>After politely saying goodbye to Father, Loretta disappeared from Marianne\u2019s Garden. Hwaya and Loretta. The two storms had passed by safely, and I couldn\u2019t help but sigh in relief.</p><br/><p>Daisy then approached me. She seemed unfazed by everything that just happened. She simply had a jubilant expression that showed just how elated she was about getting new corpses.</p><br/><p>\u201cI used my skills. First time in a long time. I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaisy, why are you asking me tha\u2026 Eh? What happened to all the corpses?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInventory. Do you want payment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLater. For now, let\u2019s go in the mansion. I have to properly introduce you to everyone. After that\u2026 I\u2019ll let you eat an amazing tuna sashimi.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing the phrase \u2018tuna sashimi,\u2019 Father and Walker slowly got up and walked into the mansion. When I was about to invite the others in, I noticed that Ludia was nowhere to be seen.</p><br/><p>\u201cYe-Eun, where\u2019s Ludia?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe took Shuna and went to the dungeon. She looked like she was extremely troubled. I\u2019m worried\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll message her later. Let\u2019s go in for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>What I said might have shocked Ludia. She was relying on me, but what I said today was no different than saying that the status quo would change. Perhaps, she might have imagined a future without me.</p><br/><p>Huu\u2026 It really was complicated.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before I noticed, Ye-Eun had approached me. Her eyes trembled apprehensively.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan it not be\u2026 me? Am I not charming at all to Shin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not. Don\u2019t be absurd.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, I\u2019m just a normal girl\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat normal? You\u2019re extremely charming and unique. You don\u2019t lose to anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Especially when you\u2019re fighting monsters. Because I didn\u2019t add the last part, Ye-Eun seemed to be feeling much better.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, thanks. I really like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I like you too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen is today our day 1!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy answer is the same as last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go in. I\u2019m sure everyone\u2019s waiting. I don\u2019t want to see Father\u2019s personality when he\u2019s hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlood sugar\u2026 low. Can\u2019t, move.\u201d</p><br/><p>While joking with Ye-Eun, I dragged Daisy, who had gotten extremely sluggish after playing with the corpses, inside the mansion. This time, we managed to finish a fourth of the melting tuna that I had left.</p><br/><p>Around dinner time, I left the guild house. Although it was good to spend time with my guildmates, it was more important to quickly finish grinding the Twin-headed Ogre. If I dawdled too long and a day passed by, I would have wasted a day. I reluctantly refused father who asked if I wanted another drink and headed to the dungeon.</p><br/><p>Since Walker was there, I figured he wouldn\u2019t be lonely. Though they weren't that close, in the beginning, they had gotten much closer after drinking together. I wanted Walker to participate in the guild\u2019s activities out of his own volition, not because of the contract. In order to do so, it was best that he got closer to the guild members.</p><br/><p>Walker wasn\u2019t a saint, but he wasn\u2019t evil either. He was over thirty, but talking to him, I realized just how caged he had lived his whole life. More specifically, he was very biased toward one side of things. His thoughts were dark, sometimes overly down-to-earth, and sometimes cold-hearted. Since he must have had to deal with Brightman\u2019s shady actions, it was understandable.</p><br/><p>However, that didn\u2019t mean he had to continue that way forever. That wasn\u2019t the proper and normal way of living. Though, I couldn\u2019t say that our current lives were normal either.</p><br/><p>Being bound to us through the contract and having to work with us, it seemed he was changing one step at a time. I could tell that he was opening up to the people in the guild. He was even joking with me when I had severely beaten him up and forced him to sign a contract.</p><br/><p>I was certain that a day would come where the contract would become unnecessary. I wanted that day to come.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>I had an idea of what kind of elixir the Twin-headed Ogre would drop. When I ground the Giant Wolf on the 45th floor, it dropped tattoo invigoration elixirs. When I was talking with Ren, he casually remarked that he was grinding invigoration elixirs on the 55</p><br/><p>floor. As such, I was more or less certain.</p><br/><p>[Choose your reward.]</p><br/><p>[1. Ogre\u2019s Tattoo Invigoration Elixir</p><br/><p>2. Twin-headed Ogre\u2019s Leather Belt]</p><br/><p>To my eyes, the words \u2018Ogre\u2019s Tattoo Invigoration Elixir\u2019 looked like the words of God. Without hesitating, I chose the tattoo invigoration elixir and threw it in my mouth. Instantly, the tattoo on my arms glowed. If this elixir had the same function as the one for the wolf tattoo\u2026</p><br/><p>[Your Twin-headed Ogre\u2019s Tattoo becomes more invigorated. Your strength increases by 0.5% and constitution increases by 1. As you have the Twin-headed Ogre\u2019s Tattoo, your strength increases by an additional 0.5% and your constitution by an additional 1.]</p><br/><p>As I thought, there was an additional bonus! I flexed my arms contently and thrust my spear into the air a couple times. No other explorer had the Twin-headed Ogre\u2019s Tattoo. I was the only one who had it.</p><br/><p>When the normal Ogre\u2019s Tattoo was invigorated to its limit, it would raise its possessor's strength by 15%. However, that would only be half of the strength increase I would enjoy.</p><br/><p>\u2018First\u2019! It was truly a sweet word! The 55th floor was the best!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then let\u2019s continue this momentum and go again!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes, Master! If it\u2019s only this, I can go 100 times without feeling tired!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish I could\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The dungeon\u2019s mana, the effect of other explorers, and whatnot, it seemed the dungeon\u2019s system wasn\u2019t so simple. Although this ten-time battle ticket looked like a simple piece of paper, it contained an extremely complicated arrangement of vast mana that I could not even begin to fathom. Plus, it was undoubtedly made of special material as well. I was certain that the price I bought them from was a bargain.</p><br/><p>With such a thought, I left the Floor Master room. When Loretta saw me from the Floor Shop, she flapped her ears with a blooming smile. Then, her ears drooped. It seemed she remembered me scolding her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou came, Shin-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to go back for another round though.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I didn\u2019t mean to answer curtly, Loretta shrunk back slightly and asked carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you\u2026 still mad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t mad, to begin with. It was just that I didn\u2019t like how you lied to provoke the others.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Loretta would probably not joke like that again. When I glanced at Loretta with that thought, Loretta was tearing up. No, she was crying!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hic, hic, I\u2019m sowwy. Hic. I didn\u2019t you\u2019d hate it so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I won\u2019t do it again, I won\u2019t joke again, so don\u2019t hate me, hic. I\u2019m sowwy, I\u2019m sowwy\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, I don\u2019t hate you at all. I don\u2019t hate you, so crying!\u201d</p><br/><p>I had to stay for 30 minutes to console Loretta who started crying. How can a woman who's lived over 2000 years cry like a teenage girl!? It\u2019s too cute!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Lilith (7)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>\u201cPeika, what does this look like?\u201d</p><br/><p>[A horn?]</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked Peika just in case I was mistaken, but Peika\u2019s answer didn\u2019t change. Dortu then sensibly created a metallic mirror. I saw my reflection in the silver mirror, and I could clearly see a dark-red horn protruding out. Not only that, but my skin had also turned snow-white, while a part of my hair had turned red. It was as though I had taken Lilith\u2019s characteristics.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear God\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I realized that the portion of her power I couldn\u2019t completely accept had fused with my mana to form this horn. Should I cut it off? I couldn\u2019t help but consider the possibility, but I immediately decided against it. I knew that once I could accept all of Lilith\u2019s power, the horn would disappear naturally.</p><br/><p>In other words, just because I absorbed Lilith\u2019s Horn, it didn\u2019t mean I could fully use her power. Of course, I checked my stats and saw that my charm stat had shot up by almost 300 points, but it wasn\u2019t to the point of being able to charm inanimate objects.</p><br/><p>If I process the remaining power in the horn, would I be able to do it? I wasn\u2019t sure. But with my charm increased, several of my other skills had also become stronger.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Evil Eyes were affected by charm as were skills like Provoke and Overwhelm. If the difference between me and opponent was big, I could now kill him with my presence alone. I wouldn\u2019t have even imagined such a thing had I not obtained Lilith\u2019s Horn.</p><br/><p>\u201cLilith\u2019s power can\u2019t become my primary ability, so I\u2019ll have to be content with this. If I get greedy for more, I\u2019ll only end up doing myself a disfavor.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Master\u2019s charm is already amazing!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so too.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied to Peika with a bitter smile. 300 points. Although I didn\u2019t want to admit it, my charm had long since surpassed the realm of a human. Considering one of my skills doubled the effect of charm against those of the opposite sex, I might even be able to use Lilith\u2019s Temptation on Lilith herself. Of course, since Lilith was dead, this could only stay a theory.</p><br/><p>I looked in the mirror once again and realized that I was still naked. I thought about putting my armor back on, but thinking that I wouldn\u2019t need to fight in the dungeon for the rest of the day, I just put on light clothes. Wraith Queen Set or Vampire Lord Set was the best for such occasions.</p><br/><p>In truth, Incubus King\u2019s Set was cooler than either of these, but it was just too flamboyant for any sane person to wear. On the other hand, Wraith Queen Set and Vampire Lord Set were comparable to luxury brand designer clothes. Not only did they look the part, but they also had decent functionalities. Since Wraith Queen Set was older and came from a lower-level Floor Master, I mostly used Vampire Lord Set.</p><br/><p>But when I changed into the Vampire Lord Set and looked at the mirror, someone resembling a dungeon Floor Master was there.</p><br/><p>\u201cI only got a horn and had my skin color changed, but this\u2026 No, that\u2019s a pretty big change.\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn! If only I could get rid of this horn!</p><br/><p>It was yet another reason to focus more on training.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out for now. Good job, everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You did well too, Master!]</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s an honor to be of help, Master.]</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. Dortu can now make orichalcos.]</p><br/><p>I left Beyond along with my three elementals. I made sure to check for any leftover orichalcos, but it seemed they disappeared along with Lilith\u2019s death. Since Dortu said he could make them, I planned to make some when I had mana to spare.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, welcome back\u2026 Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt bad about leaving Loretta behind and jumping straight into Beyond, so I planned to stay with her for a little bit. But Loretta\u2019s expression seemed a bit strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019d like to ask. Shin-nim, do you know what state you\u2019re in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cState? \u2026 Ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shoot, because I was fighting Lilith, I had my charm raised to its limit! Not to mention, after I obtained Lilith\u2019s power, I left without properly restraining my charm..!</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t even have time to reply. Loretta\u2019s approached me stealthily and grabbed my hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, I think I know who you fought in Beyond\u2019s 35th floor. Shin-nim\u2019s appearance changed a lot and it\u2019s so obvious too. Huhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta\u2019s smart as expected. So in that sense, I have something to ask you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta smiled like there was nothing more to be said. She stuck her body onto mine and whispered in my ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, if it\u2019s only for a little while, I can isolate us from Lord\u2019s view.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about Sherafina\u2019s voyeurism fetish!\u201d</p><br/><p>I yelled, but Loretta suddenly tightly squeezed my hands. Her eyes were shining fiercely. She pulled on my arms as if to say she\u2019d never let go.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go to my cabin. Quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, let\u2019s just talk this out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, I like talking with my body more. We can talk with our mouths later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>I screamed and twisted my body. But because I wasn\u2019t wearing my armor, I couldn\u2019t use my full power! Loretta opened the gate to Fairy Garden and murmured in a happy voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhuhu, what should we name our thirteenth daughter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how far we\u2019ve gone in your head!? Isn\u2019t that too many!?\u201d</p><br/><p>From then, it took some time for Loretta to let me go. I felt like I had to use more energy than the energy I spent fighting Lilith before I could finally escape. I\u2019ll just say that it almost made me cry.</p><br/><p>With Mother entering the dungeon, there were some days when dinner wasn\u2019t prepared, and today was one of those days. I considered going to Marianne\u2019s Garden, but scared that Loretta might be waiting for me, I decided to just eat instant ramen. When I was boiling water in the kitchen, someone sauntered in.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, fulfilling your promise?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you in my house!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy sat down casually wearing a dress shirt and loose shorts. She acted like an old man tired of the harshness of the real world. Plus, her clothes were too defenseless.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you wear something proper? Otherwise, button up your shirt more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cComfy clothes, good clothes. When you\u2019re not fighting, it\u2019s good to let loose.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo why are you in my house?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cComfy house, good house. When you\u2019re not fighting, it\u2019s good to let loose.\u201d</p><br/><p>So my house was comfy. It was my fault for letting her in here so easily. Complaining internally, I took out another bag of ramen from the cupboard. Daisy then casually added.</p><br/><p>\u201cI eat two.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was somewhat expecting it. Even though we used mana to fight, we both had superhuman muscles. As such, we had to eat at least twice as much as normal people. Since boiling three or four ramen was more or less the same, I took out another bag without hesitation.</p><br/><p>When I was pouring more water into the pot, Daisy suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, you got a horn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yeah, I defeated someone called Lilith and this is what happened. It might look weird now, but it\u2019ll disappear when I can fully control it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHorn, okay. Horn is a symbol of the powerful. If weak demons have horns, strong demons will break them. Dragons, they have the most beautiful horns. Elves who like strong people, also like horns.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I learned that today too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You mated with the Elf Queen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>I turned around and shouted back. Daisy then narrowed her eyes and glared at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cElf Queen, perfect woman. Not mating with her, is it because you like me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be serious. I don\u2019t plan on troubling other women. I can\u2019t do much about the ones I said I\u2019d accept, but I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You don\u2019t want to pursue, your feelings for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour unfound confidence surprises me every time! I meant to say, I don\u2019t plan on liking you romantically!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though I said that Daisy looked at me with pitiful, all-understanding eyes. Feeling like there was nothing I could say that would convince her, I gave up and went back to quietly boiling water.</p><br/><p>When I stopped talking, Daisy nodded with a satisfied face, then began swinging her feet as she hummed melodies I didn\u2019t know. Now she was like a cheery elementary school kid.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Daisy widened her eyes like she realized something important.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this\u2026 a newlywed atmosphere?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a lame newlywed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo money to eat proper food has to make do with ramen. House is small but full of love.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch poor people won\u2019t each eat two bags of ramen. This house isn\u2019t small and there\u2019s no love between us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, water\u2019s boiling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>I quit picking on her words and started opening the ramen bags. Out of nowhere, Daisy softly spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, thank you very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI should be the one thanking you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt times like this, you should pretend to have not heard anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to whisper to yourself, you should just say it in your head.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I retorted with a snicker, Daisy snorted. Seeing a smile on her face, I couldn\u2019t help but think about how much everything changed. Knowing that I had affected her, I felt somewhat proud.</p><br/><p>At that moment, an archangel I wasn\u2019t expecting to see peeked her head into the kitchen.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, if it isn\u2019t too late, can I eat ramen too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s not late. Wait just a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyak, Oppa, there\u2019s a horn on your head! And\u2026 You look more bewitching.\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t call a man bewitching, Yua.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much, so don\u2019t worry about it. This horn is like a G**dam builder part!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay! If that\u2019s what Oppa says, hehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yua was wearing light clothes as though she just got out of a shower after being in the dungeon. In her arms was a small dragon fuming a fiery yawn. It was the baby dragon born from Lava King\u2019s egg.</p><br/><p>Since I didn\u2019t add ramen into the water, I could still add more water to the pot. With this, I had to wait for more until the water boiled.</p><br/><p>Seeing Yua slump down next to her, Daisy tilted her head, then exclaimed in her delusional realization.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister-in-law, disrupting newlywed couple\u2026 Annoyed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaisy-ssi, can you say that a little louder?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSister-in-law, disrupting newlywed couple\u2026 Annoyed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Yua couldn\u2019t do anything about Daisy\u2019s my-pace attitude. Daisy had a talent for making her jokes not sound like jokes. Seeing Yua become flustered by her words, Daisy smiled bashfully and hit the chair next to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t starve you. Sister-in-law should eat ramen with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me sister-in-law, Daisy-ssi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Yungoong said, I can call you that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for letting me know, Daisy-ssi.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed Father would have to avoid Yua for a while. I mean, just what was this old man telling everyone! Is he trying to make a soccer team with daughters-in-law rather than grandkids!?</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, when\u2019s ramen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait 5 minutes. Sorry for making you wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have more people, it\u2019s okay. I can wait. Grey Elves are very easygoing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre they?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. They\u2019re easygoing and relaxed about everything. So although everyone is very talented, we don\u2019t get many outstanding warriors. Because we\u2019re easygoing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m hearing this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, when they need to, they get serious. Still, they\u2019re very patient. That\u2019s quicker in the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>The topic went from ramen to a rather interesting subject. I threw five portions of ramen into the boiling water and thought back to when I first met Daisy. Daisy lying down on her bed really seemed to resemble her description of Grey Elves. Just when I was thinking that Daisy added a final comment.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Grey Elves\u2019 courtships are easygoing. Love and relationship are also easygoing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaisy-ssi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Yua called her name, Daisy feigned ignorance and bit down on her chopsticks. I couldn\u2019t help but laugh seeing her child-like manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, if you want to whisper to yourself, you should say it in your head.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, at times like this, you should pretend to have not heard anything. But since you already heard it, it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy spoke with a wink.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven after we defeat the Demon Lord, Kang Shin should make me ramen forever. Kang Shin and I can both spend time leisurely. I\u2019m sure it will be fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>The ramen we had that night was extremely delicious. Unfortunately, Yua\u2019s angry kitten-like stare continued to scratch me.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

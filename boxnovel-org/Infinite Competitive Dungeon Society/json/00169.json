Double Crisis (5)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Chapter 169. Double Crisis (5)</p><br/><p>[You became level 56. You obtained 5 bonus stats.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained the qualification to challenge Beyond\u2019s 5th floor.]</p><br/><p>[Amazing! You are the first in First Dungeon\u2019s history to succeed in soloing the Twin-headed Ogre on the first try! The dungeon will remember you as a Great Explorer. You obtained 2 skill point as a reward. Remaining skill points: 20]</p><br/><p>[You obtained the title, \u2018Twin-headed Ogre Master.\u2019 All stats increase by 2. This effect will apply even if the title is not equipped.]</p><br/><p>[You defeated the Twin-headed Ogre alone. You obtained the special reward, \u2018Twin-headed Ogre\u2019s Leather Pants.\u2019]</p><br/><p>[You obtained 350,000 gold.]</p><br/><p>[You received the only reward left hidden by the First Explorer. Congratulations! Your luck stat increases by 1.]</p><br/><p>[Secret. Twin-headed Ogre\u2019s Tattoo]</p><br/><p>I was ecstatic that no one had gotten the first achievement for the 55th floor. Not to mention, the reward was a tattoo! I happily chose the reward. Immediately, my arms began to heat up. The Giant Wolf\u2019s Tattoo was engraved on my legs, but it seemed the Twin-headed Ogre\u2019s Tattoo was for my arms. I took off my armor and checked the tattoo. Streaks of red lines were being drawn on my arms.</p><br/><p>[You obtained the Twin-headed Ogre\u2019s Tattoo. Your strength increases by 15%, and once per day, you can add 50% damage to a close-ranged skill.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 full of power!\u201d</p><br/><p>I tried to look cool and made a pose showing off my muscles. Feeling the strength surging through my body, I nodded in satisfaction. Then, I put my armor back on. What reward did Ren get? Since he didn\u2019t get the first reward, could it be a single-headed ogre tattoo?</p><br/><p>In any case, I had no longer had any business in the boss room. Peika, who had dematerialized and returned to her small dragon form, coiled around my arm, as I walked out of the room. When Loretta saw me from the Floor Shop, she flapped her ears and welcomed me. Though I\u2019d seen it many times by now, the ways her ears flapped were always amusing. I thought, \u2018I\u2019m curious about elves\u2019 muscle structure! Could it be that Elf Queen\u2019s had different muscle structure?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were really quick. The Twin-headed Ogre shouldn\u2019t have been an easy enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCompared to the Orc Lords, he wasn\u2019t anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta smiled wryly, then seemed to remember something as she said, \u201cShin-nim. Now that I think about it, I forgot to ask you. I\u2019m sorry to make Shin-nim even busier, but I think Shin-nim would like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need the lecture.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. So, if you could fight Floor Masters more than three times per day, would you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded my head vigorously and pushed my face toward hers. Then, feeling embarrassed, I pulled back, but Loretta looked completely unaffected as she took something out of her pocket. It was a stack of glowing golden paper!</p><br/><p>\u201cFighting a Floor Master three times every day, but never get tired! The Floor Shop has specially prepared an item just for you! Ten times! Ten times per day! This entrance ticket for high-ranking explorers is incomparable to the average entrance ticket. It is called, \u2018Ten Times a Day, You Monster\u2026!\u2019 Now, each ticket is only 100,000 gold! Don\u2019t miss this chance!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy it, so change the name immediately! Change it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Make it a simple combination of adjective and noun! Who\u2019s the one that named it! Bring that person to me now!</p><br/><p>The entrance ticket\u2019s name was quite disturbing, but since it was exactly what I needed, I bought it anyway. Using all the money I had, I bought 400 tickets. Since I got 350,000 gold per raid, each of them would be a 250,000 net gold profit.</p><br/><p>If I used all this money on Earth instead of the dungeon, the market would undoubtedly crash. It still felt unrealistic that the gold from the dungeon could be exchanged for Earth\u2019s currency.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really bought it. I knew my eyes weren\u2019t wrong! So many \u2018Ten Times a Day, You Monster\u2026!\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChange the name!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it? Eleine said it was her best work\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let me go beat her up now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Eleine should be hard for Shin-nim right now, so wait until Shin-nim\u2019s level 90! No, since Shin-nim is in Beyond, level 80 might be enough!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for the advice, Loretta\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That Eleine woman looked frail. To think she would be that strong\u2026 Since Loretta chased her away with a single wave of her hand, just how strong was Loretta? As if to stop my train of thought, Loretta stared at my face fixedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you be okay? Fighting the Floor Master ten times a day isn\u2019t something to scoff at. I shouldn\u2019t say this as the seller, but you\u2019ll become exhausted\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe more time I save on the First Dungeon, the more time I can invest into Beyond. So, of course, I should do it. Isn\u2019t that why you brought them to me, Loretta?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026 but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta\u2019s ears drooped slightly. I smiled and patted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks anyway. You can\u2019t sell this to just anyone, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2019m the one who asked Shin-nim to do such a difficult task, so it\u2019s only right that I support Shin-nim to the best of my ability\u2026 Hehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I\u2019m off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Are you leaving? W-Where? Aren\u2019t you fighting the Floor Master again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No, there\u2019s someone I need to meet\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 A girl?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta\u2019s soft and flowery eyes quickly turned into the sharp cold eyes of a solitary assassin. It was seriously scary.</p><br/><p>\u201cS-She\u2019s technically a girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Meeting a girl instead of fighting Floor Masters. I\u2019m quite curious as to who it could be, huhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, can you put the battle axe back in the Floor Shop and calm down? She\u2019s only nine years old.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c9!? N-No, I\u2019m almost 300 times\u2026 K-Kuhum!\u201d</p><br/><p>I erased what I just heard from my head and chanted the sentence, \u2018Loretta\u2019s 17 years old,\u2019 when Loretta asked with teary eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes Shin-nim like younger girls? That\u2019s cheap. I can\u2019t do anything about that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m like a father to her. It\u2019s not what Loretta\u2019s thinking about, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Father?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta made a radiant smile and took out two giant battle axes from the back of the Floor Shop. Carrying a weapon on each hand! This woman, she\u2019s serious!</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, to deliver another hook punch right after the first. Shin-nim is really amazing. Now, if you obediently tell me who the mother is, you\u2019ll only see a single person\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019re going to kill her, right!? You\u2019re killing that person, right!?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, I didn\u2019t say Hwaya\u2019s name. I knew Loretta wouldn\u2019t really hurt her, but I was worried that Hwaya would be in trouble when she crossed over to the First Dungeon and met Loretta. Although I wanted to trust Loretta, she was clearly not thinking straight with those two axes of hers. I dodged her charging toward me and hurriedly escaped to Marianne\u2019s Garden.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, ina.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I had already told Hwaya and Ina that I would be back soon, the moment I arrived, I was greeted by Ina\u2019s headbutt. She smiled happily and rubbed her face on my cheek. For the record, Ina could use her mana to move extremely quickly. Though, she couldn\u2019t teleport like when she was in Ice Castle. She was similar to Hwaya in many ways.</p><br/><p>No matter how outstanding her ability was, if she continued moving like that and hunting monsters, she would run out of mana. Fortunately, HP and MP were completely restored when a floor was cleared. As such, Ina was already on the 22nd floor on just her second day. We may have created an unbelievable monster.</p><br/><p>I originally planned to come as soon as I finished Beyond\u2019s 4th floor, but I ended up taking three more hours because I didn\u2019t want to waste Talaria. I made a wry smile at the slight sense of guilt, as I patted Ina\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you so fast, Shin? Didn\u2019t you say it could take over a week?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya appeared behind Ina and asked. Since she was still wearing her battle dress, it seemed she had just come back from the dungeon.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s\u2026 a reason that I have to hurry a bit more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA reason to hurry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 This is a good chance. I\u2019ll tell you first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe others might not be ready for it. I feel like you won\u2019t be shaken that much even if I told you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya puffed out her chest, apparently happy with what I said. She really was weak to compliments.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can tell me anything! I\u2019ll hear you out, huhuhu!\u201d</p><br/><p>I patted Ina a few times since she was asking for my attention. Then, I messaged Hwaya.</p><br/><p>[The enemies we faced in the last Event Dungeon was from the Luka continent\u2019s Demon Army. Ludia told me about it, and I looked more into it, so I\u2019m sure.]</p><br/><p>[Luka continent\u2026? Where Ludia used to live?]</p><br/><p>[Yeah.]</p><br/><p>[Eh\u2026 Doesn\u2019t that mean Ludia knows about this too?]</p><br/><p>Why was she sad about that? As Ina kept poking my face, I tickled her for revenge.</p><br/><p>\u201cKiki, I\u2019m ticklish.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ludia is from the Luka continent. It was thanks to her that I noticed it so quickly.]</p><br/><p>[Ne\u2026 Nevermind. Sorry, I know I\u2019ve been weird lately. It\u2019s unlike my usual calm and collected self. I have to fix it soon.]</p><br/><p>Strange. Did the Hwaya I know go through cattle mutilation? The Hwaya I knew was always short-tempered and straightforward\u2026 Of course, I didn\u2019t say it aloud as I worried that the \u2018cool and collected\u2019 Hwaya would burn in rage.</p><br/><p>[Hurry and get to the point.]</p><br/><p>[It seems our world is getting attacked by two forces right now.]</p><br/><p>[\u2026]</p><br/><p>[Because of that, we don\u2019t have much time. I was told that one of the forces would completely crossover in 2 years.]</p><br/><p>Hwaya became silent. I also didn\u2019t say anything else. Ina was the only one making a sound, as she kept playing adorably. Without her, the atmosphere would have been heavier. For someone with an ice ability, she sure knew how to warm someone\u2019s heart! Could my daughter be the world\u2019s greatest daughter!?</p><br/><p>Hwaya\u2019s silence soon ended. She sauntered up to me and pushed her face up against mine. I backed off a bit, flustered, and Hwaya frowned. I inadvertently froze. For someone with a fire ability, she sure knew how to freeze someone! Could she also be the world\u2019s greatest? I asked her slightly panicked.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Though she was frowning just a moment ago, she was now looking at me with concerned eyes. I shrugged in response.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s why I\u2019m diligently climbing the dungeon. I heard I could do something if I conquered the dungeon within two years. Even so, it should be hard with just my strength alone, so\u2014 whoah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya suddenly pulled me into her embrace. Flustered, I froze. Ina, who ended up being squeezed between Hwaya and me, laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What\u2019s wrong? I\u2019m not the only one in danger! The entire Earth is in jeopardy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut in the end, they\u2019re all aiming for you. You\u2019re their target, only because an unknown being gave you an unknown power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cB-But as you know, I\u2019m quite strong\u2026 C-Can you let me go? Sorry, but I have someone I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of my business.\u201d</p><br/><p>This woman just cut me off! Just when I took the courage to say it!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s important is that you look strained and that I want to embrace you. \u201c</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Really.\u201d</p><br/><p>I responded brusquely, but to be honest, I might have slightly fallen for her. No, I fell for her a lot. This woman\u2019s uselessly many charms really troubled me.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, you won\u2019t run away, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no doubt in her tone. It was as if she knew exactly how I would act. I couldn\u2019t help but break out into laughter. At the same time, she hugged me even tighter.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood\u2026 Remember, I\u2019ll always be by your side. I won\u2019t let you bear everything alone\u2026 If\u2026 If you die, I\u2019ll still be by your side. Do you understand what I mean\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would you\u2026 go so far?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you really don\u2019t know the answer to that question, I\u2019m going to burn you now\u2026 I\u2019m surprised too, but right now, I\u2019m the most serious I\u2019ve ever been in my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t refuse\u2026 right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>How pressuring.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know whether she was consoling me or threatening me. But, to be honest, the load weighing down deep inside my heart seemed to have become much lighter. I decided to thank her honestly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, I\u2019ll be relying on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m happy that you know my worth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy because Mommy and Daddy are happy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ina, who was still between us, shot her arms up in the air and shouted. We were taken aback by her sudden outburst, but soon, we met each other\u2019s eyes and laughed. Then\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI inadvertently ended up seeing a beautiful sight. I need popcorn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the popcorn, Walker. *nom nom*.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs\u2026 Is this the time to eat popcorn!? They\u2019re acting like a family! I won\u2019t allow this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO Earth\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>All of Revival\u2019s members were there. We fell into a panic.</p><br/><p>\u201cH-How!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI broke through the 60th floor and came to the guild house to rest when I saw you two filming a melodrama. I couldn\u2019t let the others miss this, so I called them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWalker, you\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I turned around to look at Hwaya, I caught her hiding her hand after giving Walker a thumbs up. I already saw you, Hwaya! When I was about to lecture them angrily\u2026</p><br/><p>[An Event Raid broke out in the First Dungeon!

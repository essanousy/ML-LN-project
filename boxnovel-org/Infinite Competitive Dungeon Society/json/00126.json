You in the World of Sunset (4)</p><br/><p>[You equipped the Wendigo Set. Your magic and dexterity increase by 25. When the Wendigo Set is equipped, you can use \u2018Ice Touch\u2019 once per day.]</p><br/><p>[With Ice Touch, you can gather extreme freezing energy on your hands. When you attack your enemies, it ignores the enemies\u2019 resistance and freezes them, but they can break out after 5 seconds depending on their resistance.]</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, I see.\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded my head imposingly as a response to message noona, then took off the fur coat as it was irritatingly hot. Then, as I stored Ice touch on the 10 o\u2019clock position, I pondered, \u2018How was I supposed to use this skill? \u2026 Wait.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I use Divine Speed and beat up the enemy for 3 seconds, then use Ice Touch before Divine Speed ends, I can beat up the enemy for 5 more seconds!\u201d</p><br/><p>Together, I would have 8 seconds to beat the enemy up freely! Plus, I didn\u2019t need to use this freezing energy in close-range only. There must be a way to use it somehow with Ruyue. After all, all Floor Masters\u2019 skills were useful.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright\u2026 It\u2019s time to contact her.\u201d</p><br/><p>I took out the letter I always carried with me. Ciara Kenex. I didn\u2019t know what she wanted from me, even after reading the letter thrice. It would be faster to ask her in person. After making my decision, I put it to action. Once I set my mind to do something, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate. That was my personal philosophy.</p><br/><p>The next day, I gathered my family, including Yua who still wouldn\u2019t talk to me, and told them I had to go to America. Yua\u2019s expression was quite a sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cAgain!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really busy lately, son. You\u2019re going to lose weight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I did get slimmer, but I got a lot stronger as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, America\u2026 Are you going to that canyon where wyverns appear?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, do you want to come with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Father surprisingly thought about it seriously, then shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I would have gone if it was any other time, but I\u2019m almost about to make a breakthrough in my spearmanship\u2026 I heard that wyverns are strong. Be careful and don\u2019t get hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia has a healing ability. Since we\u2019ll be together, there\u2019s no need to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPalludia-ssi is going too!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yua\u2019s anger seemed to have soared to the heavens. She then shouted, \u201cI\u2019m going to start going to church!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYua!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to be a priestess too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Yua, even if you become a nun, I don\u2019t think you can become a priestess that uses holy magic.\u2019 Thinking that in my head, I placed my hand on Yua\u2019s head. She tried to take my hand off in anger, but before she could do so, I said, \u201cThanks for worrying about me, Yua.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Yua becomes an Awakened, then oppa won\u2019t leave Yua alone at home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about being a dungeon explorer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t climb the dungeon without a combat ability. If Yua becomes an Awakened, we can talk then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yua seemed to have acquiesced, as she nodded with a frown. Thank god!</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Oppa will bring back presents from America for Yua, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a child, don\u2019t try to appease me with presents. I hate oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed I needed more time before Yua\u2019s anger could be appeased.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m going too.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hwaya?\u201d</p><br/><p>[You came to help me before, so I\u2019ll go with you to Arizona.]</p><br/><p>When I told Hwaya I\u2019d be in America for a while, she said she would come with me, making me flustered. As her reason made sense, I was even more flustered.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s different than this. I know I\u2019m going to an S rank Field Dungeon, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019ll be in a dangerous situation. You don\u2019t need to trouble yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>[But wouldn\u2019t it be easier if I was there?]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026 You\u2019re Britain\u2019s ability user. If you come, they might take it as Britain\u2019s assistance.\u201d</p><br/><p>[No, I\u2019ll make it clear that I\u2019m participating as Thunder Knight\u2019s friend.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019re not going to make it a trade between America and Britain?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yeah. Britain won\u2019t understand my worth unless I show them.]</p><br/><p>Coming from someone as patriotic as Hwaya, it was a surprise. Brightman really must have made her angry. I continued, still half-surprised from what she said.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, you\u2019ll be in my way.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s too honest! I\u2019ve gotten stronger too! Plus, I got a Legend-grade defensive equipment, so I\u2019ve perfectly covered my weakness. Don\u2019t be surprised when you see me! I\u2019ll prepare a plane for us in two days, so be ready!]</p><br/><p>With that, Hwaya hung up. \u2018At least she was eager to go\u2026\u2019 With that, I sighed. I had no choice but to acknowledge that she was coming.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, Ye-Eun safely defeated the Grim Reaper with Ludia and Ellos\u2019 party. Since Ludia has broke through to the 41st floor and even awakened an ability, I decided to take her with me to America like I promised.</p><br/><p>The day of promise then came.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, hi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was one uninvited guest waiting for me in front of my house.</p><br/><p>I turned around to Ludia and demanded an explanation. Ludia buried her face in my back and dodged my eyes as she replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cS-She said she would come. I couldn\u2019t do anything about it. I didn\u2019t want to tell her either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, you\u2019re so mean. You should have called me if you were going somewhere so dangerous!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re weaker than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI got stronger by climbing the dungeon, so I wanted to try hunting wyverns too! By the way Palludia, can you get off of Shin now? I heard that the two of you are just friends!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia returned Ye-Eun\u2019s burning gaze with her special cold gaze. At the same time, I sent Ye-Eun a message only she could hear.</p><br/><p>[I told you, Ludia has a special circumstance.]</p><br/><p>[But it\u2019s annoying watching her like that in front of me!]</p><br/><p>[Do you want to go home?]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Tsk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun finally seemed to have understood. I felt sorry in a way, so I decided to get her a gift to make up for it. With that, I headed to the airport with both Ludia and Ye-Eun. I had already turned down Ciara Kenex\u2019s offer to prepare a method of transportation. Hwaya and I promised to meet here, and her private plane would be waiting here. As expected, when I arrived at the airport, Hwaya was already waiting at the airport. It was obvious she had used some kind of magic to prevent herself from being noticed by people other than me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Shin\u2026 Oh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it really has, Hwaya. Sorry, I forgot to tell you about my friends. They\u2019re both ability users and dungeon explorers.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Hwaya saw Ludia and Ye-Eun, she opened her eyes widely in surprise. However, it was Ludia and Ye-Eun who were more surprised, as they noticed Hwaya only after I spoke with her. The two of them rudely pointed their fingers at Hwaya and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cT-That\u2019s Ye Hwaya, right? Ye Hwaya!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw her on TV!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my Korean name. Even though I\u2019m staying in Korea for now, I\u2019m British. Hwaya Mastiford. I\u2019m a Second Dungeon explorer and a friend of Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya seemed to be accustomed to such reactions, as she introduced herself with a sigh. Ludia and Ye-Eun\u2019s response differed.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, you, when did you become friends with someone like her\u2026? Uk, no, I\u2019m lacking in all aspects\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPalludia. I have a family name, but I\u2019m not using it right now. Shin is\u2026 my friend. For now.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Hwaya\u2019s introduction, Ye-Eun wrapped her head with her hands and crouched down in agony, while Ludia made a light smile and puffed out her nonexistent chest to introduce herself. Eh? Ludia, she\u2026 Eh? When did she\u2026 Eh!?</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Friend \u2018for now\u2019\u2026 Hm, okay. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya smiled lightly at Ludia and knocked on the airstairs next to her plane.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, no one else is coming, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, let\u2019s go. The skunk plane is going to depart soon. We can continue talking once we take off. We\u2019ll have to fly for at least 7 hours anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>While I was bewildered from Ludia\u2019s inexplicable change, Hwaya urged us to get on board. Ye-Eun also looked slightly out of touch with reality as she staggered up the stairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2019m on Ye Hwaya\u2019s personal plane\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia linked her arms with mine and pulled me along. Now that I realized the change in Ludia, I shivered at the sensation I could feel with my arm. Dear god, there was no way this was artificial\u2026 It had to be natural! When I walked up the stairs as shocked as Ye-Eun and entered the plane, Hwaya, who walked by me, asked me in a whisper.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, there should only be six explorers on Earth. How do you explain bringing two explorers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can explain later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be sure to hear it when we\u2019re alone, so prepare yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I was standing still listening to Hwaya, Ludia called my name and pulled on my arm. I made a bitter smile, and Hwaya laughed with her eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin won\u2019t run away. You don\u2019t have to shout his name. Don\u2019t be so nervous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya and Ludia exchanged glances for a short moment. Was it a power struggle? Could this be the women\u2019s fight, which I only ever heard about? One that determines who\u2019s superior in their first meeting? Now that I thought about it, neither Ludia or Hwaya should have lost to anyone in appearance. Hwaya was famous on Earth for her beauty, and Ludia was regarded as one of the top beauties in the dungeon.</p><br/><p>It was almost impossible to objectively judge a person\u2019s appearance, but it would be hard for me to find anyone more beautiful than Hwaya and Ludia purely in appearance. Since the two of them met, it was probably normal for them to have their own thoughts about the matter.</p><br/><p>I flinched seeing them exchange glances, but I soon urged Ludia to keep going.</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, let\u2019s sit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn, wait\u2026 Mastiford. I don\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel the same way, Palludia.\u201d</p><br/><p>They both smiled. It was the kind of smile that emanated chills. Because their smiles were almost exactly the same, I almost got goosebumps. However, this atmosphere, which was as if Wendigo had used Ice Touch, was soon melted by a voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, there\u2019s a drinking bar here! Do you think there are fries too!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ye-Eun, I really like your never changing self\u2026\u2019 With a sigh, I replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know, you didn\u2019t even introduce yourself to Hwaya yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, right. I\u2019m Su Ye-Eun. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, nice to meet you too. I think I can get along with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-It\u2019s an honor! Uu, but I feel conflicted\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like that, the four of us set off to Arizona. Ciara Kenex would be waiting for me at Antelope Canyon. Would she know that I\u2019d bring them along? Perhaps, she might with her special ability. With a grin, I leaned my head against the seat.</p><br/><p>Would I be at Arizona once I woke up? How did Ciara Kenex know I was the Hero? Does she know more about Heroes than me?</p><br/><p>Perhaps, she knew why and how I became the Hero.</p><br/><p>Thinking about questions that I had no way of answering for now, I slowly closed my eyes.</p><br/><p>I heard the rumble of the skunk plane taking off.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Awakening is amazing!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>It is indeed\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

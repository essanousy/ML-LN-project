The End (4)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Ciara strutted her chest and spoke proudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. The more difficult things are, the more people will look for a savior. With 2.3 billion people dead, I was confident in making Hero-nim into a God. I just had to cut off the few dissenting voices and amplify the positive voices. It was simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had experience controlling the media with her clan\u2019s power. Contrary to my belief, she hadn\u2019t cut off her relationship with the Kenex clan. In fact, she was most likely its ruler. With her clan\u2019s power and the power of her future sight, manipulating the popular opinion should have been simple.</p><br/><p>\u201cSetting me aside, how did you trick Daisy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHero-nim, I am an Evil Eyes beholder.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cross in her eyes shone fiercely.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy League isn\u2019t so low as to be analyzed by such low-grade Evil Eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHero-nim, please ask if you have more questions! I will answer any questions you have!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you enter the dungeon? Were you afraid I would lose to Sherafina?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not. There\u2019s no way someone who can\u2019t even beat me could beat Hero-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right, that was the same conclusion I came to just now. A conclusion that made all the preparation I made against Sherafina look foolish.</p><br/><p>Ciara continued to answer my question.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was to make use of that Irregular\u2019s ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately, I began to feel uneasy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer League might have been low, but her ability was certainly shocking! To think she could transfer worlds\u2019 powers as she wished! With an ability like that, we can quickly complete Hero-nim\u2019s power.\u201d</p><br/><p>An even more cruel thought arose.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, you mean\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I will connect Earth with all other worlds. I\u2019ll transfer their worlds\u2019 powers to Hero-nim, so Hero-nim just has to absorb them! Our plan will be complete!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ciara\u2019s eyes were shining incomparably.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Hero-nim, please don\u2019t defy me. I don\u2019t wish to bring harm to Hero-nim. It will hurt for just a moment, so please bear with it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 You\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, it became difficult to talk. Why? Obviously, it was because this space was densely packed with \u2018Sherafina\u2019s\u2019 now Ciara\u2019s mana. An immense pressure was pressing down on my body.</p><br/><p>Though somewhat ridiculous, with Sherafina\u2019s power, Ciara was undoubtedly stronger than me.</p><br/><p>If all worlds\u2019 powers became concentrated into me like she said, the situation would be reversed, but it would be too late once that happened. Just separating the few worlds\u2019 powers I had in my body would take ages. Once countless other worlds\u2019 powers became forcibly fused, it would be impossible to reverse it.</p><br/><p>No, in the worst case\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, what will become of you afterward?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I will become a suitable existence for the name Hero-nim will have.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if I kill you, take the power distribution ability you have and give back worlds\u2019 powers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHero-nim, absorbing the worlds\u2019 powers is simply a process, not a goal. I understand you have lingering affection towards other worlds, but please give up. Once you wake up, it will be irreversible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ciara continued to squeeze our her mana as she hummed joyfully. Sherafina\u2019s mana flew towards me with a different power than Enigma.</p><br/><p>Though it was Ciara who was controlling Sherafina\u2019s mana, she was doing it naturally and effortlessly. Her talent in learning Peruta Circuit surprised me before, but the level of control she was showing had far surpassed the talent she showed me.</p><br/><p>I fought back with Enigma, but Sherafina\u2019s mana suppressed it with raw power. But this wasn\u2019t too unexpected. If I was confident in beating Sherafina with only Enigma, I wouldn\u2019t have been so nervous in the first place.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, we were in a space created for and by Sherafina. Even if I moved just a bit, her mana reacted sensitively.</p><br/><p>I tried to attack her with Divine Speed, but it was futile. Manipulating her mana fluidly, Ciara easily blocked me with a smile. Then, while I contemplated the moves I could make, she sighed and curled her fingers to a hook shape.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. It\u2019ll hurt, but please bear with it. I\u2019m not as skilled as Hero-nim, so I can\u2019t control someone else\u2019s power too well. Eit.\u201d</p><br/><p>I immediately realized what she was trying to do. Sherafina\u2019s power rose up and a devouring pressure overwhelmed me.</p><br/><p>She was trying to suck out all of the dungeon\u2019s power from me. Ridiculous! She could wield Sherafina\u2019s power to this extent already?!</p><br/><p>Although I was shocked by her skillfulness, I was relieved by her action itself.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive it up, Ciara.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow? Hero-nim, you should have that woman\u2019s power inside you, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did, but it\u2019s a bit different now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh wow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ciara acted surprised as she tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me, Hero-nim completely absorbed it? She must have put several locks to prevent Hero-nim from doing that, how amazing! Hero-nim is really amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sure are detestable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow mean. But it\u2019s okay, I know Hero-nim loves me deep down inside! You fixed my eyes after all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my life\u2019s greatest regret.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I blurted out curtly, I became certain of one thing. She couldn\u2019t use her foresight ability in this space. If she knew she couldn\u2019t absorb the dungeon\u2019s power from me, she wouldn\u2019t have carried it out. It could only mean she was unable to achieve a perfect future sight in this space.</p><br/><p>Of course, the reason she couldn\u2019t steal the dungeon\u2019s power from me was simple. Currently, the dungeon\u2019s power was tied to me by a certain medium. This medium was an item that had stayed with me for a long time - the Collector\u2019s Pocket Watch.</p><br/><p>The pocket watch was an odd item even in terms of the dungeon\u2019s rules. Whether it be the power of the dungeon or the power of an artifact, the pocket watch could absorb it and let me wield it.</p><br/><p>At first, the pocket watch was just as mysterious as any other dungeon item, the more I climbed the dungeon, the more I came to know that it wasn\u2019t a simple item. Once the pocket watch let me synthesize skills, my suspicions became solid doubt. From it, I obtained Overlord. In a way, the pocket watch was what made me reach where I was today.</p><br/><p>And it was none other than Loretta who gave me the pocket watch. Not long ago, I asked Loretta if she had my identity in mind when she gave me the pocket watch and she nodded unhesitatingly. Right, Loretta had known for a long time that Sherafina had tricked her, and the pocket watch was her secret weapon against her.</p><br/><p>Not long ago, the pocket watch went through a final change. The final product was simple. It stored any number of external powers, synthesized them and let its user wield them freely. Its purpose was even simpler.</p><br/><p>That was to transfer Sherafina\u2019s power to a different medium and convert it to a different power, and thus even if Sherafina tried to take the power away or tried to use it to harm me, she would be unable to. As long as I had this item, I would be released from the fate of explorers, which was to be at the whim of the Dungeon Lord.</p><br/><p>However, the pocket watch\u2019s power had been blocked once before. That was when I fought the demon Lespina. Other than that one time, it had never been blocked. Then why was blocked against Lespina?</p><br/><p>Lespina was a deviant who was unique even among demons. Unlike the Five Kings or the other worlds\u2019 enemies I\u2019ve faced, she didn\u2019t simply reject Sherafina\u2019s power, she rejected any power that wasn\u2019t pure. That was why she could reject the pocket watch\u2019s power after she perceived it.</p><br/><p>In any case, the fact that Ciara was oblivious about the pocket watch\u2019s existence proved that she was no different than Sherafina in this space.</p><br/><p>Though I was quite shocked at first, fighting Sherafina or fighting Ciara was no different!</p><br/><p>\u201cGeez, it really isn\u2019t easy, is it? Hero-nim is just too excellent. Though, that\u2019s what I like about Hero-nim, huhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI might like you if you just die here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, there you will again with the tease. I already know how much love you have for me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her mana shot towards me from all sides, but my control over mana didn\u2019t lose out either. Even against an enemy who beat my mana both qualitatively and quantitatively, I had the confidence to stand firm. As I thought she would predict my attacks with her foresight ability at first, my shoulders lost strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like you really can\u2019t use your foresight ability in this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Evil Eyes isn\u2019t something like Evil Eyes of Future Sight. Hero-nim, these eyes let me see vividly the record of all past and future of the planet called Earth. They\u2019re also what lets me help Hero-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>So it was like that. I thought Sherafina\u2019s power was resisting her, but it seemed Ciara\u2019s Evil Eyes had an absurd ability. Her Evil Eyes weren\u2019t the eyes of an ability user, but an administrator!</p><br/><p>She said her League was lower than mine? She was only being humble. Someone who knew everything about a world couldn\u2019t possibly have a lower League than me! If she returned to Earth, there might be no way to stop her.</p><br/><p>But thankfully, it seemed the power of her eyes was limited to the premises of Earth. That explained why she had trouble using her ability on matters related to the dungeon. Another suspicion rose up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you find out about Sherafina?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know her name. I simply found out about the existence of the dungeon and its hindrance to our plan. The rest was easy. Once I have the keyword, I can pull out any information about it from Earth\u2019s memory.\u201d</p><br/><p>What heaven-defying ability! In other words, the only thing Ciara couldn\u2019t see among everything I did was what I did in other worlds.</p><br/><p>Even at this very moment, Ciara was working to connect Earth to all other worlds. She knew that an infinite number of worlds and an infinite number of beings would perish. Yet, her expression was bright. Rather than her might, her distorted will was much more frightening.</p><br/><p>\u201cCiara, why are you going so far?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because I love Hero-nim! I only exist for Hero-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need something like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you do, Hero-nim. I know it. You might not be able to understand it now, but trust me and just wait a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was impossible to get through her. The values we had were hopelessly different.</p><br/><p>Talking to her was meaningless. If anything, it would only serve as a way to relieve her boredom while she connected Earth to other worlds.</p><br/><p>Even so, I couldn\u2019t help but ask. There was still something I wanted to know.</p><br/><p>Staring at her, I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you remember Lespina?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

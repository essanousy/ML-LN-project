From Today, I'm an Official Explorer (1)</p><br/><p>Since I had already gotten the Elementalist class, I had forgotten about it. I left the pocket watch stuffed into my inventory and never looked at it. But to think it would turn out like this. As always, the best feeling came from unexpected gains.</p><br/><p>More importantly, it was a subclass. Unlike the Elementalist class, it did not grant me any amazing abilities that changed the way I fought. That said, it would have been weird if my class changed from Elementalist to something else. Being able to use Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry, Vengeful Spirit\u2019s Wail, and other equipment set skills without having to equip them was certainly beneficial.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, the class passive skill \u2018Spirit of the Collector!\u2019 Although this skill seemed to rely on luck for the most part, it was clear that the skill would not be harmful in any way. As a passive skill, it would help me for a long time.</p><br/><p>After organizing my thoughts, I hurriedly took out the pocket watch. The pocket watch was shining with dazzling light from the jewels on the lid. It was as if a switch had been turned on.</p><br/><p>The moment I opened the lid, the minute hand, which was between 11 and 12 o\u2019clock positions, suddenly began spinning. At the same time, I heard a voice in my ear.</p><br/><p>[You used the skill, \u2018Endow Skill.\u2019 You currently possess 3 skill equipment. Which of them would you like to endow?]</p><br/><p>[1. Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry</p><br/><p>2. Vengeful Spirit\u2019s Wail</p><br/><p>3. Dark Thunder Explosion]</p><br/><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it wasn\u2019t like I had doubted it, but I could not help but smile seeing it with my own eyes. Without erasing the smile from my face, I spoke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cOrc Lord\u2019s Warcry.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Designate the hour.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHour? Ah, it\u2019s asking where. Then 1 o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as the word left my word, the Orc Lord Set flew out of my inventory and fell on the ground. Then, the Orc Lord Set began to shine with red light. Soon, a red jewel flew up amidst the red light and went into the pocket watch.</p><br/><p>Thinking I was being attacked, I almost let go of the pocket watch. But seeing that I was unhurt, I turned my gaze toward the pocket watch. The spinning minute hand had stopped and was now fixed on the 1 o\u2019clock position. A red jewel was embedded there, replacing the number 1.</p><br/><p>I now realized that these holes weren\u2019t actual holes where something came off. They were empty sockets where skills would be embedded.</p><br/><p>\u201cVengeful Spirit\u2019s Wail.\u201d</p><br/><p>Like before, the Wraith Queen Set shone with a gloomy grey light and spit out a grey jewel. It then entered the 2 o\u2019clock socket. I continued with the Dark Ratman Set, which went into the 3 o\u2019clock socket. For some reason, however, the jewel was yellow. Was it because lighting was yellow? But it\u2019s called dark thunder\u2026 how mysterious.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu, so this means I don\u2019t need to wear the full set anymore. Though, since the Dark Ratman Set is the best, I\u2019ll continue wearing it.\u201d</p><br/><p>It increased my strength and dexterity by 10 points each. That was a stat bonus equivalent to 4 whole levels! The Dark Ratman was comparatively difficult to solo, but I had also gained a lot from doing so. Feeling all around happy, I smiled from ear to ear as I patted Peika\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>[Stop, my hair will get tangled.]</p><br/><p>Since Peika said it while flushing her cheeks and twisting her body, I continued to pat her.</p><br/><p>Hm? Why did I feel like I was forgetting something?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah, the reward.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reward from defeating the Floor Master alone. I had almost forgotten about it. When I checked, it was a Return Magic Book. Return? Tilting my head, I used it immediately.</p><br/><p>[You learned the Return skill. Using 80 percent of your remaining mana, you can teleport to any predetermined location. You can bring up to two people. You can only choose two locations at any given time, and you must have visited these locations before. You can only use this skill twice a day. You can change these locations every two weeks. The number of locations and the number of times Return can be used will increase with levels.]</p><br/><p>[You cannot bring non-dungeon explorers to the dungeon.]</p><br/><p>[You cannot bring those belonging to other worlds into your own.]</p><br/><p>\u2018Geez, why is there so many twos!? It\u2019s easy to memorize at least. Wait, now that I think about it, this skill\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no better skill for going to and from school! Imagining myself teleporting to the school and teleporting back as soon as classes ended, I could not hide my excitement.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah, going from school to home should be easy since I can just go into the restroom, but the other way would be hard\u2026 I\u2019ll need to look for a secluded area at school. Well, I\u2019ll think about this later.\u2019</p><br/><p>[Name: Kang Shin Race: Human Sex: Male</p><br/><p>Class: Elementalist (Sub \u2013 Skill Collector) Title: Dark Ratman Slayer Rank: Bronze 1</p><br/><p>Level: 20</p><br/><p>HP \u2013 5,870/5,870 MP \u2013 3,860/3,860</p><br/><p>Strength \u2013 55(+15) Dexterity \u2013 49(+13) Constitution \u2013 59(+3)</p><br/><p>Intelligence \u2013 20(+3) Magic \u2013 74(+3) Charm \u2013 43(+3) Luck \u2013 20(+3)</p><br/><p>Normal Skill \u2013 Mid-rank Martial Arts (Lv 9), High-rank Spear Technique (Lv 4), Peruta Circuit (Lv 3), Mid-rank Heroic Strike (Lv 2), Low-rank Provoke (Lv 7), Return (Lv 1), Deific Manifestation.</p><br/><p>Class Skill \u2013 Low-rank Spirit Mastery (Lv 5), Low-rank Spirit Aura (Lv 1), Low-rank Elemental Control (Lv 1), Low-rank Elemental Contract (Lv 2), Low-rank Elemental Tempest (Lv 5)</p><br/><p>Subclass Skill \u2013 Endow Skill, Spirit of the Collector]</p><br/><p>Huu. Now that I looked at my status, one thing stood out in particular. It was that my highest stat was magic. It was because I received bonus magic stats when I became an Elementalist and a Skill Collector.</p><br/><p>Of course, since magic could strengthen spear techniques, it was not a bad thing. Other close-combat classes most likely received bonus strength, dexterity, or constitution stats. But the compressing elixirs I consumed easily covered that difference. Not to mention, the bonus from the Dark Ratman Set should have made me surpass them. I knew for certain that equipment that raised strength and dexterity by 10 were rare.</p><br/><p>When I visited the Floor Shop afterwards, Loretta was smiling without saying anything. Even when I showed her my sparkling pocket watch, she seemed to have expected it as she maintained her tranquil smile. Her leisure irritated me for no apparent reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll be challenging the 20th Floor Master next.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, although I won\u2019t go for a complete conquer until I\u2019m level 25.\u201d</p><br/><p>At my words, Loretta seemed to ponder over something, then said, \u201cCustomer, the 20th Floor Master, Lizard Knight, is a monster that separates the Bronze rank and the Silver rank. It is a cruel and formidable monster that slaughters explorers who do not meet the qualifications to rise to the Silver rank.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? But why are you telling me this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor customer, it might be easier to defeat the Lizard Knight than the Dark Ratman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loreta stayed silent for a moment before she opened her mouth again.</p><br/><p>\u201cCustomer, if the Dark Ratman appeared with a stronger defense, but without its ratmen minions, what would you have done?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI probably could have defeated it at level 15. I would just have to dodge its skill.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was only one reason the Dark Ratman fight was so hard. It was because of how difficult it was to fight the fierce ratmen minions while dodging the Dark Ratman\u2019s lightning. But if there were no ratmen minions to worry about, defeating the Dark Ratman would have been easy. In fact, it might have been easier than the Wraith Queen fight. No matter how much its defense increased, it would not stand a chance against my skills. I just had to use it a couple more times.</p><br/><p>But at my answer, Loretta became speechless and stared at me fixedly. When I gave her the \u2018why are you looking at me\u2019 face, she cleared her throat and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly how the Lizard Knight is. He does not have any minions that fight for him. However, he is strong, fast, and robust. With these qualities, he has forced countless explorers to kneel and despair. But if customer is confident, it would be fun to challenge him alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDare to adventure. That\u2019s what you\u2019re saying, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you remember what I told you? That the fruit of adventure is always sweet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta was giving me a hint. But what did she mean by the fruit of adventure being sweet? The title of Lizard Knight Slayer should be the same no matter when I earned it. What difference was there in getting it now or later?</p><br/><p>Ah.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me, there\u2019s a difference if I succeed in a solo raid in my challenge?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? Hwi hwi~!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta avoided my gaze as she whistled. It was obvious to the point it was doubtful, but Loretta had never said anything to put me at a disadvantage. She did try to con me into buying more items though.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Could I trust her?</p><br/><p>\u201cOne more thing, customer.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I was wondering whether a mere level 20 adventurer like me should try to do something that doesn\u2019t seem particularly appealing, Loretta added, as if to put the nail on the coffin.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe \u2018first\u2019 is always special.\u201d</p><br/><p>The first. I felt a strong attraction to that word. It also implied that I had never truly been the first. Being the idiot that I am, I felt my pride being provoked. Even her eyes seemed to be saying \u2018you can\u2019t even do this?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll do it. The first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta stared into my eyes for a moment before flushing her cheeks and turning away. Then, she shouted as she took something out of her pocket.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen here\u2019s an offer from the Floor Shop, customer! This here is a magical item that holds down the enemy\u2019s movement for 5 seconds! Now it\u2019s only 10,000 gold!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not buying it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll challenge it. At level 20, I will solo the 20th Floor Master! Without that magical item, of course!</p><br/><p>Author's note: Mastered lower-ranked skills have been removed from that status to avoid cluttering!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

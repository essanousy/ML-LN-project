I could call it cute, but because of my aversion towards her, she only looked hateful no matter what she did. However, now was the time to set aside my feelings. I let out a dry cough and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cI already told you. What was the reason I needed your help?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Because enemies that could nullify the dungeon\u2019s power appeared... right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>[And that\u2019s why Hero-nim called me. To read their movements and prepare beforehand.]</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Then for me to get stronger, shouldn\u2019t I\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d</p><br/><p>I shook my head. Of course, Sherafina told me I needed to make Ciara a dungeon explorer. However, that\u2019s because Sherafina didn\u2019t know about Lespina.</p><br/><p>The Dungeon Lord wasn\u2019t a god. She wasn\u2019t omnipotent, nor was she omniscient. Her suggestion was reasonable, but not in this case. Against enemies that could ignore the dungeon\u2019s power, how could we fight them with the dungeon\u2019s power? That was partly why I gave up on grinding stats! Easily raised levels from the dungeon? They were different. Rather than the sweet fruit given as a reward for completing the dungeon\u2019s tests, I wanted the tests themselves.</p><br/><p>For this reason, climbing the dungeon was beneficial for combat type ability users. There was a huge difference between those who experienced combat and those who didn\u2019t. Those who won against powerful enemies gained experience different from the levels the dungeon gave. I considered this another aspect of one\u2019s league. I believed that this was also the reason so many gods had their eyes out for me.</p><br/><p>However, Ciara was different. She was frail. Most likely, the limit of her physical strength was picking up a knife and a fork. Her underdeveloped body could be easily seen from the outside. Although she carried a special and boundless mana, she could only use it when she used her ability. Most of the time, it was just leaking out of her body. Her mana wasn\u2019t being used. Setting aside her talent for magic, she had never even wielded her mana.</p><br/><p>Even she entered the dungeon, what could she do? Of course, if I paired her with another ability user, it would be possible to make her stronger. During that process, Sherafina would most likely read Ciara\u2019s ability and help her develop it. However, as I said before, such an ability was useless in front of enemies like Lespina. It might not even activate properly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much did your ability grow?\u201d</p><br/><p>[The range increased by another 20km radius.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s still growing?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes, Hero-nim. My ability gets stronger the more I use it. I don\u2019t know the origin of it, though.]</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, then I have an idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I felt confident I could develop her ability, I took out a piece of paper. It was a Soul Contract.</p><br/><p>[I can feel an amazing power from it\u2026 and an ominous aura.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I can\u2019t trust you so easily, so it\u2019s a failsafe method\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, I hesitated. Then, I fell in thought. Ciara couldn\u2019t see with her eyes, but she realized what I was doing and turned to face me. I could call her action admirable, but because of my aversion towards her\u2026 The rest didn\u2019t need to be said.</p><br/><p>I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you like me?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Because it\u2019s my fate!]</p><br/><p>I hate\u2026 No, endure it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I said before, can you do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very efficient. If Hero-nim allows it, I\u2019ll look for another method. There\u2019s a lot to be prepared for the world Hero-nim will rule!]</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you still do that after cutting ties with your family?\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019ll be slightly more difficult, but I can do it! As long as I have the authority to grant abilities, I can coerce ability users to\u2026 Ehem. In any case, it\u2019s possible!]</p><br/><p>\u201cRejected.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Uuu\u2026 Okay.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to put an observer on you. Is that fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>She did not give an immediate answer. She then tilted her head and asked.</p><br/><p>[The object Hero-nim took out can restrain my actions, correct?]</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. It can even restrain the way you think. It\u2019s a scary object.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Then why would Hero-nim not use it and put an observer on me instead?]</p><br/><p>It was a fair question. Did I feel bad about using the Soul Contract on Ciara? Not in the slightest. I had already used Soul Contracts on many people. As long as the contract\u2019s terms were kept, a Soul Contract was nothing more than a piece of paper, something that didn\u2019t pose much danger. If the target was Ciara, I didn\u2019t really need to hesitate.</p><br/><p>Even so, this was the decision I came to.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I thought I shouldn\u2019t continue using Soul Contracts on my allies.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m touched, Hero-nim! I finally became Hero-nim\u2019s woman! Aaah, I\u2019m so happy!]</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t change the topic.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ciara was trembling from elation. Although seeing her gave me the chills, I knew I could restrain her even without using a Soul Contract.</p><br/><p>The reason was simple. She\u2026 Kuhum, she liked me way too much. In the end, her every action was for my benefit. She accepted any sacrifice and justified any action if it was in my favor. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want to be involved with her. I was afraid she would do something I couldn\u2019t control.</p><br/><p>However, that wasn\u2019t the case now. I had more than enough power to control her actions. There was a reason to be afraid. Moreover, rather than avoiding what I feared and ignoring it, I knew it was better to keep it next to me and watch over it. This was the decision I came to after analyzing the data collected by the succubi\u2019s investigation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say it again, get rid of the organization you\u2019ve been forming.\u201d</p><br/><p>[An enormous amount of money and manpower have already been used. I\u2019m sure it will be of great help to Hero-nim\u2019s future!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need it. Get rid of it. Or, you can just give it to your family and tell them to do what they want with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I said that, I thought for a moment. The Kenex family would undoubtedly oppose me taking Ciara away. A tiny clash might happen in the process\u2026 and I can use this chance to get rid of this organization. Yep, that sounded like a good plan.</p><br/><p>In any case, Ciara\u2019s answer was interesting.</p><br/><p>[Yes! Then I\u2019ll make it so that we can regain control over them at any time!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be needed. I already obtained everything I wanted. Including you.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Yes.]</p><br/><p>For some reason, Ciara twisted her body and blushed. I pondered which part of my statement caused her to act so annoyingly, but since I wasn\u2019t really interested in her, I just ignored it.</p><br/><p>I put away the Soul Contract and thought how this was a good opportunity.</p><br/><p>Some of Revival\u2019s members were still collared. Ilayda Van and Laz Michel\u2026 They were trustworthy people, but I wanted to watch over them for a little bit longer. However, Leon, Walker, and Sophie were already on Revival\u2019s boat and couldn\u2019t get off. Even setting that aside, I already knew what kind of people they were. Soul Contracts weren\u2019t needed. Putting collars on their necks was nothing less than an insult. I decided to get rid of them.</p><br/><p>Walker might curse me and attack the moment he was freed from his Soul Contract, but getting hit once wouldn\u2019t be so bad. I could always return it a hundredfold too.</p><br/><p>[Hero-nim, what are you thinking about? I want to hear it too!]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. In any case, from this moment on, you\u2019re a member of Revival. Though, you won\u2019t enter the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>[A secret agent? Just for Hero-nim!?]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Well, let\u2019s call it a secret agent for Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>I made a bitter smile and nodded. Then, I continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be the one training you. Hwaya will also help. The two of us are skilled with handling mana, and it\u2019ll help you develop your ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hero-nim\u2019s training\u2026 Can I go outside and calm myself from this excitement?]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t be excited. Don\u2019t calm yourself down. Hwaya will be there too. Got it? Hwaya will be there! Don\u2019t forget that!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I wish only Hero-nim was there\u2026]</p><br/><p>Just what did this girl eat to be so extreme at just thirteen-years-old!? I needed to hear the Kenex family\u2019s education policy. Then, I\u2019ll make everyone kneel and apologize.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, let\u2019s open your eyes and mouth. It\u2019s not my style to work people without properly reimbursing them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Except for Walker.</p><br/><p>[Mm\u2026 This might be rude, Hero-nim, but can I say something?]</p><br/><p>Ciara made a sorrowful expression that I\u2019d never seen before as she shook her head.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s not that I want to doubt Hero-nim\u2019s words, but I\u2019ve never been able to fix this disability I was born with.]</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019ve only met bad doctors.\u201d</p><br/><p>[It was impossible with modern medicine. Even though mana stones and monster remains brought huge advancement in medicine and science, it wasn\u2019t enough to fix my eyes. It was the same for my mouth. They said that something unapproachable by science was blocking me. Something like a curse.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><br/><p>[The Kenex family and I tried mobilizing all healing ability users. The Kenex family is larger than what Hero-nim thinks. All healing ability users on Earth tried to cure me. One of them was Miss Ilayda Van, who is currently in Revival. No one could recover my sight, nor my voice. Although Miss Palludia wasn\u2019t one of them, I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be different.]</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, yeah, Ludia\u2019s power might not be enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>I shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m different.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Of course, I have the greatest faith in Hero-nim\u2019s power! But Hero-nim, I don\u2019t want to be disappointed at Hero-nim. I don\u2019t want to be disappointed in myself, who is disappointed in Hero-nim. I\u2019m happy as I am now. It\u2019s fine.]</p><br/><p>Ciara\u2019s attitude was clearly unnatural. She was shaking her head like she was afraid of something. I had some doubts, then I remembered something obvious.</p><br/><p>She was only thirteen.</p><br/><p>She was smart and headstrong for her age, so I never considered her to be a thirteen-year-old. Right. She was young. The time she had might have been too short for her to naturally accept her disability.</p><br/><p>From the day she was born, she couldn\u2019t see, hear, nor talk. It seemed she accepted her disability as a payment for becoming an ability user. She acted proudly, and she never doubted her actions. Since she paid such a great price when she was born, she had no qualms about using the power she had. A saintess chosen by God\u2026 It made sense that that\u2019s how she viewed herself.</p><br/><p>Even so, it was hard to say she overcame her disability. In fact, her actions showed how much of a complex she had towards her disability. Her current reaction proved this theory completely.</p><br/><p>I became disappointed in myself. I knew that at the basis of her blind actions was her disability, but I had been carrying hostility towards her all this time.</p><br/><p>I was rather proud of my ability to see through people for my age, but it seemed it was just a rookie\u2019s folly. I still had much more to learn in this regard. Who was I to judge people and hate them? I was only twenty two! It was good that I realized it now. Even if I didn\u2019t want to, my position required me to think and act this way.</p><br/><p>Some of her actions were certainly unforgivable. She committed a crime that couldn\u2019t be justified in any way. I felt that her way of thinking wouldn\u2019t change, and so accepted my decision to restrain her actions. No matter how much good she did, since she would never repent for her sins, she would forever remain a sinner, and I would forever hate her. That\u2019s what I had thought.</p><br/><p>Now, however, I felt like I saw a tiny potential. A way to open her heart, which, in some way, could never ben opened or changed. Making her realize her faults and making her act on her own volition rather than for me.</p><br/><p>Since I planned to do it anyways, there was no need to hesitate. I took out an Elixir from my inventory.</p><br/><p>[This is\u2026?]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, this won\u2019t be enough. It\u2019s a miraculous medicine, but it\u2019s still a bit lacking to resolve your curse. It would be a waste to use two, so I\u2019m only going to use one.\u201d</p><br/><p>I gave her a short reply and took a breath. After looking around, I nodded and muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cOverlord.\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, the power of Enigma enveloped me. It automatically split itself for offense and defense, then followed the path of Peruta Circuit to circulate around my body. I grabbed this mana of Enigma mid-path.</p><br/><p>[Hero-nim, what\u2026 what an amazing power. I can\u2019t see you. Are you really there?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you see with your own eyes soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>I grinned and focused entirely on the Elixir in my hand. I had considered it for a long time. Strengthening items with Enigma\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t impossible. At this moment, Enigma was mine. If I couldn\u2019t use it as I wanted, how could I call myself its master? As if to prove this, Enigma\u2019s mana followed my control, thoroughly entering the bottle of Elixir. Ciara, who couldn\u2019t see, only trembled at the energy she felt.</p><br/><p>\u201cDone.\u201d</p><br/><p>[What\u2026 What do I need to do, Hero-nim?]</p><br/><p>Ciara\u2019s voice was shaking. I smirked and grabbed her tightly clenched fist. After opening it slowly, I put the bottle of Elixir on her hand. Then, she grabbed it carefully, afraid it would break.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust drink it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, I controlled Enigma to open the bottle. With trembling hands, Ciara put the Elixir on her mouth. Then, she drank it all in one go. She didn\u2019t doubt in the slightest. Her affection again gave me the chills. When she opened her eyes and saw me, would she see how I was different from her image, become disillusioned and lose her affection for me? Oh, please! Let that be the case! For a moment, I had a wishful dream.</p><br/><p>Then, as if how she couldn\u2019t open her eyes was a lie, she opened her eyes too naturally.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, aaah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCiara, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I saw her eyes, I realized why such a great curse was placed on her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHero\u2026 nim\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Large black irises that were as clear as the starry sky and a white cross clearly inscribed in each eye.</p><br/><p>She was the only innate Evil Eyes holder birthed by Earth.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Shin and Hwaya obtained their Evil Eyes by raising their leagues and proving their qualifications. Other than Ciara, Loretta and Daisy are the only ones in the story born with innate Evil Eyes.</p><br/><p>You understand why Ciara couldn\u2019t open her eyes or speak, right? And what ability that Evil Eyes has! After all, the ability of Evil Eyes can\u2019t be hidden just by closing one\u2019s eyes! Huhu.</p><br/><p>Next chapter will have detailed explanations!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

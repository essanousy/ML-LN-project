Granting Freedom (3)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Chapter 96. Granting Freedom (3)</p><br/><p>Hwaya\u2019s eyes opened wide. It was to be expected. She probably didn\u2019t expect Walker\u2019s name to suddenly pop out.</p><br/><p>But I was sure. The black clothed man who was frozen up to his stomach was undoubtedly Edward Walker. I could tell from his voice. Seeing him use a skill, I became even more confident.</p><br/><p>I took off the mask he was wearing. A brown eyed and brown haired middle-age man was revealed underneath. Although he was gritting his teeth and glaring at me, I didn\u2019t pay it any attention and grabbed his face. Pzzt. Sparks flashed. This strong resistance made me confident.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou even have an item that hides your identity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike the one you\u2019re wearing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already said I was sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>I let Walker go. Since he could have the Return skill like me (though he would have used it by now), I broke both of his two legs to leave behind evidence that he couldn\u2019t get rid of. Although I wasn\u2019t sure how severe the state of his arms and legs were, that was not of my concern.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuuuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWalker, sneaking into a lady\u2019s room is something only a piece of trash would do. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuuu\u2026.!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see, I\u2019m quite angry. It could be because I have a younger sister, but it doesn\u2019t feel like someone else\u2019s problem. I might be a bit harsh\u2026 so start talking.\u201d</p><br/><p>First, I lightly punched his stomach. The mana surrounding his body undulated and a strong blue light shot out for a moment. From the resistance I felt against my fist, it seemed he was wearing an impact-reducing item, as it only reacted to physical impacts, not to lightning or ice. No, perhaps the item reacted, but couldn\u2019t win against them.</p><br/><p>I wondered how it worked. Was it a one-time use item? Or did it have a set number of uses? Perhaps it simply activated using his mana. To answer my question, I punched Walker again. He frowned, and at the same time, another blue light shot out.</p><br/><p>It seemed he was using his own mana. Deciding that it was best to deplete his mana before he could do something to escape, I punched him repeatedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even pretend to be someone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 Walker. Kuk\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, let me deplete your mana first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 won\u2019t resist!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you, so shut up.\u201d</p><br/><p>I beat him repeatedly. When the blue light subsided completely, Walker\u2019s pupils dilated. It was the sign that his lack of mana was affecting his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk\u2026 Yeon Hwawoo, you brute\u2026! I was only inside the building!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, you were just trying to sneak a peek on Hwaya taking a bath? Did someone like you crawl into an SS-ranker\u2019s lodge to play tag? If you\u2019re going to continue your nonsense, I can always hit you more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, why would a dungeon explorer like you work under someone like Brightman?\u201d</p><br/><p>I, of course, judged that Walker was Brightman\u2019s subordinate and was acting on his orders. To be honest, it was rather obvious. Hwaya was also nodding her head in agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cWould you believe me if I said I wasn\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I raised my fist without a reply, Walker let out a deep sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are a brute\u2026 uk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, take off that item.\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker glared at me, then reached his hands out to unequip his item. Then, realizing that his arms were broken, he murmured something. Surprisingly, something thin came off of his face, and he became a black haired, green eyed young man. Although his facial lines were rather thick, his green eyes gave off a calming impression.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, give me that item of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s a Floor Shop item, so it\u2019s untradeable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I see.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I picked it up, it came in my possession without any resistance. He was lying.</p><br/><p>[Ghostface (Unique)</p><br/><p>Durability \u2013 98/110</p><br/><p>Equipment Limit \u2013 Level 40+, Magic 50+</p><br/><p>Option \u2013 Magic -20, Dexterity +15</p><br/><p>Skill \u2013 Ghostface: Wearing this item will allow you to change your appearance into someone you\u2019ve seen before. However, as the item uses your mana, you cannot use a portion of your mana while the item is equipped.]</p><br/><p>The moment the item description popped up, I punched Walker\u2019s stomach again. As expected, blue light once again shot up. He was undoubtedly trying to do something, as he grit his teeth at my attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the son of a bitch here.\u201d</p><br/><p>I depleted his mana once again and put Ghostface in my inventory.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you disarm yourself next?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t move my body. Heal my arm at least.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll just take them off myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyak, what are you doing when I\u2019m watching!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like that, Walker was stripped until even his important parts were showing (Hwaya screamed and turned away). I put some random clothes on Walker and burned his undergarments. Then, I checked his equipment and found what I was looking for.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Serina\u2019s Guardian Bracelet (Epic)</p><br/><p>Durability \u2013 551/1,120</p><br/><p>Equipment Requirement \u2013 Bound to Edward Walker. Others who equip it will not receive its effects.</p><br/><p>Options \u2013 All stats + 10, Constitution +10</p><br/><p>Skill \u2013 Serina\u2019s Protection: Upon receiving physical or magical attacks that surpass its wearer\u2019s defense, it automatically uses mana to protect its wearer.]</p><br/><p>\u201cEpic, huh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t realize at first, but I also had epic-grade items. My Crimson Dragon Scale Armor Set, Crimson Dragon, Red Dragon Felixes\u2019 Cape and Gluttony Spear were all epic-grade items.</p><br/><p>As I didn\u2019t expect walker to have such a precious item, I couldn\u2019t help but let out an exclamation of surprise. However, as I already knew, epic-grade items became bound to their first wearers. Others who equipped them weren\u2019t able to enjoy their effects. As such, I ordered Peika to destroy Serina\u2019s Guardian Bracelet. It was a shame, but there was no other choice, since I couldn\u2019t equip it.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, do you know how precious that is!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWalker, just shut up.\u201d</p><br/><p>I checked the rest of his equipment, but they were only rare-grade at best. I put them together in a pile and burned them up. Walker bit his lips and cursed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch. No, you son of a devil.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s hear your story.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour mouth isn\u2019t hurt. Why are you working under Brightman? Don\u2019t tell me you made him a dungeon explorer? Though, there\u2019s still only 6 people in Earth\u2019s dungeon explorer rankings\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m crazy? Compared to him, the only thing I have going for me is that I\u2019m a dungeon explorer. He doesn\u2019t know that I can go to a place outside this world and grow my ability\u2026 Plus, it just so happens that my clan has been serving Brightman\u2019s clan for generations.\u201d</p><br/><p>It really was a simple reason. Although I had doubts, Hwaya seemed to have accepted it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s the 21st century.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, in this world, there are lots of people living lives you can\u2019t even imagine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Okay, I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at Walker and fell deep into thought. I didn\u2019t think I would beat Walker half-dead when I came over for dinner. It was so absurd that I felt like I was looking at an answer to a math problem without any work.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why were you spying on Hwaya?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two are really quite friendly. Calling her Hwaya\u2026 I\u2019ve never seen Mastiford allow someone to call her by her first name.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWalker, I thought you were smart\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps, even though he understood the dangerous situation he was in, he might have wanted to show that his mind had not yielded to me. Or, he was simply comforting himself by telling himself that he had not completely lost yet. I didn\u2019t care either way, but I didn\u2019t have any intention of letting this drag out any longer. Did I have to resort to more violence?</p><br/><p>Walker seemed to have noticed what I was thinking as he hurriedly continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you can imagine, it was Brightman\u2019s orders. He said to observe and report everything\u2026 He probably wanted to find something he could exploit. Not to mention, Yeon Hwawoo\u2026 though it\u2019s probably a fake name, you\u2019re also someone he ordered me to observe. He was quite mad that Mastiford let you enter her lodgings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEk, creepy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya scratched her arms, likely from goosebumps she must have received. If I were her, I would have been creeped out too\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMastiford, you didn\u2019t let your guard down often. The only thing I could deliver to Brightman was a picture of you taking a shower that I took between the door gap.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya screamed and threw her flame cat at Walker. The clothes I took the trouble to put on him were burned instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya, calm down. Murder is bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCreepy, creepy, this is the worst! Brightman who ordered to take pictures of me secretly and Walker who carried it out! I want to kill them both! I\u2019m going to kill them both!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe patient for now. I had something in mind. Unless you\u2019re really going to kill Walker, why don\u2019t you hear me out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu, huu, huu\u2026! You have a plan? I\u2019ll hear it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya breathed roughly and retrieved her flame cat. After half-burning a man to cinders, the cat turned around and meowed cutely.</p><br/><p>I thought she\u2019d refuse, but she regained her composure rather quickly. In the end, it seemed she was thinking the same thing I was.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally\u2026 kuk, you\u2019re letting me show very embarrassing parts of myself\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Half-burnt Walker murmured as he gritted his teeth. As I had just finished talking with Hwaya, I replied to him, dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have known this was going to happen if you were discovered.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight\u2026 How did you pierce through my stealth? I was confident I would never be found out\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you really thought I\u2019d tell you\u2026 Alright, Walker, you have a few choices. Listen up.\u201d</p><br/><p>I raised a single finger up.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, you can go back to Brightman and reveal to the whole world that you\u2019re involved with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou seem to be missing some conditions there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, you\u2019ll use your real face and reveal what you did. Although Brightman is behind you, the British government cares for Hwaya just as much. I can be certain that it\u2019ll be quite hard for you to have a proper life after that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker closed his mouth. I continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond, you can run away to the dungeon and never come back. It\u2019s probably better than the first option, though, it\u2019s still the same that you won\u2019t be able to live on Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there more?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course there is. Third, you can betray Brightman and come to our side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You think I will? After what you just did to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker asked me as if he had just heard the most absurd thing in the world. However, I nodded my head assertively.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you will. You were only working under Brightman because you were born into it. If you thought about Brightman so much that you would always be loyal to him, you would have made him a dungeon explorer a long time ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone who knows that would do this to me!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you did was unforgivable after all. Even if you can become my ally, you\u2019ll have to pay for your crimes.\u201d</p><br/><p>At my words, Walker became silent. Watching him, Hwaya burst out into laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cKukuk, so this is the Walker who cared for himself so much and didn\u2019t want to help\u2026 Walker, your actions frankly disgust me, but it\u2019s not unforgivable as you didn\u2019t make Brightman into a dungeon explorer. Although I wanted to end you no matter what Shin said\u2026 If you cooperate wholeheartedly from now on, I can stop myself from ending your life. You should know this is an incredible mercy on my part.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone who couldn\u2019t notice me until now shouldn\u2019t be so arrogant\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUk.\u201d</p><br/><p>After making Hwaya speechless, Walker turned his gaze towards me. Walker was certainly a dungeon explorer, as I could see his body naturally healing as time went on.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t escape from him. Even before he became an ability user, the power and money he had was enormous. As long as I\u2019m in Britain, I can\u2019t escape his reach. Even if I can go into the dungeon, it would be the same when I come out. Unless I plan on living in the dungeon forever like you said, I can only be loyal to him. The only way I could resist him is not letting him know that I can turn him into a dungeon explorer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSetting aside the question of whether or not that was really the only way\u2026 Why can\u2019t you just leave Britain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWere you listening to me? There\u2019s no way to leave Britain without him finding out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I give a very simple example? During the Event Raid, you could have left for another country and stayed there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were just scared. Admit it. You didn\u2019t have the courage to change the way you lived.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Huu.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a short sigh, Walker revealed his true thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as I was loyal to him, I could have anything I wanted. You\u2019re right. Being able to thoughtlessly work under someone is indeed comfortable, and I grew used to it. Participating in a raid and running away? I don\u2019t know how I would live after that. I was working under him the moment I was born. There wasn\u2019t a single time where I acted on my own accord.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason you only laughed at others in the communication channel and never participated, was it just a defense mechanism?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that was because I simply thought you guys were idiots. It wasn\u2019t a defense mechanism or the like. If jumping into danger on your own volition isn\u2019t stupid, what is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing exactly that right now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This guy, even if his body\u2019s a mess, he\u2019s mouth is alive\u2026 I decided to give him the ultimatum.</p><br/><p>\u201cWalker, make your decision. This is the last chance to change your lifestyle. If you agree, I\u2019ll separate you from Brightman completely. Pledging your loyalty and living for Brightman for the rest of your life, or living in the dungeon without being able to come back to Earth. I can at least offer you a better lifestyle than that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I.\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker hesitated for a long time and finally answered.</p><br/><p>Hearing his answer, I grinned.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>I\u2019m feeling a bit sick. I have a cold and my entire body hurts. I couldn\u2019t write much today. I hope I\u2019ll be fine when I wake up. Tomorrow\u2019s chapter is on the line!</p><br/><p>Everyone, I hope you enjoyed the chapter! I\u2019ll come back next chapter with Loretta!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

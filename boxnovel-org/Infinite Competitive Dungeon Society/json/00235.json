Guardian (5)</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s dangerous, don\u2019t go.]</p><br/><p>Daisy spoke in a straightforward manner.</p><br/><p>[Kang Shin will die.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI asked you to explain the situation to me, not curse me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Let me come. Else, I\u2019ll go alone.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you arrive in a different place if you go?\u201d</p><br/><p>[So let\u2019s go together.]</p><br/><p>Daisy stubbornly insisted, but I had no plans of taking anyone with me. I believed that it was best to go with just Lin. Anyone else would just slow us down. Though, that might not necessarily be the case with Daisy\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cA very powerful member of the administrative guild is coming with me, so you don\u2019t have to worry about my safety.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Book Walker, strong. And many.]</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, that\u2019s what I wanted, to know the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Book Walker, also called Slaughter Scholars.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, what\u2019s so special about them?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Take me too.]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy was insistent. I sighed and looked back at Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we bring another person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Of course not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t gain anything by having more people. I\u2019ll be doing the fighting, so we don\u2019t need anyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>His confidence irked me slightly, but I also knew he wasn\u2019t just boasting. However, I had an idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cHer name is Daisy. She\u2019s from the Sylon continent, so wouldn\u2019t it be helpful to have her guide us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSylon continent? There\u2019s still an explorer other than Hydelcyon from that continent? \u2026 What\u2019s her level?\u201d</p><br/><p>I seemed to have caught Lin\u2019s attention. I quickly asked Daisy.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaisy, what level are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>[83.]</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s level 83. She\u2019s also a Beyond explorer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeyond\u2026? There were more people like you in your guild? Fine, at least she won\u2019t hold us back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin made it sound like there would be more people who would want to come with me. When I notified Daisy that she could join us with a bitter smile, Hwaya frighteningly spoke out.</p><br/><p>[Let me come too!]</p><br/><p>I then explained that we wouldn\u2019t gain anything by letting her come. Of course, I took time to say this carefully so her feelings wouldn\u2019t be hurt. Although Hwaya refused to accept my explanation and appealed her strength, we really couldn\u2019t take Hwaya with us as well. There was also the fact that Hwaya\u2019s level had gone down after she moved from the Second Dungeon to the First Dungeon.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust wait. I\u2019ll come back safely, I promise.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I became a Dimensional Mercenary just so I could go with you in cases like this\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going as a Dimensional Mercenary this time. My Dimensional Travel is on cooldown, so I can\u2019t even use it. Next time, we can take a Dimensional Mercenary mission together, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Huu, okay\u2026 I\u2019ll get mad if you come back hurt, got it?]</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>While I pacified Hwaya, Daisy had arrived in Fairy Garden. She seemed to be full of spirit, as she seemed to give off more vigor than usual.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeaving Hwaya behind, very difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, good job.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe said, if I make a move on Kang Shin, she\u2019ll kill me. But, what does making a move mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Since she\u2019s here, let\u2019s go. We have to find Sipua as quickly as possible and put her back in her place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin seemed a bit surprised when he saw Daisy, but he soon calmed down and urged us.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Lin, since there are two teams from each of the four guilds, are there eight teams going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m just making sure. There\u2019s no way to specify Sipua\u2019s location?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. We\u2019ll be able to sense her if we get close enough, so we can only split up the continent into eight regions and search. That\u2019s the easiest way to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn a world that\u2019s being ruled by a world\u2019s enemy, huh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a seriously annoying and dangerous mission.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf not decided, pick a location. Sion Empire, most likely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLodert Hydelcyon, probably there\u2026 Most likely dead. Sion Empire is the most dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. I love danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin retorted with a grin and started walking. It seemed he was going to choose the region we would search for as Daisy recommended. Daisy stared at Lin walking away, then faced me and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin\u2026 As I thought, you like men?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! What do you mean, \u2018as I thought\u2019!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two seem close.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t say that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I, third wheeling?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! Thank you for coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>The dungeon had stopped. From the First Dungeon, all the way to the Fourth, all operations other than the Residential Area ceased. Although we had to return everything to the way it was as quickly as possible, we couldn\u2019t rush into another world. As such, it took another thirty minutes for the eight teams to choose the region they were going to.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, please be safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only thing I can do at times like this is giving Shin-nim a blessing\u2026 Hehe, come here. Hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have no plans to hide your real intentions, do you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since it seemed she wouldn\u2019t let me go if I didn\u2019t let her have her way, I obediently received Loretta\u2019s blessing. Even though I had already found out that she didn\u2019t need to kiss me to give me the blessing, she still did so while acting as if I had never found out.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, although I was the only one she kissed, the blessing was also applied to Lin and Daisy. I could hear Lin muttering Loretta being a scammer, but Loretta silenced him with a mana bullet.</p><br/><p>[You received Queen Elf\u2019s, High-Rank Blessing. For the next 4 days, you receive the following effects: You are protected against all low rank and mid-rank status effects. You can maintain your consciousness for 5 minutes after falling in a half-dead state. Your luck increases by 100. All members of the Faerie race will see you favorably. Your health and magic power recovery rate increase greatly, and you will not get exhausted easily. When attacking, your chance of landing critical hits increases.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later then. Lin, for each scratch on Shin-nim\u2019s body, it\u2019ll be one Last Bullet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you trying to kill me, Noonim?\u201d</p><br/><p>The team consisting of Sikatra and Philoen left ahead of us, and we also used Dimensional Travel afterward. It wasn\u2019t my Dimensional Travel skill, but a Dimensional Travel similar to the portal that linked the dungeon to other worlds.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m off, Loka.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe safe, nyan. The baby will be waiting for Daddy to come back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re only two months pregnant\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Noting the somewhat heartwarming interaction between Loka and Lin, I jumped into the portal along with Lin and Daisy.</p><br/><p>The scenery then changed into a complete wasteland.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter where I looked, there wasn\u2019t a single building or creature. Lin waved his hand through the air as though the sandstorm was annoying him and put a cigarette in his mouth. His casual movements shocked me greatly, but it seemed he didn\u2019t think it was unusual.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start after I finish this smoke.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy heard Lin\u2019s mumbling and tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cBook Walker, coming soon. They\u2019re sensitive to change.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre any of them around here strong enough to threaten me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot at all. Iana is enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy opened her inventory and took out a boar clad in steel. Although it was dozens of meters long when I first fought it, it had shrunk to only three meters. Now, it could only barely fit a person on its back.</p><br/><p>\u201cIana, strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>While I was nodding to Daisy\u2019s praising of her undead again, the so-called Book Walkers began to appear. I imagined literal walking books, but that wasn\u2019t how they looked. In fact, they looked no different than regular humans.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen them before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are still humans left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe must add them to our database.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin chomped on the cigarette he was smoking and muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, blow them away. Just their way of talking annoys me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBook Walkers are researchers. They study their opponents, record them in their books, find their weaknesses, and attack. To win against them\u2026 You have to kill them swiftly with various methods without giving them information. The moment they record on their books, all Book Walkers gain resistance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat means you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUndead I used once won\u2019t work well next time. Abilities I used before won\u2019t work well either. But.\u201d</p><br/><p>Iana abruptly charged towards the Book Walkers, and steel thorns enveloped in a black aura shot out from his body to attack them. The Book Walkers seemed surprised and took something out, but Iana reached them in an instant and skewered them before they could do anything. Daisy nodded her head in satisfaction and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give them, time to research. Then, undead is reusable. Or, with overwhelming power, research is futile.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it doesn\u2019t matter as long as we\u2019re powerful? They aren\u2019t that different than normal monsters then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInformation sharing, annoying. High caste, stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we were told to avoid them\u2026? Fine, whatever. What about those books?\u201d</p><br/><p>At the spot which Lin pointed to were three fancy leather books which were what the Book Walkers had taken out.</p><br/><p>\u201cBurn them, as quickly as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Daisy\u2019s words left her mouth, Lin threw the cigarette his was smoking. When the cigarette landed on the Book Walkers\u2019 corpses, they started to burn along with their books. I couldn\u2019t help but feel awed at Lin\u2019s terrifying flames. At that moment, Daisy approached me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Daisy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to say something, to Kang Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her large red eyes were staring at me intently.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf possible, Kang Shin shouldn\u2019t use your power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I came.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy\u2019s tone was extremely serious. Her eyes were fixed on me and refused to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you use abilities, they\u2019ll get recorded. They will gain resistance, to them. This is the same, for the world\u2019s enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin said one day, you\u2019ll come back and save this place. So for now, save your strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why you wanted to come with us so much so that you can prevent them from learning about my abilities. You\u2019re planning on using your abilities instead\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy nodded. Her trust for my potential had even surprised me. While I was thinking as such, Daisy made a small smile and added. This was the first time I saw her smile, at least towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I trust you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought I was protecting myself from being read\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t read, with my Evil Eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin is, easy to read. Even without Evil Eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shame!! However, what she added afterward made me flinch.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, don\u2019t flirt with another woman in front of me. I\u2019ll shoot you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin who had finished incinerating the corpses and books scowled as he walked back to us. Daisy tilted her head and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cFlirt? With another woman? Who, with who\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, Daisy, please remain innocent!</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>The Sylon continent! Daisy was going to stay out of it at first, but while I was writing, I realized that she could just use the dungeon\u2019s power to go through its portal instead of using her Dimensional Travel! There are, of course, the other reasons mentioned in the chapters too.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Kahar (5)</p><br/><p>In under 20 minutes, Lotte really brought a giant wyvern. Ellos got frightened out of his mind when he saw the wyvern and refused to ride it, but as he said before, he was jumping into a dragon\u2019s mouth. How could he give up now?</p><br/><p>Suppressed completely by Lotte\u2019s league, the wyvern obeyed her words absolutely. Even when Ellos got on, it was looking at Lotte. For the record, it seemed Lotte was okay with other women riding her as she let Licorice get on.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFriend, I\u2019m beginning to regret this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, everyone says that at first.\u201d</p><br/><p>One large and one small, two wyverns flew up into the sky, drawing attention from many in the palace. I ignored their gazes and souted.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Grrrrruaaaa!]</p><br/><p>Lotte flapped her wings with a spirited roar. Ellos seemed to have given up, as he also entrusted his body to his wyvern. In an instant, we left the palace and was soaring through the sky. There was nothing that could block our path.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt this speed, we\u2019ll enter their territory in ten minutes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Entering the invaders\u2019 territory meant that the dungeon\u2019s inventory and messaging system would become unusable. I already told the guild members that I wouldn\u2019t be able to contact them, so all I had to do was take out the items I needed from the inventory.</p><br/><p>Licorice, who was taking this opportunity to hug me tightly, peeked her head over my shoulder and gave me a silk pouch.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the inventory substitute Dear Husband talked about. I\u2019m good at space magic, you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this is\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep. It should be able to hold about a thousand potions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat. Thanks, Licorice.\u201d</p><br/><p>A pouch this size was also easy to carry around. I happily took the pouch and began to move items from the inventory. At that moment, Licorice, who was watching me fixedly, asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, will we be fine on our own?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Okay, I trust Dear Husband.\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice then went back to hugging my back. I was fairly used to it by now, but it was impossible to resist Licorice\u2019s natural fragrance. My heart was beating faster.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is nice. I wish I can stay like this without having to do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to, one day.\u201d</p><br/><p>I moved the remaining two Elixirs from my inventory and murmured.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, I could feel that we had entered the invaders\u2019 territory. My strength fell slightly, and I couldn\u2019t open my inventory when I tried. Thanks to Lin\u2019s bracelet, I didn\u2019t feel too weak. It was really a supreme treasure. No, it was part of my body now.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, are you okay!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos shouted with his voice still shaking, and I replied nonchalantly. If Ellos was fine, everyone else would be fine too.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll pass over their castle soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll have to prepare a gift.\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with my words, Licorice immediately began to chant. I also summoned two elementals and put them on standby. I looked down on the land from Lotte\u2019s back. According to Ellos, the invaders were humans who called themselves invaders.</p><br/><p>Because of their appearances which were identical to Edias continent\u2019s inhabitants\u2019, no one believed they were invaders when they first revealed themselves. Apparently, everyone thought they were from foreign lands. But when more and more invaders revealed themselves in battles against Edias continent\u2019s people, and invaders who had infiltrated the continent made great achievements politically, people finally caught on. When Edias continent\u2019s people found out, several countries had already had their societal values flipped by the invaders. Their methods were truly worthy of the name \u2018invader\u2019.</p><br/><p>The invaders were specialized in magic, and many apparently wielded powerful magical tools. This was also the reason we didn\u2019t fly too high. Each castle apparently had huge magical tools that shot down flying entities above a certain altitude. They were more or less identical to antiaircraft missiles.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>The first thing I sensed was cannons installed on the castle\u2019s walls. Even though no one was operating them, over two hundred cannons all turned towards us and shot magic bullets. They were weaker than antiaircraft missiles, but they were more than enough to turn a city into a beehive.</p><br/><p>[Eit!]</p><br/><p>Before anyone else did anything, Ruyue made a cute shout and spread her arms out. A giant transparent ice barrier appeared under us and easily blocked all the magic bullets. The ice barrier then shattered and fell. No, Ruyue had done it on purpose.</p><br/><p>[Crush them!]</p><br/><p>Ruyue\u2019s voice strengthened the falling ice shards, and they ravaged the castle walls like a storm. The ice storm continued until about half of the cannons were broken or buried. At the same time, a loud siren rang out. Just when I was wondering whether they were having a defense training, thousands of people suddenly shot up from the castle.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnemies!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat squad are they from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Leave one alive and kill the rest of them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re only two of them\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>They really didn\u2019t look that different than Paul, Ellos, or the soldiers and knights I\u2019ve seen. I hesitated for a split second, but soon realized that they were all wearing something.</p><br/><p>It looked like blown-up muscles, and artificial mana circuits ran around them. If I didn\u2019t recognize them, I would bring shame to the Power Basilisk that gave me my Evil Eyes. Right, what they were wearing were powered suits. Plus, I could feel a strong scent of mana from their bodies. There were this many powerful people in a single castle\u2026 I wondered how people of Edias continent survived until now.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, just kill them all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, since they were aiming for our lives, I couldn\u2019t be merciful.</p><br/><p>[I can kill them?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019ll be hard in this form, so I\u2019ll materialize!]</p><br/><p>Ruyue spun in a circle and materialized into a mature beastgirl form. The enemies looked surprised, but they soon shot magic attacks towards us.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, their mana is different than ours! They can absorb our mana and analyze them, and grow resistant to our attacks!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, are those guys Book Walkers\u2019 descendants?\u201d</p><br/><p>All the invaders I met in foreign worlds had strange abilities. Dealing with Earth\u2019s two worlds\u2019 enemies was annoying, but it seemed other worlds didn\u2019t have it much better.</p><br/><p>\u201cEllos, they can\u2019t share the mana they collected with each other, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, no, nothing like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, you heard that, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go first!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the enemies\u2019 attacks reached Ruyue, Licorice shot the magic she had prepared. Huge flames erupted and ravaged the invaders\u2019 front lines.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have a powerful magician!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, such a large mana in just an instant!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCounterattack!\u201d</p><br/><p>In truth, she just had it prepared.</p><br/><p>Following Licorice, Ruyue reached out with her hand and blocked all the magic attacks.</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t like their magic power. It\u2019s not pure.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt must be their racial trait. Wipe them!\u201d</p><br/><p>As if she was waiting for these words, Ruyue kicked off the air. From her hands, white large ice claws rose up and glistened against the sunlight threateningly. The enemies seemed to have expected Ruyue to close range fight, as they fluidly changed their formation. Ones wearing full-body powered suits then came up front.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re advance guards of the continent\u2019s allied force! Don\u2019t let them enter the castle! Kill them here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome at me, little gi\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ruyue\u2019s claws quickly decapitated them.</p><br/><p>\u201cStrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, call for reinforcements!\u201d</p><br/><p>If reinforcements came, it would become more annoying. I held up my crossbow and sniped the ones who left formation to call for reinforcements. With the power of Lightning God, each crossbow bolt pierced the enemies as miniature lightning bolts. My crossbow, Perfecter Hunter, could consecutively shoot hundreds of bolts. After killing the one who left to call reinforcements, I began to snipe the supporting troops in the back. Because of how much they resembled humans, I couldn\u2019t help the ill-feeling I got whenever I killed one.</p><br/><p>I murmured shortly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least I\u2019m getting used to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can use crossbows too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust as a spare.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA spare? With this destructive power\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos murmured with a dumbfounded face. All the while, the number of invaders was decreasing. The bodies of the deceased fell from the sky and into the castle. These men probably had families and friends to protect too.</p><br/><p>However, co-existence was impossible. We had to kill them, and they had to kill us. The only thing we needed from them was knowing their combat capabilities and weaknesses.</p><br/><p>Even so, it felt like I was the one invading them. With how easy this fight was, I wasn\u2019t gaining anything from it either. I was only wasting time and feeling uncomfortable. I shouldn\u2019t have listened to Ellos and gotten scared of these antiaircraft missiles.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just raise our altitude. We don\u2019t have time to waste like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut their magical tool is frightening. No matter how high we fly, it\u2019ll reach us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can just outspeed it. Even if we can\u2019t, there are other ways to block it. Licorice, help us clean this place up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The magic Licorice prepared wasn\u2019t just the flame magic. When she reached out with her hands, strangely white clouds rose up from her arms and swept over the enemies. Soon, they trapped everyone in the area, including Ruyue. Ruyue then released freezing energy at full power.</p><br/><p>[Die!]</p><br/><p>In an instant, the clouds froze with cracking sounds. Ruyue then dematerialized and left the clouds. The giant ice lost its ability to float and began to fall. Licorice smiled proudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s an excellent attack. How is it, Dear Husband?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>I made a wry smile and patted Licorice. Ellos asked a question with a blank expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou.. Just what have you been doing until now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot much, just fighting monsters and evil villains\u2026 I also visited other worlds a few times.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, I didn\u2019t tell him I defeated worlds\u2019 enemies three times. It was Lin who killed one of them, and the other two barely counted as worlds\u2019 enemies. In truth, they were more like the world\u2019s enemy\u2019s underlings. What I told Ellos was more than enough. I could see his eyes shaking severely.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally\u2026 You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Ellos. From now, we\u2019re going higher and speeding up. Let\u2019s reach Peruta Mountain Range in a day!\u201d</p><br/><p>I cut him off and shouted.</p><br/><p>If I let him finish, I felt like it would make me unhappy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

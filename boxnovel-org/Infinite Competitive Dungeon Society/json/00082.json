Under the Two Moons (5)</p><br/><p>\u2018MT aren\u2019t all that special!\u2019 That was what I felt. I just listened to some bored professors talk and the 400 or so people were split into 20 groups. These groups were called classes, and it seemed these classes were formed at the freshman opening party.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you know about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn, to think a community like this was formed from the start of school\u2026 Watching the people separate into their classes, we looked pitiful. Of course, we weren\u2019t the only ones who didn\u2019t go to the freshman opening party, so with the help of our sunbaes, we were able to join a class. Of the twenty classes, Su Ye-Eun and I were in the same class.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hehe, we\u2019re in the same class.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Kang Shin is in this class.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Su Ye-Eun followed him even here.\u201d</p><br/><p>We then grilled some meat and watched the talent show that others in our class prepared. I, of course, kept circulating Peruta Circuit, and realized that I wasn\u2019t fit for the campus life. Twenty people fiddling around with just two grills irritated me, and watching the people\u2019s amateurish dances made me want to trip them with my feet.</p><br/><p>After that, people went to the rooms assigned to their classes for drinks. People from other rooms sometimes barged in for drinking games, but I got tired of it all in exactly 17 minutes. I didn\u2019t understand why they needed to play a game to drink alcohol. If they wanted to chug it that badly, that should just drink it by the bottle!</p><br/><p>As expected, college social life didn\u2019t really fit me. Although there must be more to it than just this, I had a strong feeling that whatever I was missing out on wasn\u2019t right for me anyways.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext time, I won\u2019t come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy!? Let\u2019s go to an MT with just our class. It\u2019ll be fun!\u201d</p><br/><p>A girl drinking nearby asserted as she approached me. Class MT? I looked around at the 18 people besides Su Ye-Eun and me. There were two Chinese international students. Both were male, and were talking to girls with rather obvious intentions. Su Ye-Eun then screamed and hid behind my back, making them glare at me.</p><br/><p>Other than them, there was a male and female student who looked awkward around each other as if they just broke up, group of guys that were planning on going to other rooms to pick up girls, and girls that strangely liked to give me more drinks. Wondering if they knew my identity and were trying to threaten me, I became nervous. Going to another MT with these people? I would rather die.</p><br/><p>After losing a few rounds of the drink games and drinking the special penalty drink, Su Ye-Eun stuck herself on my back with a frown. Of course, I had to take more guys\u2019 glares because of it. Even though Su Ye-Eun covered herself with her hoody, it seemed people had found out how pretty she was.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, yeah\u2026 Ina.\u201d</p><br/><p>Barely remembering the name of the girl that called out to me, we exchanged drinks. After Su Ye-Eun became too intoxicated to continue, the drinking game stopped, and everyone sat in a large circle and began talking about interesting things that had happened over the semester, like general gossip or stories with famous Guardian or Freedom Wing members.</p><br/><p>Young and good-looking Guardian and Freedom Wing members became famous through appearances on TV networks, regardless of their abilities. It was the governments\u2019 attempt to make the citizens feel familiar toward the Awakened. I suspected that the government would eventually have TV shows where Awakened hunted monsters.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really not going out with Ye-Eun?\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl pointed at Su Ye-Eun stuck to my back. Like a sloth, she had her arms on my back and was dozing off. She really didn\u2019t know shame.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. We\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Ye-Eun likes you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe just doesn\u2019t have the courage to make friends other than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not just that \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl sighed and looked at Su Ye-Eun with a look of pity. The girl, who I only knew as Ina, then asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cS-So\u2026 you don\u2019t have a girlfriend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOooh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, go!\u201d</p><br/><p>The girls around me got louder. Peika and Ruyue, who each sat on my shoulder, made growling noises. Thinking that this drinking party would continue for a while, I unsummoned them. Then, I answered her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOooooh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe says he doesn\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>While others were talking excitedly, I suddenly smelled something strange. Something foul. I put my nose to the drink in my hand. It was a perfectly normal whiskey. Then where was the smell coming from? It smelled a bit like iron. I was definitely familiar with it. This was\u2026</p><br/><p>The smell of blood.</p><br/><p>I slowly stood up. The others looked at me, but I didn\u2019t care. Su Ye-Eun, who also got up, rubbed her sleepy eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, what\u2019s wrong, Shin? Am I home?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I be in your home? If you\u2019re awake, go wash your face.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Su Ye-Eun didn\u2019t want to separate from me, I carried her on my back as I walked toward the windows and opened one. The outside was silent and still. No, the silence was immediately broken by the smell of chemicals as a small firework went up into the sky. It seemed people from other classes were setting fireworks. Regardless, I knew that a monster had not appeared outside. Was I mistaken?</p><br/><p>Then, the door opened. When I turned around, there was someone completely unexpected standing there. It was the French international student and a few of the male students that followed her around.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuk, it\u2019s Chloe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Chloe Blanc.\u201d</p><br/><p>The guys that had been planning to go to other rooms stopped and quietly sat back down. The girl called Chloe Blanc then walked into the room with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe guys in my room already passed out. Do you guys mind if I join you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her Korean was extremely fluent. Of course, no one declined and Chloe Blanc naturally joined us.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Su Ye-Eun began to shake and whispered in my ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I don\u2019t like her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow rude. We haven\u2019t even met before. Besides, you shouldn\u2019t say that while you\u2019re hogging such a hot guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>She sure had good hearing. Su Ye-Eun was startled and stuck even closer to me. The guys started to complain and Blanc shrugged her shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Chloe Blanc. What are your names?\u201d</p><br/><p>The people in the room took turns introducing themselves. After waiting for them to finish, Blanc gave me a glance. I answered her shortly.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin! What a cool name. It matches your handsome face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can say the same about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmpty words, but I\u2019ll gladly take them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Drinks went back and forth again. Just her presence seemed to be sweetening up the atmosphere. The guys that were eyeing Su Ye-Eun changed their attentions to Chloe Blanc, making it easier for me. However, because her gaze was fixed on me, I felt a bit uncomfortable. The other girls also found it irritating.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe has tons of other guys. Why\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArgh, annoying.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed word had gone around that she was in this room as a few more guys came in. Because there was a limit to how many people we could fit, we had to turn them down. Although they brought up wanting to change members, no one accepted. I, on the other hand, wanted to get some fresh air. When I got up, Chloe Blanc suddenly stopped me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going, Shin? Take me with you. I want to talk to you more.\u201d</p><br/><p>I sat back down. The gazes from the other students became more hostile. What did this French international student want from me? As I wondered, Su Ye-Eun\u2019s shaking got worse. After a few more drinks were exchanged, I finally asked her boldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cChloe Blanc, what\u2019s your objective?\u201d</p><br/><p>She hesitated slightly, then looked around the room. Following her eyes, I also looked around the room. Most of the students were lying on the floor, or had hazy eyes. Almost as if they were zombies. Almost as if someone made them like that.</p><br/><p>She honestly replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to kill you and take your vital energy, Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>She closed her eyes then opened them again. Vertical pupils that appeared were showing that she wasn\u2019t human.</p><br/><p>Shit! I knew she had been planning something, but I didn\u2019t think she was a monster! Su Ye-Eun pulled on me stronger. Realizing what was in front of her was a monster, Su Ye-Eun had activated her super vibration mode.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t run. Do you think I was just drinking here for fun? I already captured everyone in this room.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Chloe Blanc gracefully raised her hand. One of the girls looking hazy naturally brought a cup to her hand. She did it respectfully, with both her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for you too, Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>She smiled charmingly. I heard the sound of clothes ripping as a pair of black wings shot out from her back. They looked like enlarged bat wings. She then opened her mouth as she let out golden light from her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll introduce myself again. My name isn\u2019t Chloe Blanc, though I did come from the country you humans call France. I\u2019m \u2018Blood Succubus,\u2019 the owner of the dungeon that appeared in France.</p><br/><p>[An Event Raid has broken out! B-rank 20-man Raid, \u2018Blood Succubus.\u2019 Because you were at the location of the raid boss, you will be forced to participate.]</p><br/><p>[You hold the priority for the Event Raid. Unless you want to reveal its existence, other dungeon explorers will not be notified until 1 hour later!]</p><br/><p>I gritted my teeth. For some reason, she looked incredibly charming. Succubus. A monster said to appear in men\u2019s dreams and devour their vital energy. The succubus in front of me had the terrifying ability to charm both men and women in reality.</p><br/><p>Although she was only a B-rank 20-man raid boss, her special ability was undoubtedly frightening. I was trapped in her status effect. Before it was too late, I had to use Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, I already used it\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>I had already used Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry in my battle against Dullahan this morning. Not only that, but I had also used Dark Thunder Explosion, Dragon Skin, and Diehard! If I couldn\u2019t solve my status effect, I could really die!</p><br/><p>I had to escape. That was the only way I could live! I tried to activate Return, but it didn\u2019t work. My instincts were refusing to let me leave. I did not want to separate from her. I did not want to be far away from her. Even though I knew I would die! With the same reasoning, I could not let the other explorers know. Return, Elemental Summoning, Deific Manifestation, and even going into the dungeon, her charm was strong enough to prevent me from doing anything.</p><br/><p>Gritting my teeth, I asked while I could still talk freely.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrance\u2019s Gate should have disappeared!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, but I wonder why? When I woke up, I was in Paris. Unfortunately, a scary oldie named Michelle kept chasing me, so I had to run. I managed to reach Charles De Gaulle Airport and sneaked onto a plane. It turned out that it was going to Seoul. Then, when I was wandering aimlessly, I met Chloe. She gave me her knowledge, body, and even her existence. She was such a good kid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Increased chance of an Event Raid happening where Event Dungeons disappeared. I finally understood what it meant.</p><br/><p>Currently, the world was full of bosses that had escaped their dungeons when Event Dungeons disappeared! It was just that their characteristics determined whether Event Raids broke out immediately or they hid themselves among humans, like the Blood Succubus I was looking at.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were a monster!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, monster, how rude. Look at me, aren\u2019t I beautiful? Which part of me looks like a monster?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe part\u2026 kuk\u2026 where you killed humans. You already killed today too, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? But humans kill other humans too. You shouldn\u2019t call me a monster because of it. What a mannerless man. But you aren\u2019t wrong. You see, I already took care of five rooms. After all, today will be my last day at this college. I wanted to consume as much vital energy as possible tonight. In truth, you\u2019re tonight\u2019s main dish.\u201d</p><br/><p>She stood up. Throwing the glass cup and shattering it, she slowly walked towards me. Her long, slit pupils shined with evil and charm.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe pure and boundless mana you have, it\u2019s too tempting. Did you know, I\u2019m the one who planned this MT.\u201d</p><br/><p>When my eyes met hers, I could not move at all. Without Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry, I was powerless against status effects. I should have realized it sooner, so that I could have planned for it! I had relied too much on the Floor Master skills, and this was the result. I was too ashamed of myself.</p><br/><p>It was then that I realized Su Ye-Eun\u2019s trembling had stopped. She was now murmuring to herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m s-scared\u2026 but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou stay still. I\u2019ll eat you too, after I\u2019m done with Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-If I don\u2019t do it\u2026 I\u2019ll die\u2026 Shin will\u2026 die\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>To protect Su Ye-Eun, I frantically tried to think of a solution. How could I escape this charm? If I could snap out of it for just a moment, I could rip that woman to shreds!</p><br/><p>However, white noise kept jamming my head. An irresistible attraction to her enveloped me. Any methods that I could use to separate from her, I myself was rejecting it.</p><br/><p>Right, she was my everything. Separating from her would have little meaning. If she wanted, I could even give my life, so why should I resist?</p><br/><p>I smiled. Blood Succubus also smiled. Her eyes opened wide as they let out a radiant golden light. I felt like forgetting myself and sinking into them.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Su Ye-Eun stepped in front of me and raised her trembling hands. She even took off her hoody, which I had never seen her without. Her long, beautiful, night-black hair fluttered like water.</p><br/><p>Then, the Blood Succubus\u2019s left eye was ripped out.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

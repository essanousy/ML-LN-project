The Third Explorer (5)</p><br/><p>Immediately afterward, I headed to the guild house with Ludia. In the hall, I met Shuna for the first time in quite a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Crown Prince-nim, Ludia! H-Hello!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Miss Shuna.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can just call me Shuna. You don\u2019t have to be so formal! C-Can I also say Shin-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want me to stop being formal, but you want to address me so respectfully!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuna was hard to understand. However, since she was cute, it was pleasant talking to her. She was more cute, rather than beautiful.. She looked good with Ludia, who exuded a more noble and mature aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Shuna.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Shin-nim! Kyaa, I called him by his name!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was surprised by how happy she was, but I didn\u2019t say anything as my instincts were warning me to not question it. More specifically, I had a feeling that Ludia might kill Shuna.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must have been surprised because the guild house suddenly moved. Can we still get to the Residential Area?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! We can go to the First Dungeon\u2019s Residential Area just like before! Also\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuna stretched her arms out to the side and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can also go to the Second, Third, and Fourth Dungeon\u2019s Residential Areas!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, of course, it's only the Residential Areas, not the dungeons themselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was confused for a moment but I soon understood. I knew this place\u2019s affiliation changed to Beyond, but I didn\u2019t think it would let me go other dungeons\u2019 Residential Areas. Eh? Hold on, does that mean\u2026</p><br/><p>An absurd thought crossed my mind, and I was then shocked that it wasn\u2019t as absurd as I initially thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid this guild\u2026 transcend the First Dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does that mean, Shin-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It means we might get some new members, Shuna.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuna clapped in response, but Ludia didn\u2019t look so happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy dream of a newlywed\u2019s home\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can hear you. And that\u2019s not it.\u201d</p><br/><p>To be honest, I wanted to explore Beyond\u2019s Residential Area, but it was more important to confirm whether my conjecture was right. I pulled up my friend list and immediately took action.</p><br/><p>As a result, in less than 20 minutes, a few people gathered at our guild house.</p><br/><p>\u201cOoh, is this the first present my son is giving me!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, father. This is my mansion. I won\u2019t be giving it to you, so stop dreaming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing. I can really enter\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, this is Shin-nim\u2019s mansion? How cool!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, how did you climb the dungeon to be able to afford a mansion like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice now that we\u2019re all here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Marianne\u2019s Garden became noisy. Shuna became flustered seeing them for the first time and hid behind my back, while Ludia linked her arm with mine and frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you guys know, this is my friend Ludia. The pretty, pink haired girl is Shuna, Ludia\u2019s friend. They\u2019re both guild members.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Hwaya Mastiford.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2026 Hello!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuna easily fell for Hwaya\u2019s charm and sociability. With Hwaya serving as the mediator, the awkwardness quickly disappeared and Shuna learned to talk with others. However, Ludia seemed unhappy for some reason and continued to stay by my side.</p><br/><p>Of course, there was a reason I called them over. It was impossible before, but it was possible now. It was to create a guild that transcended the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Dungeons. Since they all wanted to join a guild, things went smoothly. Other than me, only Hwaya owned a residence. Since she adamantly said she wanted to join my guild, there was no problem whatsoever.</p><br/><p>It felt like it was just yesterday that she said she wanted to make her own organization, but now she was acknowledging me as the guild master. It was the same for Sumire, who happily joined my guild. That said, a lot had changed since the first time the communication channel opened.</p><br/><p>Of course, I had changed a lot too. Although I thought it wasn\u2019t necessary to form a group, after partying with Hwaya a couple times, I had changed my mind. I had created the guild on my own accord and invited others since I became a Beyond explorer, but even if it was Hwaya standing in my position, I would have happily joined her guild.</p><br/><p>The biggest reason I refused her offer back then was that I couldn\u2019t trust her. Half a year had passed since then, and things were a bit different. I trusted Hwaya and I trusted Sumire. It was the same for Walker, who was tied by a contract. We were stronger together, and as dungeon explorers, we could trust each other. The guild would only bind us together more.</p><br/><p>[Guild \u2018Revival\u2019 became D rank! When challenging Event Dungeons or Event Raids, when 5 or more guild members are present, all guild members\u2019 abilities will be increased by 5%!]</p><br/><p>[Guild members: Kang Shin (Guild Master, First \u2013 Gold &amp; Beyond), Kang Yungoong (First \u2013 Gold), Su Ye-Eun (First \u2013 Gold), Palludia Gren Ehuir (First \u2013 Silver), Shuna Aren Lihita (First \u2013 Silver), Hwaya Eleni Mastiford (Second \u2013 Gold), Minami Violet Sumire (Second \u2013 Gold), Edward Walker (Third \u2013 Gold). Total: 8]</p><br/><p>Now, it was more like a guild. Seeing the list of guild members, I smiled. Walker had also broken through the 50th floor. With this, couldn\u2019t we be called elites? Plus, I liked their our abilities increased when 5 or more of us were together. Event Dungeons and Event Raids were on Earth as well. Together, our chance of survival would increase. I wish Loretta would have told me about this sooner!</p><br/><p>\u201cOoh, when my vitality hits zero, is this where I\u2019ll come back to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow nice. Shin, you\u2019ll prepare a room for me next to yours, right\u2026? Huhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I call the other side!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, I\u2019m going to live in Shin\u2019s room!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs the guild master, I\u2019m claiming an entire hallway to myself, so stop dreaming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ignoring the girls\u2019 complaints, I assigned them their rooms. When I did, keys were given to them, binding the rooms to them entirely. It was the feature of a guild house. Since the mansion had over 100 rooms, giving private rooms to the guild members wouldn\u2019t have any problems.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, Kang Shin. What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, it\u2019s just a Giant Iron Boar and a Flame Drake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re using those precious things as decorations\u2026? You\u2019re as amazing as always.\u201d</p><br/><p>While everyone was focused on the inside of the mansion, Walker was looking at the garden. The Giant Iron Boar was now 7, 8 meters, making it awkward to even call it \u2018giant.\u2019 The Flame Drake corpse was also shrinking. It wasn\u2019t that mana was leaving the corpses. Now that I could better detect mana, I could clearly feel it. They were being compressed.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know what they were working so hard for even as corpses. I just knew that Marianne\u2019s Garden wasn\u2019t a normal space. Since it looked like they were making themselves more expensive, I decided to just let them be.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, there\u2019s something we need to do first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although everyone looked like they wanted to explore the mansion more, I gathered them together.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to find out what\u2019s outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMonsters?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMonsters can\u2019t appear in the Residential Area. But since Ludia said she felt a strange presence, there might be something else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t scare me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya grabbed onto my sleeve as she said that. Thinking back to the time she was scared by the spiders, it seemed she was rather weak hearted. Ludia looked mad when she saw Hwaya, but she soon calmed down. You\u2019ve improved, Ludia!</p><br/><p>However, feeling my body getting heavier, I looked back. Ye-Eun and Shuna were also grabbing onto me. I smiled at them kindly and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you, get off of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>We left the garden. It was truly dark. Because of the thick fog, we couldn\u2019t see far ahead either. However, when we walked forward, the fog disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to split up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s split into two teams. Contact us periodically or if you find anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>I went to the right with Minami, Ludia, and Walker. I dispersed my mana as far as I could to increase my detection range, when Minami asked me.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, you just expanded your aura outward, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. By dispersing my mana, I can expand my senses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, amazing\u2026 If it\u2019s okay, can you teach me how?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure. We\u2019re both guild members, so I can teach you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you! Ah, and you don\u2019t have to be formal! You can call me Sumire too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO-Okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that I thought about it, I had not talked to Minami, or rather, Sumire, much. When we met in Yeungdeungpo to clear the Event Dungeon, she seemed impressed by my strength and continued to address me with \u2018nim\u2019 in respect.</p><br/><p>I had seen sparkling eyes like hers often. The martial artists, who respected father, often had such eyes. Considering her strength and attitude towards martial arts, she might be a martial artist herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you learned martial arts from Yungoon ajusshi, but you\u2019re stronger than him now, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m a step behind father in terms of the depth in martial arts, but overall\u2026 I should be stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew it\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Burdensome. Sumire\u2019s sparkling eyes and Ludia hugging my arm like she wanted to break it were burdensome!</p><br/><p>Wait, hold on.</p><br/><p>\u201cWalker, did you feel that?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI did. It looks like a barrier of some sort.\u201d</p><br/><p>I expanded my senses, but they were cut off like they collided into something. I dispersed my mana in all directions, checking where my senses were cut off and how far they could reach. The fog in the area my senses reached also disappeared. The ground revealed a stone floor, while a huge wall stood in the distance. Beyond it, I saw a medieval castle similar to my own mansion. After that, my mana was cut off completely.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing\u2026! You\u2019re really amazing, Shin-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sumire complimented me and Ludia got happy in my place. I didn\u2019t know why.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think that is? A new dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are Event Dungeons in Residential Areas too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I feel like that\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Sumire and Ludia thought the castle could be an Event Dungeon. However, after observing the outline of the castle walls, Walker proposed.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, Kang Shin. Isn\u2019t that a mansion like yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>Almost as if to prove that his conjecture was right, a voice rang in my ear. It was the voice of a beautiful, young man. I realized after I heard the voice. It was coming from Beyond\u2019s communication channel!</p><br/><p>[Go back, Third Explorer. I have no intention of dealing with you.]</p><br/><p>[You are\u2026 Excuse me. I just came here, so I was exploring the Residential Area with my companions.]</p><br/><p>Perhaps interested in what I said, he became silent for a moment. Just when I thought he no longer wanted to talk, his voice rang out again.</p><br/><p>[\u2026 A guild master, I see. I was once also interested in such childish games. In any case, go back. What you desire isn\u2019t here. Go west. You\u2019ll find some treasures there.]</p><br/><p>[Thank you for telling me. We\u2019ll be off then.]</p><br/><p>[Wait. You must have been acknowledged by an administrative guild master\u2026. Who is it?]</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s Fairy Garden\u2019s master, Loretta.]</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Is that so\u2026]</p><br/><p>His silence continued. I sensed something from his silence. Could it be that he is\u2026?</p><br/><p>[She is\u2026 No.]</p><br/><p>With that, I was certain.</p><br/><p>[No, it\u2019s nothing. Second Explorer is also listening. It\u2019s fine, go back.]</p><br/><p>Feeling strange, I turned back. He was my senior as he entered Beyond before me. Although he sounded young, he must have lived for much longer than me. Perhaps, he was Loretta\u2019s\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t understand why I\u2019m feeling so weird...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did you use your mana too much? Are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No, I\u2019m fine. Let\u2019s go. That was another explorer\u2019s house. He said there\u2019s something to the west, so let\u2019s go there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow kind of him to tell us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sumire, Ludia, and Walker followed after me. I still felt weird. Loretta must have known, right? Then why didn\u2019t she tell me about it? No, it was probably me that was weird. There was no doubt about it. Whether Loretta\u2019s first love was here or not, it had nothing to do with me.</p><br/><p>After 5 minutes, we got a report from the team that went the other way that they found something.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Guild Revival has absorbed Earth\u2019s explorers! This is the start of a legend!</p><br/><p>What did the other team find!? Find out next chapter!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>The author refers to the guild as \u201cGuild Revival\u201d instead of \u201cRevival\u201d or \u201cThe guild, Revival,...\u201d I thought of changing it to just Revival, but I decided to just go with Guild Revival (as it comes up often and seems to be a better fit). Basically just saying Revival loses the \u201cguild\u201d aspect (the readers know it\u2019s a guild, but people listening don\u2019t). Saying \u201cThe guild, Revival,...\u201d is slightly inaccurate, and also has way too many commas (the author already has a billion clauses and whatnot).</p><br/>\n</div>"}

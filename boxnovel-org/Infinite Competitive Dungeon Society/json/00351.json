The one who had the ability to ignore the dungeon\u2019s power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said the next Demon Army Commander I would fight would be a strengthened version of Lespina.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I did. But that was my mistake. I realized it after I obtained this woman\u2019s memories. That woman was an Irregular among Irregulars. If this Sherafina woman knew such an odd thing would be born, she would never have given information to the Demon Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lespina\u2019s power was unique even among the countless demons that ever existed. The Demon Lord seemed to have vowed to birth more demons like her, but in the end, no demon like her appeared again. Even the Demon Lord was toyed by Sherafina\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>But after subjugating Lespina, there was something I always considered strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore I defeated Lespina, I met Sherafina for the first time. At that time, Sherafina told me about two things. First, the danger of demons. Second, Ciara Kenex, to take you in. \u2026 That was a magic spell to force someone to act a certain way\u2026 a mental suggestion, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Because Hero-nim already had Absolute Soul at the time, it was impossible to instill a mental suggestion without Absolute Soul activating unless she met Hero-nim face to face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, so she did the same to Loretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>I remembered thinking Loretta was acting strangely by suddenly bringing me to meet the Dungeon Lord.</p><br/><p>That was the only time Sherafina met with me directly. At the time, I didn\u2019t think it was strange, but thinking about it now, it was too unnatural.</p><br/><p>If she wanted to tell me something, she could have done so through the dungeon\u2019s messaging system. If she wanted to stay in her automated message-like character, she could have relayed her message to Loretta.</p><br/><p>Moreover, if Sherafina wanted to eventually obtain my power, it was better to not show herself in front of me until the time arrived. Because I met her before, I was able to deal with her mana much easily.</p><br/><p>There was no way Sherafina didn\u2019t know this. It was just that she had to see me at the time to instill a mental suggestion.</p><br/><p>The way she achieved this was simple. She put in a mental suggestion to Loretta to bring me to her. After meeting me in person, she successfully put in a mental suggestion to me. It would have been impossible had I mastered Absolute Soul, but I had not completely adapted to Absolute Soul at the time. That was why I fell for her mental suggestion.</p><br/><p>What happened afterward, I remembered clearly. Even though I didn\u2019t want to meet Ciara again, I decided to pull her in without much thought. Most importantly, I killed any demon I came across mercilessly and ruthlessly.</p><br/><p>Of course, I never hesitated about killing an enemy. But at the time, it was almost as if I was blinded by the thought of killing Lespina. I massacred demons without caring for my own safety or thinking straight.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why? You should know since you absorbed Sherafina. Why did she need to go so far as to meet me to put in a mental suggestion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey were important to her. She was confident in being able to absorb me and feared that female demon\u2019s power. Also\u2026 That woman, Lespina, knew part of the truth. She knew about the connection between the Demon Lord and Sherafina, Though, she ended up dying by Hero-nim\u2019s hands without being able to do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I thought, Ciara didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>There should have been one more thing Sherafina was worried about. Me finding out that she was the one giving information to the Demon Lord, that she was the hidden ruler behind the monsters\u2019 continent. Ciara said Lespina died without being able to do anything, but the reality was a bit different.</p><br/><p>Right, that was when I became certain that Sherafina was my enemy. The moment Lespina fell under the effect of Lilith\u2019s Temptation and became my subordinate, the mental suggestion Sherafina left in my head disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Dungeon Lord met with the Demon Lord.\u2019</p><br/><p>That was what Lespina said as she was burning to death. </p><br/><p>\u201cBut Hero-nim, why are you asking about her now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ciara didn\u2019t know what Lespina told me. There was only one reason.</p><br/><p>Her power wasn\u2019t pure.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to make up my mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMake up your mind?\u201d</p><br/><p>With a nod, I reached my hand out to the air. In an instant, more than half of the mana inside me became concentrated in my hand. It was a technique that I could do, a miraculous ability that is only granted to me.</p><br/><p>Ciara quickly interfered with her mana, but I roused Extort\u2019s power to the maximum and stole some of its power. The reason I hadn\u2019t used Extort until now was for this moment. No matter how overbearing Sherafina\u2019s mana might be, I wouldn\u2019t lose to her so easily, especially with a trump card or two in my pocket.</p><br/><p>Ciara looked astonished.</p><br/><p>\u201cHero-nim, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a magic called Dimensional Travel.\u201d</p><br/><p>A magic I learned in Loretta\u2019s cabin, where neither Sherafina\u2019s nor Ciara\u2019s magic could reach. This magic lets me travel through dimensions to other worlds without the dungeon\u2019s support. Looking noticeably shocked, Ciara shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHero-nim, don\u2019t tell me\u2026 Are you trying to leave this place? I apologize, but I cannot let that happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought about that too. It should be possible if I use Hermes\u2019 power, but I decided otherwise.\u201d</p><br/><p>I hesitated between two choices. One was to escape first and make a surprise attack later. The other was ending it all here and now.</p><br/><p>After analyzing her ability\u2026 No, just based off of what Ciara said, if I escape, Ciara would go back to Earth. That would only make her stronger.</p><br/><p>If I were to fight Ciara here, it would be no different than fighting Sherafina, and I would be able to use everything I prepared against Sherafina on Ciara. Since Ciara couldn\u2019t use her Evil Eyes\u2019 ability, the outcome was already decided.</p><br/><p>Through the dimensional gate that opened up, I threw in a single coin. Immediately, Ciara\u2019s irresistible mana swept over the gate, closing it all too easily.</p><br/><p>\u201cHero-nim\u2026 What was that coin for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ciara asked with an expression that seemed to say she couldn\u2019t understand. I answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was a signal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSignal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Ciara tilt her head in a cutesy manner, I drew in the urge to smack her head. For now, I nodded calmly and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you remember when I finished off Lespina?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! I watched all of Hero-nim\u2019s fight with my eyes! Aaah, no matter the situation, Hero-nim was magnificent, glorious! As for that female demon, Hero-nim burned her to death with chaos flames!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, and you know what chaos flame is, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn inextinguishable flame that burns until the target is dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ciara\u2019s eyes lit up. It was as though she forgot about the dimensional gate I just opened.</p><br/><p>This child was really too dangerous. Having an absurd amount of mana and the ability to see the history of the past 4.6 billion years was one thing, but her personality was too twisted.</p><br/><p>\u201cHero-nim used to favor that power in the past! Aah, I still remember how much my heart fluttered when I first saw Hero-nim use that power! My only regret is not having been there to see it in action!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo tell you the truth, there are actually two ways to extinguish those flames. Do you know them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! The first is for the target of the flames to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the second?\u201d</p><br/><p>With an undulation of space, a gate opened up in the air. I didn\u2019t open this gate. It was opened from the other side by the one who received my signal.</p><br/><p>At that instant, Ciara\u2019s expression paled.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hero-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>I spoke with a grin.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for me to extinguish it myself\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>From the gate, a supple bodied woman walked out. Violet hair and light blue skin. Other than the complete white pupils she had that made her eyes frighteningly creepy, she was a rare beauty.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore the target dies.\u201d</p><br/><p>A demon.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I\u2019m glad I made it on time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Lespina. It\u2019s good to see you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too, Master!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cH-How\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the dumbfounded Ciara, I kindly explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cI faked Lespina\u2019s death. To prevent Sherafina from finding out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2026!? No, just where was that woman!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEdias.\u201d</p><br/><p>I spoke briefly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI had the feeling Sherafina was closing in on me and Lespina was also reaching her limit. I released her to a different world so she wouldn\u2019t have to live in hiding. It seems I managed to trick you because of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEdias\u2026 The world\u2019s enemy!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep. She was also a safeguard I prepared for my trip to Edias. Do you really think I would go to a world filled with danger without a safety net? Lespina was my safeguard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mastering Peruta Circuit wasn\u2019t part of my plans. Only a fool would rely on a lucky encounter to save his life. I thoroughly planned for my survival, and that was to bring Lespina along. With Lespina\u2019s power to reject all impure power, I had the confidence to survive in any situation.</p><br/><p>But one unexpected happening after another occurred, and I ended up not using Lespina. But I managed to carry out my second purpose in going to Edias. A place filled with Peruta\u2019s mana, Peruta Mountain Range. There couldn\u2019t have been a better place to hide from Sherafina\u2019s eyes and recover at the same time.</p><br/><p>If not for this, I would have made all of Peruta\u2019s mana in the continent into mine. Why else would I have left behind such valuable mana?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you achieve\u2026 Dimensional Travel?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need two things for Dimensional Travel. First is the spell to cast Dimensional Travel, second is the mana is to use Dimensional Travel.</p><br/><p>I gave Paul all the necessary ingredients.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t just give Paul his world\u2019s power as he went back to the Edias continent. I also placed magical knowledge that would allow Lespina to find my coordinate and the mana she would need to use Dimensional Travel.</p><br/><p>With the previous coin, I sent Lespina the signal, and she managed to find me successfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut how\u2026 Sherafina should have kept a close eye on this man called Paul!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only asked Paul to do one thing. To go to Peruta Mountain Range and make a tomb for Peruta.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was no fool. Why would I explain Paul everything? His task was finished when he went to Peruta Mountain Range, where Lespina was staying. The rest, Lespina could figure out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why Sherafina didn\u2019t find out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHu, huhu\u2026 But a single demon won\u2019t change anything, Hero-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. If I wasn\u2019t sure, I would have taken everyone and escaped.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s little you can do with that demon, Hero-nim. Don\u2019t underestimate the League of my ability. I devoured Sherafina\u2019s power in my powerless state. No matter how much I love Hero-nim, I might get mad if you look down on me too much!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Ciara. If that power was yours, I wouldn\u2019t have been so relaxed. But\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Turning around, I spoke as I shook my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that power isn\u2019t yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>If that power purely belonged to Ciara, she would have known everything in regards to Lespina. If she did, things wouldn\u2019t have come to this.</p><br/><p>She would have done everything she could to prevent Lespina from crossing over to Edias continent, and she would have been hell bent on having Lespina killed. The fact that she failed to do so proved that Ciara\u2019s power was rejected by Lespina\u2019s authority.</p><br/><p>Lespina rejected all impure power. Her power rejected Ciara.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen whose power is it!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ciara shouted. Lespina had already taken action. I transferred the remainder of my mana to Lespina and using my mana, she separated Ciara from all of her powers. This included Sherafina\u2019s power, the League she possessed, and Earth\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>Ciara tried to draw up her mana, but it was futile. Her desperate attempts to resist became laughably sad.</p><br/><p>As I pulled these powers towards me, I became certain. Mm, considering how only Sherafina\u2019s power was being sucked in, it seemed Ciara\u2019s original power really wasn\u2019t mine.</p><br/><p>In that case, there was only one other candidate.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot telling ya.\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking tauntingly, I grabbed Ciara.</p><br/><p>I could finally catch her. With her boundless mana and lofty League disappearing, the Ciara in my hand was no different than an ordinary 13-year-old girl.</p><br/><p>\u201cP-Please save me.\u201d</p><br/><p>She said.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease save me! You were the one who told me about Hero-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt like I knew who she was talking to, but this being didn\u2019t reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cSave me! I need to give Hero-nim his power\u2026 I must! Otherwise, Hero-nim is too pitiful. Hero-nim should be a king that rules over all\u2026 Oh, please!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you like me that much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHero-nim, I\u2019ve been saying it from the beginning! You are the only one for me! From the moment I was born, I knew about Hero-nim and I lived only for Hero-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>She should know what I was about to do to her. Still, Ciara\u2019s eyes were only filled with affection and longing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHero-nim, it\u2019s not too late. Connect all worlds to Earth! Hero-nim will become God, and by your side, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I hate you. I have since the moment I met you, and I still do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHero-nim\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Without hesitating any longer, I tore her in half. Then, with my power of lightning, I incinerated her body without leaving behind a piece.</p><br/><p>\u201cAaah, Master, so cool!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did well too, Lespina. You know what to do now, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lespina placed her hands over my own and began to transfer all of her power to me. Though it was a bit difficult when I had yet to fully absorb Sherafina\u2019s power, I still successfully took in her mana. Lespina\u2019s power was vital for what I wanted to do next.</p><br/><p>My unique power, Sherafina\u2019s power, and now Lespina\u2019s power to reject all impure power. It was incredibly unnatural for these powers to mix. In the first place, it was contradictory for a power to reject impure power to combine with other powers, thereby forming something non-pure.</p><br/><p>But the talent I was born with made this possible. Under my watchful eyes, all three powers fused into one unbelievably smoothly. The inside of my body expanded endlessly, and my mana grew explosively without limit. It was hard to believe that a simple fusion of three powers could result in something like this.</p><br/><p>My appearance also began to change. I grew taller, my skin began to glow, and another golden circle appeared in my eyes. Finally, my halo let out a brilliant light before beginning to change shape.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, it was an honor to serve you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Afterward, Lespina raised her hand and tried to stab her stomach. But looking at her, I reached out and stopped her.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I planned on killing you at first, but you\u2019ve been too helpful. Plus, I don\u2019t feel like killing anyone else right now\u2026 You should continue living by my side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lespina shouted with a touched look. The fact that she was alive and would continue to live went against the creed I lived by until now. But, in a way, this didn\u2019t seem so bad.</p><br/><p>Though it was an act of mercy I made on a whim, thinking about it again, that might have been the final catalyst in making me reach this position.</p><br/><p>The position of godhood.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what will you do now, Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>Though she lost all of her power and became an ordinary demon, Lespina asked with a voice full of energy and happiness. Compared with the moment she submitted to me, her change in attitude was almost a bit unnerving, but I believed this was for the best.</p><br/><p>Reaching out to her with my hand, I filled up her mana and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. There\u2019s definitely a lot for me to do but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Putting the dungeon back in operation, cleaning up Earth, taking care of other worlds\u2026 There was just too much work for me to do.</p><br/><p>But for now.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me sleep a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Master!\u201d</p><br/><p>After sleeping just a little bit, I\u2019ll take care of the rest. Thinking that I snapped my fingers. Looking at the golden bed that appeared in front of me, I furrowed my brows.</p><br/><p>\u201cDortu, try to make it softer.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. Metal is normally hard. It\u2019s definitely not because I hate Master for sleeping with another woman.]</p><br/><p>Well, I won't be sleeping I guess.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

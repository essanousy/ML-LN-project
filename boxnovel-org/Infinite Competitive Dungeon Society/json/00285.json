The Last Member (2)</p><br/><p>I noticed everyone\u2019s gazes on me. They were all relying on me to act. It was a bit troubling that they couldn\u2019t come to their own conclusions, but\u2026 I still voiced my thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can trust Ciara\u2019s ability. The two kings must be in these two dungeons. You all know what kings are, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though she missed her chance to spar with me, Sumire\u2019s eyes were burning with eagerness. Last time, even though she clearly voiced her desire to fight, she couldn\u2019t do so because of her lack of ability. As she was chosen this time as one of the approved members, her eagerness was understandable.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push yourself too much, Sumire. Got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Shin-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t the most trustworthy answer, but there wasn\u2019t much I could do about it. I continued with a slight sense of unease.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen we take care of these two kings, only one king will remain from the original five. It looks like there\u2019s an even stronger one above them, but we\u2019ll still be able to greatly undercut the monsters\u2019 forces. Once we kill the five kings, monsters of the attribute they control will grow weaker, so we have to make sure to hunt them down. We can\u2019t neglect Event Dungeons either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you going to decide on the members?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya immediately asked the tough question. I looked around at Revival\u2019s members. There were some that wanted to sit back. I couldn\u2019t blame them. Those who were present when we fought the Lava King knew the monstrous power these kings possessed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe, Hwaya, Daisy, Father, Ye-Eun, Sumire\u2026 and Ina. Is that okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn! I\u2019ll help Daddy! I don\u2019t want Daddy to get hurt!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right, Ina was never hesitant to participate in fights. Perhaps, she didn\u2019t understand what fear was. If possible, I wanted her to continue that way for all of her life.</p><br/><p>I hugged Ina, who shot her hands up energetically. With an innocent laugh, she rubbed her face against mine. Someone looked at Ina enviously, but I ignored it. I felt like knowing who it was would give me more trouble than it was worth.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe seven of us will go together. Against the kings, we can\u2019t split our forces. We\u2019ll attack the dungeons one by one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, why is it so hard to get acknowledged by my son\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCorpses, corpses, uhuhu. Uhuhuhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>While everyone else seemed full of spirit to fight the kings, Daisy alone laughed somewhat perverted thinking about corpses. I smacked her forehead to snap her out of it, then looked back at everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I need to ask everyone else to do. To be honest, two kings appearing at once is too strange. I feel like there\u2019s more to it than what\u2019s on the surface.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked back at Ciara just in case. She shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, Hero-nim. My ability isn\u2019t complete yet. I can\u2019t read any further into the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. The information you gave is already more than enough. Thanks, Ciara.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Hero-nim\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah shit, I shouldn\u2019t have said that. Ciara\u2019s face reddened and she stepped closer to me. I frowned, thinking I dug my own grave, and pushed Ciara away before continuing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMobilize all of the succubi and let them focus their attention on any changes to Earth. This includes areas currently conquered by monsters. In fact, if it\u2019s necessary, just wipe them out completely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? I thought we were going to take our time reclaiming other regions. The Philippines is still under reconstruction, didn\u2019t Guild Master say we had two years?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ilayda voiced her question. She wasn\u2019t wrong, but things had changed. I told her exactly what Ciara told me.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry if it sounded too rushed, but the two years I talked about was the time we had until the Demon Lord invaded Earth. That\u2019s how much time we thought we had, but it\u2019s different now. There\u2019s less than a year until the Demon Lord\u2019s descent, and it might even be less than three months. We have to act fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the reason their ability to ignore the dungeon\u2019s power?\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded solemnly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just Earth. All worlds related to the dungeon might be facing similar situations. There\u2019s a great change on the horizon, one that will make the simultaneous appearance of two kings pale in comparison. Ilayda, we have to do what we can before things go out of control. You\u2019re with us, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO-Of course! If it\u2019s for you, I\u2019ll do anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>At my serious tone, Ilayda nodded vehemently with a flushed face. While I tilted my head, thinking something was strange, Licorice approached me and whispered in my ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, you\u2019re not controlling your power right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shoot, because I was nervous, I was unknowingly releasing my charm and magic power. Damn, I still lacked training. I tried to fix the situation, but my body wouldn\u2019t listen to me. Ciara\u2019s words seemed to have shocked me more than I thought. Thinking I should quickly leave this place, I took a deep breath and made a final announcement.</p><br/><p>\u201cI said everything I needed to. The six members coming with me should follow me. Everyone else should also immediately set out! Make sure to report on your situation thoroughly, and do not get hurt! Understood?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sounding more like a leader now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA truly fiery development!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo idle talks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChet.\u201d</p><br/><p>We immediately set out. Our first destination was France\u2019s Bordeaux, as there still may be survivors. The seven of us hopped on Hwaya\u2019s private plane.</p><br/><p>As for everyone else, besides Leon who was training with Lin, they were working together in a single group.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, Deific Manifestation. Can everyone use it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSame. True name\u2019s power is also ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about everyone else?\u201d</p><br/><p>Besides Daisy and me, only Hwaya, Ina, and Sumire possessed gods\u2019 true names. Hwaya and Sumire nodded, while Ina tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can use\u2026 one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean your god\u2019s true name has several abilities, and you can only use one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ina seemed happy that I knew exactly what she meant, as she smiled brightly. What an angel.</p><br/><p>How can she get prettier by the day? Even if I search all of the numerous worlds, will I be able to find a worthy boyfriend for her? No, there was no way someone like that existed. It seemed I had to hold onto her for the rest of my life. Huu\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSave it until it\u2019s absolutely necessary, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost there.\u201d</p><br/><p>If we had time, I would have liked to taste Bordeaux\u2019s famous wines. Unfortunately, the gate was in Bordeaux\u2019s sky and we weren\u2019t in any position to leisurely sip on wine.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s in the party?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe dungeon\u2019s power probably won\u2019t work, so have your potions out. If you have Elixirs, make sure to have them ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hopefully, we wouldn\u2019t be in a situation where we needed to use Elixirs, but we had to be prepared against the kings. Even the weakest Hermit King made me nervous, but now we were about to face kings of the same level or even higher level as the Lava King.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeast King\u2019s corpse, give me, yes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, you can take it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWedding gift? Kang Shin, I\u2019m still too young.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think your brain is too young.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the plane came to a stop. I didn\u2019t know how it worked, but I could tell it had all the latest technology. The plane\u2019s door opened, and even as I faced the violent wind, I was completely unfazed as I looked back at the party members.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll jump in. Since we\u2019re in a party, everyone should be moved when I enter the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to go with Daddy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Despite what I said, Ina didn\u2019t want to let go of me. Thankful for how much she thought about me, I patted Ina gently.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, let\u2019s go together.\u201d</p><br/><p>I pecked her cheek and jumped out of the plane with her. Sharana, who I already had summoned, guided us to fall on the gate. As I fell into the black gate letting out ominous energy, I shut my eyes and successfully entered the dungeon.</p><br/><p>However, Ina who was in my arms a moment ago was no longer with me.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What?\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked around flustered. I was undoubtedly in the jungle I saw in the video. Although I didn\u2019t get any messages about having entered an Event Dungeon, I was sure that I was in one.</p><br/><p>But there was no one else here. It wasn\u2019t just Ina. None of the other party members were here. Not even Licorice or Lotte.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt a chill go down my back. In the next moment, a thought flashed through my mind. I was in an area that the dungeon couldn\u2019t designate as an Event Dungeon. It was stupid to think a party formed through the dungeon\u2019s power would function the same way.</p><br/><p>But what about those guys in the video? So many people entered the gate together just fine, but how come I was the only one who ended up this way?</p><br/><p>I tried to open my friend list, but it was futile. That meant I couldn\u2019t send any messages. Neither the guild communication channel or the explorer communication channel opened.</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re finally here?]</p><br/><p>At that moment, a thunderous voice rang out. I turned around. A golden-maned lion, far bigger than the one I saw in the video, was looking down at me. He seemed to have been waiting for my arrival.</p><br/><p>[I finally meet you, Savior Hero.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I broke out in a cold sweat. It was partly because I felt his heavy power, but it was mostly because of the sense of unease in this uncontrollable situation.</p><br/><p>No, calm down. Even if I was alone, I should be able to beat him. I\u2019ve overcome countless life-threatening situations. Even if I lost the dungeon\u2019s power, I should still be fine!</p><br/><p>[In conclusion, Hero-nim cannot use the eye\u2019s power from now on. The Demon Lord will descend before a year passes.]</p><br/><p>At that moment, Ciara\u2019s words popped up in my head. Did she foresee this situation? No, that was impossible. There was no way she would have kept quiet if she saw me in danger. Still, she still should have felt something. No, could it be a different kind of danger than this\u2026!?</p><br/><p>[Are you worrying about them, Hero?]</p><br/><p>The lion talked. Them? His words made me space out. I knew far too well who \u201cthem\u201d referred to.</p><br/><p>Right, why was I worried about myself? I was the strongest person on Earth. Even in this situation, I was confident in being able to defeat the Beast King. But I was thinking in the wrong direction.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s too late, so don\u2019t worry, Hero. This time, all kings have come out.]</p><br/><p>All kings. In other words, the last king was also on Earth.</p><br/><p>In that case, I wasn\u2019t the one trapped here.</p><br/><p>The one trapped was people of Earth, who lost me, their greatest strength.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

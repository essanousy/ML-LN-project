Coming Closer, Going Farther (6)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Crimson Hell was strong enough to give me trouble even after I grew stronger through the Beast King. They appeared from anywhere in the dungeon floor and put in great efforts to try and assimilate me.</p><br/><p>However, I already learned how to fight against them on the 81st floor. Using Death Knight\u2019s skill, Breath of Death, I created chaos flames wrapped in death energy. The moment they touched these flames, they were dyed grey, losing their mana and evaporating.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hate how they\u2019re so quiet.\u201d</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t make any slimy or watery sound. They simply popped out of nowhere, assaulting me. What annoyed me the most was that just being in this place sucked mana out of me. Absolute Soul actively held its defense and protected my mind, but it couldn\u2019t stop them completely. It was a true hell.</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. Reinforcing Master\u2019s equipment.]</p><br/><p>At that moment, Dortu suddenly muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cReinforce?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. Reinforcing all metals.]</p><br/><p>Immediately, Pure Black Desire shone with a faint light. Small symbols appeared on its surface along with tiny bumps. It was the same for Chaotic Spear. The spear became slightly longer and a red symbol was engraved above the spear blade.</p><br/><p>\u201cDortu, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. I did well.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, you did.\u201d</p><br/><p>It felt like he wanted me to compliment him, so I did. I still didn\u2019t know how he strengthened my equipment, but I soon found out.</p><br/><p>First, Pure Black Desire\u2019s defense went up. Not only its physical defense, but also its magical defense and mana resistance. This meant that Crimson Hell was now stealing less of my mana. Wait, strengthening Pure Black Desire? Even though it was already a Legend grade item?</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. Effect is temporary. Dortu can change it permanently by staying in it for a long time.]</p><br/><p>\u201cDortu\u2026 You\u2019re the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chaotic Spear, on the other hand, had its reinforcement focused around its aura. The amount of aura I could draw out using the same amount of mana doubled. Crimson Hell seemed surprised by my sudden change, as they backed off before coming together into a giant wave. These damned cowards!</p><br/><p>[They\u2019re below us too, Master!]</p><br/><p>\u201cSharana! We\u2019re going to break through!\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn, why did I have to run through waves while climbing the dungeon!? With my spear held out front, I activated Wind King\u2019s Rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cSharana!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes, Master!]</p><br/><p>Just by having their names called, my elementals became happy and displayed greater power. Starting from the tip of my spear, a fierce whirlpool covering my entire body rose up. Sharana meticulously and elaborately strengthened this whirlpool, and flames the Chaotic Spear let out with an ominous light decorated the whirlpool.</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaaaaaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>I screamed at the top of my lungs and charged forward into the wave of Crimson Hell!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so cocky when you\u2019re not even the real thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>The wave rolled towards me. After clashing with the flaming whirlpool, most of it evaporated and fell apart as they were dyed grey. Although I could only see the fiercely spinning whirlpool in front of me, the sizzling sound of Crimson Hell put a wry smile on my face.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you suffered this much, you should know you aren\u2019t strong enough!\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, with their mass, it was hard to maintain this whirlpool. But if I stopped, I knew I would only get engulfed. As such, I tightly shut my mouth and charged forward quickly. Absolute Soul, Peruta Circuit, and Dortu and Sharana\u2019s power. This might be the first time I put this much concentration into manipulating so many powers.</p><br/><p>[You cleared the First Dungeon\u2019s 82nd floor. You obtained the qualification to challenge Beyond\u2019s 32nd floor.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained 5 bonus stats.]</p><br/><p>After running with Wind King\u2019s Rage for some incalculable amount of time, I stopped reflexively in response to a familiar message. As the whirlpool surround my body subsided, I could finally see around me once again. Some distance away was a staircase, and closer by was a black shade, the gate leading to Beyond. There was also Loretta, who was staring at me with a surprised face from the Floor Shop\u2019s stall.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, you changed your armor and weapon? Did you go see Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, no, it\u2019s my elemental.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElemental? \u2026 An elemental that can transform a Legend grade weapon and armor? Mmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t think too much of it, but it seemed Loretta thought differently. However, after looking like she was hesitating, she didn\u2019t say anything more about it. Instead, she smiled and changed the subject.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood work. Worlds\u2019 enemies aren\u2019t easy to deal with, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome here, I\u2019ll give you a massage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like you\u2019ll massage me in inappropriate places.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a wimp. Ehehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt like Loretta forgot all about running the Floor Shop, but seeing her face, I couldn\u2019t refuse her.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhuhuhu, I prepared a mattress in case something like this ever happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you touch me in weird places, I\u2019m going straight to Beyond.\u201d</p><br/><p>Contrary to Loretta\u2019s suspicious manner of speech, she really gave a genuine massage. When I lied down on the mattress with my armor and spear back to its bracelet and choker form, she got on top of me and pressed her thumbs down on my sore muscles. An ordinary person would have had his bones shattered, but I was now strong enough to withstand her strength. Every time she pressed her fingers down, a cool breeze seemed to flow into me. I even got these messages.</p><br/><p>[Your magic stat increases by 1.]</p><br/><p>[Your magic stat increases by 2.]</p><br/><p>[Your luck stat increases by 3.]</p><br/><p>[Your constitution stat increases by 2.]</p><br/><p>\u201cit\u2019s a special energy only the Elf Queen can use. I can\u2019t use it very often so you should enjoy it now. So? How is it? Refreshing, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, my stats are increasing permanently\u2026 Isn\u2019t this abusable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Normally, this technique can only be used on an Elf Queen\u2019s spouse, so don\u2019t tell other elves.\u201d</p><br/><p>I grinned and fully relaxed my body for her massage. When I closed my eyes and untensed my body, Loretta laughed as she continued her massage.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh\u2026 Yep, if it\u2019s Shin-nim\u2026 Huhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you say something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said I love Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm\u2026 I love Loretta too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hiing, I didn\u2019t record it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta frowned while she continued to massage me diligently. I also laughed lightly.</p><br/><p>I knew that wasn\u2019t what Loretta initially said. I knew she was still hiding something from me, but I didn\u2019t ask.</p><br/><p>She was an Elf Queen that had lived for over 2000 years. She wasn\u2019t obligated to tell me everything she knew, and even if what she wasn\u2019t telling me was related to me, I knew she had my best interest in mind. This level of trust was already fully ingrained between the two of us.</p><br/><p>A pleasant silence flowed, and soon, we moved on to a different topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid Kain properly enter Shin-nim\u2019s guild?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. He decided to cooperate with me for a common goal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, I thought I knew everything about Shin-nim\u2026 Before I noticed, Shin-nim has been finding out about things even I didn\u2019t know about, and Shin-nim can now easily do things that seemed so hard for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her way of talking sounded like a mother proud of the children she raised. I couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I think having a secret or two can be more charming. I don\u2019t plan on interrogating Shin-nim about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta\u2019s charming too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuu, meanie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta became quiet. I continued the story about Kain.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think Kain might have lingering feelings for Loretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought so. I\u2019m very pretty, you see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow!? What does that mean!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt means I love you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t trick me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta\u2019s acupressure got harder, but I simply laughed. If I hadn\u2019t obtained the Beast King\u2019s power, my bones would have broke undoubtedly.</p><br/><p>[Your charm stat increases by 3.]</p><br/><p>[Your luck stat increases by 3.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, this is enough. Just how much power do you plan on using?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can do it again next time. I have to go now.\u201d</p><br/><p>I got up and stretched. Her massage made me feel refreshed like the time I reformed my body. I lightly patted Loretta who seemed to want more and jumped into Beyond without even wearing my armor.</p><br/><p>Then, in just 30 minutes, I jumped out of the gate. Loretta, who was yawning at the Floor Shop, widened her eyes in surprise. After examining me from head to toe, she called my name with a dumbfounded voice.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Shin-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>I waved my hand at her and ran up the stairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you on the 83rd floor, Loretta!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Eh? Shin-nim! Shin-nim! What was that!? You went into Beyond, right!? How are you going up to the 83rd floor? What\u2019s going on!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even after I fully stepped into the 83rd floor, I felt like I could hear Loretta\u2019s panicked shouts. I found it very interesting.</p><br/><p>From the 81st floor to the 85th floor, I could practically skip Beyond, so Crimson Hell was the only obstacle I had to deal with. Thankfully, Crimson Hell on the higher floors didn\u2019t come with strange added effects. They were simply stronger in the amount of mana they sucked in and the amount they appeared in.</p><br/><p>I was increasing my skill proficiencies more by fighting the Crimson Hell than I was by training in Beyond. From what I felt, Absolute Soul seemed to be growing the most. It reached level 8 during my break through of the 83rd floor, and in the 84th floor which had a wider hallway and increased aggressiveness of Crimson Hell, Absolute Soul finally reached level 9. Even I couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026 So it\u2019s not just my imagination. Peruta Circuit\u2019s efficiency is increasing too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Absolute Soul aimed to achieve the perfect soul. Its ability to absorb mana was a natural effect resulting from the increased league of my soul, but after it reached level 9, not only did it steal mana from monsters, it also naturally absorbed mana from all things in the universe. When I used Peruta Circuit to absorb mana, its efficiency even multiplied severalfold.</p><br/><p>Moreover, I was getting more familiar with Dortu, who was born not too long ago, and I could now use his ability more efficiently. I also became more adept at using Peruta Circuit, which was too complex to be described as \u2018mastered.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cCrimson Hell might be the fallen state of an lifeform that tried to reach for a higher league.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps, the pitiful creature might still be thinking it\u2019s reaching towards a whole soul.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just Crimson Hell. The worlds\u2019 enemies I\u2019ve met were all continually evolving. What was their ultimate goal? Was it perfecting themselves like Absolute Soul? But even a world\u2019s power couldn\u2019t\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Ugh, I almost thought of something again.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was probably too abstract for me to answer definitely. For a moment, however, I felt my heart drop and beat loudly. My instincts seemed to be telling me that I was walking the right path. That if I continued, I would be able to run quicker than anyone else.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 Why? Why only me?</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t allowed to know the answer right now, so I could only go on. One day, when I arrive at the destination, I\u2019ll be able to know.</p><br/><p>I kicked open the giant door in front of me. It was there waiting for me.</p><br/><p>\u201cFight me, Crimson Hell!\u201d</p><br/><p>The 85th Floor Master battle was now beginning.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

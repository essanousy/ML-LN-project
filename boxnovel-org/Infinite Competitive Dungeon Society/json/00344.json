Demon Lord (7)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>The dungeon reeked of blood. Just how many ability users died that the smell of blood irritates me this much?</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe dungeon\u2019s power\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Sumire and Ye-Eun seemed taken aback. I expected as much. While this place was more or less an Event Dungeon, it also completely rejected the dungeon\u2019s power. To be exact, this space rejected Sherafina\u2019s power. After losing the power they had for such a long time, it wasn\u2019t surprising for them to be shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuu, I expected to lose the dungeon\u2019s power, but I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d feel this weak.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve experienced it before but I just can\u2019t get used to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I glanced at my companions.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrepare your gods\u2019 power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have one, Son.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re strong without it, Father.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father succeeded in taking a step into the realm outside the dungeon, and he didn\u2019t lose to anyone in his mana control. Perhaps because of it, he seemed less affected than Ye-Eun or Sumire.</p><br/><p>Knowing that, I retorted curtly as I drew up my true god names\u2019 power. An invisible something descended on my spear and a pair of wings sprouted up on my back.</p><br/><p>[Ho.]</p><br/><p>A man\u2019s voice rang out.</p><br/><p>[So this is your power, Earth\u2019s Hero. Interesting. Truly interesting.]</p><br/><p>It was the Demon Lord\u2019s voice. Oddly, I couldn\u2019t grasp his presence in the slightest.</p><br/><p>I slowly looked around. The first thing that caught my attention was the blue moon shining down on us from above. The next to catch my attention was a river of blood shining under the moonlight.</p><br/><p>[It hasn\u2019t been long since then, but you sure changed a lot.]</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, the number of presence increased. I should have killed all demons other than the Demon Lord. Could he have kept some in the dungeon? However, my question was soon answered, as human-shaped creatures made of blood began to pop up.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon Lord, there\u2019s something I always wanted to ask you.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Go on. I\u2019m very curious about you too.]</p><br/><p>My eyes flashed. In an instant, the rising blood creatures and the entire river of blood turned to stone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho told you about Earth?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the petrified river began to flow once more. This time, however, it wasn\u2019t blood, but a mercury-like metal that was liquid at room temperature. I raised my hand lifting up the river water and molded it into a single giant ball.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho told you where I was?\u201d</p><br/><p>[What do you mean? I simply opened up a path to another world, and Earth just happened to be on the opposite end.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hm, is it not?]</p><br/><p>With that, the Demon Lord finally made his appearance, bringing along countless number of black mana balls.</p><br/><p>[Indeed, I received help from the one you know. It wasn\u2019t a particularly pleasant experience.]</p><br/><p>He was a beauty. Of course, I didn\u2019t think the Demon Lord would look ugly, but he was beautiful to a shocking degree.</p><br/><p>If I wasn\u2019t here, my companions would have fallen under his charm.</p><br/><p>[But regardless of the method, I ended up meeting you!]</p><br/><p>He spread his arms open. In a moment, the black mana bullets shot down towards us. Without exaggeration, each of them carried enough power to obliterate a large city. The Demon Lord had an unusually large amount of mana. Almost like me.</p><br/><p>\u201cDortu!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. Blocking all attacks.]</p><br/><p>The metallicized river spread out across the sky and received all the mana bullets. The Demon Lord\u2019s tone went up a notch.</p><br/><p>[Yes, that power! That looks interesting too!]</p><br/><p>Pieces of rocks began to float up from the ground. The Demon Lord\u2019s black mana enveloped the rocks glowing under the moonlight, strengthening them. At that moment, Father charged towards the Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou talk too much!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m not interested in you.]</p><br/><p>Speaking apathetically, the Demon Lord focused his magic power on Father. I immediately destroyed it, and Father successfully shot his spear towards him.</p><br/><p>It seemed Father\u2019s attack was enough to threaten the Demon Lord as he reached out with his hand and actively blocked the attack. Meanwhile, I reinforced the metallic river water with the Demon Lord\u2019s mana I stole and shot it towards him.</p><br/><p>[Huuuuu.]</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord took in a deep breath. Immediately afterwards, the floating pieces of rocks shot out in all directions. The metallic river water could not block them. Thankfully, Sumire quickly stepped in and protected us with Athena\u2019s power, Aegis.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow annoying!\u201d</p><br/><p>[This time, it\u2019s my turn to ask a question.]</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord created a sword made of black demonic energy and received Father\u2019s spear with it. After greedily devouring the vibration in Father\u2019s spear, it spat it back out. Father also took in the vibration and returned it back.</p><br/><p>[Who told you that?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should already know.\u201d</p><br/><p>I raised my head. Something has been on my mind for a while, and sure enough, the light emitted by the blue moon began to change to a blood-like crimson color.</p><br/><p>[Lespina! That wench betrayed me!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI must have been more charming than her original master.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I retorted playfully, I scanned the magic power within the moonlight. Father continued to attack the Demon Lord, and Sumire soon joined in with Athena\u2019s spear. Realizing that a single hand wasn\u2019t enough to deter them, the Demon Lord took out a strange dagger with his other hand and received Sumire\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cCareful, that dagger can suck out your soul!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Good, you\u2019re well informed!]</p><br/><p>Sumire struck the Demon Lord\u2019s jaw with Aegis. Immediately, the Demon Lord\u2019s jaw began to petrify. The Demon Lord looked stunned, while Ye-Eun suddenly appeared behind him. She immediately swung her dagger at the Demon Lord\u2019s neck, but soon spoke doubtfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, I think he\u2019s fake!\u201d</p><br/><p>[How did you find out?]</p><br/><p>The beheaded Demon Lord reappeared unhurt. With an annoying smile on his face, he held a different weapon than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, this one\u2019s fake too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord shot out another wave of mana bullets. This time, the bullets were far stronger than before. I frantically operated Dortu and Ruyue\u2019s power in defense.</p><br/><p>[Hero, do you know the value of your power?]</p><br/><p>Another Demon Lord appeared. Then another appeared, and another appeared. Each carried an overwhelming amount of mana, and I stared at them in disbelief.</p><br/><p>[Hero, do you know why you were born with that power?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>I answered. In truth, I wasn\u2019t really interested in what he had to say. I was more concerned with trying to kill him. I was beginning to understand why Ciara said I needed to save Shiva\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Wait, I was just about to think of something\u2026?</p><br/><p>[Hero, do you know what that power is for?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, leave the ground to me and do what you need to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun finally activated her god\u2019s power. Her body became enveloped in a golden aura, and arms equipped with powerful weapons sprouted up.</p><br/><p>[Hm!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll handle these guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, she had activated both Kali\u2019s and Durga\u2019s powers, but she didn\u2019t use them both. Instead, she transferred Kali\u2019s divine power to Durga\u2019s weapons to strengthen them. While the two gods\u2019 close affiliation likely made it possible, Ye-Eun was still incredible for being able to accomplish it.</p><br/><p>In any case, what was important was that Ye-Eun could deal with the Demon Lord\u2019s clones that were popping up on the ground. The clones had multiplied to dozens and each created countless mana bullets, carpeting the entire airspace. However, Ye-Eun charged towards them without a hint of hesitation.</p><br/><p>Countless number of hands appeared in the air to combat the mana bullets.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the end, you\u2019re only clones!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun began to make her move. Mana exploded here and there along with the Demon Lord\u2019s clones. Sumire protected me from the explosions with her shield, and Father struck down the clones flying towards Ye-Eun.</p><br/><p>[Kuhahahahaha!]</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord laughed heartedly. I couldn\u2019t tell which of the clones were laughing, even while many of them were being erased under Ye-Eun\u2019s attacks.</p><br/><p>[Humans sure are interesting. You\u2019re quite different than the humans I met in the Luka continent! Those self-proclaimed gods, to think about obtaining power from those relics of the past. Who would have thought of it?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether gods were born or created. What matters is that they\u2019re strong. They worshiped by billions of people, and their heroic tales are passed down to this day.\u201d</p><br/><p>I began to activate Shiva\u2019s power, one of the strongest among them. The center of my forehead opened up and a red eye appeared.</p><br/><p>[Foolish! Truly foolish! You dare to fight me with such fake power? Hero, if you think of doing the same, that will be your downfall! A god is someone like me!]</p><br/><p>The moon shone. The light emitted by the reddened moon illuminated the Demon Lord\u2019s clones and illuminated us. This light seemed to want to forcefully tear apart my body.</p><br/><p>[I swallowed billions of souls and made their mana mine! What would this power be if not the power of a god!?]</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord shouted. Having swallowed 2.3 billion humans from Earth, the red moon was shining fiercely. Just the light it was giving off was a powerful attack.</p><br/><p>It was incomparable to what I did in the Luka continent with Dortu\u2019s giant mirror. Power of souls that couldn\u2019t be imitated with mana, the resentment of billions of souls made that moon the worst magical tool of all time.</p><br/><p>[You think you can destroy it with that eye? Kuhahaha!]</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord sneered. However, I retorted with a smirk.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a god. You couldn\u2019t create a moon, so you brought one over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Admittedly, he was absurdly powerful. Using his magic power, he had brought over the moon in Luka continent\u2019s gravitational pull. Not only that, he also placed it in this dungeon he created. This dungeon did not look big from the inside, but that moon was denying that proposition. That moon was too far for our energy to reach it, but its power could easily reach us.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why I needed Shiva\u2019s power. I could sense it the moment I activated it. Befitting its description of all-destroying power, this eye would destroy this entire space along with that moon. The only problem was that I couldn\u2019t exclude my companions from its target.</p><br/><p>When I realized this, the third eye slowly closed down. I murmured in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this power too useless?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Have you realized it\u2019s futile? Have you given up? Your friends are still energetic! I wonder how long they will last.]</p><br/><p>The moonlight absorbed power from all beings on earth. It seemed similar to the dungeon\u2019s power Sherafina had. While it had a different basis of power, its basic structure seemed extremely similar.</p><br/><p>No, it wasn\u2019t just that.</p><br/><p>[She taught me too many things, not realizing it would come back to bite her!]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><br/><p>I shook my head and reached out with my hand. Following my hand\u2019s movements, Dortu\u2019s liquid metal slowly formed a long sharp spear. Then, the golden light from my hand enveloped the spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were used. This was her goal from the beginning.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Why do you think so?]</p><br/><p>Gods\u2019 powers are molded into suitable forms by Sherafina before being given to explorers. That\u2019s why explorers can use them as skills and wield them without having the suitable body.</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s not what a true god\u2019s power was. A true god\u2019s power only existed as a concept symbolizing the god. It was Sherafina who turned the Destruction God Shiva\u2019s power into an eye form. Sherafina was manipulating Shiva\u2019s mighty and destructive power to her will.</p><br/><p>How could a god given the title of Destruction God not be able to distinguish what to destroy and what not to?</p><br/><p>The power that formed Shiva\u2019s Eye was now being extracted into its original form and being imbued into the giant golden spear. It was the same for Zeus\u2019 power.</p><br/><p>\u201cLend me your power for the last time. Afterwards, I won\u2019t use them again.\u201d</p><br/><p>I whispered. As though my words worked as a catalyst, the spear carrying Zeus\u2019 and Shiva\u2019s power let out an eerie light and changed its form. For a moment, the red moon stopped functioning. Ye-Eun could finally catch a breath, while Father gritted his teeth and stabbed his spear on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, the power of gods are disappearing\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sumire, who was protecting me from the Demon Lord\u2019s attacks all this time, turned towards me and shouted in shock. I replied with a grin.</p><br/><p>\u201cI still have Hermes\u2019 power. I need to borrow his power for something.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Will you be able to stop it? You may be enlightened, but you should know, that enlightenment is just another word for helplessness!]</p><br/><p>The red moon had only lost its power for a moment. Soon, it began to beam out as if to not lose. A ball of resentment created by billions of souls and mana, as though to devour all existences, it was applying more and more pressure.</p><br/><p>\u201cEit!\u201d</p><br/><p>I threw my spear. Although I made a joking shout, the spear\u2019s effect was evident.</p><br/><p>The moon stopped giving off its light.</p><br/><p>[Hm!?]</p><br/><p>For the first time, the Demon Lord let out a shocked voice. In that instant, above the moon shattering into countless pieces, a giant appeared. It was the Demon Lord\u2019s real body!</p><br/><p>The moon was his method of attack, and at the same time, a magic circle to hide his presence.</p><br/><p>Staring at the moon, our eyes widened. It wasn\u2019t just because he was humongous. Of course, he was bigger than any existence I\u2019ve ever faced, but that wasn\u2019t the only reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father nodded. Ye-Eun and Sumire did the same. Although everyone was confused, there was something they realized amidst the confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still don\u2019t get it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Lespina might be more knowledgeable than the Demon Lord. Lespina could perfectly nullify Sherafina\u2019s power. In our fight against her, this unique ability of hers made us struggle greatly. However, the Demon Lord\u2019s method was different.</p><br/><p>He created this dungeon with his own power and he made it so that we couldn\u2019t use the dungeon\u2019s power here. Although he seemed to be unaffected by the dungeon\u2019s power, he actually wasn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being reinforced by the dungeon\u2019s power.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 What!?]</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Demon Lord had more of the dungeon\u2019s power than any explorer. On the other hand, my companions and I did not have even a fraction of the dungeon\u2019s power. Almost as if someone had planned things to be this way.</p><br/><p>Right, an explorer who didn\u2019t know the situation would say this.</p><br/><p>That a single demon explorer was fighting several human bosses.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

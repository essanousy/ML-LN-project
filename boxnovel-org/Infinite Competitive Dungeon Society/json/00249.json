After drinking about half the bottle, I asked Sharana to bring Lotte to me to have her drink the rest. Even as we were getting emergency treatments, messages continued to flow in.</p><br/><p>[Amazing! You completely killed one of the enemies threatening the world alone! You reaped the Hermit King\u2019s soul with the reaper\u2019s scythe. With the king\u2019s soul in possession, all lightning type monsters that invade Earth will have their abilities reduced by 10%! This is a monumental achievement! In addition, you can retrieve the remaining magic power in the Hermit King\u2019s body and soul, and turn it into your own.]</p><br/><p>[If you receive the Hermit King\u2019s power, the Hermit King\u2019s corpse will disappear and you will not get any reward for the raid completion. If you destroy the Hermit King\u2019s soul, you will obtain the Hermit King\u2019s corpse and receive appropriate rewards from the dungeon. What will you do?]</p><br/><p>[You obtained the title, \u2018Ruler of Lightning\u2019! Your affinity to lightning increases greatly. The ability to govern the lightning element has been newly created. Even without mana, you can withdraw lightning from nature and wield it.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained 30 stat points and 10 skill points for completing a Grand Raid.]</p><br/><p>I thought this would happen. From what I can tell, something like this happened when the reaper\u2019s scythe dealt the final blow. Retrieving the Hermit King\u2019s power? I pondered over the message.</p><br/><p>[Dear Husband! Are you okay?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine and so is Lotte! Plene, you can stop singing now!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un!]</p><br/><p>When I looked back at my companions, a message window popped up as if to demand my answer.</p><br/><p>[What will you do? If you do not decide quickly, the king\u2019s soul will be extinguished.]</p><br/><p>In truth, I wasn\u2019t sure what to do. With its transformation undone, I could see the giant corpse of an electric ray suspended underwater. It was much smaller than when the Hermit King first appeared.</p><br/><p>Right, his secret wasn\u2019t anything grand. He just had the ability to become extremely big or extremely small. There was one more aspect to this ability.</p><br/><p>What made his ability so scary was that he could shrink his presence as if he didn\u2019t exist or enlarge it as if he was a terrifying enemy. Furthermore, regardless of what size he was, his true strength didn\u2019t change. When he condensed his enormous lightning power into the size of a flea and attacked with a terrifying speed, even Enigma couldn\u2019t defend against it. It was a power fitting of the name Hermit King.</p><br/><p>The question was how I noticed him. It was thanks to chaos flames. No matter how small he became, the chaos flames burning inside his eye didn\u2019t disappear. How could I not know where my ability was located? I had seen through everything.</p><br/><p>However, if he noticed that I had discovered his secret, I would have lost my chance to counterattack perfectly. To attack him in the perfect time, I pretended not to see him and ended up with holes in my body.</p><br/><p>Thanks to this, I could accurately time when he would charge towards me, and I gave him the strongest attack I could make. If that wasn\u2019t enough, I planned to use Sky God\u2019s Rage for the finishing blow, but it was thankfully unnecessary. Trishula\u2019s effect and the reaper\u2019s scythe had activated with a critical hit.</p><br/><p>[What will you do?]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hu.\u201d</p><br/><p>The decision was entirely up to me. If I took his corpse and the raid reward, hm\u2026 Daisy would receive another powerful undead and I would probably receive a Legend grade item. However, I was more interested in a power that would become mine entirely. Even if that power was an ability to transform or an ability to hide my presence, that would have its own use. Moreover, the fact that message noona was asking me in the first place suggested that\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the power.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I gave my answer, the Hermit King\u2019s corpse began to shrunk. I watched with a blank expression until the corpse disappeared completely. In the end, only a blue energy was left floating. It then slowly approached me and was absorbed into me.</p><br/><p>[Dear Husband!]</p><br/><p>Licorice and Plene, who was approaching me with a relieved look, sped up in shock when they saw what was happening. However, I was already in no situation to explain them the situation. The moment the blue energy was absorbed into me, it resonated with Peruta Circuit and was surging through my body at a terrifying speed.</p><br/><p>[You can choose between two titles. The first is \u2018Hermit King\u2019, and you will be granted the Hermit King\u2019s Unique ability, \u2018World Trickery.\u2019 With this skill, you will be able to freely change your body\u2019s size, form, and presence while maintaining your full strength.]</p><br/><p>[The second is offering your title, \u2018Rule of Lightning\u2019, to obtain a new title, \u2018Lightning God\u2019 With this title, your affinity and dominance over lightning will reach a pinnacle, allowing you to freely create and wield lightning at your desire. You will also not take any damage from lightning below the EX rank, and you can even wield your enemy\u2019s lightning as if it was your own.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s Lightning God! Are you kidding me!?\u201d</p><br/><p>How are those two even comparable!? I shouted as if someone was listening. Immediately afterwards, the blue energy in my body transformed into a dazzling golden color. It immediately transformed into a powerful lightning and went berserk as if to burn me alive.</p><br/><p>[Master, there\u2019s so much energy! This is\u2026 Master\u2019s\u2026!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHuaaaaaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unable to endure the shock, I screamed, echoing underwater. This was like when I obtained a god\u2019s power\u2026 No, my body was transforming even more than when I obtained a god\u2019s power!</p><br/><p>[You obtained the title, \u2018Lightning God\u2019. Your affinity and dominance over lightning has reached the pinnacle. You can wield all lightning under EX rank as if it was your own, and you will not be injured by them.]</p><br/><p>[Congratulations! You met one of the conditions to advance to the next realm!]</p><br/><p>How long did it take before that message rang out? I had no way of knowing. When I became conscious, Licorice, Lotte, and Plene were hugging me in a competition of some sort.</p><br/><p>[Dear Husband, Dear Husband!]</p><br/><p>[Hero, don\u2019t die!]</p><br/><p>[Snap out, Shin!]</p><br/><p>Ruyue and Sharana were also floating around me with worried looks. However, as Peika was in my body the whole time, she didn\u2019t seem too worried. I flicked the girls\u2019 foreheads and made them back off.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Stop trying to take off my armor and get back.\u201d</p><br/><p>[But I have to check your body! You might be hurt!]</p><br/><p>Feeling doubtful at Licorice\u2019s choice of words, I notified them that I was at my absolute best condition. Then, I flicked Licorice\u2019s forehead one more time. I suddenly became curious if it was Licorice\u2019s buff that allowed me to obtain the title of Lightning God. After all, it was thanks to her buff that I obtained the Ruler of Lightning title.</p><br/><p>Thus, I changed my mind and pat her head. Although it didn\u2019t really work as we were underwater, she seemed to have understood my feelings as her face brightened. She suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>[Can I unclothe you?]</p><br/><p>\u201cStop when you\u2019re ahead, please.\u201d</p><br/><p>As a test, I ignited lightning with my left hand. It was done without using Peika\u2019s power. Despite us being underwater, golden lightning danced on my palm naturally. I felt an indescribable sense of pleasure.</p><br/><p>[Dear Husband\u2026 I see, if you obtained a power of this level, it makes sense that you fainted. How is it? Can you handle it?]</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I feel like\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I threw the lightning towards the bottom of the Mariana Trench. That single bolt of lightning didn\u2019t lose even the slightest strength as it descended endlessly. Soon, the light it was giving off disappeared and a powerful explosion was felt.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can even kill the remaining three kings alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before we entered the SSS rank Event Dungeon underneath, I notified the rest of the guild members that I took care of the king and that we didn\u2019t need any backup. Some breathed sighs of relief, some cursed, and some laughed as if it was only natural. Leon\u2019s trust in me was too big!</p><br/><p>[Nothing less from the guild master. My heart dropped for a second though.]</p><br/><p>[Was the king weak?]</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said he was the weakest.\u201d</p><br/><p>[How can he stop us from running away? That\u2019s cheating!]</p><br/><p>[If all kings are like that, we\u2019ll have to be extra careful. You said he hid his presence so he couldn\u2019t be discovered?]</p><br/><p>I nodded at Hwaya\u2019s question (though she couldn\u2019t see me), and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was a strange technique that only the Hermit King could do. The other kings shouldn\u2019t be able to do it. I\u2019m certain so you don\u2019t need to worry. The other kings can\u2019t hide their presence. Their overwhelmingly powerful presence, that is.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yeah, the Lava King was like that, but\u2026]</p><br/><p>[Corpse\u2026 What about\u2026 the beautiful, tough\u2026 corpse?]</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no such thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ah\u2026 Kang Shin, I hate you.]</p><br/><p>Daisy seemed angry I couldn\u2019t acquire the corpse, but I would have made the same choice even if I went back in time. I made a bitter smile and consoled her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Antarctica has powerful monsters too. I\u2019ll find a strong one for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Pinky promise\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Yua made a surprising report.</p><br/><p>[Oppa, the egg hatched!]</p><br/><p>\u201cReally!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I was sad I couldn\u2019t be there to witness it.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s a really cute baby dinosaur!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you name it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feeling uneasy, I couldn\u2019t help but ask. Yua gave a hearty response.</p><br/><p>[The name is Doo\u2014][1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dooly_the_Little_Dinosaur]</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t name him yet, what about \u2018Ruth\u2019!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I cut her off and shouted. Yua corrected me.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s a she. Plus, I already named her.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou named a girl Doo\u2014 No, nevermind. How about Luna?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Oh, that\u2019s a pretty name, Oppa! Then I\u2019ll call her Luna from now!]</p><br/><p>Just like that, I made a better future for both Yua and Luna. I had yelled whatever name that came to my mind, but naming a flame dragon\u2019s baby Luna\u2026 My naming sense\u2026</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m happy Oppa named her, huhu.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy that Yua\u2019s happy. Mostly in the sense of copyright laws.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I agree with that, but you two brother and sister need to make some distance.]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m already so far from him! You want me to get even farther! I hate Hwaya Unni!]</p><br/><p>[See! In the first place, that\u2019s the wrong response! Yua, this Unni will introduce you to a nice boy. How about it?]</p><br/><p>[No! I\u2019m going to live with Oppa for the rest of my life! I hate Unni!]</p><br/><p>It seemed I had sparked another trouble. As I was scared of both Hwaya and Yua, I decided to ignore them both. Then, I charged straight into the SSS rank dungeon.</p><br/><p>Two weeks later, on the 32nd day after leaving Korea, I completely cleaned up the Pacific Ocean and the Oceania and headed to the Antarctic Ocean. Including the stat points from defeating the Hermit King, I had gained 55 bonus stat points. While the Chaotic Spear was at 84% growth.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The World Becomes a Dungeon (1)</p><br/><p>About two years after I first defeated the Orc Lord, any party I was in no longer knew defeat.</p><br/><p>No matter how messed up the party composition was, even if a worthless explorer joined, I had no problem defeating the Orc Lord.</p><br/><p>I defeated an Orc Lord everyday without exception, and the 100 gold reward stockpiled slowly.</p><br/><p>With the increased number of times I succeeded in defeating the Orc Lord, I naturally had more opportunity to obtain a Muscle or Bone Compressing Elixir. Now, just eating one or two wasn\u2019t enough to raise my stats. I had to eat at least ten.</p><br/><p>The amount of free stat points I gained through muscle and bone compressing elixirs was 28. It was just short of the amount gained from 6 level ups. I knew I was level 6, yet not really level 6.</p><br/><p>One day, because no Muscle or Bone Compressing Elixir had dropped, I chose the Orc Lord\u2019s Glaive. It was just about when my wooden spear was completely worn out. In truth, it was surprising I lasted so long with a wooden spear. Once I began carrying around the glaive, the way people saw me changed. It became easier to find my place in parties. It was the first time I realized the importance of weapons.</p><br/><p>Once I had the Orc Lord\u2019s Glaive, my attack power increased exponentially. Sometime later, I found myself wearing a leather helm, leather gloves, and leather armor. They were all equipment dropped by the Orc Lord.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Crown Prince\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, after 5 years, I can finally escape the 5th floor!\u201d</p><br/><p>My name became more and more well-known. When I began recruiting party members, all ten slots filled up in an instant. Other dungeon explorers also called me the \u2018one who leads the path past the 5th floor\u2019 and \u2018Savior Incarnate.\u2019 Although I tried to stop the embarrassing nicknames from spreading, it was of no use.</p><br/><p>Because I didn\u2019t want to make money by hunting orcs like my father, once I defeated the Orc Lord, I left the dungeon and studied. I had to make use of my 20 intelligence stat. My grades at school went up. My mother was happy and the number of universities I could attend went up.</p><br/><p>No matter how much money I made from the dungeon, it was my mother\u2019s opinion that I had to attend a university when I graduated from high school. I could do little to resist my mother. In truth, the thought of attending a university excited me. It was something I couldn\u2019t have even dreamed of when my intelligence of low.</p><br/><p>Yes, other than the fact that I couldn\u2019t obtain mana, everything was perfect.</p><br/><p>I focused my efforts on the Orc Lord Raids and paid little attention to maintaining a social life at school (not that I had one to maintain in the first place). One day, I was called to part of the school teachers rarely visited.</p><br/><p>I was nervous, wondering if delinquents were trying to pick a fight with me. Instead, a familiar girl had appeared. She was from my class. Contrary to her usual cheerful and enthusiastic self, her head was drooped down like she was an entirely different person.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Who? This cute girl? Me? She likes me?</p><br/><p>I thought it was a joke. Even though I was taking muscle and bone compressing elixirs, I was still the person who was once called an orc. When I asked if she was joking, she began crying and ran off.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you crying!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I wasn\u2019t kidding! Uwaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>A rumor had spread throughout school that I was rejecting girls. When I came home and told my mother and sister about it, they stared at me as if they had just heard the most ridiculous thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t notice?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa... stupid\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Stupid? I\u2019m not stupid anymore\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>An unsolvable mystery was created that day.</p><br/><p>Half a year after that, I began to think whether I needed all ten members to defeat the Orc Lord. Just as a test, I went into battle with just eight people, but it was still extremely easy. The ones who came in with me made expressions of disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt worked\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut how?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 a bug\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bugs referred to monsters that dropped an unusually high amount of gold or a high-grade item that normally would not drop on that floor. They were considered treasures, created from mistakes by the ones who operated the dungeons. But it seemed I was being treated like a bug.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is no laughing matter, Crown Prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, Crown Prince. You should hurry up and head to a higher floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop calling me Crown Prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>I retorted bluntly and checked the list of rewards. It was then that I seemed to be struck by lightning.</p><br/><p>[1. Orc Lord\u2019s Glaive</p><br/><p>2. Power Potion</p><br/><p>3. Middle Potion</p><br/><p>4. Skin Compressing Elixir</p><br/><p>5. Orc Lord\u2019s Boots</p><br/><p>6. Muscle Compressing Elixir</p><br/><p>7. Mana Potion</p><br/><p>8. 230 Gold]</p><br/><p>\u2018No way! Am I seeing this correctly?\u2019</p><br/><p>I washed my eyes and looked at the list of rewards again. Orc Lord\u2019s Boots. This was the first time I had seen it in 2 years of hunting the Orc Lord. There was something else that surprised me. Skin Compressing Elixir! I was thinking about how my skin wasn\u2019t reducing at the rate that my muscle and bones were reducing.</p><br/><p>Without a shred of hesitation, I chose the skin compressing elixir.</p><br/><p>[Skin Compressing Elixir (Rare)</p><br/><p>Warning. When someone who has not consumed both muscle and bone compressing elixir consumes this elixir, one could experience severe pain and permanent bodily damage. For those that consumed both muscle and bone compressing elixir, this elixir will make one\u2019s stretched out skin tighter and stronger, boosting one\u2019s defense and giving the skin a clean, hard texture.]</p><br/><p>I ate it, and my constitution increased. It was the start of a new grind.</p><br/><p>When the number of people decreased, new items appeared on the reward list. When I thought about it, it made sense. Quantity decreased and quality increased.</p><br/><p>I hunted in a party of eight for a while, then switched to seven, then six, then five. Even then, everything went smoothly. Skin compressing elixirs appeared more often, and muscle and bone compressing elixirs always appeared.</p><br/><p>I compressed my body endlessly. The more I repeated it, the smaller and stronger I became. When I realized my 210cm height had gone down to 190cm, the winter break of my 3rd year of high school had started.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Standing in front of a mirror, it was all I could mutter. The mirror was now capable of capturing my whole body without problem. Did I become blind when I focused on a topic? Although I washed myself every day, it was only now that I was seeing the changes in my body.</p><br/><p>The me in front of the mirror was a normal young man. No, I wasn\u2019t exactly normal. Those who worked out could easily see through the strength hidden in my muscles.</p><br/><p>On the outside, I was more than enough to be described as slim. More importantly, my muscles weren\u2019t repulsing to look at anymore. In fact, it was the opposite. My body finally matched my face, which took after my mother\u2019s good looks. Although I felt like I was still a bit too tall, it was nothing to complain about.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feeling a sense of fulfillment, I sighed silently. It was a long journey, but I had finally done it. To be exact, no matter how much compressing elixirs I took, my stats wouldn\u2019t increase anymore. So I quit.</p><br/><p>After taking elixirs for almost 3 years, I had gained a total of 40 stat points. 10 strength, 10 dexterity, and 20 constitution. Just with my status alone, I would be evenly matched with level 14 explorers.</p><br/><p>\u201cEllos and Palludia must have passed the 15th floor now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I murmured bitterly and let out another sigh. The fact that I couldn\u2019t use mana had tied me down to the 5th floor for 3 years. I felt sorry for myself. I then realized my father must have felt the same.</p><br/><p>It must be why he was going around talking about getting qi at such an age.</p><br/><p>[Name: Kang Shin \u00a0 \u00a0 Race: Human \u00a0 \u00a0 Sex: Male</p><br/><p>Class: None \u00a0 \u00a0 Title: None \u00a0 \u00a0 Rank: Bronze 7</p><br/><p>Level: 6</p><br/><p>HP \u2013 1,940/1,940 \u00a0 \u00a0 MP \u2013 0</p><br/><p>Strength \u2013 34(+2) \u00a0 \u00a0 Dexterity \u2013 30 \u00a0 \u00a0 Constitution \u2013 39</p><br/><p>Intelligence \u2013 20 \u00a0 \u00a0 Magic \u2013 0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Charm \u2013 16 \u00a0 \u00a0 Luck \u2013 10</p><br/><p>Skill \u2013 Low-rank Martial Arts (Master), Low-rank Spear Technique (Master), Mid-rank Spear Technique (Master)]</p><br/><p>Was this the status of a level 6 explorer? The answer was yes. I didn\u2019t believe it either, but it was the truth.</p><br/><p>What was strange was that my charm stat had gone up by itself. It was 7 initially, but it had gone up until it was 16. Because the charm and luck stat were bonus stats and you could not distribute status points to them, I didn\u2019t pay much attention to them.</p><br/><p>Most importantly, my magic stat was still 0. Compared to the HP I had, it looked completely barren.</p><br/><p>My equipment were entirely from the Orc Lord. Its helmet, chestplate, leggings, boots, gloves, and glaive. On one ear, I even had an Orc Lord\u2019s Earring, which raised the strength stat by 2 points.</p><br/><p>If I walked around Myung Dong like this, would they think I was cosplaying? I quickly erased the thought from my mind. With how the world was these days, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if someone really attacked me thinking I was a monster.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>If you ask what I\u2019m ready for, it was obvious. It was killing the Orc Lord solo!</p><br/><p>I had always kept the possibility in my mind. The reward increased as the number of explorers in the party decreased. If I succeeded in defeating it alone, what reward would I get? As far as I knew, there was no one who managed to defeat the Orc Lord alone. The reason was simple. Once one defeated the next floor master, it was impossible to go back and hunt the previous floor master.</p><br/><p>In other words, explorers above level 11 could not come back to the 5th floor to kill the Orc Lord. Those below that did not even think about hunting the floor master alone. If there was such a person, it would be someone who grinded through elixirs year after year just like me. I had asked father about the elixirs, but he said that as the man in charge of the house, he gave up hunting the Orc Lord and focused on hunting as many orcs as possible. It was likely to be the same with others in a similar situation as father. Someone who could pass the 6th floor did not need to kill the Orc Lord.</p><br/><p>That is, I was the first. I should be. I would like to be.</p><br/><p>I did not want to just try it. If I was doing it, I wanted to succeed. Pressing down on the Orc Lord\u2019s Helmet, I stood in front of the huge stone door.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026 here I go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, just like 3 years ago, I pushed open the stone door and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cOrc Lord! Fight me!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

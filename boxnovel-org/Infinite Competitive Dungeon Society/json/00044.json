Event Dungeon (7)</p><br/><p>After questioning what thoughts father had in my mind, I urged everyone on.</p><br/><p>\u201cAttack! Now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD-Did you do that, Yeon Hwawoo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLess questions, more attacking!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, I charged at Arachne. Warcry lasted for 5 minutes. If we couldn\u2019t defeat Arachne in 5 minutes, her charm would likely wipe us out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t have mana right now! I used it all up exploding the army!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really SS-ranked!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, we wouldn\u2019t be doing so well without me! I\u2019m recovering, so wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was true that she played a big role. Arachne\u2019s most feared weapon, the Black Forest, was restricted for now. The huge explosion from just now seemed to have reached Arachne too, as one of her legs were missing and green goo was coming out of what should be a hard carapace.</p><br/><p>That said, Mastiford was a magician. Shouldn\u2019t she have learned how to manage her mana from the time she spent exploring the dungeon? For someone with such a powerful ability, she wasted too much energy in using her skills. In a way, her ability was something that went beyond her league.</p><br/><p>For the record, Arachne\u2019s bodily fluid sizzled upon contact with the air and rose up as smoke. It was poisonous as well!</p><br/><p>[Kiaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>What sounded like the singing of a beautiful voice was now nothing more than a monster\u2019s roar. At the same time, two of Arachne\u2019s legs flew toward us. I instinctively knew that if I was hit, I\u2019d die! The goosebumps I instantly received urged me on. Using Divine Speed, I charged past its attacking legs and sent a punch toward its upper body.</p><br/><p>[Kiaaak!]</p><br/><p>\u201cLetting a grappler approach, it\u2019s over! Thunder Beast!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since I used 20 percent of my mana with Divine Speed, I could only maintain Thunder Beast for 80 seconds. The moment I activated Thunder Beast, the lightning that was staying in my gauntlet expanded to cover my entire body. I could feel it strengthening my muscles and nerves. I could tell that this powerful ability had at least doubled my overall power.</p><br/><p>From the outside, I looked like I was simply shining, as if I was shooting out lightning from my body. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s called Thunder Beast! To anyone looking at me, I probably looked more like a lightning beast than human.</p><br/><p>[Master, something is forcefully taking my power!]</p><br/><p>\u201cJust hold on a little, Peika. I\u2019ll end it soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>[O-Okay, I\u2019ll do my best. Do Master\u2019s best too!]</p><br/><p>With Peika\u2019s cute voice cheering me on, I struck my lightning clad fist on Arachne\u2019s face. Although it looked like a weak woman\u2019s face from the outside, there was not even a scratch, as expected of a boss.</p><br/><p>In fact, Arachne screamed and tried to bite down on my fist. At the same time, she raised her two legs to attack me. Thankfully, father was there to stop it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare seduce me, when I have a wife!? I\u2019ll take your silk and make my wife and Yua a dress! Mega Wavelance!\u201d</p><br/><p>Father seemed to have used a major skill as Arachne screamed as her huge eyes trembled. Using this opening, I quickly wrapped my legs around her waist. Although she was a monster, I had still come in close contact with a naked woman\u2019s body. As such, her sweet scent and soft skin distracted me. After seeing this, father shouted, \u201cYou bastard! I\u2019ll tell Yua about this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut it, Kang Yungoong-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Can you not make it obvious that we\u2019re father and son!?\u2019 After shouting at father, I continuously punched Arachne\u2019s fair face. Tactile feeling aside, she was still a monster! Her beautiful looks made me feel like I was doing something inhumane, but I chose to ignore it.</p><br/><p>[Kiaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t open your mouth, your spit\u2019s getting on my fist!\u201d</p><br/><p>Puk! Puk! Puk! Puk!</p><br/><p>After continually pummeling her face with all my strength, Arachne\u2019s face finally tore up from the heightened impact from Thunder Beast, and poisonous blood began to shoot out.</p><br/><p>However, the lightning enveloping my entire body did not let the poison reach me in the slightest. I continued to punch her to do as much damage as I could before the time ran out. At the same time, just in case I couldn\u2019t finish her off in the time frame I had, I did not forget to prepare the highest-grade Health and Mana Potions I had.</p><br/><p>[Kiaaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>Arachne seemed frustrated that she was unable to do anything as she wildly shook her human arms to attack me. Although they looked like a frail girl\u2019s arms, the impact they had upon hitting my armor was indescribably painful. Although they weren\u2019t as strong as her spider legs, they were as strong as my own arms. Furthermore, as time went on and she realized the life-threatening situation she was in, she crazily shot out spider webs from her bottom half.</p><br/><p>The streams of spider webs flying out in all directions then joined into a single large stream and attacked father and me. As we were both super-armored, receiving the attack didn\u2019t hinder our movements by much. That said, we would still be injured. At that moment\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cUuu, if I collapse from anemia, it\u2019s you two\u2019s fault! Cutie, hold out a little longer!\u201d Mastiford shouted.</p><br/><p>As if to prove the saying that \u2018a diamond on a dunghill was still a diamond,\u2019 Mastiford made her final move. I felt something flying past my shoulders like an arrow. At the same time, the poisonous spider webs that were attacking me were burnt up and disappeared.</p><br/><p>Not only that, a white ball of flame that was flying through the air struck Arachne\u2019s body, making her cry out in pain. In just this short moment, Mastiford had recovered enough mana to use another skill! Although she was regretful in some areas, her ability was undoubtedly shocking.</p><br/><p>In truth, I almost fell for Mastiford who managed to play such a pivotal role even after using skill after skill. Thankfully, I held on with Warcry\u2019s effect. As I thought, love was a status effect! It wasn\u2019t normal! I converted all of my emotions into rage as I pummeled Arachne.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaaaaa! Diediediediediedie!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kiaaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>\u201cDie! Wave Gatling!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the moment where I found out from who exactly that I inherited my harsh tongue. Father and I both yelled out crudely as we beat up Arachne. She in turn screamed and thrashed about with her two human arms and five spider legs. In response, I used Dragon Skin. When Arachne hit my body, her eyes opened wide in pain.</p><br/><p>[Kiik! Kiiik!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYep, that\u2019s what I wanted to hear! A mere arthropod should not try to seduce a human! You\u2019re 5 million years too early for that! Die!\u201d</p><br/><p>I considered using Dark Thunder Explosion, but I saved it in case an Event Raid broke out afterwards. Plus, I felt it wasn\u2019t necessary now either.</p><br/><p>Because of Dragon Skin, the speed brought up by Thunder Beast was halved. Even so, I was fast enough that Arachne could not dodge me. My fists hardened by Dragon Skin had more than enough destructive power to make up for the decrease in speed.</p><br/><p>Eventually, the end arrived. My fists pummeling her face finally penetrated skin and broke her bones.</p><br/><p>[Kiii!]</p><br/><p>The headless Arachne let out a short shriek and went limp. I finally got up from my mounted position and deactivated Thunder Beast. The party members then eased their tension after knowing the boss fight had ended.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew, haaa\u2026. I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood job, so\u2026 Yeon Hwawoo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNice finish!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou looked cool!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the Thunder Beast\u2019s effect went away, exhaustion swept over me. I felt like collapsing in place. The drained mana gave me a headache and the overexertion of my body made my muscles convulse. Dragon Skin was the only thing keeping me from falling on my knees.</p><br/><p>When I tried to pull my hand out of Arachne\u2019s head, I felt something in the way. When I dug through its brain and looked, a Bluestone glowing deep-blue came out. Although it was small, its brilliance was incomparable to the giant spider\u2019s. I suddenly felt strength in my body again. With sparkling eyes, I showed everyone the Bluestone.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, this looks expensive! Everyone, look!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I know it\u2019s a monster, but you shouldn\u2019t dig through a beautiful woman\u2019s head like that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMastiford-ssi, you yourself called it a monster. Don\u2019t be so picky\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were cool, Yeon Hwawoo-nim! Really cool! You were like the incarnation of Takemikazuchi[1. Japanese god of thunder]!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unlike Mastiford who gasped and backed away, Minami applauded me with sparkly eyes. I didn\u2019t know what Takemikazuchi was, but I let it be since it sounded like a compliment. I gave her a thumbs up and slid down Arachne\u2019s body. I then saw father rubbing his chin while staring at Arachne\u2019s leg that he had ripped off. When he saw me looking at him in anticipation, he knocked on the leg\u2019s carapace with his spear and said, \u201cThis. Don\u2019t you think it would taste great if you fry it? Like crabs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s poisonous!\u201d</p><br/><p>He calmly said something I never would have imagined. Then, a fanfare suddenly rang out.</p><br/><p>[You defeated the Event Dungeon boss monster, Arachne!]</p><br/><p>[100,000 gold is distributed evenly amongst party members. You received 25,000 gold.]</p><br/><p>[Kang Shin-nim\u2019s contribution is the highest. Choose your reward.]</p><br/><p>[1. Arachne\u2019s Silk Dress</p><br/><p>2. Arachne\u2019s Black Earthen Spear</p><br/><p>3. Arachne\u2019s Cobweb Earrings</p><br/><p>4. Arachne\u2019s Cobweb Bracelet]</p><br/><p>Gasp! My contribution was the highest!? I definitely thought Mastiford would have the highest contribution. Now that I thought about it, although Mastiford showed great firepower throughout the dungeon, the only damage she did to Arachne was through the initial explosion and Cutie\u2019s final attack.</p><br/><p>She would have high contribution points, but it seemed it wasn\u2019t higher than mine, as I dealt most of the damage against Arachne and even dealt the final blow.</p><br/><p>As expected, Mastiford was complaining.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Who has the highest contribution? Why isn\u2019t it me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Mastiford-ssi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, if it\u2019s you, then\u2026 though I don\u2019t want to admit it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Thankfully, it seemed other people couldn\u2019t see the [Kang Shin-nim\u2019s contribution\u2026] message. I had forgotten about it, but my real name would have been found out.</p><br/><p>After answering Mastiford, I slowly examined the reward list. Perhaps because it was an Event Dungeon, or because all four of us made good contributions, all four items seemed excellent.</p><br/><p>That said, I knew the items higher up on the list were better than the ones below. Since the dress and earrings were likely for females only, I had to choose either the spear or the bracelet. I glanced at father. His weapon was the Silver Spear just like mine. I wondered if I should give father the spear under the \u2018elder\u2019s first\u2019 spirit.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>I contemplated for about 0.01 seconds before I picked the Black Earthen Spear without hesitation. I then quickly stuffed it into my inventory so father wouldn\u2019t see it. It was the perfect crime.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

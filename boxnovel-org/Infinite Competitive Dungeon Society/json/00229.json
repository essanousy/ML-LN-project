Overlord (9)</p><br/><p>After using Overlord, I examined my body, surprised by the effect. My 5 meter tall stature, the black armor of mana covering my body, and the overwhelming power touching my skin made me tremble.</p><br/><p>Even the Lava King could not laugh seeing my appearance.</p><br/><p>[That power\u2026!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI obtained it just to beat up bastards like you!\u201d</p><br/><p>In truth, I didn\u2019t care about anything the Lava King was currently saying. Following the sense of omnipotence flowing through my body, I lengthened my spear to several tens of meters and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll defeat you within the next 3 minutes!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Try it if you can!]</p><br/><p>The Lava King opened his mouth and vomited out flames once again. However, I charged into his mouth directly. Before I could even try to block his fire breath, Lotte blocked it on her own.</p><br/><p>[You won\u2019t harm Hero!]</p><br/><p>[Eit, a mere wyvern acting so bothersome just by learning to wield flames!]</p><br/><p>I flew past Lotte and straight towards the Lava King. The Chaotic Spear, which had elongated to dozens of meters, was flashing with a threatening black lightning.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat this!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuhahaha, I like your courage, Hero!]</p><br/><p>A giant barrier of fire appeared in the air, and the spear I thrust out clashed with the barrier, crackling with a terrifying amount of lightning. I twisted my waist, adding more strength to my spear and pushing it forward. In an instant, the barrier of fire became dyed in black before it shattered easily.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>My spear then stabbed his neck. His blood spurted out towards me, but I quickly pulled my spear out, swinging my spear lightly to make the blood dissipate.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, what a beautiful sight!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hecate\u2019s voice rang out. She then soared into the sky and swung her whips here and there. All of the undead monsters then howled before beginning to attack the Lava King who was writhing in pain. Ina also took advantage of this chance, creating giant masses of ice in the air and firing them at the Lava King.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hot! I hate you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyahahaha! You\u2019re too cool, Dear!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDuca, control yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Once exposed, the Lava King\u2019s body was only a good shooting target. I twisted my body in the air once more, stabbing the Lava King again and again. In the next moment, Duca\u2019s figure seemed to flash in the corner of my eyes and another stream of blood spurted out from the Lava King\u2019s neck. I didn\u2019t know why that woman liked attacking her enemy\u2019s neck so much.</p><br/><p>[Kukuk\u2026 Kuhaha! Humans, you are indeed interesting! But if you think this is enough\u2026 to make me troubled, you couldn\u2019t be more mistaken!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKyak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duca screamed and quickly jumped off his body. Centered around his body, a powerful heatwave pulsed out, sweeping over all of us. I quickly reached out with my hands and unfolded \u2018Enigma.\u2019 Enigma\u2019s domain then perfectly halted the heatwave\u2019s advance. Even I was surprised at my own power\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>[So it\u2019s as I thought. Hero, you really are interesting!]</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but I don\u2019t find you that interesting! Hwaya, the volcano\u2019s going to erupt!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason he was talking was to give himself time to recover. I spread Enigma out like a net and suppressed the Lava King\u2019s attacks completely. Then, I aimed my giant spear filled with an ample amount of Heroic Aura towards him. The Lava King flapped his wings fiercely and shouted.</p><br/><p>[Hero who has reached the limit of a human being, see if you can overcome this king!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I plan on doing!\u201d</p><br/><p>I shot my spear forward. The Lava King faced it directly, breathing out flames. However, Lotte blocked his flames coming towards me. Her body was already wrapped in a blinding brilliance.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the volcanic crater under us was rumbling unnaturally. I could see Hwaya jumping in haphazardly!</p><br/><p>\u201cChild, you\u2019ll die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this is all it takes to kill me, I\u2019d rather die! Shin, I\u2019ll stop him from recovering! You kill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m trusting you, Hwaya!\u201d</p><br/><p>In truth, I was worried sick about Hwaya\u2019s safety, but I tried my best to not think about it. Even a bit of extraneous thoughts made one\u2019s spear shaky and halved its power. Right now, it was more important to focus on dealing a devastating blow to the Lava King!</p><br/><p>The giant spear version of Heroic Strike clashed with the Lava King\u2019s scarlet flames, which even Lotte couldn\u2019t block, and scattered its energy to the side. I once again fiercely circulated Peruta Circuit. The atmospheric mana became absorbed into my body, becoming part of the whirlpool enveloping my spear.</p><br/><p>[Kuhahahaha! I was hesitating because it would be a waste to burn you into ashes, but I won\u2019t hesitate any longer!]</p><br/><p>\u201cTry it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment my spear neared the Lava King\u2019s face, his eyes flashed, and hundreds of fireballs ignited in the air, swooping towards me. If I hadn\u2019t used Overlord, I would have had no choice but to dodge them, but my current self didn\u2019t see the need to dodge them. I continued onward with a penetrating force and charged into the flames. Lotte exerted flames from her entire body and charged in with me.</p><br/><p>\u201cLotte, I\u2019ll leave it to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I can\u2019t block them all, Hero!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI can handle the rest of them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Controlling the mana of Enigma covering my body was none other than Peruta Circuit\u2019s rotation! Peruta Circuit\u2019s rotation sucked in a portion of the amorphous mana making up my armor and became a pitch-black whirlpool. The Lava King\u2019s ravaging flames were also sucked into the whirlpool. Of course, it wasn\u2019t that they couldn\u2019t damage me at all. However, this much pain was more than bearable!</p><br/><p>\u201cSacrifice!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuhuk!]</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>Along with his scream, a large amount of the blood he vomited rained down. Although I was also injured from Sacrifice\u2019s side effect, while I was using Overlord, the pain was reduced. Seeing the king writhing in pain, I grinned.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes it hurt? It hurts for me, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Now you\u2019ve made me mad! Kuaaaaa! Eternal Flame!]</p><br/><p>Along with the pulsing of his mana, the volcanic crater rumbled once again. Soon, it would erupt again! Even as he tossed blood in all directions, he cried maniacally.</p><br/><p>[I am eternal! As long as even a single wick of flame exists, I will never die!]</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said\u2026 I won\u2019t let that happen!\u201d</p><br/><p>I threw my spear towards him. Carrying a black whirlpool, the Chaotic Spear cut through the air and pierced the Lava King\u2019s wing. Then, I pulled it back by controlling the Enigma. I felt like the Lava King\u2019s monstrous weight would pull my arm out. I really had to exert all of my energy to pull him towards me. At that moment, Ina stepped in to help me.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bully Daddy! I hate you even more!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ku\u2026 Kuhahahaha! You, your ice is truly surprising\u2026!]</p><br/><p>Ina\u2019s attack at full force froze his body in an instant. Without missing this opportunity, I yanked him towards me. Hecate also made the best out of this opportunity, holding her hand in the air and shouting.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle One, the blood you shed will strangle your neck!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hecate\u2019s magic flashed. The blood flowing out of his neck and burning in the air squirmed together from Hecate\u2019s magic, becoming a red chain that dug into his body! Strength then left the Lava King\u2019s body, and it became easier to pull him.</p><br/><p>Lotte also tackled him to make him lose his control over his center of mass. Although Lotte\u2019s figure was much smaller than the Lava King, her tackle was powerful enough to make him groan in pain. Every time Lotte struck his body, he was pulled closer to me more quickly.</p><br/><p>Even so, there wasn\u2019t enough time. Before I could completely pull him away from the range of the volcanic crater, the volcano erupted with a scalding lava!</p><br/><p>[Kuhahaha\u2026 ha?]</p><br/><p>His endless mad laughter suddenly came to halt. The eruption had suddenly stopped as if the throat of the volcano had been plugged. It was undoubtedly Hwaya\u2019s doing! Using this chance, I quickly yanked on the Lava King.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>\u201cDuca!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duca\u2019s body instantly separated into dozens of copies. With each of them possessing a frightening amount of magical power, they all charged towards the Lava King and stabbed him with their daggers exuding a black aura. Duca then shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeel the weight of my blade! Dance of the Fool!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuhahak! You bitch!]</p><br/><p>Just the fact that the Lava King had stopped laughing showed the situation the Lava King was in. Moreover, he had realized he couldn\u2019t recover like before. He must have laughed, thinking that he could regenerate himself no matter how much damage he took, but now, each and every attack was bringing him closer to death.</p><br/><p>When Duca backed off after succeeding in her attack, I reached out and retrieved my spear first before charging at the Lava King, who was still writhing in pain from Duca\u2019s unknown skill and power. It would have been nice if I could use Wind King\u2019s Rage at this moment, but as I had used it not long ago and had even fully charged it, it was regretfully unavailable for use.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaaaaaap! Die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even so, my charge was monstrously powerful. The Chaotic Spear dug straight into the middle of his chest and detonated the mana of Enigma, messing up the Lava King\u2019s insides completely.</p><br/><p>[Kuhahahak!]</p><br/><p>I controlled Enigma with Peruta Circuit to the best of my ability to do as much damage as I could. There really was nothing better than Peruta Circuit for controlling a large power that even I was incapable of understanding.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>Even after leaving my spear and thus my control, Enigma continued to spin endlessly as it ravaged the Lava King\u2019s body. It almost felt like it could kill the Lava King directly!</p><br/><p>[A mere human dares to injure my body!!!]</p><br/><p>The flames on his body exploded. Although his mana was decreasing, it was still overwhelming, as his giant mana became a torrent of flames of an indescribable temperature and swept toward us like a tidal wave. This was undoubtedly the highest ranked flames he could ignite! I knew instinctively that this was the EX rank! Flames one must burn his soul to ignite!</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone dodge!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time I shouted towards everyone to dodge, Hwaya also shouted. She was soaring up from the crater. Her eyes were shining with a strange red light, and there were no signs on her body that she had stopped the volcano\u2019s eruption. Instead, several tens of enormous masses of magma circled around her, as if to act as her guard.</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya, you\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you get it now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya smiled bashfully. Then, she made a peace sign with her fingers.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can go to Beyond now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s important!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving my shouting behind, Hwaya shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see if your flames can win against Agni!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Lava King\u2019s flames fiercely clashed with the masses of magma Hwaya shot out. Surprisingly, they were neck and neck. A god\u2019s true name could even resist EX ranked flames! In any case, I had to make use of this opportunity. I gripped my spear and charged towards the Lava King. The mana of Enigma gathered on the spear tip and caused a powerful rotation. It was almost as if I was using an electric drill.</p><br/><p>[Kuk, do you think a human can overcome this king just by obtaining a god\u2019s power!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why there\u2019s the saying, there\u2019s no shame in a pack of hyena attacking a lion!\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied for Hwaya as I charged towards him with my spear. His flames were occupied with Hwaya\u2019s flames and could not affect me in the slightest. The Lava King seemed to have resorted to physical brawls, as he flew towards me with his giant body!</p><br/><p>[Why don\u2019t we fight!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sure can move quick for someone so heavy!\u201d</p><br/><p>With every flap of his wings, the distance between us shortened. His tail shook ominously as it gathered flames at the end of it. As a precaution, I called Lotte.</p><br/><p>\u201cLotte!\u201d</p><br/><p>[My all for Hero!]</p><br/><p>Although her battle cry was a bit worrying, I ignored it temporarily. She flew in front of me and hid herself within the light. The name \u2018Blaze Queen\u2019 suited her perfectly as she was a brilliant luminosity, not just flames!</p><br/><p>[Take this!]</p><br/><p>[Stop annoying me, Wyvern!]</p><br/><p>Lotte charged forward, and the Lava king swung his tail. Surprisingly, in the middle of flying, Lotte disappeared. The moment the Lava King\u2019s tail struck empty air, Lotte penetrated his abdomen and appeared behind him!</p><br/><p>A huge amount of blood became dispersed in the air. To think she could penetrate through his body directly!</p><br/><p>[Kak!]</p><br/><p>[Hero, now!]</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, now\u2019s the time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with Lotte\u2019s shout, I affirmed my resolve and shot my spear into him as I activated a skill. The enormous mana swirling around my body directly\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the next moment, I was thrown vulnerably in front of my giant enemy\u2019s eyes. No, that wasn\u2019t it.</p><br/><p>My body had shrunk.</p><br/><p>[I was waiting for this very moment!]</p><br/><p>The Lava King opened his mouth. What could be seen within was an endless void and an undulating fire of hell. I grinned.</p><br/><p>Then, he swallowed me.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

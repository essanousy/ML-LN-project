What Happened Twice Will... (3)</p><br/><p>[Your strength, constitution, and magic increases by 20%. All stats increase by 5. Your affinity to all elements increases, and your affinity to the light element increases greatly. Your resistance to poison increases greatly.]</p><br/><p>[Once per day, you can summon Shiva\u2019s trident, \u2018Trishula\u2019, for 30 minutes. The summoned Trishula will become infused into your weapon and will increase your spear technique\u2019s rank by one level. When attacking, you have a 10% chance of attacking the enemy thrice, dealing 3 times the normal damage.]</p><br/><p>[Once per month, you can summon Shiva\u2019s gana[1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gana], \u2018Nandi\u2019, for 5 minutes. Nandi is a giant bull, and will go berserk upon summoning without caring for its body. It possesses power befitting of a gana of the Destruction God, charging forward with the sole purpose of destroying your target.]</p><br/><p>[Once per year, you can use \u2018Eye of the Destruction God.\u2019 A third eye said to exist on Shiva\u2019s forehead opens, shooting a powerful beam of light forward. As it flies in the speed of light, it is said to be unavoidable and said to be able to destroy anything. Its attack power increases based on your stats.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained three gods\u2019 true names with the body of a human! This is a miraculous event never before seen in the history of the dungeon. Although there are countless other gods who wish to bestow their names to you, it is extremely difficult to carry four gods\u2019 true names with the body of a human. However, if you advance from your current realm, it might be possible to obtain a fourth god\u2019s true name!]</p><br/><p>Although I thought I had gotten stronger, the shock I received this time was enormous. When I obtained Hermes\u2019 true name, my speed had increased by 15%, and when I obtained Zeus\u2019 true name, my strength and charm had increased by 15%. This time, however, my strength, constitution, and magic had all increased by 20%! Without decreasing other stats!</p><br/><p>15% to 30%, 30% to 60%. Rather than the shock from the doubled percentages, the shock from the change in strength, constitution, and magic had greater impact on my body. It was so great that my body, which had conquered 20 Beyond Floors and was at level 71, felt like it was breaking.</p><br/><p>The pain couldn\u2019t even be compared to when I obtained Zeus\u2019 true name. A boundless divine power was surging through my entire body, amplifying my mana and strengthening my muscles and bones. My body was evolving to become more god-like. I gritted my teeth to not fall unconscious.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it\u2026 I don\u2019t even get a choice of gods\u2019 true names this time\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Zeus and Thor had offered their names together. It seemed the strongest deity in Hinduism didn\u2019t want to be compared with another god and put in a place where he had to wait for my decision. His method of bestowing his true name was too violent.</p><br/><p>For 10 minutes, I writhed in pain as I endured the transformation my body was undergoing. When I got up after the pain subsided, I could feel the change. When I checked my status, my HP had gone past 100,000 and my MP had gone past 180,000. 180,000! The amount of mana flowing through my body had become this monstrous!</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the world\u2019s enemy I faced in the Sylon continent had even mightier mana. Not just mana, but his pure physical abilities had surpassed every bit of my imagination. Even if I had gotten stronger, there could be others who were stronger. There was no guarantee that the unknown world\u2019s enemy Earth was facing was weaker than the Book Walker\u2019s leader, and the Demon Lord was undoubtedly stronger. Even with a third god\u2019s true name, I wasn\u2019t confident in being able to take the Demon Lord\u2019s life.</p><br/><p>Of course, that didn\u2019t mean that I was weak. It was just that the target of comparison was bad. If I utilized the power I obtained this time well, I could probably fight evenly with a world\u2019s enemy on the Lava King\u2019s level.</p><br/><p>Trishula, which raised my spear technique rank and increased my attack power, was perfect for me, and although it could only be used once per month, Nandi was also a wide area weapon with immense destructive power.</p><br/><p>Finally, there was Shiva\u2019s third eye, which could destroy anything. Since it could only be used one per year, its destructive power was guaranteed. Even the Demon Lord wouldn\u2019t be able to ignore this attack. Thinking about all these, I felt full of spirit. With this, I had obtained another potent way of attacking!</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. I can still become much stronger!\u201d</p><br/><p>I had only just cleared the 70th floor. Including Beyond and the First Dungeon, there were still 60 floors to go. I could definitely grow stronger by several times.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reward\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The message window kept bugging me to pick my reward. I only had one choice, so I didn\u2019t know why it wouldn\u2019t just give it to me! I picked the Shadow-Hidden Blade as I grumbled. I expected it to be a weapon, but it was unexpectedly an earring.</p><br/><p>[Shadow-Hidden Blade (Epic)</p><br/><p>Durability \u2013 850/850</p><br/><p>Equipment Requirement \u2013 Elder Reaper\u2019s Master, Strength 300+, Magic 300+</p><br/><p>Option \u2013 Strength +30, Magic +30. When you attack or are attacked, and the attack lands as a critical hit, a large reaper\u2019s scythe appears and attacks the enemy. The attack power of the reaper\u2019s scythe increases based on your strength and magic stats.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, this is\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The item description was short, but the effect was nothing to scoff at. The fact that it also activated when I was hit by a critical hit was a great advantage. Although I would need to use it once to make solid judgment, the word \u2018reaper\u2019s scythe\u2019 was strangely enticing.</p><br/><p>After thinking about my choices for a long time, I took off the Blood Succubus\u2019 Earring and put on the Shadow-Hidden Blade. The dark red color of the Blood Succubus\u2019s Earring looked good with the Golden Teardrop which had a beautiful golden gem, but the Shadow-Hidden Blade\u2019s black metallic was more masculine and didn\u2019t go well with the Golden Teardrop.</p><br/><p>Looking at my face reflected on my spear blade, I hesitated. Was this okay?</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s my stats that matter the most, let\u2019s ignore this. It feels like I\u2019m emitting less scent too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Blood Succubus\u2019 Earring had an effect of amplifying my charm and emitting a scent that made it easier for the opposite sex to like me. Although the Blood Succubus\u2019 Earring\u2019s effect became unnoticeable with my overly high charm, I still felt like taking the earring off made the scent diminish. I was certain.</p><br/><p>As I stepped out to the Floor Shop, I decided to give the Blood Succubus\u2019 Earring to Yua, who regularly utilized the charm stat. When Loretta saw me, she flinched.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Did Shin-nim obtain another true name!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep, it was Shiva\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShiva\u2026 The Destruction God!? Shin-nim\u2019s body could contain Shiva\u2019s power? I was just thinking how Shin-nim\u2019s body seemed different\u2026 I\u2019ll have to examine it.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a surprised face, Loretta was feeling my body here and there\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI can clearly see your other thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to check whether something\u2019s wrong with Shin-nim\u2019s body\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEit.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I forcefully dragged Loretta off, she pouted and grumbled. I ignored her complaints and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, is anything off?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes? \u2026 Ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You completely forgot about it with your evil intentions\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think smiling cutely will change anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Next, Loretta thoroughly checked my body without any ulterior motives. She then told me that my body was tense with a third god\u2019s power clashing with the first two gods\u2019 powers. I\u2019d been thinking the same thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo make sure you rest!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I really need to? The 71st floor won\u2019t be hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAccepting three gods\u2019 powers in one body is already shocking. Before they can find their balance, Shin-nim needs to rest. If possible, don\u2019t use their powers and rest thoroughly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I already got ample rest from yesterday. Do I have to rest more?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I asked with a sigh, Loretta clapped and shoved her face towards me. Her golden pupils were staring at me fixedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, play with me! I want to treat Shin-nim to something! Let\u2019s go to Fairy Garden together, hurry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Loretta\u2019s eyes look too dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no evil intentions, really! Not even a bit!\u201d</p><br/><p>I would rather believe my mother\u2019s words that she\u2019d return the New Year\u2019s pocket money I entrusted her with than believe Loretta\u2019s words with her beast-like eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back, Loretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, aaaaah! Shin-nim, Shin-niiiiim!\u201d</p><br/><p>I waved my hand at Loretta who desperately cried out my name, and came out to Earth. I certainly felt a bit off from the shock of receiving Shiva\u2019s true name, and I could somewhat feel the uncontrollable powers clashing against each other within my body. However, ever since I learned mana, I had a cure-all way for when the state of my body was weird. It was Peruta Circuit.</p><br/><p>Yua had gone to school, Father and Ludia were in the dungeon, and Mother had gone to work. As a result, I found myself alone at home. In the serene stillness, I began to circulate Peruta Circuit.</p><br/><p>I gathered the roiling mana in one place and forcefully pulled the stubborn powers with Peruta Circuit\u2019s rotational power. Once incorporated into Peruta Circuit\u2019s flow, the circulation speed accelerated. Pulling outside mana into my body while controlling the mana within me, I refined my mana with endless circulations.</p><br/><p>\u201cGods\u2019 powers are really hard to control\u2026 No, focus, focus.\u201d</p><br/><p>To become more used to a god\u2019s true name and to better draw forth its power, one needed to identify and wield divine power. I recognized Hermes\u2019 power, Zeus\u2019 power, and Shiva\u2019s power as separate entities, and worked to control them.</p><br/><p>To fight against worlds\u2019 enemies, I needed to be able to wield powers outside the dungeon\u2019s system. It was easy to overlook the fact that gods\u2019 true names were also being controlled through the dungeon\u2019s power. Although it was nice having a supporter that helped me wield a god\u2019s power, in the end, I needed to make the powers I had into my own without relying on the dungeon. Only then could I say that I had the qualification to be a holder of a god\u2019s true name.</p><br/><p>I heard that even in the past when the dungeon didn\u2019t exist, gods bestowed deserving people with their names. Just like how I wielded Peruta Circuit, spear technique, and elemental techniques without the system\u2019s help, in the past, gods\u2019 true names must have also been given to people as unique abilities.</p><br/><p>As such, I needed to be able to use gods\u2019 true names like they were my own, not just by shouting skill names. Once I could do that, I would be able to call myself god\u2019s true name holder. When that became possible, my league\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cMm? Didn\u2019t something just flash?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when I thought I had come to grasp something important, my heart thumped. However, no matter how much I tried to recall my thoughts, I couldn\u2019t do so. Since wrenching my head didn\u2019t result in a solution, I decided to go back to focusing on Peruta Circuit. No matter the case, it was certain that I was walking towards the right path!</p><br/><p>Peruta Circuit had the ability to make one focus. Almost as if I was half-asleep, I circulated Peruta Circuit peacefully. Suddenly, I was ambushed by message noona.</p><br/><p>[Event Dungeons have been mass-created on Earth! There are too many dungeons beyond past dungeons\u2019 difficulty. Please clear them before it\u2019s too late!]</p><br/><p>Right.</p><br/><p>What happened twice happened thrice. The sudden attack of Event Dungeons also arrived at the most unexpected time!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

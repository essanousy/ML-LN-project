Requirements of a Dimensional Mercenary (6)</p><br/><p>30 minutes later, I headed to the Residential Area\u2019s trading center with Loretta, who was too worried to send me alone. At the trading center, I saw a hobgoblin looking over documents as always. Explorers moved busily, trying to sell their items directly or through auctions and also registering themselves on the noticeboard. Feeling the numerous gazes that fell on us the moment we appeared, I walked toward the trading center\u2019s administrator.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh if it isn\u2019t Kang Shin! \u2026 And Guild Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>The one in charge of the trading center today wasn\u2019t Meladel, but Eladel. Although I couldn\u2019t really tell them apart, Loretta was there to whisper to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s linking arms with Kang Shin\u2026. Hu, right. I remember.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Eladel. I\u2019m sorry, but there\u2019s something I\u2019d like to ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he was grinning while looking at Loretta, I turned his attention toward me.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you two getting married?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re doing it now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the word \u2018married,\u2019 Loretta became overly excited and pulled on my arm. I flicked her head lightly and calmed her down.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to become a Dimensional Mercenary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You, aren\u2019t you a Hero?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I know what a Hero is too. I want to become a Dimensional Mercenary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 something I can\u2019t recommend. A Hero working as a Dimensional Mercenary... I\u2019ve never heard of it before. Although Dimensional Mercenaries work in a certain degree of safety, if you, a Hero of a world, dies in another world\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t die. Plus, imagining myself with a collar on my neck just because I\u2019m a Hero gives me goosebumps. If you say no, I\u2019ll give up being a Hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s something you can give up so easily, Heroes wouldn\u2019t have agonized for such a long time\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEladel, do as he says. Shin-nim has the right to do as he wishes, and you don\u2019t have the right to stop him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta bluntly spoke to Eladel who seemed to be hesitating. Perhaps Loretta followed me because she knew Eladel would be troubled at my request.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuild Master\u2026 Is that what you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s not like Shin-nim asked to be the Hero. Plus, Shin-nim said he would be a Dimensional Mercenary. Dimensional Mercenaries are existences that both the dungeon and worlds need. As dangerous as it is, the reward is also big. We should respect Shin-nim\u2019s courage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you say that, being a Dimensional Mercenary is dangerous. I can only see his courage as foolish. \u2026 You, are you not projecting someone else onto him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to die, Eladel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Startled, I unlinked Loretta\u2019s arms from mine. I felt that Loretta had said something that didn\u2019t suit her in the slightest. The Loretta just now did not seem like the Loretta I knew. I couldn\u2019t stay still, as she seemed too unfamiliar. I could tell that Eladel\u2019s body also froze when he heard her.</p><br/><p>When I was about to instinctively distance myself from Loretta, she had gone back to her smiling face. It was the Loretta that I knew.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say such a cruel joke. There\u2019s no way I can compare Shin-nim with anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-It was my bad, Guild Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that from now on, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Eladel answered, still trembling from before, Loretta linked her arm back onto mine tightly, as if to prevent me from running away. I hesitated a little, then softly stroked her arm.</p><br/><p>Loretta was Loretta. She had things she didn\u2019t want to tell me and appearances she didn\u2019t want to show me. Without a doubt, some of them would provoke a certain degree of repulsion from me. However, the Loretta that didn\u2019t know what to do because I had discovered it was the Loretta I knew.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t run away, so you don\u2019t have to grab onto me so strongly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta turned toward me and asked with worrying eyes. I lightly smiled and nodded my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you want to go to the wedding hall like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk.\u201d</p><br/><p>After confirming that I had met the requirements to become a Dimensional Mercenary, becoming one was easy. I just had to submit an application.</p><br/><p>[You became a Dimensional Mercenary! You can now accept requests and receive rewards as a Dimensional Mercenary!]</p><br/><p>When I was blankly listening to the message that I had become a Dimensional Mercenary, Eladel gave me an additional explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the First Dungeon, there are currently 57 active Dimensional Mercenaries. You will, of course, become the youngest of them. Dimensional Mercenaries can accept requests from the Residential Area\u2019s request noticeboard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere do requests come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMost of the time, an explorer in need of Dimensional Mercenaries submits a request application to the administrative guild, and if the guild see that it is appropriate, the request will appear on the noticeboard. Then, any Dimensional Mercenary can accept the request. In some cases, the requests come from the dungeon. In this case, the job will be extremely difficult, so you\u2019ll have to prudent when accepting such requests.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the rewards?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? Depending on the results and the level of one\u2019s contribution, the dungeon will provide gold, stat points, skill points, skills, or magic. You can even obtain special equipment. There are also cases where the requester gives additional rewards as thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>The rewards were indeed attractive, especially the stat points and skill points. I could see why others worked as Dimensional Mercenaries. I then asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happens if you give up and return?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSimple. You won\u2019t be able to accept another request for half a year. It\u2019s the duration of Dimensional Travel\u2019s cooldown time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dimensional Travel\u2019s cooldown time was half a year? Mine was undoubtedly half of that, three months. Plus, the cooldown time would decrease when the skill level went up. It was then that I remembered that I was the first explorer to defeat Wendigo alone on my first try. That was probably where the difference came from.</p><br/><p>That said, didn\u2019t that mean there was practically no penalty?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember this, Kang Shin. Dimensional Mercenaries are in a dominant position over the requesters. They\u2019re only working to get the skills and stats the dungeon will provide. Unless the requester provides an extremely attractive reward, they will do as they want.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feeling my image of Dimensional Mercenaries as superheroes shattering, I continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne last thing. How do I check the requests?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you\u2019re within the Residential Area, you can call the request noticeboard at any time and check it there. That\u2019s also a special right given to Dimensional Mercenaries.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, I had heard everything I wanted to. I nodded my head, thanking him, then immediately opened the request noticeboard. Ludia most likely did not put in a request. However, Ludia and Shuna couldn\u2019t be the only survivors of Luka continent.</p><br/><p>As I thought, there was a recent request by a Luka continent explorer. After reading it, I nodded my head. The contents matched what I hoped to do. To save the Luka continent\u2019s kidnapped princess.</p><br/><p>[If you accept the request, you will arrive at the Ehuir Empire. Upon completing the request, you can take any item from the Imperial Palace\u2019s treasure vault. I, Ehuir Empire\u2019s Kiros Knight Commander Bellode, promise. The Demon Lord has been gravely injured by the Hero, so I can guarantee that you will not need to fight the Demon Lord. However, you may need to fight high ranking demons, so only those confident in their abilities should come. On the day of Pallia, six in the afternoon, we will depart together.]</p><br/><p>Reading the request, I took a deep breath, then accepted it.</p><br/><p>[You accepted Bellode Iraus\u2019 request. Including you, 12 Dimensional Mercenaries have accepted the request so far.]</p><br/><p>I was relieved. Perhaps it was because they did not need to fight the Demon Lord, but quite a few Dimensional Mercenaries had accepted the request! Of course, if the situation became dangerous, they would leave Luka continent, but I was relieved that there was still so many of them. With a cheery voice, I messaged Ludia.</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, I became a Dimensional Mercenary. I\u2019m going to your continent to save Shina.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Stupid, it\u2019s dangerous! Don\u2019t come!]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Don\u2019t come? Don\u2019t tell me, you\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia answered after a bit of silence.</p><br/><p>[Right. I returned to the Luka continent.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Even if my world will collapse, I can\u2019t just stay still when my sister\u2019s been kidnapped. If I run, I won\u2019t be able to live a proper life\u2026 so I\u2019m going to go save Shina.]</p><br/><p>It seemed she had already made up her mind. Although she was trembling after the Hero fell, she was now burning, as if she was prepared to die. Not looking after her own safety was foolish, yet it was incredibly beautiful and worthy of respect. Rather than being touched, however, my sense of unease was greater. It was becoming more and more like the situation from my dream.</p><br/><p>I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre your parents fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yeah, they\u2019re both armed, fighting against the invading demons with the empire\u2019s knights and magicians. After all, they\u2019re both First Dungeon explorers.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the first time I heard about that, but that\u2019s good to hear.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed not everything was like my dream. A dream was a dream. Not everything from it could be the truth. After all\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Ludia from my dream had big breasts\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[T-They\u2019re going to get bigger! I\u2019m still growing! Plus, the size of my breasts has nothing to do with you! N-Nothing at all! Not even a little!]</p><br/><p>Ah, I accidentally sent that as a message! But Ludia, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any chance that your breasts will get any bigger\u2026 In any case, I raised my voice to cover my mistake.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, I\u2019m going. Let me help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t come! If it\u2019s doable with just you, then it\u2019s fine even if you\u2019re not here! And if we\u2019re going to fail\u2026 You being there won\u2019t make it a success\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m coming. I can\u2019t leave you alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed Ludia was still underestimating me. I had many trump cards in my arsenal. I doubted I could do anything against the Demon Lord, but I at least had ways to turn the battlefield around completely.</p><br/><p>However, Ludia didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Ludia?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Uk! You stupid! I\u2019m Ehuir Empire\u2019s crown princess. No one\u2019s going to leave me alone! Y-You\u2019re self-conscious!]</p><br/><p>Her voice was shaking slightly as she responded. I may have made her angry. Even so, I had no intention of backing down.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there soon, wait for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You can come if you want to come so much! It\u2019s not my problem if you die though. I don\u2019t care about your world at all!]</p><br/><p>After shouting, Ludia hung up. I grinned and checked my equipment. Next to me, Loretta was standing there with worried eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it gets dangerous, you have to use Return without hesitation, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have enough potions? You might have to sleep outside, so should I let you borrow my bed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want me to sleep outside on a bed? It\u2019s fine. I have a sleeping bag and tent in my inventory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you missing anything? You should check one more time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, now that you mention it.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was something I decided to do before I left. Since I didn\u2019t know what would happen, I wanted to make myself as strong as possible. There was one thing I could do now.</p><br/><p>It was to raise my skill levels.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>The one evidence no one expected, showing Shin\u2019s dream wasn\u2019t absolute! Damn, I at least wanted that part to be true!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What Happened Twice Will... (7)</p><br/><p>I instantly recognized the being that appeared in front of us. It was incredibly difficult not to, given his humongous size. On the other hand, he was extremely thin! Long serrated tail that stretched out backwards and forward-facing eyes. He was\u2026</p><br/><p>[A ray! You\u2019re a ray!]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m the king of all who hides, the king of all who protect their lofty leagues by hiding! I am the Hermit King!]</p><br/><p>[Ah, an electric ray! Plene, it\u2019s dangerous. Go back to the mansion!]</p><br/><p>[You! Listen to me!]</p><br/><p>As I coincidentally knew the characteristics of an electric ray, I quickly summoned Peika and infused her into my body, and glanced at Plene to motion for her to leave. However, Plene shook her head helplessly.</p><br/><p>[It won\u2019t open. I can\u2019t go back!]</p><br/><p>[No one can escape from me! I am the Hermit King, appearing only when my victory is assured, leaving no prey behind!]</p><br/><p>[Gaze activates! Your movement speed falls slightly. You cannot open your inventory. Your health and mana recovery speed decreases slightly. When being gazed at by your enemy, you will not be able to use Return!]</p><br/><p>[Damn!]</p><br/><p>Was the Gaze skill something all worlds\u2019 enemies could use!? Being stared down by his eyes, I couldn\u2019t get myself to calm down. There was no choice but to fight him. Before he attacked, I quickly called Sharana and Ruyue.</p><br/><p>[Protect everyone, Sharana, Ruyue!]</p><br/><p>[Leave it to us!]</p><br/><p>Almost immediately afterwards, the electric ray shot out pale blue lightning from his entire body.</p><br/><p>[Pay the price for your impudence to this king!]</p><br/><p>[Peika!]</p><br/><p>[I can handle this much!]</p><br/><p>As we were underwater, his lightning spread to all sides the moment it was released. We were instantly enveloped by his lightning, and I grit my teeth and endured it with Peika\u2019s power. At the same time, I felt something strange.</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Isn\u2019t this guy weak?]</p><br/><p>[I think so too!]</p><br/><p>His attack wasn\u2019t as bad as I\u2019d expected. Of course, it was partly because of Peika\u2019s power as a lightning elemental, but Peika was still just an elemental while our opponent was a world\u2019s enemy. It was strange that we could take on his attack so easily.</p><br/><p>When I turned around, Ruyue and Sharana seemed to have also held on by freezing and strengthening the air bubble Lotte, Plene, and Licorice were in. The fact that the lightning\u2019s power spread by being underwater instead of concentrating in one place also seemed to have helped, but still\u2026</p><br/><p>[Now that I think about it, Gaze skill\u2019s effect was weak too Its effect is probably proportional to the user\u2019s power. Not to mention\u2026]</p><br/><p>Even if the Hermit King was a hermit and was an expert in hiding as he said, why would he have stayed hidden all this time on Earth?</p><br/><p>Now that I thought about it, the Mariana Trench was close to the Philippines. Right.</p><br/><p>Philippines. Until not long ago, there was a terrifying monster there.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Lava King was looking for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You met the Lava King, Hero!? B-But there is no way he knows where I am!]</p><br/><p>He bit the bait.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were hiding from him!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I was concealing myself! I was not hiding from the other kings because I was afraid!]</p><br/><p>As I thought, he was hiding from the Lava King. Afraid he would be discovered if he moved, he hid in the Mariana Trench, which was the deepest place on Earth!</p><br/><p>I had considered it when I heard Lotte speak. Although the five kings shared the same goal, it seemed their relationship wasn\u2019t particularly good. If a king had to hide in fear of another king, this couldn\u2019t be the only case.</p><br/><p>Now that the thought crossed my mind, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. I could understand why he appeared so grandly. We must have been the first humans he saw in a long time! Not to mention, since Earth\u2019s Hero, who was his main target, appeared in front of him on his own, he must have been extremely happy.</p><br/><p>The Hermit King seemed to have noticed what I was thinking, as he spoke in an uncomfortable tone.</p><br/><p>[Earth\u2019s Hero is so arrogant. If we knew you were so foolish, we wouldn\u2019t have all needed to come!]</p><br/><p>\u201cStop talking shit and come!\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t even need to provoke him, as he immediately released another powerful lightning attack. Though I didn\u2019t know exactly where to attack, I charged towards his body and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are our reinforcements!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[We\u2019ll have to give up, Dear Husband! Even the closest team needs 2 hours to come!]</p><br/><p>I took the Hermit King\u2019s lightning directly and pondered as I endured it. Rather than enduring his attacks for 2 hours, although it might be dangerous, it was better to go on the offensive and aim for his life. Since I couldn\u2019t open my inventory, I had to fight with just the few potions I had on hand. It was impossible to hold out for two hours with so few potions.</p><br/><p>[Show me the power of a Hero!]</p><br/><p>[Damn right I will!]</p><br/><p>After replying to the Hermit King, I used Weapon Swap to equip my crossbow and shot dozens of bolts towards him. He seemed surprised at the invisible attack, but just as I expected, the bolts had little effect.</p><br/><p>[Is this it!?]</p><br/><p>[I bet it stung more than your lightning!]</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t expect much from my attack in the first place. The crossbow was good for attacking the unexpecting enemy in their vitals, but even if I shot his eyes, the bolts couldn\u2019t even leave a scratch. Rather than doing damage, it only made him angrier.</p><br/><p>Even if the Hermit King seemed weak, it didn\u2019t change the fact that he was one of the five kings. It would be a different story if all members of Revival were here, but it was indeed difficult to take him on just by myself. If I used Overlord already, I would certainly lose.</p><br/><p>However, if I could force him to let his guard down, it was undoubtedly possible for me to defeat him alone. And to force him to let his guard down\u2026</p><br/><p>[Dear Husband, I\u2019ll join you!]</p><br/><p>[I hate getting wet, but\u2026 I hate seeing Hero getting hurt even more.]</p><br/><p>[I, I\u2019ll sing too!]</p><br/><p>\u201cJust make sure you don\u2019t get injured! Ruyue, protect Licorice and Plene! Sharana, protect Lotte!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un!]</p><br/><p>[Understood!]</p><br/><p>With the elementals\u2019 help, Licorice, Lotte, and Plene charged into battle. To block the lightning the Hermit King was releasing even now, Ruyue protected the air bubble Licorice and Plene were in, and Sharana enveloped Lotte\u2019s body with her wind to allow her to freely move underwater without getting wet. Though they couldn\u2019t nullify the Hermit King\u2019s lightning entirely, it was still better than receiving his attack directly.</p><br/><p>As Licorice could use powerful magic in all elements, she could perform better than I can against worlds\u2019 enemies. Similarly for Lotte, as long as she wasn\u2019t beaten by the Hermit King\u2019s lightning, she could deal great damage to the electric ray with her power of fire.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, it was hard for Plene to do anything against him. It was unknown how much her songs could affect the Hermit King. However, it seemed she had something in mind, as she started to sing with a resolute face.</p><br/><p>[Lalalala~]</p><br/><p>Her voice flowed out of the air bubble strengthened by Ruyue\u2019s power without any resistance. I had expected this much to happen, but what I didn\u2019t expect was what happened next. Her voice didn\u2019t travel far and stayed close to us. This strange scene made even the Hermit King stop attacking. The effect of Plene\u2019s singing was then notified through a message.</p><br/><p>[Siren\u2019s \u2018Song of Blessing\u2019 resounds. Your speed increases greatly and your resistance to the enemy\u2019s magical attacks increases. Your chance of receiving critical hits decreases, while your chance of dealing critical hits increases.]</p><br/><p>[This is\u2026 a buff!?]</p><br/><p>I was surprised even though I was experiencing it directly. To think that sirens could use buff type skills. I had always thought Plene specialized in drawing in mobs and using curses and debuffs, but it seemed that wasn\u2019t the case.</p><br/><p>When I looked behind me, Plene was making a proud expression as she continued singing. I would need to compliment her later. Though, I\u2019d also need to complain why she didn\u2019t tell us about it earlier.</p><br/><p>[What a beautiful song. What a beautiful woman!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was releasing lightning once again! I jumped in directly and used Weapon Swap to equip Chaotic Spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, focus on defense for now!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Okay!]</p><br/><p>Lotte, who could now move as if she was flying thanks to Sharana\u2019s power, was charging towards the Hermit King from the opposite side. Seeing as how her face was heated red, it seemed she would breathe out fire the moment she reached the Hermit King.</p><br/><p>I also rushed forward, aiming for the Hermit King\u2019s eyes which had been bothering me for a while. Although his lightning became fiercer and took away my health, that much pain didn\u2019t faze me in the slightest.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see how strong your eyes are!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You think I\u2019ll let you!?]</p><br/><p>The Hermit King snorted and trembled. Immediately, I stopped my charge. He had disappeared completely.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t detect him.\u201d</p><br/><p>I thought it was an invisibility skill, but that wasn\u2019t it. I couldn\u2019t feel his presence at all. Lotte, who was rushing forward from the opposite side, also stopped with a confused look. Hermit King, to think he had an ability like this!</p><br/><p>[Good, that\u2019s the expression I like to see! I\u2019ll first swallow your woman along with her singing!]</p><br/><p>His voice rang out from afar. He wasn\u2019t aiming for me, but rather Plene and Licorice!</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, is it teleportation!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The giant ray opened his mouth. Before it shut and swallowed Licorice and Plene, Licorice spread her arm out. Immediately, a pillar of ice appeared from the bottom of his mouth to the ceiling.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>The Hermit King howled and spat out lightning, but Licorice worked with Ruyue and had already escaped from his range.</p><br/><p>[Elemental, move!]</p><br/><p>[I was going to!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was charging towards Licorice and Plene again! I used Divine Speed and shot out the Chaotic Spear in my hand. The target point was his eye!</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u201d</p><br/><p>[How laughable!]</p><br/><p>The water resistance caused the spear slowed down even more than I expected, but it thankfully struck the Hermit King before he could dodge it.</p><br/><p>However, even though the spear had penetrated deep into its eye, the Hermit King didn\u2019t seem too affected by it. It made sense. No matter how much I strengthened it with my Heroic Aura, compared to his giant eye, it was like a toothpick.</p><br/><p>[Kuhaha, what did you do!? I was expecting much more from you, but in the end, you\u2019re just a human!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou better fix that impatient personality of yours first!\u201d</p><br/><p>I sneered at him and clenched my fist. Following Peruta Circuit\u2019s energy, connecting my fist and my spear, my mana ignited chaos flames and burned his eye\u2019s inside.</p><br/><p>Chaos flames were flames in the end. As they couldn\u2019t be easily ignited underwater, this was what I had thought of. As it relied on high class techniques like Peruta Circuit and Mad Typhoon, its effect was indeed excellent.</p><br/><p>[Kuuuuk!]</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, chaos flames work!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the past, I couldn\u2019t take out chaos flames as the opponent was the Lava King. This time, however, the opponent was a underwater monster. Fire was perfect for cooking fish! After being confident in the amount of chaos flames I ignited, I pulled back on my hand slightly and retrieved the spear. This strange flame that didn\u2019t lose out to the Hermit King\u2019s resistance continued to burn wonderfully.</p><br/><p>[I see, this flame won\u2019t go away until I kill you, Hero\u2026!]</p><br/><p>He seemed to have realized what he was dealing with as he turned to directly face me. Blue lightning repeatedly crackled around him and diffusing into the surroundings. An overwhelming amount of mana that I had felt from the Lava King before was gathering within him.</p><br/><p>[This is the power of a king! Despair!]</p><br/><p>[I will not let Hero get hurt!]</p><br/><p>Before the Hermit King released his lightning, Lotte\u2019s kick struck his tail. Kick!? I doubted my eyes for a moment, but Lotte was indeed flying through the water at an incredible speed and continuously kicking his tail.</p><br/><p>Immediately afterwards, about half of his tail was severed. The Blaze Queen\u2019s focused attacks had been strong enough to annihilate a part of a king\u2019s body. The problem was the Hermit King\u2019s response.</p><br/><p>[Fine, I\u2019ll kill this annoying bitch first!]</p><br/><p>The lightning building up in his body instantly shot out towards Lotte! Although Lotte shot back and Sharana cast a barrier of wind around her, the Hermit King\u2019s lightning couldn\u2019t be stopped.</p><br/><p>Damn, even with Divine Speed, I couldn\u2019t get close enough to her! Although I had gotten used to moving underwater, the Hermit King\u2019s lightning was still faster than I could reach my hand forward\u2026!</p><br/><p>[This ray!]</p><br/><p>Almost as if she read my mind, Licorice reached her hand forward in my place. Sucking in Licorice\u2019s boundless magic power, pillars of ice appeared everywhere and slammed down on the giant ray\u2019s body. However, these pillars couldn\u2019t stop his lightning, and blue lightning struck Lotte.</p><br/><p>[Kuuk!]</p><br/><p>\u201cLotte!\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s okay, it wasn\u2019t a direct hit!]</p><br/><p>My heart dropped, thinking I might lose her, but Sharana\u2019s confident shout calmed me down. However, Lotte was still incapacitated from the attack.</p><br/><p>This was my mistake. Although I had attacked with chaos flames, Lotte was hurt because I underestimated his lightning. In exchange for injuring the king, Lotte was taken out of fight. It was simple to see that we were at a disadvantage.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, the Hermit King\u2019s affinity with water didn\u2019t seem as high as the Lava King\u2019s affinity with fire, as he couldn\u2019t recover his injuries through contact with water.</p><br/><p>[I will show you why this Hermit King is so fearful!]</p><br/><p>However, with these words, the Hermit King\u2019s presence disappeared once again. In that instant, I realized his secret.</p><br/><p>I became certain.</p><br/><p>I could defeat him!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What We Can Do (2)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Chapter 144. What We Can Do (2)</p><br/><p>Guild Revival\u2019s accomplishments quickly spread. It was only obvious. Father said he\u2019d act alone, so only beautiful girls were left to clear Event Dungeons. No matter how weak they were, they would have received attention. What made it worse was that each of them had incredible strength. Even the lowest leveled Shuna had a special ability passed down in her royal family, granting her shocking defensive capability.</p><br/><p>Perhaps because she was similar to Sumire in a lot of ways, they got along well. From what I heard in the guild communication channel, it seemed they were best friends. They were around the same age as well.</p><br/><p>In any case, the 5 girls didn\u2019t hide their identities and confidently marched into the gates of countries that allowed foreign ability users to enter them. Of course, Hwaya provided her private plane for transportation.</p><br/><p>Regardless of whether the Event Dungeons were ranked C or A, they cleared them thoroughly. Even when Event Raids broke out, they effortlessly cleared them. Since the Flame Witch Hwaya Mastiford was already well known, people at first suspected that they were affiliated with Britain\u2019s Guardian. However, after they identified Ludia and Ye-Eun as the girls who fought with Dragon Knight in America, they began to say that the group was under Dragon Knight\u2019s command. They were right.</p><br/><p>Their decisive and swift action of destroying Event Dungeons regardless of their ranks drew the attention of other ability users and various mass media. They probably wanted to know our objective, but Hwaya avoided contact with the media. After all, even if Hwaya didn\u2019t explain, everyone should already know why Event Dungeons had to be destroyed. Hwaya simply led the others to clear as many Event Dungeons as possible.</p><br/><p>Thanks to their action, other regions began to clear their Event Dungeons too. They were probably thinking something like, \u2018I don\u2019t know what\u2019s what, but they must be getting something amazing. So Let\u2019s do it, too!\u2019</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t wrong. Hwaya and the others were getting great benefits from clearing the Event Dungeons. However, these benefits were only available to dungeon explorers, not regular ability users. That said, if they could reduce the harm caused by governments trying to let Event Dungeons turn into Field Dungeons, that would be good for the future.</p><br/><p>As each Event Dungeons gave at least 1 bonus stat, Hwaya and the others grew greatly, clearing 88 dungeons in the given time. Since they even cleared Event Raids perfectly, I couldn\u2019t help but be jealous after calculating the stat bonuses they must have gotten. Of course, I wasn\u2019t so stupid as to make them stop and wait for me. To me, the current training was the most important. I could bear with hearing Hwaya\u2019s bragging.</p><br/><p>[Huhu, I just cleared my 30th.]</p><br/><p>[Congratulations, father.]</p><br/><p>Father also destroyed many dungeons by himself. Considering how confident he was of late, it seemed he had mastered high-rank Spear Technique. I was certain, considering how he was bragging about reaching a new height in his spearmanship. He was worthy of the self-proclaimed title of world\u2019s strongest.</p><br/><p>[How are you doing lately, son? Is your spear training going well?]</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s so-so. I\u2019m coming close to grasping it.]</p><br/><p>[Ho, even so, you won\u2019t be able to reach father\u2019s level.]</p><br/><p>[Just wait and see.]</p><br/><p>I had to concentrate on Beyond even more. Today was the last day of the one month period I promised.</p><br/><p>With Guild Revival\u2019s effort, and Guardian and Freedom Wing trying to clear high-ranked dungeons, 222 Event Dungeons had been cleared so far. It was just over half of the total. There were still two SS ranked dungeons in Russia and America, and 14 other dungeons ranked S+ or above. There were 35 dungeons between A rank and S rank, which the government elites were trying to clear, and 167 dungeons ranked B or below, which various governments were scheming to turn into Field Dungeons.</p><br/><p>Good. With just that, it was worth a try.</p><br/><p>[Kiaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>[Kyaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>Standing in the middle of a long and straight pathway, I glanced at the front and back. Hundreds of Wraith Queens were screaming and flying toward me.</p><br/><p>[Soul Guard became level 7. You develop a perfect resistance to almost all mental attacks. Your league of existence increases further. Weapons without mana can no longer hurt you.]</p><br/><p>Ooh, just by being here, I can feel my Soul Guard\u2019s experience skyrocketing! However, I couldn\u2019t just stay here forever. The hasty Wraith Queens had already begun spitting out ectoplasm arrows.</p><br/><p>I shot out a few crossbow bolts, shooting down the arrows I couldn\u2019t possibly avoid. Then, I lowered my center of gravity. Below my feet, light whirlpools appeared, sending me flying. After Peruta Circuit reached level 7, I became able to apply Peruta Circuit to a certain extent.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shooting forward forcefully, I slashed the Wraith Queen in front of me. Immediately afterward, I stepped on the ground, shooting up like a spring and activating a skill. It was Gale Track.</p><br/><p>[Kiaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThird, fourth, fifth!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gluttony Spear beamed with golden Spirit Aura as it pierced through all enemies blocking its path. As Spear Technique leveled up, each attack drew out more damage. As a result, the Wraith Queens in Gale Track\u2019s path died instantly when they were unlucky. Of course, once I killed ten Wraith Queens, adding 50% bonus damage to my attack, they all died instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuaaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kyaaaa!]</p><br/><p>[My\u2026 heart\u2026.!]</p><br/><p>Peika was infused in my spear, while Ruyue stayed on the outside, hindering Wraith Queens\u2019 movements and leading them so that I can kill them more easily. Peika\u2019s ability focused on attacking, while Ruyue\u2019s ability could be used in various ways.</p><br/><p>\u201cEvery single one of you, come!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You used Provoke! All enemies in the area attack you with great hostility!]</p><br/><p>[Kill that human!]</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t let him leave!]</p><br/><p>[Make him our ally!]</p><br/><p>[A male\u2026 ally\u2026 Wraith King?]</p><br/><p>[Make him our ally!]</p><br/><p>[Husband\u2026 I mean, ally!]</p><br/><p>Huk! The Wraith Queens\u2019 eyes were flashing strangely! They were like the eyes Loretta sometimes had!</p><br/><p>Using Gale Track, I charged through to where the gate was, shredding all Wraith Queens on my way. Once I was in front of the gate, I turned around, surging with great rotational force. The wind energy gathered on the tip of my spear, seemingly wanting to burst out at any moment. It traveled around my body, then gathered on the tip of my spear again.</p><br/><p>I raised my spear. There were still about a hundred Wraith Queens left alive.</p><br/><p>\u201cElemental Tempest!\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s a festival!]</p><br/><p>[Wind, fan!]</p><br/><p>[Super spin spin~!]</p><br/><p>Elementals flew toward my spear, where wind energy spiraled around. With the addition of the elementals, the spear gave off a rainbow light. The explosive wind energy and power from the elementals caused my hand holding the spear to shake, but I firmly gripped my spear with a snort.</p><br/><p>Then, I thrust it forward.</p><br/><p>[Kyaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>With 50% of my mana instantly leaving my body, a sense of fatigue swept through my body. I stretched my foot back and prevented myself from falling. The Wraith Queens filling up the pathway died in mass, and I constantly heard messages that I obtained 3,000 gold.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu, it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was really over. Seeing the wide pathway completely empty, I was deeply moved. Now, I couldn\u2019t grind even if I wanted to.</p><br/><p>Currently, my Spear Technique was level 9. This had happened almost two weeks ago. Still, I didn\u2019t know if the last two months of grinding would let me master my Spear Technique. Skill experience wasn\u2019t something I could calculate. However, I couldn\u2019t just stay here forever.</p><br/><p>Even if I couldn\u2019t master high-ranked Spear Technique, it was fine. It didn\u2019t mean that the two months of training was meaningless. I grew more used to practical application of Peruta Circuit in battles, and I was confident I had reached great heights in my spearmanship. Soul Guard had reached level 7, and my Elementalist abilities also grew. That was enough.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then\u2026 let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a sense of unease, I stepped beyond the gate. In that instant, several messages rang in my ear.</p><br/><p>[You conquered Beyond\u2019s 3rd floor. You can challenge the dungeon\u2019s 54th floor.]</p><br/><p>[Your maximum HP and MP increase by 2%. You obtained 5 bonus stats.]</p><br/><p>[Experience has been added to skills you frequently used to progress through Beyond\u2019s 3rd floor.]</p><br/><p>[High-rank Martial Arts became level 5! Positive effects will be added to all actions using your body!]</p><br/><p>[Mid-rank Crossbow Marksmanship became level 8. You can shoot without aiming and hit your target\u2019s vital points.]</p><br/><p>[You mastered low-rank Gale Track! The wind energy gathered for the final blow is amplified.]</p><br/><p>[You learned mid-rank Gale Track! Every time an enemy is pushed away, your attack power increases by 7% up to 200%!]</p><br/><p>[Mid-rank Dash became level 6! Positive effects will be added to all charge type skills!]</p><br/><p>[Peruta Circuit became level 8! Even in fierce battles, you can circulate Peruta Circuit and recover mana like normal. At the same time, you can effectively attack and defend using the flow of mana.]</p><br/><p>[Soul Guard became level 8! Your lofty league renders most mental attacks ineffective and reflects them back to their user. You will not be intimidated by enemies stronger than you, and as your existence becomes more complete, your resistance to dark mana increases greatly.]</p><br/><p>[Overwhelm became level 2! Just by existing, you cause all enemies to tremble. It decreases all of your opponent's abilities by 10%. The chance of your opponent failing to activate a skill increases by 10%]</p><br/><p>[High-rank Spirit Mastery became level 2. All souls connected to you obtained the possibility to leap past their souls\u2019 original potential.]</p><br/><p>And.</p><br/><p>[You mastered high-rank Spear Technique! When you\u2019re holding a spear, aura will form automatically. Even without a spear, you can create a spear using your aura. You greatly intimidate enemies with lower levels of weapon techniques. Your spear begins to sprout the potential to covet godhood.]</p><br/><p>[Now, you must create your own Spear Technique. This path is long and arduous, and is bound to happen slowly. Do not get impatient. If you can seek help, it is recommended that you do so. Unique Spear Techniques that surpass high-rank Spear Technique are not created so easily.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your concern, message noona.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cBut instead of worrying about that, first\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Loretta widening her eyes, I grinned and waved my hand. Then, I shouted inwardly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes! I mastered Spear Technique! \u2018</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, you finally came back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I obtained what I wanted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHigh-rank Spear Technique master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta\u2019s jaws dropped.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid\u2026 Did you just say master? A high-rank weapon technique?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Father seems to have mastered it too. Shouldn\u2019t most Gold ranked explorers have it mastered?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want come with me to the Residential Area and try shouting that out loud? I can promise you, people will start throwing stones at you within 30 seconds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI worked hard for two months, you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew, I don\u2019t know what to say to Shin-nim, but\u2026 I\u2019m glad you\u2019re back safe and sound.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because Loretta\u2019s gaze was making me feel slightly uncomfortable, I took a step back. Loretta\u2019s eyes quickly narrowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is our reunion after two months. Can\u2019t you be happier, Shin-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just have a lot to do. I\u2019m going to be busy from now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta stared at me intently. Her golden eyes were so clear and bright that they seemed to be sucking out my soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What\u2019s wrong, Loretta?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, with me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith Loretta?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta\u2019s lips lightly budged. It seemed she was hesitating to say something.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith me\u2026 No, nevermind. It\u2019s nothing. What am I saying\u2026 Huu, it\u2019s nothing. Shin-nim is doing well. I\u2019m just feeling a bit uneasy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you say it so I can understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI meant Shin-nim should let me know when things get rough. Let me know even if things don\u2019t. I can at least give Shin-nim a massage. Though, I\u2019ll take proper compensation for it that\u2019s not money, huhu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re saying that because you\u2019re worried about me, but I won\u2019t ever ask Loretta for a massage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta clicked her tongue. Then, she laughed lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis much should be fine. But Shin-nim, you can\u2019t overwork yourself. When things get too tiring and difficult, you have to let me know. I\u2019m saying this seriously, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not tiring and difficult at all, but sure, I will.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tiring and difficult? It seemed Loretta didn\u2019t know me that well. As I headed to my mansion after saying goodbye, I thought, \u2018I\u2019ve never been more full of energy in my entire life! Strengthening my abilities, learning spearmanship! Reaching new heights I\u2019ve never seen! These things were erasing the irritation I was feeling from everything!\u2019</p><br/><p>There was no one at the mansion. It seemed everyone was busy working. That was good. If possible, I didn\u2019t want to be bothered.</p><br/><p>I headed to the basement training room. Standing in the middle of the dark and spacious room, I closed my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeific Manifestation!\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t someone calling my name[1. Remember, Deific Manifestation = Kang Shin (in Korean) = MC\u2019s name]. It wasn\u2019t even me calling my own name.</p><br/><p>[Using half of your mana and vitality, you manifest the Mythological Heroic Spirit, \u2018Peruta Rello Vatifoa,\u2019 for 37 minutes and 21 seconds.]</p><br/><p>It was a call for the guide who would help me take a step forward.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Next chapter is the long awaited appearance of Peruta\u2019s Spear Technique! Look forward to it!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

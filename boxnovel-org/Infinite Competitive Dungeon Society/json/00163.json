The Rondo of Scarlet Flame and Silver Ice (6)</p><br/><p>Although I wanted to wait until Illina fully calmed down, I was also anxious to save the surviving ability user. As such, as soon as Illina\u2019s crying subsided, I patted her head and told her, \u201cIllina, I\u2019m sorry, but there\u2019s someone I need to save. Stay with Hwaya for a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIna.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIna?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Mommy and Daddy calls me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Okay, Ina. Wait a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing me call her Ina, she let me go. Worrying that there was possibly no way out of this situation, I approached the ability user with worry. Although everyone else turned into ice zombies and shattered, he was still alive. However, he was in a much worse situation than before, as he was frozen up to his eyes. Thankfully, Ruyue\u2019s ability had gotten stronger at just the right time, and the freezing had stopped.</p><br/><p>When I approached the others, Walker was the first to speak to me teasingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, here comes the father.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWalker, if you want to fight, come. I\u2019ll be happy to crush you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but I\u2019m not cruel enough to injure a man with a daughter. Protect your home, Kang Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWalkeeeeeeer\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Ludia shook her hand and denied what Walker said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t accept it. She isn\u2019t my daughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but you\u2019re not my wife either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to pat Illina, too\u2026 Can I?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll probably freeze instantly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it only Shin and Hwaya unni\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Well, I could understand where Ye-Eun was coming from. Ina was small and cute and looked just like a princess from a fairy tale. Although people with albinism were suffering from a pain that people without albinism couldn\u2019t understand, with how pretty Ina was, it might be considered a blessing than a curse.</p><br/><p>Plus, with the amount of mana that rivaled an SSS rank\u2019s, she couldn\u2019t be feeling the pain ordinary people with albinism had. Although she had lost a lot in return, it would be different from now. I wanted to make sure that it would be.</p><br/><p>In any case, I had to treat this ability user that was on the verge of death.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, can you bring him back to normal with your ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un! But that yellow-head needs to help me.]</p><br/><p>Ruyue answered energetically and pointed at Ludia. To use her beautiful blonde hair to call her yellow-head\u2026 How bold, Ruyue!</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, help. We need to save him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Because of my previous clear-cut refusal, Ludia\u2019s cheeks were puffed up. Even though she didn\u2019t answer me, she approached us, then pointed her staff at the ability user.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should I do, Wolf?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m Ruyue! I\u2019m not Wolf!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Wolf. So what do I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Shin, this yellow-head is calling me Wolf!]</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we just hurry up? If he really dies, it won\u2019t be funny\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Ludia and Ruyue kept bickering, they still cooperated to heal the ability user. As Ruyue slowly thawed him, Ludia invigorated his mana and healed his injuries. Surprisingly, after a while, he began to operate his mana to help them, while his eyes were still closed. I wasn\u2019t sure when he was frozen, but he really was\u2026</p><br/><p>About 10 minutes afterward, the man slowly opened his eyes after regaining his appearance. He was a handsome middle-aged man with blonde hair mixed with white streaks and grey eyes. This must be what people mean when they say that people \u2018aged well.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for helping me. I thought I\u2019d die here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Revival\u2019s Yeon Hwawoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, the greatest hero of this century. You\u2019re even better looking in person. Your eyes look soft but show strong will. It\u2019s an honor to meet you. I\u2019m Laz Michel, France\u2019s SS ranker.\u201d</p><br/><p>He reached his hand out to me. When I held his hand, I instantly realized. He was a physical reinforcement type ability user!</p><br/><p>\u201cWas everyone in here your comrades?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were others, but most of them were killed by the ice monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, he stealthily stole a glance at Ina. Anyone other than me wouldn\u2019t have noticed. Although he didn\u2019t say anything aloud, I knew what he was hinting. I couldn\u2019t help but thank him for being considerate.</p><br/><p>Although he was being frozen to death, he had seen everything that happened. He knew Ina didn\u2019t want to kill people, and probably wouldn\u2019t touch the subject if we could control her ability.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to express my gratitude again. Really, thank you. I thought I\u2019d end my short life in this place. I still have many things I want to enjoy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great that we could save you before it was too late. I\u2019m sorry to say this to someone who just came back from the verge of death, but can you help us clear the gate? Having a powerful and reliable ability user such as yourself would be of great help to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. In fact, I\u2019d like to ask if I could help. I\u2019m not the type of person who can sit still after being hit. I won\u2019t be satisfied if I don\u2019t get my revenge.\u201d</p><br/><p>He grinned and held up his sword, which he had been holding even whilst he was frozen. For a one-handed sword, the sword\u2019s body was wide and thick. It was a bastard sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m confident in my ability to fight with my body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood to have you on board.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once our introduction was over, Hwaya approached us with Ina in her arms. To be exact, Ina wouldn\u2019t let go of her. Now that she was done crying, Ina was practically in siege mode. Hwaya spoke with a voice mixed with happiness and distress.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet her off me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? You guys look nice together. Better than her clinging on me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMommy\u2019s warm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, she is a fire ability user\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Hwaya and Ina together really put a smile on my face, but there was something I had to tell Ina.</p><br/><p>\u201cIna.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I called her, she seemed to have noticed that my tone was serious, as she looked up and stared at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe guy that ran away. Have you talked to him before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. He talked in an ice caterpillar form.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I thought, he could forcefully possess living creatures. It was something only mad elementals were capable of. Of course, once a mad elemental successfully possessed a creature, non-Elementalists would be able to talk to them too.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe lost someone important to him and hurt others because of it. I want to catch him before he makes any bigger mistakes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he like me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, even if he\u2019s gone mad, he hurt and killed many people. He\u2019s not like Ina, who ran away because you didn\u2019t want to kill anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I killed lots of people, too. Everyone said that Ina is a bad kid. That the dead Mommy and Daddy would hate me, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn, everything she said was making me cry. What bastard said that to Ina? I tightened my grip on the spear and contemplated about what to say to Ina. However, I couldn\u2019t come up with anything. Hwaya hugged Ina in my stead and stroked her gently.</p><br/><p>\u201cIna isn\u2019t a bad kid. No one is bad. You just couldn\u2019t control the power entrusted to you. I\u2019m sure that Mommy and Daddy who passed away wouldn\u2019t hate Ina.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m Ina\u2019s Mommy now. Don\u2019t you believe Mommy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do\u2026 Daddy, too?\u201d</p><br/><p>She was acting like Ina\u2019s mom like it was natural. How funny. But since she consoled her perfectly, I let it slide. I also stroked Ina\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, Ina. No parent could ever hate their child.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I turned around, father silently gave me a thumbs up. It was a bit embarrassing to say this in front of father, but\u2026 I was right, no parent could ever hate their child. A parent would love even a hateful child. That was just how parents were. I was sure that parents had committed a huge crime against their children in their past lives. Otherwise, their unconditional love couldn\u2019t be explained.</p><br/><p>Eit, this is too cheesy and embarrassing!</p><br/><p>\u201cIna doesn\u2019t have to kill anyone now. We\u2019ll help you. Ina, I want to help him, too. Humans were the ones who made him turn mad. Since I\u2019m a human, I have to bring him back.\u201d</p><br/><p>All elementals were born with blank slates. When they met their contractors, they would gain deeper emotions, but when their contractors died, or more specifically when their contractors met a tragic death like that boy\u2019s, the shock would easily turn them mad. It wasn\u2019t easy for elementals to go mad, but when they faced humans\u2019 desires, it would happen more easily. Perhaps that\u2019s why the number of human elementalists had decreased.</p><br/><p>Once an elemental turned mad, it was incredibly hard to bring it back to normal. Unless one could perfectly suppress it and drain it of all of its energy, there were only two ways to bring an elemental back to normal. That was to kill the elemental or to find a new contractor.</p><br/><p>When I first met Ruyue, I had planned to drain her energy and beat her until she snapped out, but after realizing that my soul was connected to hers, I contracted her. When I saw the boy, I realized that I was connected to him as well. After all, he wasn\u2019t materialized at the time.</p><br/><p>To maintain a materialized form without a contractor, an elemental had to use his own elemental power. That was fine if the elemental was in a place full of elemental power like Fairy Garden, but that wasn\u2019t the case now. As such, he did not materialize and used the environment to its fullest to attack us. His true strength should be much stronger.</p><br/><p>That said, I couldn\u2019t understand why unique elementals I met after Peika were all mad elementals. Not to mention, they were all connected to me. Perhaps\u2026 Ei, let\u2019s think about that later, too.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo do that, Ina, we need your strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy strength?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I haven\u2019t told Ina yet, but this dungeon will soon appear on Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? What should I do? I don\u2019t want to kill people anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just have to stay with us. I told you, right? I\u2019ll help you so that you don\u2019t hurt anyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ina\u2019s expression became bright. Did she not believe me before? It seemed I would need to say things to her multiple times. With a bitter smile, I continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen this dungeon moves to Earth, we probably won\u2019t be able to meet him anymore. When more people die, it will be too late to go back. He\u2019s running away from me right now. He must have really loved his previous contractor, but if we don\u2019t capture him, he will hurt more people. I want to stop that from happening.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to catch him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Ina. Can you help?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 Perhaps, she didn\u2019t need long explanations. Now that I thought about it, she probably wasn\u2019t mature enough to understand everything I was saying. I didn\u2019t know why I was explaining so seriously to a little girl. Ina suddenly raised her hand. I tilted my head and called her, as I couldn\u2019t understand what she was doing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIna?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI caught him.\u201d</p><br/><p>What? I looked at Hwaya. Then, I realized that the place we were in wasn\u2019t the same as the previous place. We were undoubtedly in a giant hall in the castle\u2019s 2nd floor, but the place we were in had windows to the castle\u2019s outside. Seeing the height we were in and the ceiling that looked like a dome, I thought\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cCould this place be\u2026 the highest floor!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, including Hwaya, Guild Revival\u2019s members, and France\u2019s SS ranker Laz Michel, had all been teleported. Wait, does that mean\u2026!? I looked around. Then, I was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re already here\u2026 Kuk!]</p><br/><p>[Girl, you changed your mind\u2026?]</p><br/><p>I saw the elemental making a shocked expression and an army of ice armors filling up the area. What was most shocking was the throne on the innermost part of the room, and a giant ice armor sitting on it like a king.</p><br/><p>For an armor made out of ice, it was adorned with intricate engravings, which were glowing with red light. As I expected, this dungeon\u2019s boss wasn\u2019t the elemental!</p><br/><p>The giant armor looked at us and slowly got up. On his hand was a truly giant ice hammer.</p><br/><p>[Come. The Eternal Army will not fear thee.]</p><br/><p>Seeing it full of spirit, I turned around and looked back at Ina. Couldn\u2019t you have said something!? Without knowing how I was feeling, she puffed out her chest proudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can go anywhere I want inside here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, good job\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, I couldn\u2019t blame her. I planned to raise my child with nothing but compliments!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf anyone\u2019s not prepared, tell me. Ina should be able to teleport us again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSame!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO power of the earth, bless us! Lend us your power! O Mitarus, bless us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, my targets are all here!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed everyone was fully prepared. That was also the case for our enemies.</p><br/><p>[Good, I will kill you here and now. All of you humans!]</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t act wildly on your own. Maintain your elegance. Soldiers, open your eyes.]</p><br/><p>The ice armors slowly got up. As they stood tall with their weapons, it was easy to tell they were much more orderly, completely different than the ones we saw before. They were undoubtedly much stronger, too. I\u2019m sure that Ice Castle\u2019s environment had something to do with it, but each ice armor was overwhelmingly stronger than any of the bugs we met in Insect World. Now, there were about 200 of them. Even I couldn\u2019t stay lax in such a situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to get wild.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy, catch him. I\u2019ll catch the rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, Ina?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ina widened her eyes in Hwaya\u2019s arms and grasped her hands in mid-air. Then, all 200 ice armors suddenly stopped. Could it\u2026 be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if you command them like they\u2019re your pets\u2026 What? All 200 ice armors crumbled together!</p><br/><p>[You really are strong, Ice Witch! But I won\u2019t lose!]</p><br/><p>The giant armor gritted its teeth and shouted. Shockingly, the armors began to rise again. I could feel a frightening amount of mana moving. However, Ina pushed it back easily. As I thought, Ina was incredibly strong in this place\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of them, Daddy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, thanks!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll handle the boss. You stop the elemental!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>I left the armors to Ina and Ina to Hwaya. Then, I stared at the elemental floating above and glaring at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should be feeling it, too. Stop running away!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I told you\u2026 Pesina is my only contractor!]</p><br/><p>He shouted in anger and emanated pressure in all directions. Kuk, I somewhat considered it with what happened in the previous room, but he really was a wind elemental! In any case, it was best to stop an elemental with another elemental. I called my partners.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, Ruyue!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You called?]</p><br/><p>[Un!]</p><br/><p>I turned around. Once unsealed, it seemed they could maintain their appearance while they were in their spiritual form, as a miniature-sized wolf-eared girl and a dragon with beautiful scales were staring at me.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Dragon!?</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Let me explain! This chapter had a lot of explanations, so the author put in 160% of the normal chapter length to make up for it!</p><br/><p>Also, remember what Peika said when she and Shin first met? About Shin\u2019s soul being similar to hers!?</p><br/><p>This arc will end next chapter. Will a new elemental contract Shin!?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

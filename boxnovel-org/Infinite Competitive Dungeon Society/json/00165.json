Double Crisis (1)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Chapter 165. Double Crisis (1)</p><br/><p>When we came out of the dungeon, the Guardians\u2019 cheer was truly breaking through the heaven. This time, I felt like it was a true welcome. Russia\u2019s prime minister also ran over as soon as he heard that the dungeon disappeared.</p><br/><p>Of course, as soon as he saw Ina in Hwaya\u2019s arms, he froze. Seeing him shaking, I winked and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn exchange for taking care of Russia\u2019s SS ranked gate, Revival requests Russia to officially accept Illina Alexandrovna Mikhalova\u2019s citizenship renunciation. She has already asked to be naturalized to Korea.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was only one acceptable answer. I put so much effort into memorizing Illina\u2019s name that I would have smacked him if he didn\u2019t accept my request.</p><br/><p>We then split ways with Michel on a good note. Although Sharana wasn\u2019t at fault, she materialized and apologized sincerely. Before he got on his flight to France, he told me, \u201cIt was a truly astonishing experience. A giant armor that can talk, an elemental, and a different world\u2026 You know more about it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I do. In the coming days, I suspect that I will have to tell you about it and seek your help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen with my own eyes why your organization exists, so I won\u2019t doubt you. I hope the day comes soon. It seems it\u2019s much more serious than anyone could anticipate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying our goodbye to Michel, we went back home immediately. Sumire returned to Japan, Shuna went back to the guild house, Ye-Eun went back to her home (though she kept turning around and looking at me), and Walker went back to his new house, which was right next to ours.</p><br/><p>Then, a problem arose.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy, don\u2019t you live with Mommy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, mm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Right, we weren\u2019t sure what to do with Ina.</p><br/><p>At first, I thought it would be easy since Hwaya said she\u2019d take care of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her. My place is pretty big for just me and my mom. I think Mom would like Ina, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you be okay? Isn\u2019t your mother an ordinary person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cM-Mother\u2026 Kuhum. O-Of course, I promised Ina, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 true.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the promise.</p><br/><p>First, I would appoint Ina to become a First Dungeon explorer. This had already been done. She was now a First Dungeon explorer.</p><br/><p>Second, Ina would quickly climb the dungeon and reach the 21st floor, when she would be able to enter the Residential Area.</p><br/><p>Third, we\u2019d invite her to the guild house. She\u2019d stay with Mommy (Hwaya) or Daddy (me) when she was on Earth, and stay in the dungeon or the guild house when we were both away.</p><br/><p>The third clause was especially important. Without Hwaya or me, Ina would be treated as a dangerous ability user again. To help her live as a regular child, the third clause was necessary. Though she couldn\u2019t really live as a regular child from the moment she was made a dungeon explorer.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlus, even if anything happens, I can quickly come back, so it\u2019s okay. With my power, I can save people as long as not much time has passed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya spoke with a reddened face and hugged Ina again. Then, Ina tilted her head and reached out and grabbed my sleeve. As I wasn\u2019t wearing my armor, it was my actual sleeve.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Daddy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026. Hm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy\u2019s coming too, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>We became speechless for a moment. I wasn\u2019t sure how to explain this to her. However, Ina skillfully read the awkward air between Hwaya and me and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you having a divorce?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe never married in the first place, Ina!\u201d</p><br/><p>As much as Ina was hungry for affection, she was indulging herself and having us spoil her. Because of it, she felt younger than her actual age, but she wasn\u2019t a girl that couldn\u2019t understand reason. She should know that Hwaya and I aren\u2019t really husband and wife, nor that we were dating.</p><br/><p>Even so, I explained to Ina again to drive the point home. Ina then puffed her cheeks and said, \u201cBut the two of you are a match made in heaven.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you learn that phrase?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMommy taught\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ina was about to reply, Hwaya blocked her mouth naturally and pulled her into her embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cIna, Mommy told you about the guild house, right? You can see Daddy there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t live together?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIna, you can\u2019t be stubborn about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ina helplessly nodded. Then, she gave me a peck on the cheek and made me promise.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to come see me every day!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, I\u2019ll try, Ina. Every day might be hard though.\u201d</p><br/><p>Beyond wasn\u2019t a place I could clear so quickly. Even when I explained that to her, Ina sulked. Kids really were difficult.</p><br/><p>Before we all returned to our daily lives, I called the guild members together. We then held a funeral for Pesina in the guild\u2019s resort, Resting Place of the Angels. The funeral was a special ceremony for elementalists, and Sharana watched in her materialized form.</p><br/><p>It was something only possible when a fellow elementalist was present. In this funeral, elementals would gather in the corpse of the elementalist and they would sublimate the mana left in the corpse. The body would then naturally dissipate. The myth was that an elementalist that went through this funeral would reincarnate as an elemental.</p><br/><p>As it used up a lot of the helping elementalist\u2019s mana, it wasn\u2019t viable during battle. It was rare for there to even be an elementalist to help. In addition, most elementalists hated to this funeral ceremony to be seen by others. Thus, it was a rare sight.</p><br/><p>That said, the elementalist funeral ceremony was probably one of the most beautiful forms of funerals for humans.</p><br/><p>\u201cElementals, light up the path forward for your friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>[An elf elementalist!]</p><br/><p>[Poor girl, she couldn\u2019t die all this time.]</p><br/><p>[Prince said to help.]</p><br/><p>[This is my first time doing this!]</p><br/><p>Countless colorful elementals gathered in Pesina\u2019s corpse. In the process of naturally taking out her mana, the elementals shone with a light that even those who couldn\u2019t see elementals could see. It was almost as if a rainbow was being drawn above Pesina\u2019s corpse.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautiful\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnbelievable, to think Kang Shin could show such a beautiful sight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Except for Walker, the rest of Revival\u2019s members watched silently. It would have been nice if we could have held funerals for the rankers that died in the Event Dungeon, but their corpses became lost when the Event Dungeon disappeared.</p><br/><p>As time passed, the light became stronger. Eventually, the light began to diminish around a focal point. By the time the elementals stopped giving off light, Pesina\u2019s corpse became particles of light and scattered into the air. All mana left in her body had been used up.</p><br/><p>[Goodbye, Pesina. It was really fun being with you.]</p><br/><p>Sharana spoke with a cheerful voice and created a breeze to send the particles away. I couldn\u2019t help but ask Sharana.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill Pesina be reborn as an elemental?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes. Since we even held an elemental funeral ceremony, I\u2019m sure of it. I\u2019d like to meet her again one day\u2026]</p><br/><p>She murmured in a whisper, then bowed.</p><br/><p>[Thank you, Master. I didn\u2019t think you even knew about the elemental funeral ceremony.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt comes with being an elementalist. Though, I don\u2019t really know how I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>I smiled bitterly and turned to look at the party members, who were still standing around with blank expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for coming over, everyone. Let\u2019s enjoy a good tuna sashimi at the mansion and go back to exploring the dungeon!\u201d</p><br/><p>I wanted to finish it soon. The melting tuna\u2026 no matter how much I ate, it wouldn\u2019t disappear! Hwaya and I were eating it whenever we could, but there was no end in sight. Perhaps I had to give some of it away to Fairy Garden.</p><br/><p>While everyone began to move, there was one person that continued to stand still. It was Ludia. When I approached her, she stood in place and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, what did you say was the name of the elf elementalist?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you, it\u2019s Pesina. Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>I tilted my head and put my hand on her shoulder. She flinched as if she was slightly surprised, then became pale and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, Pesina is the name of the legendary elf Hero who fought against the Demon Race in Luka continent 50 years ago\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I immediately ran to Loretta. Because I told her I would be away for a while, she had temporarily gone back to Fairy Garden. Thus, I had to run to Fairy Garden to meet her.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I opened the door to the log cabin, I saw Loretta and Lin drinking tea, and also a beautiful woman sitting right next to Lin. When Loretta saw me, she threw the teacup she was holding (the woman on the opposite side of her caught it with magic), and jumped toward me.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyak, Shin-nim! I wanted to see you so mu\u2026 I, I mean! You took too long, stupid!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to see Loretta a lot too, but there\u2019s something more important right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou treated it like an unimportant matter again! Treating my feelings like tha\u2026 Wait, you said you wanted to see me a lot? Ehehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta\u2019s expression quickly changed from a look of injustice to a blooming smile. Though it looked stupid, it was also quite cute. However, I didn\u2019t have the time right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow\u2026 So this is Loretta\u2019s boyfriend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, yeah. He\u2019s a bit of an idiot, but he strangely attracts women. You be careful, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s like you, Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare to make fun of a draconian? How bold. Good, follow me, I\u2019ll show you my rage.\u201d</p><br/><p>I could hear Lin and the woman\u2019s chatter, but I ignored them and pulled off Loretta, who was rubbing her face on my chest as if to poke a hole through it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, you know I left to destroy Event Dungeons, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Shin-nim told me about it. You became so strong, but you shouldn\u2019t trust your status too much. What\u2019s important is your level. No matter how overwhelming your stats are compared to an enemy, if your level is too low, the league of your soul will fundamentally pale in comparison.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can tell me about that later in more detail. There\u2019s something I wanted to ask Loretta about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it, Shin-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed she realized that I was being serious. Loretta\u2019s eyes had also become serious. I calmly explained to her what happened. Meeting the elf elementalist Pesina and my new partner Sharana in the dungeon, and that they were both from the Luka continent.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the Demon Army that attacked Luka continent also attacking Earth? Loretta, how can that be possible? The Demon Army only just conquered the Luka continent. How could they have been invading Earth since 2 years ago? Did they operate 2 separate armies? Or is there a warp in time that I\u2019m not aware of?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No, neither of them are true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta shook her head. Her lips were trembling.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, please, I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t Earth\u2019s enemy. I\u2019m sure of this because only worlds that have lost their power can invade other worlds\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I heard an absurd secret. Wait, did that mean that the world\u2019s enemy was also residents of other worlds like us? Were they invading other worlds to steal their power? How did they lose their power in the first place!?</p><br/><p>No, I could solve that mystery later. The important thing now was\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why did an Earth\u2019s dungeon have a boss who served the Demon Lord?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious, kid? They can\u2019t pave a pathway themselves, but they can use the pathway that\u2019s already been drilled.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin responded in place of Loretta, who was lost for words. His eyes flashed with coldness.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour world is currently being attacked by two forces. Although it\u2019s rare, it\u2019s not like it hasn\u2019t happened before. Ones that got a taste of the world\u2019s power could easily turn their attention to other worlds\u2019 powers. Even after they achieved the continual existence of their world, they aren\u2019t satisfied and seek to obtain even greater powers. That\u2019s who you\u2019re dealing with.\u201d</p><br/><p>He continued with a slightly trembling voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe call that a Double Crisis. Simply put, you\u2019re fucked.\u201d</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>I googled Double Crisis just in case and I got Pokemon\u2026 WHY!?</p><br/><p>Hello, this is Toika. The secret behind the world is being slowly revealed. A new administrative guild master has been revealed, though she hasn\u2019t been introduced yet! ICDS\u2019s setting is starting to be revealed!</p><br/><p>Double Crisis will be explained more in detail next chapter! Then, after that will be more dungeon conquering. Next chapter is pretty important so pay attention!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>FYI, Korean authors put in asterisks for curse words because laws\u2026 But I didn\u2019t put f*ckers, because let\u2019s be real, we\u2019re all adults here.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Kahar (7)</p><br/><p>[Hu, Huhu\u2026 It\u2019s been awhile since I felt like I broke through my limit.]</p><br/><p>After realizing that she no longer needed to fly at a breakneck speed, Lotte spoke in relief. But seeing as how her tail was still standing straight, she still seemed tense. I stroked her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks. Are you tired?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hmph, this much is a piece of cake for a Blaze Queen! In fact, I\u2019d like to thank Hero for letting me realize my own abilities!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. Thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Like I said, Hero doesn\u2019t need to thank me!]</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the wyvern Lotte dragged along was half dead. I thought about letting the pitiful creature go, but when I imagined Lotte carrying Ellos and Edias\u2019 Hero with her claws, I stopped in my tracks.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, this is where Peruta Mountain Range begins? It\u2019s already pretty rough.\u201d</p><br/><p>The atmospheric mana I felt before was even thicker in this mountain range. Here, even the ground was affected by the high mana density. This meant that the cause of Edias continent\u2019s strange atmospheric mana was here. It was truly absurd. The size of Seoul was nothing compared to Edias continent, but there was something in this mountain range that could affect the entire continent?</p><br/><p>I became certain. It was Peruta. It had to Peruta. Why else would this mountain range have his name? This also explained why this mana felt so familiar to me. After all, my mana was trained using Peruta Circuit.</p><br/><p>Besides me, however, everyone else was struggling with Peruta Mountain Range\u2019s high mana density.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, it\u2019s really not easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like something\u2019s choking me whenever I breathe. Uuu, to think it could affect me so much, how amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hup.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I really don\u2019t like this place.]</p><br/><p>\u2018I see, so the environmental penalty raises the mountain range\u2019s difficulty.\u2019 I could understand why it was called the continent\u2019s most dangerous place.</p><br/><p>Of course, that wasn\u2019t it. I didn\u2019t know whether it was because it really was Peruta\u2019s mana or some other reason, but there was something only I could feel as I was unaffected.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe dungeon\u2019s power is being suppressed even more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos looked back at me with a shocked face.</p><br/><p>\u201cEllos, something\u2019s here, something harmful to explorers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way\u2026 No one can last long in this mountain range.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat means it\u2019s the best place to set up a scheme.\u201d</p><br/><p>Invaders were apt in magical tools. What was suppressing the dungeon\u2019s power was more likely to be a magical tool than an individual\u2019s ability. Everything made sense in that case. Otherwise, the suppressive force wouldn\u2019t be so strong in this mountain range.</p><br/><p>At the same time that I was confident the answer lies here, I became uneasy.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said you could feel it, right? The Hero\u2019s energy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour paper magical tool is proving that, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><br/><p>I crumpled the paper. The air felt bitter. I hoped that this wasn\u2019t the case, but it seemed things wouldn\u2019t go as I wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Hero might really be here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In that case, there was a high chance that I\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, if what you\u2019re saying is true\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t go back now. Let\u2019s go, Ellos.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos nodded. Lotte and the wyvern flew up after resting for a bit, and undead suddenly ambushed us in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGriffins! They\u2019re undead griffins!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos shouted. I didn\u2019t recognize them because they were all bones! I looked down below. Undead monsters made of bones were also flocking towards us. This entire mountain range was full of undead creatures, each carrying a great density of mana!</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re naturally created, Dear Husband. Giant mana brought them together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to waste time killing them. Just break through!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>For monsters only made of bones, the undead creatures screamed and chased after us. I smacked my lips. This was a great opportunity for me to display my Skull Breaker title, but the title\u2019s effect was also halved by the damned suppressive force.</p><br/><p>The Hero was somewhere in this mountain range, somewhere where the magical tool was pointing to. No matter what was waiting for me there, I couldn\u2019t stop. I couldn\u2019t help but think how fortunate I was to have received Radiance from Lin before I came.</p><br/><p>[This half-dead trash!]</p><br/><p>\u201cRather than half-dead, aren\u2019t they half-alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Shut it, bat! Just get rid of them!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lotte\u2019s flames and Licorice flame and light magic scorched the undead. Although they were also affected by the mountain range, with their leagues, they had no problem dealing with the undead. It was the same for me.</p><br/><p>Although my power as an explorer was being suppressed, Peruta\u2019s mana and Radiance both supported me. As such, I could attack them without hesitation. I threw lightning bolts full of Lightning God\u2019s power at the undead far away and stabbed the ones that managed to close in with my spear.</p><br/><p>Ellos also fought the undead, but it was clear how much he was struggling with his power suppressed. Even so, his eyes were burning passionately.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I\u2019d lose\u2026 to these guys!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, Ellos.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied calmly and stabbed the air with my spear. A shockwave shot out, exploding dozens of undead. At that moment, Lotte roared and breathed out a fire, opening a path in front of us.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m breaking through!]</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, Lotte!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Screw off, all of you!]</p><br/><p>Lotte roared and charged forward. When I looked around after breaking through the encirclement, I could sense the mountain range\u2019s entire undead creatures running towards us. However, they were no longer in my sight.</p><br/><p>The ground rumbled, and a volcanic crater far off in the distance began to smoke. I held up the paper I crumpled. Shining particles of light floated up and made an arrow. It was clear where it was pointing to. He was waiting for us there.</p><br/><p>[Hero, you\u2019re all fired up!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. I realized I can\u2019t fight with my previous mindset.\u201d</p><br/><p>I closed my eyes and checked my condition. Everything was perfect.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Our goal is that volcano!\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t remember how many undead were blocking our path, but I knew that we crushed countless undead on our way. When we arrived in front of a cave on the side of the volcano, I was practically covered in crushed bones. I had to ask Ruyue to clean me.</p><br/><p>The undead creatures stopped charging. For some strange reason, they didn\u2019t dare to approach the volcano. In truth, I felt like I knew why. A meek wind was covering the volcano. It was a gentle, yet powerful wind of mana.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s enter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos nodded solemnly. Together, we entered the cave. Lotte had transformed into her human and stood next to me, while the pitiful wyvern was tied in front of the cave where enemies didn\u2019t approach. At the very least, it would be safe.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Hero likely didn\u2019t hide here by his own will.\u201d</p><br/><p>I spoke as we walked through the cave. Ellos flinched, then nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there really is a device in here that obstructs the dungeon\u2019s power, the invaders might have something to do with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat means there\u2019s something even more important to them than killing the Hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, do you have something in mind?\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t say anything. I didn\u2019t know whether I should. In the end, I just stared at the paper in my hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably nothing much\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I gave the paper to Licorice and asked a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cLicorice, does this thing point to the Hero\u2019s energy? Or is it pointing to his unique mana?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe latter, Dear Husband. If it was pointing to the Hero\u2019s energy, it would have responded to Dear Husband too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice answered without hesitation. As that was what I was expecting, I nodded and took a step forward. Ellos looked at me, curious as to what my question meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I was just curious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>We walked onward. Seemingly because we were getting closer to the center of the volcano, the heat was getting stronger. Although the heat couldn\u2019t affect me, that wasn\u2019t the case for my companions. Licorice wiped off the sweat from her forehead and complained.</p><br/><p>\u201cA mere volcano\u2019s heat is making me sweat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably because it\u2019s being compressed by high-density mana. Come here.\u201d</p><br/><p>I borrowed Ruyue\u2019s power to cool my hand and wiped off Licorice\u2019s sweat. Licorice blushed and didn\u2019t know what to do. Though she was a Succubus Queen, she had never experienced the real thing. Because of this, she was weak when I was the one being intimate.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-W-What, Dear Husband!? What\u2019s up with the excellent service!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI brought you all the way here, so I\u2019m sorry. Ruyue, make the others feel cool too.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un!]</p><br/><p>Ruyue\u2019s mana immediately covered the rest of the crew. I straightened Licorice\u2019s tangled hair and whispered in her ear.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn.\u201d</p><br/><p>She blushed once again and nodded. I smiled and marched onward.</p><br/><p>As the heat became more intense, the density of surrounding mana also increased. It was the same for the power suppressing the dungeon\u2019s power. We were close. Something had to appear soon. I was proven to be correct, as we soon encountered people.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumans really came all the way here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, look, Hero\u2026 Kak!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I immediately charged towards them and swung my spear. My ridiculously fast spear, containing the concentrated power of my body, easily slashed through my target\u2019s powered suit and decapitated him. My speed was no different than when I used Divine Speed. However, Divine Speed belonged to the dungeon. In this place where half of my power as an explorer was suppressed, using it was meaningless.</p><br/><p>How was I still so fast? It was simple. During the countless days spent climbing the dungeon and countless battles against my enemies, I learned how Divine Speed used my mana and nature\u2019s mana. Knowing how mana moved meant that I could imitate it. I didn\u2019t need to activate it as a skill.</p><br/><p>Of course, this was the first time I used it in a real battle. Still, my intuition told me to try it rather than using Divine Speed, and my intuition was correct. In fact, I learned quite a lot from the feeling of my body accelerating and the flow of mana. It still couldn\u2019t be compared to Divine Speed at full strength, but once I got used to it and improved upon it, I had the feeling it could surpass Divine Speed, which was already mastered and had no room to evolve.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bas\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his sentence, I decapitated him too. My lightning-fast attack ripped apart his powered suit and instantly ended his life. With the two sentries taken care of, I dusted off the blood from my spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. They should be waiting for us inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEllos, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>I continued on without hesitation. As expected, many invaders were waiting for us there. They were all strong. By the dungeon\u2019s standard, they would have all passed the 75th floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come he\u2019s unaffected?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho cares? Just crush him and question him later!\u201d</p><br/><p>Currently, I was weaker than them. If it wasn\u2019t for Radiance, I might have been gravely injured already. However, I\u2019ve experienced fighting against stronger enemies countless times before. Each time, my limit of my techniques reached new realms.</p><br/><p>So what did I need to fear?</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, this Hero is quick!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t even neutralize a weakened Hero!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, why don\u2019t you help\u2026 Kuhuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>I roused Mad Typhoon\u2019s power. Whether it was magical attacks or physical attacks, their attacks only worked if they touched me. Mad Typhoon\u2019s fierce whirlpool twisted their attacks\u2019 trajectories, and even if they hit me, they only glazed me. Meanwhile, I continued to thrust my spear using the principle of Divine Speed. With my spearmanship, my attacks already came from angles that were hard to dodge. With its lightning-like speed, there was no way for them to dodge my spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t touch my Hero!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArgh, you guys are annoying! You\u2019re wearing ugly clothes, too!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Lotte and Licorice were practically unaffected besides having their mana oppressed. Since the enemies were also affected by the mountain range\u2019s characteristic, they could easily fend them off. In an instant, dozens of invaders died, and they finally faltered back.</p><br/><p>\u201cA-Anymore would be wasting our strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not strong enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have to come inside anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were right. No matter how many enemies were waiting for me, I planned to go in. I knew who was waiting for me there.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, how!? No, why!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you know the answer without asking me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos fell silent.</p><br/><p>Even if we turned back now, we wouldn\u2019t gain anything. What I wanted, what the enemy waiting for me inside wanted, and what Ellos wanted, we had to decide it now. I walked onward. The pathway soon came to an end, and a giant space opened up. Considering the heat, we were likely close to the crater. No, this place was the crater. I could see the sky from the gigantic hole in the ceiling.</p><br/><p>Furthermore\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you, Earth\u2019s Hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a man standing in the center. It was a middle-aged man wearing a thin black powered suit clearly different than rest of the invaders. The terrifying energy he was releasing made me doubt my chances of victory even if I got back all of the dungeon\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, young and handsome. You even have two beautiful gals with you. My, my. My eyes are quite happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at my companions and smiled in satisfaction. Behind him, I could see a giant crystal. A crystal releasing a mystical, yet ominous light. Near it was the Hero we were looking for.</p><br/><p>With only his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Kasina, well done. You really succeeded.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was bound to succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos replied calmly. I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

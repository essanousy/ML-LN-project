Granting Freedom (4)</p><br/><p>The dungeon\u2019s Residential Area was packed with people today, as always. However, I headed straight to my mansion. I wasn\u2019t going there to rest, but to visit the Fairy Garden through the Fairy Spring. In the pavilion on the way to Loretta\u2019s log cabin, I saw someone I had not seen on my last visit.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, if it isn\u2019t Kang Shin, the Crown Prince who died on the 40th floor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>I knew he would make fun of me! But why was he here? I gave him an inquisitive glance. At the same time, I noticed someone next to him. It was a cute girl with cat ears on her head, who was shaking her long tail slowly. It was Lokanyan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, nyan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Lokanyan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name isn\u2019t Lokanyan, it\u2019s Loka, nyan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, Lokanyan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>After making fun of Lokanyan, I turned my attention to Lin. Just like always, he had a cigarette in his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks to your vitality hitting zero, I became free for a weak, so I\u2019m enjoying my sweet vacation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Well, you must be tired from making all that equipment for me. Thanks again, Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really hate losing, don\u2019t you\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin nyan, Loka nyan made cookies, nyan. Eat some, nyan! Everyone liked it, nyan!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Lin\u2019s hand holding his cigarette shook, Lokanyan pushed a plate in front of him, which had cookie-like things piled on top of it. Were they items? I mean, they looked just like poison items!</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I was wondering where everyone went\u2026 Loka, you sent them away, I see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s rude, nyan! Everyone shook because it was so delicious, nyan! Everyone said they\u2019d bring them home to eat them, nyan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s this much left after that\u2026? Damn, they should\u2019ve taken a bit more for me\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that, nyan! Try them, nyan! I put in lots of love for Lin, nyan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need them\u2026 Ah, I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Lin, have a nice day. Lokanyan, I\u2019m cheering for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, wait! Kang Shin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOooh! You\u2019re a good guy, nyan! Goodbye, nyan!\u201d</p><br/><p>I had no intention of trying out cookies that would make even a draconian tremble in fear. Putting an end to Lin\u2019s attempt to get me to try those cookies, I wished him luck and headed to Loretta. I ignored Lin\u2019s scream that I vaguely heard behind me and spat on the ground. A girl was trying to give him handmade cookies! It was a situation straight out of a manhwa. Not to mention, the girl was a cat-eared beauty that embodied the word \u2018cute!\u2019</p><br/><p>I hoped he would eat them and explode.</p><br/><p>When Loretta first saw me, she welcomed me as she flapped her long ears. However, her ears drooped more and more as I explained the reason I was here.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to learn a sword technique? To slice monsters for sashimi?\u201d</p><br/><p>My long and sad tale that no one could listen to without crying was cut off in the middle by Loretta. Then, she looked at me like she was looking at an idiot.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d</p><br/><p>She said it!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you make a hand knife and imbue mana into it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the confidence to control it carefully. Not to mention, it\u2019s illogical to fillet a fish with your hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you put mana into your spear?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to hide the fact that I use spears.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay revealing that you can suddenly use swords?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just learning it today, so it shouldn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a better method than that sweaty and brutish method, Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I heard Loretta\u2019s words, I became slightly uneasy. Sure enough, she took out a glowing blue kitchen knife from her pocket.</p><br/><p>\u201cA kitchen knife forged by a master craftsman, able to slice all food ingredients, even if they are monsters, without having to know even the basic of sword techniques! Its name is \u2018All Crusher!\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not allowed to crush everything!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you buy it now, I\u2019ll throw in \u2018Burnt to White Ashes,\u2019 a magical pot that can heat all food ingredients to the perfect temperature!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoth the kitchen knife and the pot have weird names\u2026 Also, it\u2019s not allowed to burn things to white ashes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be surprised, there\u2019s more! \u2018Drug,\u2019 a magical seasoning that can sublimate the taste of any food with just a single sprinkle! If you eat it once, you might get addicted and never be able to escape it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDrug? Is that a narcotic? It isn\u2019t, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis mind-blowing combination of items is only 99,900 gold! They\u2019re only 99,900 gold!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust say 100,000 gold.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom my heart for Shin-nim, the 100 gold is\u2026 a service!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Loretta make a heart with her two hands, I really considered flicking her forehead, but held myself back. Instead, I took out 100,000 gold and gave it to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I just need 99,900 gold.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll give 100 gold more as a service from my heart for Loretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO-Oh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta\u2019s ears flapped wildly. I only gave back the gold she discounted, but she was incredibly happy. This elf really liked money. Then, Loretta spoke as she gave me the items with a blooming smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll serve you some tea, so stay for a while. Huhu, Shin-nim is quite skilled at bargaining.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? Ah, tea time with Loretta is good too, but there\u2019s something I want to ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>I put the kitchen knife, pot, and seasoning into my inventory, and tried to make a serious expression to explain what had happened today. That I had met another explorer as an enemy and that he was currently restrained.</p><br/><p>Although Walker had agreed to betray Brightman, I had just beat him up severely, and it wasn\u2019t so easy to trust Walker, who had spent his entire life under Brightman\u2019s orders. I needed a way to ensure he wouldn\u2019t change his mind.</p><br/><p>After listening to my story, Loretta made a thinking \u2018hmmm,\u2019 then rummaged through her pocket with a small exclamation.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething perfect for Shin-nim is right\u2026 here. Soul Contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>It had a very dangerous sounding name.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see, since you\u2019ve made more than two achievements, you can buy this too. It\u2019s pretty easy to use. You write the content both sides of the contract should keep with your blood. It doesn\u2019t matter what language you write it in. After that, say that you\u2019ll form a soul contract, and the contract will activate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? It\u2019s that simple?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, if either person violates the contract, the other person will take his soul, so be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a really dangerous contract!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you need something like this, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta rolled the Soul Contract and gave it to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s 1,000,000 gold, but since no one\u2019s bought it for 500 years, I\u2019ll give it to you for 500,000 gold. That\u2019s the manufacture cost.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA 50% discount, wow. It\u2019s still expensive though\u2026 Alright, here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dullahan gave me 100,000 gold each time I defeated him, and as I had defeated him over 80 times, I wasn\u2019t short on money. Even with the price I paid for Party Member Scarecrows, Floor Master Battle Vouchers, potions, equipment repair costs, and the equipment crafting cost I paid to Lin, I still had about 7,000,000 gold left. That is, I could spare 500,000 gold with only a light burden.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for your purchase, customer!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Loretta. I knew coming to you was a good idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2019m\u2026 glad to be of help. I-If you there\u2019s anything troubling you, you can always look for me! As long as you pay for it, I can even make something I don\u2019t have!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll try to get Lin to take care of most of my needs. I\u2019m here because my vitality hit zero. I did meet Lin, but I couldn\u2019t bother him during his date.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 So you won\u2019t come over anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta\u2019s ears drooped down. It was cute in a way, so I wanted to keep watching her, but Loretta\u2019s depressed appearance startled me, and I was making an excuse before I noticed it.</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No! I meant I won\u2019t visit Loretta only when I have something I need. I\u2019ll come over often, as long as it doesn\u2019t bother Loretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me at all. In fact, I\u2019m almost bored to death! So please come over a lot!\u201d</p><br/><p>No, if you\u2019re that bored, do work\u2026 Aren\u2019t you the guild master\u2026?</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>When I came back after some tea, Walker was crawling on the ground with his body and mouth wrapped in boxing tape.</p><br/><p>\u201cWalker, caterpillar suits you well too\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmmm!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis talking annoyed me, so I shut him up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya was glaring at Walker with a reddened face. I first took the boxing tape off of Walker\u2019s mouth. Puha! He coughed out a mouthful of breath and complained.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, I was only curious if Mastiford and you- kuaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWalker, are you perhaps just stupid?\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker became a burning caterpillar and was wriggling violently, but I decided to leave him be until Hwaya calmed down. When Walker was letting out a slightly smoked smell, I showed him the contract.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s organize the content of the contract between us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are thorough. You even prepared something like this\u2026 What meaning is there to a contract? Don\u2019t tell me you think you could restrain me with the law?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, and I\u2019m not trying to restrain you. This is a Soul Contract, just something that gives me your soul if you break the contract. Don\u2019t worry about it too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can I not worry about it!? I\u2019d rather be restrained by the law!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you have no choice!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, no! I\u2019m not doing it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, so you were planning on breaking your promise\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya spoke with a low voice and made a flame in her hand. A white flame. It was an incredibly hot flame. Walker seemed to have noticed how dangerous it was, as he swallowed his saliva. Then he silently pulled the contract toward him.</p><br/><p>Clause one. Edward Walker (it was his real name) will not be able to directly or indirectly harm Hwaya Eleni Mastiford or Kang Shin, and this applies to their family, relatives, and friends.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, of course, but I\u2019m a bit worried just what \u2018direct\u2019 and \u2018indirect\u2019 encompasses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSimply put, you\u2019re not allowed to curse. Also, if you try to peek on me again, your soul might go flying from the mental stress I might take.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Clause two. Kang Shin will safely take Edward Walker to Korea, and help him live a free life given that he does not violate the first clause.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s your plan? It won\u2019t be easy to avoid Brightman\u2019s eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have my ways.\u201d</p><br/><p>Clause three. Edward Walker will carry out the following missions in exchange for not revealing his perverted actions publicly and privately.</p><br/><p>First. Destroy all information about Hwaya Eleni Mastiford in Brightman\u2019s possession, and use his ability as a dungeon explorer to assist her to the greatest extent possible. Also, before Hwaya Eleni Mastiford gives her permission, do not appoint anyone as a dungeon explorer.</p><br/><p>Second. Guard Kang Shin\u2019s younger sister, Kang Yua, perfectly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s exactly what it says. Brightman that bastard has a picture of me taking a ba, bath\u2026 I hate it! Get rid of it all! Also, when I make my dungeon explorer organization later, you have to help. I\u2019ll need your authority to appoint a dungeon explorer then too\u2026 That\u2019s my condition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I expected the first mission\u2026 Yeon Hwawoo, or rather, Kang Shin. What do you mean guarding your younger sister?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? I\u2019m only accepting you to our side because of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said as I glared at Walker.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see, my young sister is dangerously cute. Although I installed some safety devices, we live in a dangerous world. When something happens to my young sister and she\u2019s in trouble, I need someone to protect her until I get there. Your stealth ability and physical ability is perfect for a guard!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 just for something like that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fist I raised up flickered with lightning. Should I kill this bastard? Hwaya sighed and stopped me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou only need to guard Shin\u2019s younger sister from morning to afternoon, so you\u2019ll be free after that. You can be in the dungeon or whatever then. What dungeon did you say you were from again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Third Dungeon\u2026 damn it, my daily life is going to be completely gone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you\u2019re so noisy! You\u2019ll be free on the weekends! Just think of it as a job!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, a job of secretly guarding some young chick\u2026 I\u2019d rather stay in the dungeon for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, don\u2019t kill him.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was already punching Walker\u2019s face, but thankfully, he didn\u2019t die.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, you\u2019ll understand when you see my sister. In fact, you\u2019ll be thankful that I gave you the opportunity to guard such a pretty and cute reincarnation of an archangel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuk\u2026 She\u2019s that pretty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you lay a single finger on her, you\u2019re dead. I\u2019ll rip you to shreds and burn you to cinders. I\u2019ll bring you back to life, kill you again, find you in hell, and turn you into powder.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-It\u2019s in the contract! I know even if you don\u2019t threaten me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Clause four. When requested by Hwaya Eleni Mastiford or Kang Shin, Edward Walker will participate in Event Raids and Event Dungeons. This clause takes priority over the second and third clause.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sure ask a lot of me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it? Want me to give you a salary too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need it. I don\u2019t need you bossing me around even more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then, repeat after me. I form a soul contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026. Damn it. I form a soul contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment we made our announcements, the Soul Contract floated up into the air and burned splendidly. Walker felt pain immediately afterwards and rolled on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuuuuuak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, maybe you can\u2019t curse us inwardly either. I heard your heart starts to hurt when the contract is about to be breached. If you continue, your soul will fly out, so be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake it back, damn it, take it back! Kuaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t sure how long it would take for Walker to calm down, but it was none of my business. After finishing my business with him, I got up from my seat with a refreshed mind. Hwaya looked up at me with curious eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going? After dealing with Walker and even going to the dungeon to get items, we didn\u2019t even have time to eat dinner yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu, Hwaya, there\u2019s something I have to do. Something really important that I have to do right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is\u2026 but do you need help?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s something I have to do myself. Alright\u2026 I\u2019m off then. I might be late, so you can eat first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO-Okay. Good luck\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as she waved me goodbye, Hwaya tilted her head curiously. I left her lodgings. The town and lake were both completely dark. There was no one in sight, and far in the lake, a melting tuna was breaching over the water\u2026! Checking again that no one was around, I equipped my Crimson Dragon Scale Armor. In my hand was the All Crusher.</p><br/><p>\u201cMelting tuna sashimi\u2026 Wait for me, I\u2019m coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>The next morning, there was a report of a strange monster running above the lake waters (borrowing Ruyue\u2019s power), screaming to attract monsters (Provoke), and calling down storms to slaughter them (Elemental Tempest). Thankfully, they hadn\u2019t seen me slice the melting tuna for sashimi\u2026!</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s Notes:</p><br/><p>Can that be called freedom\u2026? (Author\u2019s thinking)</p><br/><p>Walker has joined the party with Soul Contract! Bambadabam! You obtained a good assassin to put to work!</p><br/><p>PS \u2013 1.

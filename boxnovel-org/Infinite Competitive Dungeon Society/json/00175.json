What Is Not Allowed for Her (6)</p><br/><p>I was kicked out of the room. Realizing that Daisy Ectradion would take forever to put on her clothes by herself, Loretta chased me out so that she could help her. I was already talking to Ectradion when she didn\u2019t have anything on, so was there really a need to kick me out? I felt wronged. \u2026Have I been too hungry for affection lately? No, I\u2019ve been hungry since I was born!</p><br/><p>Then, the door opened.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, let\u2019s go now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm\u2026 I\u2019m calm now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them came out. Seeing Ectradion, I became lost for words. Just one minute ago, she was only wearing a white dress shirt and black lace panties.</p><br/><p>But now, she was wearing a grey blazer with gold buttons, and a black leather mini-skirt that revealed her thighs. On her head was a sharp grey beret, and she was wearing black high-heeled shoes. Finally, black stockings wrapped around her delicate legs put the finishing touch. Not even an experienced army private would be able to change so fast into his uniform.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you change so fast\u2026? Not to mention, the uniform is very\u2026 Earth-esque.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeveral worlds share similar cultures and styles, Shin-nim. Think about all the weapons you\u2019ve seen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy battle uniform. With my enchant skill, my equipment, I can put in. Huhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ectradion was bragging about something I didn\u2019t even ask about!</p><br/><p>\u201cT-Then let\u2019s go, Loretta, Ectradion. I have a lot of corpses, but the best one is in my guild house.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCall me Daisy. My last name is too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Daisy-ssi. You can call me Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like being formal. It\u2019s too long. Unnecessarily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO-Okay, then I\u2019ll just call you Daisy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Daisy yawned and followed us nonchalantly, I took it to mean that we had gotten closer. Loretta also smiled and whispered to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, you\u2019ve gotten skilled at tricking people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTricking? What do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSaving other worlds. You said it to gain her favor, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a slight miscommunication with Loretta, but we returned to the guild house without much problem. When we arrived, however, we saw father and Walker drinking alcohol under a parasol.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, you drink with Walker?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone to drink with, so why wouldn\u2019t I? You want to join?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to gloss over this matter, Kang Shin. Who are the girls behind you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker pointed at Loretta and Daisy with his glass of alcohol in his hand. I turned around to introduce them to each other. While Loretta had her hands together modestly, Daisy quickly ran to the boar and drake corpses decorating the garden. The two of them had gotten compressed so much that the boar was now the size of a small car, while the drake was also only about 7 meters.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing\u2026 Such perfect refinement. The master who did this, introduce me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking at him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have such profound knowledge over corpses?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Loretta was bowing to father respectfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally meet you, Father. I\u2019m Loretta. I got to know Shin-nim in the dungeon. Though I\u2019m still inexperienced, I\u2019m supporting Shin-nim in climbing the dungeon. I\u2019m not too keen on Korean etiquette and may make many mistakes, but please guide me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for the polite greeting, Daughter. So Son, when can I see my grandkids?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot any time soon! Loretta, why are you making him misunderstand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMisunderstand!? He\u2019s my future father-in-law!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta declared without batting an eye. Father laughed wholeheartedly, while Walker snickered with his eyes open.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought this one was the real one, but I guessed wrong, hehe. If Mastiford sees this, she\u2019s going to get angry. To think you hid a woman from your wife. You\u2019re quite good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a wife, Walker!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHu, I\u2019m surprised you can say that when you have such a big daughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, can I hear about this in more detail? So you really had a partner. Geez, I don\u2019t like it when you hide things like this, uhuhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared the most when you laugh like that, Loretta\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Really, Heaven was helping me by not letting Hwaya be here. Back then, she ignored what I was trying to say, but she must have realized I had someone in my mind. If she knew that was Loretta\u2026 Kuk. Just thinking about it made my head hurt. In terms of personality, I knew Hwaya wouldn\u2019t lose to anyone.</p><br/><p>I called Daisy.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo? Can you use them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re both\u2026 perfect. The boar surpassed its limit. When it becomes an undead\u2026 it might continue to grow. It\u2019s the same for the Flame Drake. Here, the corpses weren\u2019t\u2026 being stored. They were\u2026 evolving.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy clasped her hands together and murmured in a dazed voice. Although her slow speech made it hard to understand what she was saying, I could tell that she liked the corpses.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 two isn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>She drooped her shoulders. So she could show such reaction in front of corpses\u2026 Thinking rather stupid thoughts, I began to put corpses down onto the garden one by one. When I began taking out the corpses I gained from the SS rank dungeon, Insect World, Daisy\u2019s red eyes shone ominously.</p><br/><p>\u201cGiant\u2026 insects. Insect undead\u2026 Cool.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSetting aside the fact that you\u2019re a necromancer, do you just like undead?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis rhinoceros beetle is\u2026 perfection.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was already in pure ecstasy from looking at all the insect corpses. She wasn\u2019t paying attention to me in the slightest. I made a wry smile. Then, curious about father and Walker\u2019s reaction, I looked back at them.</p><br/><p>Loretta was pouring alcohol into father\u2019s glass.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can have Shin now. Take him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Father! I will serve him well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me away on your own, Father! Loretta too, don\u2019t take his words seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, what a boring son.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree, Father. Ah, but Shin-nim has many good points as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>They were getting along extremely well. I thought Hwaya and Father were a good pair, but it seemed Loretta was even better. I guess she didn\u2019t live 2,700 yea\u2026 17 years for nothing. I didn\u2019t change what I was thinking because I felt a vast killing intent. Not at all!</p><br/><p>Father finally stopped cracking jokes with Loretta and looked at Daisy. She was still buried inside the pile of corpses being elated.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s she?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA Beyond explorer. It\u2019s hard to explain, but I want to sell her our corpses. Though it isn\u2019t now, she\u2019ll eventually join us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really need to get our permission, Kang Shin? What\u2019s in your inventory is yours. Even if they aren\u2019t, as long as you explain properly, no one will mind it. Though, I\u2019m sure many of them will be unhappy that you\u2019re selling them to such a beautiful woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker added useless remarks as he snickered. It seemed he became laxer when he drank.</p><br/><p>In any case, Father seemed to agree.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better than letting the corpses rot in your inventory. You weren\u2019t planning on selling them for money anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saved them in case we needed them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWanting to help others is always admirable, Son. That\u2019s especially true if the person you\u2019re trying to help wishes to walk on her two feet. Do as you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen someone owes a debt of gratitude, they\u2019ll feel pressured to pay it back more than it\u2019s worth. Yup.\u201d</p><br/><p>Most people would take things for granted and ask for even greater favors. Only a few would do as Walker said.</p><br/><p>Daisy faced me. Her eyes sparkled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible\u2026 with these. Thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGlad to be of help. Just know that they won\u2019t be cheap.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. But, there\u2019s something I want to ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked at me in the eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I help you, your world\u2026 Will you save\u2026 my world?\u201d</p><br/><p>I widened my eyes. Although I wanted her help and was ready to accept it wholeheartedly, I didn\u2019t expect her to make the offer. Did this mean she trusted me? I collected my thoughts and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I was expecting you to pay me later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have eyes for people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her eyes flashed. She was undoubtedly talking about her Evil Eyes. Indeed, there were no \u2018eyes\u2019 like them. I nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, if you help save Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy also nodded and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuild Revival. I\u2019ll join.\u201d</p><br/><p>The 10th member of Revival was thus born.</p><br/><p>[Guild \u2018Revival\u2019 became B rank! When challenging Event Dungeons or Event Raids, when 5 or more guild members are present, all guild members\u2019 abilities will be increased by 10%!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHow strong are you that the guild ranked up just by you joining?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst guild. Not sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as she answered, she was busily walking around the mountain of corpses in the garden. Then, she stopped in front of one and seemed to fall into thought. Soon, she crushed it. It then transformed into mana and spread to all the other corpses. It seemed it was a corpses reinforcement technique for necromancers.</p><br/><p>Just like that, she crushed a few additional corpses in poor conditions and made the other corpses abundant with mana. She hummed and made a satisfied expression. She then put her hand on the skirt\u2019s chain belt and pulled on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwoah, what are you doing!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, my weapon. Strong and cool.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy bragged needlessly. She was holding her belt\u2026 no, whip. Her skirt didn\u2019t fall. The whip wasn\u2019t actually tightening her skirt like a belt. While I let out a sigh of relief, Loretta grinned.</p><br/><p>\u201cDisappointed, Shin-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can ask after you put down those fingers you\u2019re pointing at my eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, and this.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Loretta and I were glaring at each other, Daisy continued to work. Every time she swung her chain whip, the monster corpses filling up the garden began to twitch. It was a truly horrifying sight. Even so, it mysteriously drew people\u2019s attention. Daisy\u2019s mana continued to spread across the garden, and in the end, captured all the corpses perfectly.</p><br/><p>The corpses\u2026 rather, the undead were lining up in front of her. We all watched her in awe.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they all attacked together, it\u2019d be difficult to deal with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNecromancers are\u2026 amazing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally\u2026 Not to mention, such a beautiful girl is commanding this army of corpses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it an enemy? Do I kill her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuu, there are two new beauties.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see! Daddy, hold me up!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Ina was fretting, I held her up to let her see more easily. But Ina, you can fly\u2026 Eh?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did you come!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now. Walker sent us a report. So? Can I get an explanation, Ina\u2019s Daddy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you not address me in ways that would cause misunderstandings!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Oh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The horn was sounding for war! Not against the army of corpses, but it was here and now!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

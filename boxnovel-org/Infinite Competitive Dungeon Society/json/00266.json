You Cannot Escape from the Saintess (6)</p><br/><p>Peruta made a satisfied expression as I sent him off after our training. Next, I sparred with Sumire, who seemed to have learned a lot from watching me. Of course, she could never be my opponent. Even though I pretty much stopped thinking and sparred with the mindset of leading her spear forward, her spear couldn\u2019t reach me at all.</p><br/><p>However, only half a year had passed since Sumire really began to train in spearmanship. Although she had the basics down from the family training she had when she was young, it was still only the basics. I remembered this clearly, as she sparred with me when she started training and watched her Spear Technique become mid-rank.</p><br/><p>From sparring with me today, Sumire learned high-rank Spear Technique. Her improvement was easy to see, and I quickly ascertained that her spearmanship advanced to high-rank Spear Technique. I didn\u2019t know how Sherafina split mid-rank from high rank, but I could feel her advancement from her spear\u2019s movements. I knew she wanted to get stronger quickly, but her speed really surprised me.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you! Shin-nim is the best!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I did much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Shin-nim, I would have never learned high-rank Spear Technique! Shin-nim is really amazing\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sumire entered her worship mode. Though I was happy, I asked her with a bitter expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cSumire, did you put in any skill points into Spear Technique\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Didn\u2019t Shin-nim say so? To not put in skill points into mana training skills or martial art skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. So you reached high-rank Spear Technique in half a year with just your own ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more thanks to Shin-nim rather than my ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sumire spoke as she tilted her head. She believed it wholeheartedly. Just where did this worship-like faith come from? I don\u2019t remember doing anything\u2026 Well, I guess I did. But she also participated, and so did the others\u2026</p><br/><p>Perhaps, this faith was what allowed Sumire to advance so quickly. I didn\u2019t want to break her wings by carelessly saying something, so I gave up on continuing this topic. Instead, I made an offer.</p><br/><p>\u201cSumire, focus for a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you teaching me something!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sumire approached me with sparkling eyes. If only Ren was half as trusting when he came to learn from me\u2026 Unfortunately, Ren\u2019s idea of learning from me was equal to being beaten up, so this was impossible. I told myself to beat him up again in the coming days and focused my attention on Sumire.</p><br/><p>\u201cRather than teaching\u2026 I\u2019m offering a method.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Failed. I wanted to leave it to her choice, but she was going to do whatever I asked. It was the first time I felt the weight of absolute faith.</p><br/><p>\u2018I guess it\u2019ll be okay as long as what I tell her is correct.\u2019 I felt my responsibility increasing as I told her the method.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t think you would get so strong in such a short time. Without even a tiny bit of exaggeration, you\u2019re a genius. You were already a genius in martial arts, but it seems you\u2019re an even greater genius in spearmanship.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m nothing compared to Shin-nim. I\u2019m still lacking!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, trust me. Hubris is poisonous, but underestimating yourself isn\u2019t good either. You have to look at yourself objectively if you want to improve quicker.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sumire\u2019s face reddened from embarrassment. I smiled and held up my sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, saying anything more will only tickle your ears. I\u2019ll be frank. Sumire, your defense is outstanding. With Athena\u2019s power, it could even be called absolute. You can probably even defend against one full power attack from me.\u201d</p><br/><p>By full power, I meant using Overlord, Sacrifice, and Sky God\u2019s Rage. Mm, I guess she can\u2019t block Shiva\u2019s Eye, but since I can only use this power once a year, I shouldn\u2019t think about it. In any case, the fact that she could defend against this meant that she could perfectly defend against an attack from a world\u2019s enemy.</p><br/><p>Although she wasn\u2019t at this level in the past, Sumire was always with us as we climbed the dungeon and completed Event Raids. Her outstanding talent, effort, and ample experience made this possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut your attack is truthfully weak. Very weak. Although it\u2019s improved a lot, even if you train for another year, you probably can\u2019t deal an effective blow against a world\u2019s enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m lacking\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, the only thing you\u2019re lacking is time. Time is one thing no one can change. Sorry, I didn\u2019t think we would be in such a rush either. If you had just two more years, you would have become more powerful than anyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her talent, effort, and God's true name proved this. Athena was Olympus\u2019 greatest warrior. Not even Zeus could take away this title.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen am I supposed to just stand back no matter what happens?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sumire, who was excited just a moment ago, now wore a sad expression. Seeing her face, I didn\u2019t feel like continuing either.</p><br/><p>Nowadays, such sense of helplessness was common against Revival\u2019s members. \u2018There isn\u2019t much we can do in crucial moments.\u2019 \u2018Guild master and a few others shoulder all the burden.\u2019 Such thoughts were the cause of this helplessness.</p><br/><p>Of course, without them, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to clear all the Event Dungeons during the last crisis, but it was also true that only the guild members other than me, Hwaya, Ina, and Daisy were left out of fighting powerful enemies. This was because other than the four of us, it was hard for the others to deal effective blows, much less fatal blows.</p><br/><p>As a result, many of Revival\u2019s members were feeling depressed about not being able to do anything. I should have made it clearer how thankful I was for them. It wasn\u2019t too late. Since they had supreme talents in their own fields, there had to be something only they could do.</p><br/><p>Sumire would be the beginning.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make that face. Do you remember what I said? I said I\u2019m offering a method.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, r-right, you did.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sumire\u2019s expression became slightly brighter. How much my words affected her showed how innocent she was.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying it\u2019s impossible if you continue with your current training method. That\u2019s why we\u2019ll use a slightly unconventional method.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnconventional\u2026 method?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep. It\u2019s honing your blade for a single thrust.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA single\u2026 thrust\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Sumire murmur after me, I held my spear and took a stance. Obviously, it was the stance I took when I used Heroic Strike. Sumire also noticed it.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sumire had the greatest defense, Athena\u2019s shield, Aegis.</p><br/><p>Once activated, Aegis automatically blocked the enemy\u2019s attack without having to be held and even petrified the enemy. Sumire usually held the spear in one hand, but during this time, she could use both hands to hold the spear. The enemy will also be blocked by Aegis, and she\u2019ll be thoroughly protected. Perfectly blocking the enemy\u2019s attacks while attacking with her spear. It was any spearman\u2019s dream.</p><br/><p>Even so, just learning one technique didn\u2019t advance one\u2019s spearmanship. It only advanced his technique. Plus, even if he strengthened his technique, without proper spearmanship as the basis, it could never reach its maximum potential. That was why I never taught Sumire techniques.</p><br/><p>Now, it was different. Sumire advanced extremely quickly. She not only had the talent to learn Heroic Strike, her level of spearmanship was more than enough to draw out its power. If she added Athena\u2019s power on top of it? I was already looking forward to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a bit embarrassed, but it\u2019s the greatest technique I can use with pure spearmanship.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an honor!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sumire cheered up completely when I told her I would impart Heroic Strike onto her. Well, since she couldn\u2019t use Heroic Aura, it wouldn\u2019t be Heroic Strike, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, let\u2019s call it the Goddess\u2019 Strike.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I haven\u2019t even learned it yet! And such an embarrassing name\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s better than Heroic Strike.\u201d</p><br/><p>My eyes were completely serious. I still didn\u2019t understand why I gave this skill such a name. I regretted it immensely. I regretted it every time I used it. Still, I shouted its name loudly every time. I could still hear mother\u2019s complaints from when I kick my bedsheet because of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, I\u2019ll show you a Heroic Strike using only my energies.\u201d</p><br/><p>I summoned Ruyue and asked her to create an extremely hard ice boulder in the center of the training room. In an instant, freezing energy filled our surroundings, and a giant ice boulder reaching the training room\u2019s ceiling appeared.</p><br/><p>[Even Shin won\u2019t be able to break it easily!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>I then summoned Peika and had her enter my spear. I then quickly took my stance. I pulled back with my right hand, and my left hand supported the spear from underneath. I leaned my entire body back slightly and bent my knees adequately. I was used to focusing my energy in one place, so I didn\u2019t really need to do all this, but since Sumire was learning it from scratch, it was good to learn the proper stance.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to feel the energy in your body. See how I concentrate it and shoot it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>First, I roused Heroic Aura. It was an energy at the summit of all auras that empowered allies and erased evil. It could also strengthen all auras I possessed. It was truly a power befitting a Hero.</p><br/><p>Next, I gave Peika my mana and also took out the Lightning God\u2019s power. Though it was granted by the dungeon, this power proved that I was chosen by lightning and thunder and that I had the qualification to rule over them. It wasn\u2019t much different from a god\u2019s true name. What this meant was that I would still maintain this power even if I lost my qualification as an explorer.</p><br/><p>I could feel all of these powers concentrating on a single point on Chaotic Spear. My body\u2019s muscles, mana, aura, and elemental power. Everything came together. Peruta Circuit spun fiercely, while Mad Typhoon mixed the energies accordingly and create a tiny whirlpool at my spear tip.</p><br/><p>Sumire, who was watching me from a distance away, was completely focused. She didn\u2019t even breathe. Suddenly, I felt a bit uneasy.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, materialize and strengthen that a bit more.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un!]</p><br/><p>Concentrating Heroic Strike\u2019s destructive power onto one target was also one of the conditions of learning it. Not uselessly dispersing its destructive power and focusing it entirely on the target! My ancestor was undoubtedly a pervert.</p><br/><p>I could also add Trishula, Sacrifice, Frozen Roar, Sky God\u2019s Rage, Twin-headed Ogre\u2019s Tattoo\u2019s close-range attack amplification, Succubus Queen\u2019s Tattoo\u2019s 2x mana\u2026 but I held myself back. It was already powerful enough.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026 Haap!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I felt that I squeezed out every ounce of power, I attacked. Although I stabbed slowly so Sumire could clearly see it, my spear still traveled extremely quickly. As if it was being sucked in by the ice, it drove into the center of the ice. At that moment\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cKyak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew this would happen!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the spear tip struck the ice, its boundless energy devoured the ice, breaking it into thousands of pieces and scattering it. Sumire screamed and held up her shield, but the ice shards disappeared without hurting anyone. The ice was under Ruyue\u2019s control.</p><br/><p>Realizing that she was unhurt, Sumire stayed stiffened for a while with her shield held up, then lowered it with slightly trembling hands. Her voice also shook her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too powerful. But Shin-nim, this isn\u2019t your full power, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, it gets stronger if I add gods\u2019 true names, item effects, and skill effects. But\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Other than gods\u2019 true names, an ability like Lespina\u2019s nullified them, so there wasn\u2019t that big of a difference realistically. Sumire murmured with a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo, too powerful. So this is Shin-nim\u2019s power\u2026 As expected of Takemikazuchi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed what I just showed Sumire went beyond what she could accept. I let out a dry cough and brought her back to reality.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my technique. The technique you\u2019ll make is different. There will be no lightning, no elemental power, and no Heroic Aura. Still, Sumire will have Sumire\u2019s mana and Athena\u2019s power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if I learn it, will I be able to display the same destructive power?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018With your crazy talent, it might be possible.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m about to show you now\u2026 is what Heroic Strike was based on.\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked Ruyue to create another ice boulder. She used the same amount of mana, and its hardness was the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis technique was something my ancestors created when they didn\u2019t know mana. It was created purely to display power surpassing the limits of one\u2019s physical body\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As I explained, something caught my attention. Why did I just think about my sparring with Peruta? It felt like something was about to pop out of my head. I thought back to what I said to see if anything popped up, but nothing happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim? Are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yeah\u2026 I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t understand. Still, I felt sure I would understand it one day. Soon, that is. Believing this, I set aside my idle thoughts and took up the same stance as before.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I mastered this technique my ancestors created, but I rate it highly since even without mana, it\u2019s on par with an attack using mana. Sumire, you\u2019ll have to use this skill as the basis to perfect your own technique.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuu, I have to learn something even Shin-nim didn\u2019t master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can do it. Trust me. Unlike Heroic Strike, you\u2019ll get a feeling for it when you see me use it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I held up my Chaotic Spear again. I let go of all my mana. I didn\u2019t draw Lightning God\u2019s power either. Using the pure power of my muscles, blood, and bones, I frantically drew everything under my control and outside of my control onto a single point. After concentrating and concentrating and concentrating\u2026 I eventually couldn\u2019t see what was in front of me.</p><br/><p>I could see one thing. The tip of my spear and the single point it needed to pierce through. I wanted to tell Sumire to concentrate, but I couldn\u2019t say a thing because I was controlling my body. In terms of difficulty, the last technique, in which I drew out all my power, was greater. Now, however, the process of controlling everything about my body and concentrating its power on a single point felt extremely difficult.</p><br/><p>Then, I realized. Mana\u2019s support. Mana, which followed my will, helped me control my body much easier. I was used to receiving mana\u2019s support in using this technique. Now that I was relying purely on my power as a human being, controlling this power felt this difficult.</p><br/><p>My heart thumped. If I realized this any later, my spearmanship might have even regressed. Although mana was powerful, I couldn\u2019t allow it to take over what a human\u2019s power could do. Mana had its own role. There was a domain that mana should never invade.</p><br/><p>That was the concentration and flow of power. It was good that I realized it now before it was too late to turn back. It was good that I could still improve in my own area, rather than Peruta\u2019s. Just mastering high-rank Spear Technique wasn\u2019t the end. Just learning Mad Typhoon didn\u2019t mean that it was the only path I could walk.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, you said you wouldn\u2019t use mana\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I could feel a weak whirlpool rising. I didn\u2019t stop it. Because I was completely immersed in concentrating my body\u2019s power onto my spear tip, Peruta Circuit, which had become one with my body, was naturally reacting.</p><br/><p>I was ready. With that thought, I reached forward. The spear smoothly drove into the ice. At that moment, I muttered to myself. I\u2019d done it.</p><br/><p>The giant ice boulder, which took up a large area, disappeared like it never existed. Although I didn\u2019t use any mana, what I accomplished was even more absurd than what I accomplished before. After pouring out my body\u2019s entire energy, I staggered slightly. As if it was waiting, Peruta Circuit swirled and consoled my exhausted body. Sumire finally exhaled the breath she was holding in.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I did! I did, Shin-nim! Everything! I\u2019ll definitely learn it, definitely! With this, I should be able to fulfill my role!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been saying that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although there was a side-effect of Sumire\u2019s worshiping me even more, Sumire had regained her enthusiasm. I could practically see the fire burning in her eyes. Not even I thought it would work so well.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, there was something else in my mind. The power I just showed. If I could combine it with mana and my other abilities\u2026!</p><br/><p>At that moment, when us master and disciple were burning with zealousness, a voice tickled my ears.</p><br/><p>[Did you finish what you needed to do on Earth, Revival\u2019s master?]</p><br/><p>I tried to remember who the voice belonged to and finally remembered. She was the administrative guild master Lost Valley\u2019s master, Eleine. She continued without hesitation.</p><br/><p>[You should have time for us now, right? There\u2019s a request.]</p><br/><p>[Request?]</p><br/><p>[Yes, request.]</p><br/><p>I felt like I could see her grinning.</p><br/><p>[A Dimensional Mercenary request in the Edias continent, happening under the supervision of the dungeon.]</p><br/>\n</div>"}

(6)</p><br/><p>[Another man\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too honest!\u201d</p><br/><p>The 70th Floor Master was, unsurprisingly, the Incubus King. With stylish clothes and handsome features, he indeed possessed looks that could capture any women.</p><br/><p>Although his high charm could affect both men and women, I was unaffected thanks to my high charm.</p><br/><p>[I do not enjoy fighting. I would rather whisper into the ears of beautiful women.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I get it. You\u2019re a creep. Come.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I especially hate men who give off enticing scents like you! They steal my women!]</p><br/><p>\u201cMind your own business!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Incubus King charged at me with an ornate longsword. When he swung his sword, thousands of ice spears appeared in the air. If anything, I had to recognize his boundless mana.</p><br/><p>[My ice spear will penetrate you!]</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you stop making everything lewd!? Also, I\u2019ll be the one penetrating you with my ice spear!\u201d</p><br/><p>I smirked and charged forward. At the same time, Ruyue flew up. In her beast girl appearance, Ruyue shouted.</p><br/><p>[Anyone who bullies Shin, I\u2019ll teach you a lesson!]</p><br/><p>Immediately, the thousands of ice spears flying toward me halted. Then, along with Ruyue\u2019s hand gestures, some became bigger and some combined with others. The Incubus King waved his sword around with a shocked expression, but it was too late. He had completely lost control of his ice spears.</p><br/><p>[A mere elemental dares to go against me!]</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you look away, you\u2019ll die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not that he wouldn\u2019t die if he didn\u2019t look away. While he staring at the ice spears in the air, I used Divine Speed and shot a Heroic Strike wrapped in chaos flames. The attack drilled into his shoulder and created a huge hole.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaak! My noble body!]</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t the other men that went through here do the same thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Are you looking down on me for being restrained by the dungeon? You\u2019re no better, a mere human being played by fate!]</p><br/><p>In his rage, the Incubus King charged towards me. I grinned and held up my spear.</p><br/><p>Chaos flames and white aura mixed together, burning in a hard to describe form. I then charged toward the Incubus King fuming with a navy demonic energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to hell with your fate bullshit!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, hundreds of ice spears strengthened by Ruyue descended. The Incubus King swung his sword and created a barrier. He then used magic to break the incoming ice spears, but his face was grim, as if he already knew he would lose.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t wrong. He had already used quite a lot of his mana to create the ice spears. When it failed, his defeat was only a matter of time.</p><br/><p>[Human, human, humaaaaan! Despair! Surrender to fate! Become a loser and forever slumber in resentment!]</p><br/><p>\u201cStop talking about yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>The ice spears then broke through his barrier and struck his body. His beautiful clothes became shredded as his limbs also became severed. Coincidentally, only his face remained unhurt.</p><br/><p>[Kuhuk\u2026 I won\u2019t forget you!]</p><br/><p>The Incubus King coughed out black blood and glared at me. I struck my spear into his face and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cBullshit to the end. Even when I see you Floor Masters 10 times a day, none of you remember me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[A Grand Achievement! You defeated the Floor Master, \u2018Incubus King\u2019, alone! Amazing!]</p><br/><p>[You became level 71. You obtained the qualification to challenge Beyond\u2019s 20th floor.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained 5 bonus stats.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained the title, \u2018Incubus King Slayer\u2019. All stats permanently increase by 1. This effect will apply even if the title is not equipped.]</p><br/><p>[You became Gold Rank 2. Congratulations.]</p><br/><p>[You defeated the Incubus King alone. You obtained the special reward, \u2018Superior Incubus King\u2019s Top.\u2019]</p><br/><p>[You obtained 500,000 gold.]</p><br/><p>[Choose your reward.]</p><br/><p>[1. Captivation Magic Book.]</p><br/><p>Unlike the Succubus Queen, it seemed somebody had already claimed the first reward for the Incubus King. In other words, an explorer who had been bewitched and killed by the Succubus Queen had slain the Incubus King in cold blood. Incubus King, you poor guy\u2026</p><br/><p>Regardless, the solo kill reward was the important thing. Captivation Magic Book. Another item beyond my expectations had come out. I couldn\u2019t refuse the reward either. Thinking I might need to learn to control my charm again, I sighed as I chose the reward.</p><br/><p>[You learned the passive skill Captivation. Captivation strengthens your charm. At level 1, it increases your charm by 10%. Against members of the opposite sex, your charm will have double the effect.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew it.\u201d</p><br/><p>If this effect multiplied the amplification I got from the Succubus Queen\u2019s Tattoo, then my charm would have quadruple the effect to females. Even if the effect worked additively, it would still be triple. Since the skills I obtained from the dungeon all worked additively, my charm most likely tripled instead of quadrupling. The 60th through 70th floor really increased explorers\u2019 charms. Hwaya must love it.</p><br/><p>Regardless, since my charm reached a troublesome realm once again, I had to control my charm before I headed out to the Floor Shop.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome back, Shin-nim... Uuu, your charm increased again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to resent someone, Loretta, resent the one who made the dungeon like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I resent anyone? I\u2019m fine as long as Shin-nim doesn\u2019t go around seducing women. In fact, I have to thank the Lord for this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least you\u2019re honest\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At my wry smile, Loretta puffed out her chest proudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeing honest is my good point! Then, Shin-nim, now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d say that. I hate you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving Loretta behind, I went back into the Floor Master room to fight the Incubus King again. To implement my plan in time, I had no choice but to work hard.</p><br/><p>Two hours afterward, at the guild house on Earth, I checked the guild members who wanted to participate in this expedition. I had already notified everyone on the day I talked to Yua, and after I cleared the 70th floor earlier than expected, I told whoever coming along to finish their preparations by today.</p><br/><p>The result was that it would be faster to count the number of people not here. No, wait\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Everyone\u2019s here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to reclaim a country. Isn\u2019t it obvious that we\u2019d come?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya spoke as everyone\u2019s representative. She was wearing formal attire and was holding a long silver stick in one hand. She stood next to a empty wall, ready to give a presentation.</p><br/><p>Michel and Leon also nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right. I joined Revival because I believed we would drive away the monsters from Earth. This is the first step. There\u2019s no way I can miss it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell said, old man! Besides, if I don\u2019t help, I\u2019ll feel weird receiving help to reclaim Texas or California.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuu, having California taken by them was indeed a great catastrophe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine! Although we can\u2019t bring the dead back to life, lost lands can always be reclaimed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Over 10% of U.S. population lived in California. When Two Moon occurred, a large scale monster attack decimated half of California\u2019s population. Even those who survived had lost their families, properties, and hopes of living.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go to California soon, so don\u2019t worry, Leon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe you, friend!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShush.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya silenced us and projected a screen onto the wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe place we\u2019re going to today is the Philippines.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPhilippines\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of monsters, 90,000,000 people lost their lives in the Philippines. That\u2019s 90% of their population. It was one of humanity\u2019s greatest catastrophes. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen a satellite image. It\u2019s full of vegetation like it has traveled back in time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible that it\u2019s part of another world\u2019s natural environment. Even if you\u2019ve been to the Philippines before, don\u2019t think the Philippines we\u2019re about to go to is the same Philippines as the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya spoke with a stern tone and pointed to the Philippines on the screen\u2019s map. Then, a few pictures popped up on the screen. Tall trees and dense vegetation made it look like we were looking at a scene from the Jurassic Period. Inside the forests, we could see giant monsters roaming about.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re pictures taken during the Philippines during the catastrophe. At the time, three SS rankers including me fought against the monsters there. Back then, we had to retreat without even killing 10% of the monsters in the coast. Like the other occupied countries, Philippines\u2019 monsters are rather high ranked. The weakest are A ranks with 60% being S rank, 10% being SS rank, and 1% being\u2026 above that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly that\u2026? Ow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look down on others just because you\u2019re strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia hit my head. I reflected.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey might have gotten even stronger by now. We can probably safely assume that most monsters had a half rank increase. The succubi battle units recovered most of the islands other than the mainland, and their reports prove that this is true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. The monsters there were unusually strong. Dear Husband, this Philippines\u2026 I think there\u2019s something in its center region. I felt a powerful aura that made me tremble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt could be a commander level monster. In any case, this operation can\u2019t be done without Shin. As you know, Shin, your Evil Eyes will be important.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>I could petrify all monsters below SS rank without having to use mana. However, as monsters with relatively high ranks could naturally cancel the petrification over time, we had to go through the process of shattering their petrified bodies.</p><br/><p>Hwaya then showed us more pictures of the Philippines, explaining the monsters endemic to the area. With the Philippines being an island nation, even coastlines had powerful oceanic monsters. As for deeper inland, there were many powerful mammalian monsters, insect monsters, and harpy type monsters. There really were monsters of all sorts.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s also the matter that served as the how this operation started \u2013 finding elite monsters for Yua. Daisy, you stop drooling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood monster are, dead monster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour definition of dead monsters is undead monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeki, strong because dead. Other mantis, weak because alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Meki the name you gave to the Evil Mantis Queen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, smart student\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>While I smacked Daisy\u2019s head, Hwaya\u2019s explanation was reaching its end.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe've already explained the situation to Guardian and Freedom Wing. The media will talk about us around dinner time. There are some volunteers from various agencies\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReject everyone under SS rank.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s everyone then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya burned away some of the papers in her hand. Now that I thought about it, the only SS rankers not part of Revival were the ones we made into First Dungeon explorers. They were undoubtedly still busy climbing the dungeon.</p><br/><p>Once the papers in her hand became cinders, Hwaya\u2019s expression became serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me confirm one last time. We aren\u2019t forcing anyone to participate in this operation. If you\u2019re unsure of your abilities\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While Snorting, Ludia retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou might want to go with Shin alone, but I won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, even if I wanted to, sister-in-law is coming anyways\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya turned away and grumbled. Yua tilted her head and asked Hwaya.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister-in-law? What does that mean? My understanding of this must be wrong\u2026 Can you tell me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Scary. And cold! Thinking perhaps it was just me, I looked at Hwaya who was a SSS rank flame ability user. Seeing how she was also trembling, it seemed the temperature around us had gone down.</p><br/><p>\u201cYua, don\u2019t be so scary. I want to get close to you. Why do you not like me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way I don\u2019t like you, Unni. Haha\u2026 So, what\u2019s the other meaning of sister-in-law?\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t bully Hwaya, Yua! Her life points have already hit zero!</p><br/><p>\u201cReclaiming a country with just us\u2026 It\u2019s almost like we\u2019re superheroes from comic books.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong, Kang Yungoong. We\u2019re this world\u2019s heroes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, Yungoong[1. Shin means \u201cgod\u201d and Yungoong means \u201chero\u201d in Korean.]. What choices of names\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho cares! Shin, Yungoon! What better describes them!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMen, stop blabbering like idiots. We\u2019re heading out now!\u201d</p><br/><p>All 17 members of Revival immediately set off to the Philippines.</p><br/><p>From this moment on, we were the main characters of this heroic tale.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

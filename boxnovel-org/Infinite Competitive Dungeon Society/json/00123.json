You in the World of Sunset (1)</p><br/><p>After coming to Earth with me, the first situation Ludia had to deal with was meeting my family.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I, I\u2019m back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Ludia and I left my room, we ran into mother who was climbing the stairs with a vacuum cleaner. Her eyes became incredibly big the moment she saw us, and she frozen. Soon, with a calm expression, she put the vacuum cleaner down, cleaned her hand on her apron, and walked up to me. Putting her hand on my shoulder, she whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that my daughter-in-law?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thankfully, her question was within my expectations so I could give an instant reply. However, Ludia tilted her head and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that I thought about it, Ludia was from Luka continent! She could talk to me since we were both dungeon explorers, but she couldn\u2019t understand mother, who wasn\u2019t a dungeon explorer! What happened next surprised me. With her hand not holding onto me, she reached into the air and took something out. That is, she had taken something out from her inventory. It was a black leather choker. She put it on and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Korean!</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What? What did you just equip?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a translator that the dungeon sells for 300,000 gold. It translates what I say or what others say to languages we can understand. Since people in my continent also speak different languages, I bought one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Loretta and Lin tell me about such an item\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I could have easily solved my poor English problem at Britain!</p><br/><p>While I was feeling a slight rage at Fairy Garden\u2019s guild master and vice-guild master, mother approached Ludia curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs she a foreigner?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you can see, yes. Ludia\u2019s a foreigner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is she from? With her Western appearance, is it America? Britain? France? She doesn\u2019t look Italian\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Ehuir Empire\u2019s prin\u2026 ordinary citizen.\u201d</p><br/><p>If you\u2019re going to throw away your status, can you talk with honorifics?[1. Kind of hard to convey in English, but you have to use honorifics when talking to older people in Korean, which she didn\u2019t do.] I gazed at Ludia strongly, but she turned her head the other way with a snort. For the record, she put more strength into holding onto me. Hearing the word \u2018Ehuir Empire,\u2019 mother tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cEhuir\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, she\u2019s a friend I made in the dungeon. I want to let her stay here for a while, is that okay? I\u2019ll tell father and Yua too.\u201d</p><br/><p>I changed the subject and asked mother. She immediately stopped thinking about where Ehuir Empire was, as she put her hands on Ludia\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! You can live here forever! God, I didn\u2019t think my son would bring such a pretty girl home. So? How far have you gone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, she\u2019s really just my friend, so don\u2019t misunderstand\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to make excuses that she\u2019s just a friend, at least stop linking your arms together.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ludia heard what mother said, she suddenly became pale, pulling on my arm harder and throwing herself into my embrace. Feeling that something was wrong, mother\u2019s expression became stiff. With a bitter smile, I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, please?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Alright. Since Shin brought a friend home, I\u2019ll have to show off. I have to appease Yua too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAppease Yua? Is she mad that I wasn\u2019t home for a while?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know once you see her.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, mother smiled. I tilted my head and looked at Ludia, but she still shaking lightly in my embrace.</p><br/><p>In any case, Yua really seemed mad, just like mother sad.</p><br/><p>\u201cN\u2026No! Y-You can\u2019t live together\u2026 oppa! Especially with someone so pretty!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just a friend, Yua. There\u2019s a complicated circumstance, so I hope you can understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at mother and father as I tried to convince Yua, but they were both more concerned with Ludia. Mother asked Ludia what her hobbies were and father seemed interested by the fact that Ludia was an explorer. In any case, they were telling me to convince Yua on my own.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, to be honest, I\u2019m mad. It hasn\u2019t been long since you came back from Britain, but you left home for four days. You even brought back someone so pretty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but there\u2019s a circumstance I can\u2019t tell you about. It\u2019s hard to explain\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it hard to explain!?\u201d</p><br/><p>As it had been a long time since I saw Yua be so unreasonable, I didn\u2019t know what to do. Then, Ludia sighed and pulled on my sleeve. Holding onto chopsticks strangely, she asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, can you explain how I use this tool?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you to use a fork instead of chopsticks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to. No matter what country you go to, diplomacy starts from your table manners. So you teach me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t come here as a diplomat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a person of this world now, so it has to be perfect. You have to teach me everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>While I was paying attention to Ludia, Yua got up from her seat, shaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really angry! Oppa can do whatever you want, I don\u2019t know anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYua!?\u201d</p><br/><p>After putting her empty dish in the sink, she left. Y-Yua was finally going through puberty\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, can you show me how to use this? I can\u2019t figure out how.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you can ignore others so well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as I sighed, I spent a long time to teach Ludia how to use chopsticks. Since I didn\u2019t know how or why I had to appease Yua, I could only sigh.</p><br/><p>When I told Loretta what happened, even she got mad.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying a customer named Palludia is staying in Shin-nim\u2019s house? The one you gave the headband to!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m jeal\u2026 No, send her back to the Residential Area!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying this too, Loretta? I\u2019m worried about Ludia. I want to watch over her for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-That\u2019s\u2026 I know Shin-nim doesn\u2019t have any ulterior motive, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta looked like she wanted to say something, but in the end, she simply sighed. Then, she spoke as if there was no other choice.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll allow it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Strange. Why did I get Loretta\u2019s approval? What approval did I even get? My head was filled with questions. Meanwhile, Loretta continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I\u2019ll first teach you how to appease your sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>The questions immediately disappeared.</p><br/><p>When I returned from the dungeon, it was midnight. As I only went to the dungeon after Ludia fell asleep and set me free, talking to Loretta for a bit didn\u2019t pass the night.</p><br/><p>\u201cYua, are you sleeping?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes, I\u2019m sleeping!]</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I go in?\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Yes.]</p><br/><p>After shouting angrily that she was sleeping, she easily crumbled at my request. I entered the door with a grin. Yua seemed to have been studying, as she was looking at her notebook and using the internet. She turned her rotating chair around and faced me. Her cheeks were puffed up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you were with Palludia-ssi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe went to sleep a while ago. Oppa just came back from the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuu, so she was clinging so closely to oppa before going to bed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYua, you also realized that something was wrong, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I asked her calmly, Yua made a difficult expression\u2026 then nodded her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you meet her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI met her in the dungeon, and we became friends. You see, I went to help Ludia this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s really just a friend? You guys aren\u2019t dating?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why is she sticking to oppa so closely?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain in detail, just that she went through some difficulties. She lost her place in her country too. I couldn\u2019t leave her alone, so I brought her here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe details are what I want to hear\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yua murmured weakly and drooped her shoulders. Then, she said something I never would have imagined.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to help oppa too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa looks like you\u2019re having a hard time lately. Plus, you\u2019re always busy. The incident that made oppa\u2019s friend like that\u2026 oppa must have been there too. So I\u2019m worried about oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm.\u201d</p><br/><p>While I was panicking as Yua\u2019s response was different than what Loretta said, Yua continued with her head down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen oppa first became a dungeon explorer, I was happy. You were always smiling, full of confidence, and even lost muscles and became handsome\u2026 Ah, oppa was always handsome, but oppa became even more handsome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-Thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut after the second moon rose and monsters began to appear\u2026 Oppa began to change. I was happy that I could be proud of oppa, but lately, I\u2019ve been restless. I\u2019m worried that oppa might suddenly leave me and disappear.\u201d</p><br/><p>A day would come where people without abilities would have trouble being near the Hero. It was when I would have to leave my family. Because Yua\u2019s words were so accurate, I couldn\u2019t argue against her.</p><br/><p>Then, Yua looked up, staring at my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I become a dungeon explorer\u2026 can I help oppa, too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I was surprised from Yua\u2019s words, I could answer her question immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cYua doesn\u2019t have to fight. Fighting can be done by people like father and oppa, who only knows how to fight. Yua can help oppa by staying safe and being healthy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know how to fight too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Yua. You\u2019re more suited to things other than fighting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yua didn\u2019t have talent for physical activities like fighting. I was certain. Since I couldn\u2019t tell her that outright, I tried to say it in a roundabout way, but it didn\u2019t seem to work, as Yua\u2019s eyes became sharp.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hate oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa sucks! Leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yua talked to me without honorifics![2. Again, hard to portray in English.] When Yua pushed me with her hands, I became worried that my tough body would hurt her and quickly left her room. Immediately afterwards, the door closed with a boom. Left alone outside the room, I found a word to objectively describe this situation, and murmured as my heart crumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cSibling quarrel\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta, this is all your fault! Even though I didn\u2019t get to say what you taught me or use the present you gave me!</p><br/><p>I found a target to lash out on. It was the Wendigo. However, the Wendigo had a critical weakness to serve as my stress reliever.</p><br/><p>[Choose your reward.]</p><br/><p>[1. Wendigo\u2019s Fur Pants</p><br/><p>2. Frozen Crystal]</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, this guy is too weak!\u201d</p><br/><p>He\u2019s so weak, I don\u2019t even feel like fighting him! I kicked the snow on the ground in anger, and swallowed the Frozen Crystal.</p><br/><p>[By consuming the Frozen Crystal, your resistance and affinity to freezing energy increases. Your magic increases by 1.]</p><br/><p>[I love Shin! It became colder!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI think my affinity with Ruyue is already at its peak, but\u2026 Ruyue, I like Ruyue too.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ehehe\u2026]</p><br/><p>Ruyue rubbed her head in my chest, and I patted her while thinking about what to do next. First, I had to appease Yua\u2026 No, that\u2019s probably not possible right now. Since Yua rarely got mad, I didn\u2019t even know when she would calm down. I had an idea why she got mad, but it wasn\u2019t possible for me to do anything about it\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s the Wyvern\u2019s Nest.\u201d</p><br/><p>America, Arizona State, Page\u2019s Antelope Canyon. Its Field Dungeon, Wyvern\u2019s Nest. If I went there, I could meet Ciara Kenex, the woman who addressed me as Hero. I would know once I met her. Why she called me Hero and who she was. If she refused to speak, I would have to squeeze the info out of her. I was more than capable now.</p><br/><p>Alright, I decided. Once I finished grinding Wendigo and Ruyue\u2019s ability grew, I would go to Wyvern\u2019s Nest. Wash your neck and wait, Ciara Kenex!</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the start of a new arc. I lightly portrayed Ludia assimilating to Earth\u2019s culture. It\u2019s now time for dungeon, dungeon, dungeon! Then, we\u2019ll focus on Ciara Kenex, that suspicious woman!</p><br/><p>For the record, if you don\u2019t read this chapter carefully, you\u2019ll regret it later. Why? That\u2019s a secret \u2605</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>ICDS \u2013 romcom edition. Wait, what about when Ludia takes showers!?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

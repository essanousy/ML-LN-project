Third Season (4)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Chapter 279. Third Season (4)</p><br/><p>Training Ren and Paul was important, but Revival\u2019s other members were just as important. Some of them were slowing down in their dungeon climbing speed, and they also needed something to prepare for if they lost the dungeon\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>After thinking about it for a long time, I came to a decision. I was going to teach them Peruta Circuit.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeruta Circuit\u2026 The mana whirlpool that you use? That thing!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou already have a mana cultivation method, so I guess you might not need it, Lebuik.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I want to learn it! Let me learn it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Just focus on the one you already have.\u201d</p><br/><p>I shouldn\u2019t say this as someone who mastered Peruta Circuit at only 22 years old, but it took a long time to learn Peruta Circuit. Without Peruta\u2019s continuous instructions and, though I\u2019m a bit embarrassed to say this, my talent, I would have needed twice or thrice the time I spent.</p><br/><p>For those with already excellent mana breathing technique and mana cultivation method, learning Peruta Circuit might do more harm than good. Good examples were Ludia, who used to be a princess of an empire, Daisy, who didn\u2019t need to learn anything, and Ren and Paul, whom, as crown princes, must have gotten the best training from a young age.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo here is the list of people who will be learning Peruta Circuit from me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya Eleni Mastiford, Kang Yungoong, Shuna Aren Lihita, Illina Alexandrovna Mikhalova, Kang Yua, Minami Violet Sumire, Edward Walker, Sophie Brightman, Laz Michel, Ilayda Van, and Ciara Kenex.</p><br/><p>When Ye-Eun saw the list, she spoke dejectedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHiing, I\u2019m not here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already learning one from Duca.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there are seven competitors here. I can\u2019t be the only one excluded\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, seven? Tell me who they are now. You just included two people that you shouldn\u2019t have!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOwwwwww!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I was punishing Ye-Eun, someone else raised his hand. It was Leon, who had confused face.</p><br/><p>\u201cFriend, can I not learn that thing? Or is there a special reason I\u2019m excluded?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Leon. You\u2019ll be learning from someone other than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>I made a mischievous smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a sunbae who\u2019s perfect for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone like that!? Why didn\u2019t you tell me earlier!? Hahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause you needed to be a First Dungeon explorer to meet him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I see! Now that you mention it, I only became one last week!\u201d</p><br/><p>In truth, he was already extremely quick. Him being a Gold rank explorer of the First Dungeon meant that he had broken through 80 floors of the Second Dungeon. I made a bitter smile and asked Leon to wait. Father also asked me.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you couldn\u2019t teach it to other people?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did, but not now. I mastered it enough to teach other people. That\u2019s why I\u2019m willing to teach it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, but I won\u2019t need to learn it. I\u2019ll break through my limits on my own.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d say that, Father.\u201d</p><br/><p>I took out Father\u2019s name from the list without regret. Suddenly, there were only two guys left. When I glanced at Michel just to be sure, he smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll gladly accept your teaching. If I\u2019m not doing well, please punish me accordingly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it too much, Michel.\u201d</p><br/><p>Michel probably said that half as a joke, as he flinched at my serious response. I didn\u2019t go easy just because the person I was teaching was older than me. It was entirely possible that more people would join Ren and Paul\u2019s thrashing phase.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill it be okay, Shin-nim? You\u2019re already so busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sumire knew that I didn\u2019t yet master the technique I displayed in front of her. Her reaction was completely justified. Still, I replied confidently as I stroked her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. As you know, I improved while teaching you. I\u2019m sure there will be something I can learn while teaching Peruta Circuit to others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Plus, when the demon race conquered Oceania, I realized I couldn\u2019t be the only one progressing. When I first made Revival, what I had in mind was an elite group that could overwhelm any foe. Now was the time to make everyone stronger.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to engrave Peruta Circuit\u2019s mana path. I\u2019ll do that individually. I can\u2019t give everyone one-on-one lessons, but I\u2019ll check up periodically and give advice. I\u2019ll do my best so that everyone can one-day master Peruta Circuit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank god I\u2019m not on the list\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven thinking about it gives me chills. Crown Prince doing his best\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren and Paul hugged each other and trembled. I snorted and vowed to do my best for them too.</p><br/><p>After safely telling everyone my plan and getting their agreements, I set up appointments with each of the ten people who would learn Peruta Circuit. Then, I took Leon to Fairy Garden.</p><br/><p>[Prince-nim is here!]</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s Prince-nim!]</p><br/><p>[Ah, he brought someone else.]</p><br/><p>[I haven\u2019t seen him before!]</p><br/><p>\u201cOoooh! This place is amazing! How beautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as we arrived at Fairy Garden, nearby elementals greeted us. Although Leon couldn\u2019t see them, he could detect the magical light they were emitting. Seeing the assortment of colors produced by the elementals, Leon exclaimed in awe. To me, he looked like an old man from the countryside who came to Seoul for the first time.</p><br/><p>\u201cFriend, if there was a place this beautiful, you should have brought me earlier!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a place anyone can get into. I had to get permission from you too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m touched! I\u2019m really touched! I haven\u2019t felt this way since I first felt mana!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou use too many exclamation marks! Anyways, follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leon couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the elementals, so I had to drag him to Lin\u2019s workshop. When we neared it, we could hear a noisy hammering noise.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? He\u2019s working today too?\u201d</p><br/><p>For someone like Lin who hated work, he was working recently to a worrying degree. I tilted my head and kicked open the door to the workshop. Lin shouted as if he knew we were coming. He still had a hammer in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cArgh, just wait a bit!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin was striking a small cylindrical metal. I immediately knew what it was.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin, are you making a gun for Leon?\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t even ask him to. He was doing it out of his own will! Lin began hammering again as he gave us a glance.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, dude! Nice to meet you, I\u2019m Leon Pepper! That\u2019s a handsome horn you got there!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sure use a lot of exclamation marks. Wait a moment. Let me finish this real quick.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin seemed to have liked Leon\u2019s compliment, as he grinned and went back to work. Meanwhile, Leon looked around the workshop and continually let out awe-struck remarks. If I could live like Leon, my life would be filled with happiness. I stared at him absentmindedly as I thought about something.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026 Okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Did Lin get a satisfying result? He picked up the cylindrical metal brimming with magic power and nodded approvingly. Then, he turned his head towards us.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeon Pepper, was it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. What should I call you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin! That\u2019s a cool name!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin grinned and took out a cigarette before giving Leon an offering gesture. Leon nodded immediately, then received the cigarette Lin threw at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t usually give my cigarettes out to other people. Consider it an honor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, I\u2019ll remember it!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Leon tried to take out a lighter, Lin smirked and lit the cigarette in his mouth without moving a finger. When Leon saw it, he also put his cigarette in his mouth, and as expected, it lit up. Leon widened his eyes and murmured with the cigarette in his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat an enviable ability\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the first time you said something without an exclamation mark, and it\u2019s about lighting a cigar?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnlike you, Kang Shin, he knows what\u2019s good. Oi, let me see.\u201d</p><br/><p>He reached out to Leon. Leon tilted his head and grabbed Lin\u2019s hand. Lin then placed his index finger and middle finger on the back of his hand and closed his eyes. Question marks rose up on Leon\u2019s face?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 He was right. You really are like me.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a while, Lin murmured quietly as he opened his eyes. His expression carried an interest that didn\u2019t exist before.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what kind of a place is Earth? It has someone like Kang Shin, and now someone who has a similar ability to me. Interesting, it\u2019s really interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo how is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin seemed to be hesitating about something. When Leon grinned, Lin shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. I can use him to ignore the women bothering me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a very pleasing reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat floor are you on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leon replied immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only been in the First Dungeon for a week! I\u2019m on the 54th floor now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou advanced from the Second Dungeon? If you climbed three floors in a week, you aren\u2019t all that bad\u2026 Good. Do you want to learn from me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m always welcome to learn, Friend! Learning is what makes someone human!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow am I your friend? Well, it\u2019s fine. Ah, I haven\u2019t told you what I\u2019ll be teaching.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin let out a last puff of smoke from the cigarette in his mouth, then threw the cigarette into the air. He then took out a small handgun and shot it.</p><br/><p>A huge explosion bloomed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in Fairy Garden, Lin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I built it sturdy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin retorted lazily and put away his handgun, but I felt like I could see an enraged Loretta running over. Leon, on the other hand, was riled up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour ability really is similar to mine! No, it\u2019s even more amazing than mine!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, so you\u2019re at least good enough to see that. Let me cut to the chase. I hate people without talent and people without work ethic. I\u2019m teaching you since Kang Shin recommended you, but if I don\u2019t like you, you\u2019re out. If you\u2019re okay with that, I\u2019ll lend you my help.\u201d</p><br/><p>He stared at Leon.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to give it a go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leon faced him directly and smiled. His face full of confidence never felt so reliable.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake good care of me, Friend! We\u2019ll be seeing each other for a long time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Leon and Lin seemed to have something going for them. Was it because they were both smokers? I tilted my head, but if their personalities matched, that\u2019s all that mattered. I nodded approvingly and spoke to Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin, there\u2019s something else I want to request from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin put on a dumbfounded look.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I owe you something? How can you make a request so confidently?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy accessories are all broken. Please, Lin. You\u2019re the only person, no, draconian, I can trust!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m the only draconian you know\u2026 W-What\u2019s this!? None of them are even remotely intact!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as he complained repeatedly, Lin accepted the accessories. Then, after examining them one by one, he screamed. He truly was a master craftsman!</p><br/><p>\u201cReally!? I shouldn\u2019t have agreed to help this guy\u2026 Kuk, come back in a week!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Lin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo away!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin really was kind! I gave him a thumbs up while Leon snickered from the side with widened eyes.</p><br/><p>Just like that, I successfully connected Lin and Leon.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

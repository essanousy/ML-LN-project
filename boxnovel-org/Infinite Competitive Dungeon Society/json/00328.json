With Your Own Power (8)</p><br/><p>The jewel resisted, letting out a dazzling light, but it couldn\u2019t do anything in its current state. Compared to when I used Peruta Circuit in the Beast King\u2019s body, this was a piece of cake.</p><br/><p>[A human\u2026 won\u2019t be able\u2026 to contain me\u2026!]</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not as amazing as you think.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because of the Eliminator\u2019s fierce resistance, Steel had to use some of its energy for defense, and thus the Extort speed decreased. I concentrated on Absolute Soul and Peruta Circuit and held the jewel tighter. A large crack appeared on the green jewel, and the Eliminator\u2019s resistance dropped by a huge level.</p><br/><p>[I refuse to die\u2026 without having completed my mission\u2026!]</p><br/><p>\u201cMission?\u201d</p><br/><p>A rather interesting word was mentioned. While the jewel\u2019s energy continued to flow inside me and became mixed with my mana unable to withstand its flow, I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat mission? You\u2019re about to die, so tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[The mission, I was given\u2026]</p><br/><p>The fact that the Eliminator was \u201cgiven\u201d a mission suggested that there was someone who gave it to him. Hmm, was this guy just saying this to disturb me on its deathbed?</p><br/><p>[To eliminate\u2026 the dungeon\u2019s creator.]</p><br/><p>Around the large crack that appeared before, numerous thread-like cracks ran out. Before I could say anything, the jewel shattered into pieces and scattered into the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sure disturbed me alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, even if I kept the Eliminator alive, it was unlikely it would say anything more.</p><br/><p>I looked at the longsword that used to hold the green jewel. Although it no longer held the jewel or the enormous energy it held, the longsword was still shining brilliantly. At that moment, the longsword let out a faint light similar to when monsters scattered into particles of light. Immediately, I encased the longsword in my whirlpool, and the longsword\u2019s light returned to normal while its energy stopped leaking.</p><br/><p>This longsword was a weapon that the dungeon\u2019s power couldn\u2019t clone. It had stayed with the Eliminator\u2019s main body through the ages. Letting it return to the dungeon was a shame. Sherafina probably wanted to absorb it as always and give it back to me after she refined it, but I preferred now to have it my way.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat. First, I\u2019ll take care of what\u2019s inside me.\u201d</p><br/><p>I quickly absorbed the Eliminator\u2019s energy inside me and processed it to join the rest of the energies that I refined into one.</p><br/><p>But as I said before, the Eliminator didn\u2019t have that much mana. It was a lot, but it was still lacking compared to the other worlds\u2019 enemies I\u2019ve met.</p><br/><p>What was amazing about the Eliminator was its authority to dominate all weapons. This authority was what made a lump of energy like the Eliminator rule as a world\u2019s enemy and even conquer a world.</p><br/><p>Of course, just absorbing the Eliminator didn\u2019t give me the power to freely control all weapons. However, I did obtain the possibility. With its potential to grow, this power could ultimately reach that level.</p><br/><p>Without Steel, it would have been impossible to absorb the Eliminator\u2019s power so perfectly. At best, I only would have become more proficient in wielding various weapons.</p><br/><p>Sherafina could only have expected this much. The reward she would give couldn\u2019t have been greater. But because I absorbed the Eliminator\u2019s power myself, the reward she could give me disappeared.</p><br/><p>[As Kang Shin-nim absorbed the Eliminator\u2019s power, the reward will become limited. If Kang Shin is willing to release a portion of it, I can refine it into the dungeon\u2019s power.]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. Even if I compared to receiving the help of the dungeon\u2019s system, keeping the power in its pure form will be more effective against worlds\u2019 enemies.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That is true.]</p><br/><p>Of course, I was confident I wouldn\u2019t be disadvantaged and obtain all of the Eliminator\u2019s power. But since Sherafina couldn\u2019t read Steel\u2019s power, she wasn\u2019t able to understand this. In any case, I could always show it to her later. Her surprised face was something to look forward to.</p><br/><p>\u201cSherafina, did you know someone\u2019s trying to get rid of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no answer. Really, she only kept quiet at times like this.</p><br/><p>With a grin, I held up the longsword in my hand. This was likely an artifact crafted with the Eliminator, an ancient artifact serving to act as the base of the Eliminator\u2019s great power. It was yet another artifact that Sherafina couldn\u2019t read.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is enough as a reward.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Understood.]</p><br/><p>The Eliminator could no longer regenerate. It might be possible if the dungeon had the green jewel I absorbed and the longsword I was holding, but I had already absorbed the former.</p><br/><p>[Will you also reject the dungeon\u2019s offer to refine that longsword?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m planning on using it for something.\u201d</p><br/><p>I lightly rejected Sherafina\u2019s offer and held up Chaotic Spear.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s too dangerous. That sword isn\u2019t something the dungeon can analyze. If its properties are transferred, it might go berserk.]</p><br/><p>\u201cTrying it won\u2019t hurt!\u201d</p><br/><p>I then strongly struck down on the longsword. In an instant, the longsword disappeared and an immense energy flowed into Chaotic Spear. A blinding light shot out from Chaotic Spear, and soon, Sherafina\u2019s notified me calmly.</p><br/><p>[??? has been absorbed by Crimson Chaotic Spear. Growth: ??.??]</p><br/><p>I could only say one thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bug!\u201d</p><br/><p>In truth, I somewhat expected this to happen. It was just that I thought it was more probably for Chaotic Spear to undergo an evolution. It was almost at 98% growth. I didn\u2019t think it wouldn\u2019t evolve even after devouring the Eliminator\u2019s longsword. No, could it be\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u201cWas it also like this when it evolved into Chaotic Spear?\u201d</p><br/><p>Back when it was still Gluttony Spear and reached 99.9% growth, it only completed its evolution after devouring all of my mana. If it was the same now, would the spear evolve once I poured all of my mana into it?</p><br/><p>Though I came to that conclusion, I returned the spear into its choker form for now. It wasn\u2019t something to be done here.</p><br/><p>I did everything I needed to on the 90th floor. Since Chaotic Spear is also stuffed, it was now time for it to go work out.</p><br/><p>Beyond\u2019s 40th Floor Master was waiting for us.</p><br/><p>The 36th to 39th floors had Vampire Lords and Death Knights. Vampire Lords were different, but I was initially quite troubled by Death Knights.</p><br/><p>Although advancing in Beyond wasn\u2019t difficult, as I knew what kind of being the Floor Masters from now would be, I couldn\u2019t help but be nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe 40th Floor Master is also a world\u2019s enemy, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes. Do be careful, as it is extremely dangerous.]</p><br/><p>Sherafina\u2019s answer was simple as always. Was there a reason she kept matching me with worlds\u2019 enemies? Why didn\u2019t these worlds\u2019 Heroes finish them off, allowing the dungeon to take them? Was it on purpose? To help nurture people like me?</p><br/><p>If the Demon Lord wanted to enter the dungeon after losing to me, I didn\u2019t have the confidence to let him go. I would most likely tear even his soul apart.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, these Heroes defeated them, but weren\u2019t quite strong enough to kill them and received the dungeon\u2019s help. No, that was strange too.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis damn dungeon only gets more mysterious as I go higher up.\u201d</p><br/><p>I complained audibly for Sherafina to hear and entered the 40th floor. Of course, there was no reply.</p><br/><p>The moment I stepped into the 40th floor, an intense spiritual pressure swept over me. It was a stifling energy that seemed to reject life.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t help but remember my encounter with Lilith. From the looks of it, it was possible that the 40th Floor Master was even stronger. As long as I won, there would be a lot to gain.</p><br/><p>From a certain point, as I climbed the dungeon, authorities and mana rather than levels and items were piling up. Did other explorers experience the same thing? Did they fight worlds\u2019 enemies, face their limits, and obtain new powers?</p><br/><p>From what Kain told me, that wasn\u2019t the case. First, it was impossible for most explorers to absorb their enemies\u2019 powers directly, and no explorer wanted to face such an extreme test either.</p><br/><p>But one thing was for sure. Sherafina was offering me a unique path and I was accepting every power beyond her expectations. My previous battle with the Eliminator was one such example. Without relying on the dungeon\u2019s system, I could extract the enemy\u2019s power on my own.</p><br/><p>If the dungeon had three different paths, other explorers were taking path A, Sherafina was guiding me to path B, while I took path C.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t have been possible had I not learned Peruta Circuit and Absolute Soul. Meeting Peruta and learning Skill Synthesis through the Collector\u2019s Pocket Watch were two biggest reasons I\u2026</p><br/><p>[Come in.]</p><br/><p>A dreary voice abruptly cut off my train of thought.</p><br/><p>[How long will you keep me waiting?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, why don\u2019t you entice me to come in somehow?\u201d</p><br/><p>I retorted with a snort. Just like Lilith, the 40th Floor Master was blabbering even with the door closed. It meant that the dungeon\u2019s power couldn\u2019t fully contain him, that Sherafina couldn\u2019t control them completely.</p><br/><p>In any case, I somewhat had a guess as to his identity. I summoned Dortu and Peika before confidently kicking the iron door open.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ve been waiting.]</p><br/><p>The Floor Master room was a huge tomb. A chilling wind of a dark, damp limestone cave swirled around me.</p><br/><p>There were candles lit with blue flames burning on the sides of the cave\u2019s walls, and at the end of the line of candles was a truly grand throne.</p><br/><p>[Hero, it\u2019s so nice to finally see you in person.]</p><br/><p>The titan sitting on the throne spoke. Other than his size, he looked no different than a normal human. He wore a dark blue armor and held a giant bigger than his body.</p><br/><p>Ah, another thing, two blue flames were blazing inside his eyes.</p><br/><p>[Along with the birth of the Savior Hero, that person has also woken up from her long rest. Being unable to see the end of the long, long evolution was my greatest regret, but now seeing the protagonist of this story in front of me, having spent my days sitting on this seat finally feels meaningful.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou talk too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>I aimed my spear at him and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, fight me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hahahaha! This is my first battle in a long, long time. Perhaps, it might even be my final. Just think of it as me putting on airs.]</p><br/><p>He held up his axe. Feeling the death energy shooting out of his body in that instant, I realized he had long since veered off of being a human.</p><br/><p>[Rather than talking, I also prefer the sound of clashing metals and flowing blood and sweat! We truly think alike, Savior Hero!]</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, you talk too much. Here, have a taste of Heroic Strike!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was probably the only way to get him to move! I immediately compressed over 500,000 mana into one point and shot out. It was the start of the battle with the 40th Floor Master, Death Lord.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Above the Frozen Land (4)</p><br/><p>I knew too well how much the land had changed. It was the place we had landed. The shape of the continent had most certainly changed. Seeing the coastline cut unnaturally, I felt a chill going down my spine.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe perpetrator has enough power to change the landscape?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Dear Husband. The perpetrator only shaved off the top layer, like scooping ice cream from a bucket. We should be able to deal with this much!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to compete\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice was right. There was a gradual slope down to the ocean, allowing seawater to flow in. It was certainly something I could do too, though I would need to use quite a bit of my aura.</p><br/><p>Even so, the fact that the perpetrator used so much energy to accomplish this made me uneasy. He had to have a reason for doing that. I pondered for a moment, and suddenly thought of something.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be\u2026 Licorice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed she was thinking the same thing. She projected the satellite pictures onto her crystal ball again and zoomed in. When we saw the land, the frozen parts were all connected to the coast. There had to be a starting point where the freezing began.</p><br/><p>The answer was quickly found. If someone completely unknowledgeable saw it, he would only think of it as a giant glacier. This giant glacier was the thing clashing with the coast, and that was where the invasion was beginning. That giant glacier was undoubtedly the cut off part of Antarctica.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow we know for sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn.\u201d</p><br/><p>A ship. The perpetrator had sliced off a part of Antarctica to use as a ship. Being able to slice off such a huge chunk of land showed just how powerful the perpetrator was. At the same time, it most likely meant that he wasn\u2019t alone. He most likely had an army with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe crossed over to Earth recently. If he was alone, it could be that he crossed over long ago and was hiding this entire time, but since he has an army, it makes more sense that he crossed over recently with his army. But\u2026 How did he time his invasion with the Event Dungeons?\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know how Event Dungeons were created. From what I know about the worlds\u2019 enemies, I know that they use \u2018pathways\u2019 to periodically send their armies to Earth, and that the dungeon traps them in Event Dungeons so that humanity doesn\u2019t have to fight them at the same time, and encourages explorers to clear them for item and stat rewards.</p><br/><p>One thing to note was that during the second wave of Event Dungeons, I encountered a demon race in the last Event Dungeon I cleared. It meant both monsters and demons became trapped in Event Dungeons when they crossed over without exception. But what about this time? Did I encounter any demons in the Event Dungeons I cleared?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>I shook my head. I couldn\u2019t believe I only noticed it now. In that case, the answer was even simpler. Disappearing Event Dungeons and the appearance of the Demon Lord\u2019s army. It could only mean one thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Event Dungeons didn\u2019t disappear\u2026 Someone had the power to take demons out of Event Dungeons. As if they had everything planned, they gathered in one place and started conquering Oceania\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen the reason all the disappeared Event Dungeons were in Antarctica was\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. They could probably control that too.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was dumbfounded. If our assumption was correct, the demons were practically playing around with the dungeon\u2019s system. Either the dungeon\u2019s restraint lost its meaning, or half of it was rendered useless. Was it because they already have a world\u2019s power? I couldn\u2019t be sure.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m going to go see Loretta for a bit. Go rest in the Residential Area.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn.\u201d</p><br/><p>I hurriedly entered the dungeon. Loretta greeted me happily, but her expression turned grave when I told her my thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. That would be the same as challenging the Lord\u2019s power directly. That oldie might be annoying, but certainly powerful!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this is what happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuu. But\u2026 Mm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta shot up and began to circle around me. Then, she began to murmur to herself. It was a bit scary, but I let her be.</p><br/><p>Soon, she nodded as if she came to a decision. She turned to face me.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, try to resist this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cResist it, okay? Though, I would be happy even if Shin-nim didn\u2019t\u2026 Kuhum! Anyways, try resisting it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta didn\u2019t wait for my answer and closed her eyes. When she opened them back up, the particles of light freely floating in her golden eyes suddenly began to let out a dazzling light.</p><br/><p>Loretta was too beautiful.</p><br/><p>For a moment, my heart thumped and obscene thoughts crossed my mind. I knew I liked Loretta, but this urge\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cLo\u2026 retta?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, just like that\u2026 No, that\u2019s not right!\u201d</p><br/><p>I knew of Loretta\u2019s beauty all too well, but its current destructive ability was beyond my imagination. What happened? I thought I was old enough to be disciplined! Unable to control my desire, I slowly approached Loretta. Suddenly, I felt terrified. I felt like I was being sucked in by Loretta\u2019s charm, unable to maintain my own will. I felt scared that I was going to lose myself.</p><br/><p>In the end, before I attacked Loretta, I instinctively poured mana into my Evil Eyes and released the charm I had kept hidden. It was common sense that high charm countered another person\u2019s high charm. Slowly, my consciousness began to return. Loretta was still blindingly beautiful, but I was no longer feeling the same uncontrollable urge.</p><br/><p>As if she didn\u2019t want to lose, Loretta bit her lips and strengthened the power in her eyes. However, I also roused my charm and resisted her. At the same time, I understood somewhat that this was the power of Loretta\u2019s Evil Eyes. Evil Eyes that can threaten my high charm, as I thought, Loretta\u2019s ability was beyond my imagination\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cJust how high are you going to go!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOw!\u201d</p><br/><p>Realizing that Loretta\u2019s eyes were sparkling to a dangerous point, I smacked her head. Loretta then finally released her Evil Eyes and rubbed her head in pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cHiing, Shin-nim just wouldn\u2019t come over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who told me to resist it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI got angry because Shin-nim resisted it too well! If I were Shin-nim, I would have taken the opportunity to attack me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that what you were hoping for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>As always, Loretta didn\u2019t hide her intentions. Dumbfounded, I smacked her head again. Loretta pouted like a duck.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure Shin-nim could really resist it. Uuuu, why did the Lord have to put mares in the dungeon to have Shin-nim\u2019s resistance rise!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really need me to answer that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When I retorted, still dumbfounded, Loretta moaned with a vexed expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been three hundred years since my Evil Eyes of Charm got blocked. Well, it was also the first time it was activated in three hundred years\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo they really were charm type Evil Eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Evil Eyes I\u2019ve seen until now were all beautiful, but Loretta\u2019s were especially beautiful. It made sense if her Evil Eyes were Evil Eyes of Charm.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Shin-nim has the qualification to meet the Lord, and I just proved Shin-nim won\u2019t be charmed when meeting the Lord, so there\u2019s no problem. Meet and ask the Lord directly. That will be the most definite way.\u201d</p><br/><p>I see. It seemed she used her Evil Eyes on me in case I got charmed by the Lord. In that case, the Lord must also be a woman whose charm was on a similar level to Loretta\u2019s Evil Eyes of Charm.</p><br/><p>Of course, I wasn\u2019t looking forward to it at all. It wasn\u2019t just because Loretta was taking her axes out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat makes sense, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can go ask for you, but Shin-nim\u2019s free, right? This is a good chance to talk to her. Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>I had no reason to refuse. I was also curious about this Lord person. If I could meet her in person, I would love to do so.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, we\u2019ll go to Fairy Garden. Then, I\u2019ll open a road to where the Lord is.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Fairy Garden, I met Lokanyan who was playing with the elementals. She was like a cat chasing after butterflies. As a cat would, Lokanyan detected our prescence and turned around to face us.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Master nyan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin\u2019s been making something. He won\u2019t be with Loka nyan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Loka half-folded her cat ears with a dejected look. I flinched. What Lin was making was undoubtedly the accessories for Daisy and me. Loretta laughed and patted Lokanyan\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin is atoning for his mistakes by doing work. Just wait a bit, Loka. He won\u2019t take too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it, nyan. Master is really kind, nyan!\u201d</p><br/><p>I wonder if she\u2019d smile when she knew Loretta was the one who gave him that punishment. Since I didn\u2019t want to pour water on a good scene, I stayed silent. Loretta dusted off Lokanyan with mana and advised her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen your stomach gets big, you can\u2019t run around like now. It\u2019s not good for your child.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it, nyan! But how does Master know so much when Master\u2019s never been pregnant or even slept with a guy, nyan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Huhu, I have my ways.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster is really amazing, nyan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhuhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt like Lin\u2019s punishment increased by at least a month. I didn\u2019t even want to approach Loretta because her smile was so scary.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta held my hand and walked away. When Lokanyan disappeared from our view, she glared at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHalf of it is Shin-nim\u2019s fault.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way, only one out of two thousand seven hundredth is my fault.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s hurry!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Fairy Garden wasn\u2019t just an administrative guild area, but a rather mystical place. Just by walking while thinking about the person you want to me, you would be able to meet her. It was a place far out of human realm\u2019s laws, a place ruled by mystical laws.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let go of my hand and if possible, don\u2019t think about anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta warned me and grabbed my hand. Then, we began to walk step by step into the empty forest. With just that, the surrounding scenery began to change. From a forest to a meadow, from a meadow to a barren wilderness, from a wilderness to a hill, the sceneries changed as if we were teleporting from place to place. Soon, everything disappeared and we came to an area enshrouded in darkness.</p><br/><p>If there was even a single star, I might have thought we were under a night sky. If there wasn\u2019t a sense of vastness that made me certain the darkness expanded out endlessly, I might have thought we were in a dark room. Of course, neither was the case. At least, I knew we weren\u2019t in Fairy Garden. Using Loretta\u2019s existence as a key and using Fairy Garden as a door, we had arrived here. It was just like how I entered Fairy Garden through the pond in my mansion.</p><br/><p>This place wasn\u2019t connected to any other places and existed independently. It wasn\u2019t a place one could enter just by wanting to enter or leave just by wanting to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are we\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the oldie\u2019s taste.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOldie? How rude, Loretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Loretta mentioned her, a calm mature voice of a woman rebutted her. I instinctively turned to the direction of the voice. It was undoubtedly the first time I had heard this voice, but for some reason, I felt a sense of familiarity. While I was enveloped in this strange sensation, the Lord greeted me with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve met. I\u2019m Sherifina, in charge of the dungeon\u2019s administrations. Everyone calls me Lord, but you always called me something else.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I heard her voice again, I realized whom it belonged to.</p><br/><p>\u201cMessage noona! \u2026 Noona?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the empty darkness, message noona, or rather Sherifina, who greeted us\u2026 was a small girl perhaps even smaller than Ina.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Kahar (4)</p><br/><p>It seemed Cravis Empire\u2019s Crown Prince, Paul, couldn\u2019t go with us on our search.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to go too. The Hero is the empire\u2019s hope\u2026 but I can\u2019t leave. My father collapsed recently, so I\u2019ve been in his shoes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuku, I know. To be honest, I want to go to the dungeon and go wild like always.\u201d</p><br/><p>Paul going wild? I only remembered monsters going wild on him\u2026 Of course, I didn\u2019t say anything. After all, this was Paul\u2019s home ground.</p><br/><p>The Paul I knew from the dungeon was slightly different than the Paul I met in the audience chamber and the grand hall. Perhaps because I was more familiar with his dungeon self, it felt like a carefree, clumpy kid was forced to wear the clothes of a crown prince. He seemed too unfit for the position, but perhaps that\u2019s exactly what made him so passionate and foolish in the dungeon. He could be using the dungeon as a way of relieving his stress.</p><br/><p>Of course, that was just my opinion. It could just be that he had no sense for battle.</p><br/><p>I stared fixedly at the Peruta Mountain Range on the map.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeruta, huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, right, didn\u2019t you say you summoned Peruta? I remember you telling me that a few years ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I met him a while ago too. I\u2019m learning spearmanship from him once a month.\u201d</p><br/><p>Paul and Ellos both expressed surprise at my words.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? You\u2019re learning spearmanship from that Peruta? That\u2019s amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s probably not the same Peruta as the one from our continent\u2019s myth. Peruta is the top-ranking god from the empire\u2019s creation myth. As a principle deity, he\u2019s on a completely different league than the other gods.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018If they knew I had true names of other principle deities, they might flip out. Well, Deific Manifestation is different from gods\u2019 true names.\u2019</p><br/><p>In truth, using Deific Manifestation no longer gave me any advantage in battle. Although Peruta\u2019s spearmanship and Peruta Circuit were more powerful than mine, I had other techniques that he couldn\u2019t use \u2013 Overlord.</p><br/><p>Peruta was unable to bring out the true depth of his martial arts with my body, while I could strengthen my entire self with Overlord. Simply put, I was superior. Even so, Peruta was a good master and an adviser.</p><br/><p>While I was regretting never having asked Peruta about Edias continent, Ellos was coming to his own conclusions.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be the same Peruta. Spear-using heroes from our continent all called themselves Peruta, so the one Kang Shin summoned must be one of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t argue with Ellos. Still, I knew that the Peruta I knew was the one from the myth. It seemed this myth carried great weight in this continent. The mythical existence they worshipped so much was teaching me, who wasn\u2019t even from their continent? I could understand what they felt. That\u2019s why I stayed silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, why is this place called Peruta Mountain Range?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s simple. In the myths, that\u2019s where Peruta vanished.\u201d</p><br/><p>It really was simple as Ellos said. I felt my heart thump. Something was there. Something that would let me take a step forward. I was certain. If I knew that Edias continent had a vestige of Peruta, I would had come earlier!</p><br/><p>No, I wasn\u2019t late. Ellos said it was the most dangerous place on the continent. If I came before, I might have had to turn back without gaining anything. Now was the best time.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, we have to talk about who\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right. I guess it can\u2019t just be me and you. Since Paul can\u2019t go, besides you and me, I guess your fian\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at Ellos\u2019 left ring finger. Ellos quickly hid his hand, but I had already seen it.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He had two silver rings on his ring finger. One was big and thick, while the other was small. It felt like he squeezed his finger through.</p><br/><p>I stopped breathing. I couldn\u2019t continue what I was saying, but I also knew I couldn\u2019t stay silent. Still, I couldn\u2019t think of any words to say. In the end, I only said one word.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos responded promptly as if he knew what I was going to say. I didn\u2019t have the confidence to look at his face. I remembered him saying that he was always prepared for the death of his comrade. But if it was his fianc\u00e9e?</p><br/><p>Impossible.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, I\u2019m okay. As a tribute to her, help me find the Hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I promise. I\u2019ll save the Hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 Thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>He smiled bitterly. I felt like I finally understood why he sounded so down when I last talked to him.</p><br/><p>In the end, the party members were narrowed down to just me and Ellos. Rather than rescuing the Hero, fighting to protect the empire\u2019s citizens was the priority of the empire\u2019s knights. The ones that could participate in the rescue mission had already left with the other Dimensional Mercenaries.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou might feel uneasy, but trust me. I\u2019m level 60 now, so I won\u2019t pull you down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI trust you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos most likely spent more time in the battlefield than he did in the dungeon. Considering this, his progress was outstanding. Even with the Hero\u2019s personal training, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible without his tenacity. I was genuinely surprised.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was wrong to think I was the only one with talent. I was happy with his potential. The reason the Hero chose him as his disciple was likely also because he saw Ellos\u2019 potential.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome back safe and sound. Other knights will ready the things you need.\u201d</p><br/><p>Paul wished us luck. I still couldn\u2019t get used to him being a crown prince. There was something bothering me, but I forced myself to smile and left the audience chamber with Ellos. In the hallway, refreshing wind blew through the opened windows.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe thankful it\u2019s autumn, Shin. Fire elementals like to play around too much during summer, and fires randomly erupt from thin air.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve come during summer to scold those guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t really matter how the weather was as my body was no longer affected by it.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, monsters are threatening no matter what season it is. Before we enter the mountain range, we\u2019ll also encounter more invaders than you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><br/><p>We were entering the enemy\u2019s territory, and they were also madly searching for the Hero. Objectively speaking, this mission was ridiculously dangerous. We knew out destination, but that didn\u2019t mean we could just march there.</p><br/><p>For that reason, we left through the first floor\u2019s entrance. Soldiers and maids were busily running about. The entirety of the palace, the empire, or even the continent could be running around like this, preparing for the decisive battle. Their determination and tension showed the gravity of the situation.</p><br/><p>That is, until they saw me.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 There\u2019s a woman like that in this world?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhose woman is she?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, her brilliance is making me blind!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf she gives me a glance, I can die without regrets while fighting the invaders.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, wait a moment. Hey, you, come over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos called a few of them here and gave them an order I couldn\u2019t hear. Seeing the male knights and soldiers scurrying away, I could tell he threatened them with punishment if they kept ogling Lotte and Licorice. As a man, I empathized. Even if the world was about to fall, guys couldn\u2019t help but look at pretty women in front of them.</p><br/><p>Once the curious gazes disappeared, Ellos opened the map he was carrying. He then explained the route we\u2019d take in detail.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be dangerous no matter which path we take, but this is the safest. We\u2019ll only have to go around a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we in their territory anyways?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith this path, we\u2019ll avoid two of their castles. You know what that means, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>I did. Unless the invaders were like monsters who liked to live in the wild, most would be living in castles. Ellos most likely planned a route that would have the least amount of fights. I again realized how absurd this mission was.</p><br/><p>I reviewed my options. The straight path was shorter, but contained two castles on the way. Ellos\u2019 path was longer, but allowed us to avoid the castles. Since we didn\u2019t know what we would lose if we fought at the two castles, Ellos\u2019 path wasn\u2019t a bad choice at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cEllos.\u201d</p><br/><p>Still, I disagreed. It didn\u2019t matter whether I fought two battles or two thousand battles as long as the world\u2019s enemy wasn\u2019t there.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos tilted his head. I looked back at Lotte. She shook her head with teary eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to. Please, Hero is the only one allowed! Why can\u2019t you understand how I feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cS-Sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>She must have had a lot of stress built up without me knowing\u2026 I felt guilty all of a sudden. No, it wasn\u2019t just a feeling. I was guilty. Did she get smaller when she became a Blaze Queen just to prevent other people from riding her? In any case, it was hard for me to ask her to sacrifice herself. If I didn\u2019t have any other choice, I would have to ask her again, but for now\u2026</p><br/><p>I faced Ellos, who looked just as surprised as Lotte.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know any wyverns live nearby? It doesn\u2019t to have wyverns. I\u2019m looking for ridable monsters that can fly quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re okay with wild untamed wyverns, there are some in a canyon about six hours from here on horseback. But Shin, are you suggesting we tame wyverns to fly? First, taming wyverns is impossible. Second, we would be imposing ourselves completely by flying so openly in the sky. Plus, we don\u2019t have any time to waste to go tame wyverns. That canyon is in the opposite direction of where we\u2019re going.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEllos, here\u2019s my thought.\u201d</p><br/><p>I spoke resolutely.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll fight less if we just kill the enemies that can follow our speed in the air. Our pace will shoot up, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bold. We\u2019ll just be shot down!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a small risk compared to the benefits. Didn\u2019t you say Peruta Mountain Range was dangerous? We\u2019ll have to fight monsters there, so we can\u2019t waste time walking there when we can fly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFlying will be quicker, but the risk is\u2026 Shin, just what level are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLevels aren\u2019t important to me anymore, friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, I grinned. The two bracelets on my wrist, Pure Black Desire and Lin\u2019s bracelet, each glowed with a hazy, bright light. Since I\u2019d yet to name Lin\u2019s bracelet, I decided to call it Radiance from now.</p><br/><p>Ellos looked at me with a dumbfounded look and surrendered.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. Since I\u2019m risking my life already, I might as well jump into the dragon\u2019s mouth. I just hope we can kill it before it breaths fire and kills us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, it\u2019s decided. So, where\u2019s the canyon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNorthwest. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos raised his finger and pointed to a direction. Immediately, Lotte transformed into her Blaze Queen form and flapped her wings. Surprised, Ellos jumped back.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe really is a wyvern!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s different from normal wyverns.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll go alone. Forcing wyverns to submit is nothing for a Blaze Queen like myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long will it take?\u201d</p><br/><p>Six hours on trained horses. Disregarding the time it takes to subdue wild wyverns, it was 12 hours. Lotte smiled confidently.</p><br/><p>[Twenty minutes is enough.]</p><br/><p>Lotte then shot up in an instant and disappeared at the speed of light. Ellos speechlessly followed the trace of light Lotte left behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust who is that wyvern\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, she\u2019s not a normal wyvern. Alright then, Ellos, while we wait\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><br/><p>I put the map away and glared at him lightly. It was time to request what I\u2019ve been waiting for.</p><br/><p>\u201cTreat me to some food, you bastard. It might be normal in your world to send people off without feeding your guests, but that\u2019s unheard of in mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>You\u2019re sending me off to a place where I can\u2019t even open my inventory, and you\u2019re not even treat me to a meal! Paul, you bastard, I won\u2019t forget this!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The Last Member (7)</p><br/><p>Once he decided to enter Revival, he immediately held his hair by the middle. In an instant, he cut his hair.</p><br/><p>His hair that was once too long to bother to measure was now slightly above his waist. I still thought his hair was too long for a man, but he seemed satisfied with himself as he picked up the hair he cut off and imbued mana into it.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, I will only use Gungnir. Show me your and your guild\u2019s power. Prove to me the potential of your offer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take long for his several hundred year of hair to come together in the form of a spear. As it continued to take in Kain\u2019s mana, the spear became metallic, and I was honestly impressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><br/><p>He swung it around a few times then nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should have enough power for a one-time use.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than enough. What a monstrous amount of mana.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor several hundred years, leftover mana stockpiled on part of my body I didn\u2019t need. Alright, let\u2019s go to Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>He slowly walked forward and stepped out of his room. Even though he was just wearing a single layer of clothes, he was giving off an imposing aura akin to an dominating emperor.</p><br/><p>Still, he was an ally of an equal standing. No matter how pressured I felt inwardly, I acted fine on the outside as I returned to Earth. Obviously, we came out at the spot I entered the dungeon. In other words, we were right in front of the gate.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Shin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, Ye-Eun. We might not have enough time left, so we should hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Ye-Eun and other Revival members looked at the good-looking man accompanying me in shock, I forced them to stand back. It seemed Kain didn\u2019t plan on dragging things out either. As soon as he located the gate\u2019s entrance, he narrowed his eyes and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more powerful than I thought. Using the dungeon\u2019s power? A lot has changed since hundreds of years ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOr maybe, nothing changed at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>My comment made him pause for a moment. Soon, he snickered and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, I was mistaken. So, about entering that thing\u2026 Simply put, it\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t Loretta say Gungnir would be able to break through the gate? Did I trust her too much!? Seeing me shocked, Kain shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI meant it\u2019s impossible with just Gungnir. I\u2019ll need to add Sleipnir\u2019s power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I knew he was helping me, but I wasn\u2019t particularly happy with him purposely messing with me in such an important situation. When I eyed him sharply, he quickly continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll open it with Gungnir and send one in with Sleipnir. Only one person can go in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><br/><p>If only one could go, it obviously had to be me. I couldn\u2019t leave it to anyone else. I might have asked Father if he had a god\u2019s true name, but he didn\u2019t. There were many that tried to convince me and Daisy was surprisingly the most adamant.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go. Kang Shin, you already fought. Too tired.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I got an upgrade to make up for it. You should be feeling it too, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou used god\u2019s power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou used it too. I should go. Plus, we need your ability to fight the King of the Dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if Kang Shin gets hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about Mommy, but also Daddy. I want to go too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Ina too, stay here with the others.\u201d</p><br/><p>While I convinced everyone, Kain activated Odin\u2019s power. When Odin\u2019s power descended on the spear he made with his hair, the hair became larger and longer, and materialized aura rose up from it.</p><br/><p>\u201cSleipnir moves in an instant. The moment I shoot Gungnir, I\u2019ll summon Sleipnir, so hold onto it immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan on losing to anyone in speed, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>He nodded. I looked back at the others one last time and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep your eyes on St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. Daisy, if they attack us first, we might not be able to open our inventory, so have your Laki out. Everyone else, don\u2019t forget about what I told you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Son. Your father\u2019s here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father grinned and smacked my shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo relax and go save my daughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGungnir!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Father finished his sentence, Kain shot his Gungnir. The spear, told by myths to always hit its target, left Kain\u2019s hand and was sucked into the gate. Soon, the gate swirled and a huge hole appeared. Immediately afterwards, the eight-legged horse Kain summoned charged towards the hole. I use Divine Speed and quickly jumped on top of it.</p><br/><p>It seemed there was an unseen connection between Gungnir and Sleipnir, as the hole which was closing itself after Gungnir entered suddenly enlarged itself when Sleipnir neared. Along with a feeling of being devoured by the gate, I was sucked in. Sleipnir didn\u2019t stop and continued to run.</p><br/><p>The gate\u2019s inside was completely dark. The sky was full of black storm clouds, and black monsters that seemed to be minions of the gate\u2019s king filled up the sky. Compared to the Beast King\u2019s simple jungle environment, the current scene was far more pressuring.</p><br/><p>[Kuhuk!]</p><br/><p>The first thing I heard was a scream. Seemingly flying at the speed of light above Sleipnir, I surveyed the area. In front of me\u2026 was something gigantic.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>First, I jumped off of Sleipnir. It didn\u2019t slow down in the slightest and continued to charge before piercing through something giant. Again, a thunderous scream rang out.</p><br/><p>[How did you get in!?]</p><br/><p>Clearly, that giant was the one who screamed. I thought about what he was, but I couldn\u2019t ascertain his shape. How was that possible? He was in front of my eyes, but I couldn\u2019t capture his form?</p><br/><p>\u201cShin!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thankfully, I could capture Hwaya\u2019s voice. As I summoned Sharana, I used Talaria and flew towards the direction of her voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was thanks to Gungnir and Sleipnir buying us time. Currently, that giant was busy screaming out in pain and didn\u2019t seem to care about attacking us. Relieved that Hwaya was fine, I immediately flew towards her.</p><br/><p>Upon closer inspection, however, she wasn\u2019t \u2018fine.\u2019 Her battle dress was torn up and she was full of wounds. Still, she still had all her limbs.</p><br/><p>When Hwaya saw me, she widened her eyes. I stopped next to her and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you safe?\u201d</p><br/><p>She shouted back.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I want to ask! You were alone with a king! What happened!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI killed him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 Thank goodness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya drooped her body. Her teary eyes told me what she was currently feeling, but I didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>She continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew you must have entered by yourself too\u2026 I was so worried.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were alone with a king too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can die, but if you die\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya, there isn\u2019t anyone that \u2018can\u2019 die.\u201d</p><br/><p>I spoke firmly as I took out my Chaotic Spear. That giant existence with an indeterminate form had finished writhing and was turning its head towards us. I had no clue where to attack him, but Gungnir and Sleipnir had caused him to scream. If he had an immortal body, he wouldn\u2019t have done so. I knew there had to be a way to injure him.</p><br/><p>Moreover, in the end, he was one of the Five Kings. Just like the Beast King said, if one of them were vastly superior to the others, they wouldn\u2019t have been called the Five Kings. There may have been an hierarchy amongst them, but the difference wasn\u2019t huge. I had already defeated the Beast King. Now, Hwaya was with me too.</p><br/><p>I reaffirmed my resolve and spoke for both Hwaya and myself to hear.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to survive until the end, Hwaya. Stay with me until the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUntil the end? I\u2019ll be with your until the end?\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked back at her. For some reason, her eyes were strangely out of strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, you aren\u2019t interested in me anyways. That elf is the only one\u2026 You won\u2019t accept me anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll accept you.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, I turned around and prepared myself for battle. The large flock of monsters in the air glared at us and shot towards us like rain. Seeing how each of them surpassed SS rank, I released my Evil Eyes.</p><br/><p>Half of the monsters turned to stone, but more than half remained unpetrified. Next to me, Hwaya raised her hands and burned up the monsters with flames at a terrifying temperature.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You\u2019ll accept me\u2026 But in the past, you\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe way I think has changed since then\u2026 And what you mean to me changed too\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Countless number of worlds and countless number of enemies. I undoubtedly had a long journey ahead of me with my current comrades. Some of them may quit when Earth became safe, but I felt that most wouldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Coincidentally, there wasn\u2019t just camaraderie between us. For a long time, I was ignorant of their feelings or I had pretended to be ignorant. But now, it was hard to gloss over them. Seeing Loretta and Kain, I realized something.</p><br/><p>I was no longer just an ordinary Korean person. I wasn\u2019t even an ordinary Earthling. Considering all the things I had to do I couldn\u2019t restrain myself under the name of Earth. If I had to pick a name, it would be explorer. Or maybe, savior was better. So I didn\u2019t need to restrict myself to Earth\u2019s common sense. I couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Accepting only Loretta, but still brining other female members around to other worlds. I couldn\u2019t do something like that. I had finally decided, and now that I have, I didn\u2019t plan on hesitating. Imagining Lin\u2019s grinning face irked me, but I had no other choice.</p><br/><p>[You killed the other king! And you came to find me! Kahahaha, that lion died! Interesting, yes, very interesting!]</p><br/><p>The king roared. In an instant, I somewhat found out what his ability was. He didn\u2019t control high-temperature lava, he didn\u2019t have the ability to conceal himself from the world, he didn\u2019t have mountainous power or control toxic acid, nor did he control corpses. He controlled emotions of all creations.</p><br/><p>His voice caused ripples in people\u2019s hearts. Even the most powerful warriors or the most powerful magicians were mere humans when their mentalities broke down. This king had the ability to break down even the most strong-minded individual and bring him to ruin.</p><br/><p>I was surprised that Hwaya was alive after facing off against someone like him for dozens of minutes. At the same time, I understood why Hwaya would say something she never would normally. When I realized it, a chill went down my back.</p><br/><p>Hwaya was reaching her limit. If I came just a bit later\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya, are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>I resisted the effect of the king\u2019s voice with Absolute Soul\u2019s power and asked Hwaya. I was thinking it might be better to make her faint. But for some reason, Hwaya\u2019s answer was a bit strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m extremely fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>I turned around. Hwaya\u2019s cheeks were bright red like she was a volcano about to erupt.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really fine!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m so fine I don\u2019t know what to do!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya shouted. She certainly didn\u2019t sound fine!</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like I can kill him on my own!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya, calm down!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t die, Shin! I don\u2019t want to die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya\u2019s eyes shone with a fearsome light. In that instant, a fiery blaze shot up above the incoming minions. They were flames of a truly colossal scale. Thinking about how Hwaya still had such firepower, a feeling of respect rose up within me.</p><br/><p>Hwaya spread her arms out and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy right now and I\u2019m sure more happy things will come in the future! How can I die now!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s survive until the end, Shin! Until the end, crushing through all these bastards!\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps unhappy that Hwaya got her spirit back, the king led his formless body towards us. Just this made my heart drop a beat. Great despair that I had overcome until now with hope for the future suddenly rose up in my head.</p><br/><p>A great fear laid its gaze on us.</p><br/><p>[Come, Hero. Your body defeated the Beast King. Let\u2019s see if you can withstand in front of my fear!]</p><br/><p>The battle between us and the fear-ruling king had now begun.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

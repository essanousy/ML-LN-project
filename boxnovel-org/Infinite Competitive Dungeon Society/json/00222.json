Overlord (2)</p><br/><p>After taking care of the first wave of monsters gathered at the coast, only the dense forest stretching out to the horizon filled our eyes. The greenery truly extended to every corner of our eyes. No one would be surprised if a dinosaur\u2019s head suddenly popped up.</p><br/><p>We had nowhere near enough time to thoroughly search every corner of Philippines for monsters. We couldn\u2019t waste time. Of course, we had come with a solution prepared.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I just sing songs that attract?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep. Just focus on singing. I\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn!\u201d</p><br/><p>The solution was none other than Plene. To kill monsters with my Evil Eyes, I needed them to be within my sight. Although it would be nice if I could draw them towards me with Provoke, Provoke\u2019s range wasn\u2019t that big.</p><br/><p>However, unlike my shouting, Plene\u2019s singing traveled far and wide like the sweet scent of flowers attracting honeybees. Plene had never accompanied me to Event Dungeons or Dimensional Mercenary missions, but now was her time to shine. Ah, come to think of it, she did shine before when Event Dungeons appeared on Earth.</p><br/><p>\u201cLala~ Lalala~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a beautiful voice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get infatuated, Father. Snap out of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father looked like he was ready to crack open a beer bottle. I restrained father and strongly circulated Peruta Circuit. I could feel countless number of monsters coming over, attracted by Plene\u2019s singing.</p><br/><p>\u201cBattle units, you guys can rest. You must be tired. If you want, you get even go back to Resting Place of the Angels.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your consideration, Dear Husband, but we can regain our strength through battle!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then be on standby. You guys can help take care of the monsters unaffected by Evil Eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>To be honest, the succubi\u2019s mind sharing ability was rather convenient. I could just grab one randomly and the rest would understand what I told her. That said, I wanted to decline their favorable impression of me from going up at the same time!</p><br/><p>Everyone prepared their bodies and minds against the strong enemies we would face. As I circulated Peruta Circuit and waited for the monsters in the distance to arrive, I thought about ways to effectively release my charm.</p><br/><p>The strength, dexterity, and constitution stats directly affected my body, the magic stat was my mana itself. Although I wasn\u2019t sure what the luck stat did exactly, I could more or less control the other stats. I could display as much strength as I wanted and display as much speed as I wanted. If that wasn\u2019t possible, it would be impossible for explorers to live their everyday lives.</p><br/><p>At first, I thought the charm stat was like the luck stat, something outside of my control. However, after experiencing many things, I came to realize that it was controllable. Then, it must be possible to control how much of it I used just like other stats.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, if I could focus it to strengthen one part of my body, like the eyes for example, and stop releasing my charm through my whole body, I could get Hwaya and Ludia to stop looking at me with judgmental eyes. As such, learning to control my charm was one of my top priorities. After all, charm was a monster-like ability that could even demolish an ability user\u2019s self-control!</p><br/><p>\u201cLala, lalala~! Laaa~!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming. I can feel it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWould it be about 0.1% of the Philippines\u2019 monsters?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but there sure are a lot!\u201d</p><br/><p>0.1%... So we only had to do this 999 more times? Although I tried to trick myself into thinking positively, I couldn\u2019t help but sigh. Dealing with monsters on a scale of a country was no joke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sigh too much, Shin\u2026 I\u2019m happy, it\u2019s been a while since I did something with you since I can\u2019t be with you in the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI get it, so go away, Ludia. Your eyes are really dangerous right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband is so strange. It is only natural for a man and a woman to embrace each other, why does he refuse it so adamantly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the first time, I agree with you, Licorice. Why don\u2019t we exchange some ideas?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, let\u2019s cooperate, witch.\u201d</p><br/><p>I swear I\u2019ll learn to focus my charm to only my eyes! If this continues, I\u2019ll be conquered before I can conquer the Philippines!</p><br/><p>In just four days, we managed to completely wipe out monsters from 40% of the Philippines. Although there were monsters powerful enough to resist Plene\u2019s singing, they couldn\u2019t hide their presence from us. We just had to find them and kill them. These monsters could also resist my petrification. When I asked Daisy and Yua if they were interested, they shook their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot this one either?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there some standard I don\u2019t know about? Is it really because they\u2019re not cute?\u201d</p><br/><p>We only had five hours to rest per day. I was the only one who thought it was too long. At first, everyone rolled their eyes and called me a tyrant.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know we\u2019re on standby most of the time, but Shin, you\u2019re always using your power. Are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? You were worrying about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>As I planned on taking two hours out of that five hours to hunt Floor Masters, I couldn\u2019t help but be flustered by Ye-Eun\u2019s question. Were these people still doubting the power of explorers\u2019 stats? I received the answer to my doubts the next morning.</p><br/><p>\u201cStrange. Why am I not tired?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, even after I became an ability user, I still felt sleepy from time to time\u2026 but now I\u2019m not sleepy at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this is the power of stats\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wait, these people, were they in the dungeon for only eight hours a day like some office work? When I asked them, the others gave me stares that said, \u2018What\u2019s this monster?\u2019 It seemed I was the weird one. Hwaya advised me seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, I know you feel pressed for time, but there\u2019s a certain level of stress you get just from battling. Without you even realizing, your mind is being hurt. You\u2019re already getting stronger quickly, so don\u2019t push yourself too much. Many of us here feel pain seeing you hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yeah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Since she was genuinely worrying about, I couldn\u2019t refute her even though I really didn\u2019t feel anything. Feeling awkward from Hwaya\u2019s stare, I nodded. In the end, I didn\u2019t tell anyone I spent two hours hunting Floor Masters. Though, I suspected that a few of them already knew about it.</p><br/><p>It was on the fourth day that something unexpected happened. During these four days, we went around the Philippines using Plene\u2019s singing and my Evil Eyes to wipe out monsters. Before we noticed, the number of monsters swarming us decreased. It wasn\u2019t that there were more monsters that could resist Plene\u2019s singing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere should be more monsters the closer inland we get. How strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, I\u2019ll get the kids to survey the area\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMight die, dangerous. Undead, safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy stopped Licorice and took out a skeleton of a hawk from her inventory. Then, she put a small crystal ball in its eye socket.</p><br/><p>\u201cScout.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kiaaa!]</p><br/><p>The hawk cried and soared into the air. Its speed was incredibly fast. At the same time, Daisy took out another crystal ball that seemed like an enlarged version of the one she took out before.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can, see with this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, so we can use this to see what the hawk is seeing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFloor Shop 770,000 gold. Revival privilege, 70,000 gold discount.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without me realizing, my name was being used here and there. I told myself to apologize to Loretta next time I saw her, as I looked into the crystal ball. The hawk\u2019s incredible fast made it hard to see the surrounding scenery, but once I got used it, I could see the dense forested area around us.</p><br/><p>For about five minutes, nothing was out of the ordinary. As we already cleaned up this area, there weren\u2019t any monsters that came into view. Although it would have been nice if that continued, Hwaya soon shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMonster migration.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy answered with a shocked expression. She was right. A group, no a herd of monsters had finally entered the hawk\u2019s view. Strangely, they were all moving towards one direction. Land monsters were plowing through the forest, while flying monsters flapped their wings and cut through the sky. It was almost as if they were racing towards the same finish line.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere really is a commander\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya gulped. I could feel her voice trembling slightly. I understood why as one of the monsters running in the crystal ball was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this the same type of monster as the one Yua hated?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s the same monster as the one that didn\u2019t get petrified. From how much mana it had\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Sumire continued Hwaya\u2019s murmuring.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was an SSS rank.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHo.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was clear what that meant. There was no way an SSS rank monster would run like a dog playing catch for a monster weaker than itself. It meant that there was a monster that was overwhelmingly stronger than an SSS rank monster.</p><br/><p>\u201cA map, anyone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHere you go, Hwaya-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the succubus handed Hwaya a 3D hologram map of the Philippines. Comparing the map with the scenery in the crystal ball, Hwaya estimated where the monsters were heading to.</p><br/><p>\u201cLuzon Island\u2026 southernmost area.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya voice fell. Soon, she came up with an answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cBulusan Volcano\u2026 They\u2019re going to a volcano!?\u201d</p><br/><p>My instincts told me a monster my Evil Eyes couldn\u2019t do anything against was there.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s enough space there for all these monsters to gather, but this is more convenient for us. Let\u2019s head over there while we take care of the slow ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t know what will be there, Shin. Let\u2019s split up our forces. I don\u2019t know what the monsters are up to, but they\u2019re certainly not trying to help you kill them all at once.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was true.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s kill them before any more of them reaches the volcano.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have six succubi battle units. We\u2019ll split up and go with them. Shin, you go with Plene and kill as many of them as you can.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuccubi, line up!\u201d</p><br/><p>The battle units immediately began to line up. The other members of Revival also stood nervously at Hwaya\u2019s frosty vigor.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere might be a monster stronger than any monster we\u2019ve faced so far. You can\u2019t just rely on Shin to take care of everything. Make sure you\u2019re resolved!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, my daughter candidate sure is feisty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, you just scared other daughter candidates with that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys, is the Philippines the only country with a monster like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably not\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t help but recall the Demon Army Commander I met in the Luka continent. A monster far surpassing him was likely waiting for us. A monster that could control SSS rank monsters\u2026 how many monsters like this existed on Earth?</p><br/><p>\u201cSo the real war is beginning\u2026 I\u2019m shaking a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, we just have to kill them. What, you\u2019re scared?\u201d</p><br/><p>At Michel\u2019s muttering, Walker snorted and replied. Michel grinned and retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not. But since you\u2019re so full of spirit, I\u2019ll be expecting a lot from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrying to act cool, old man?\u201d</p><br/><p>After splitting up into a total of seven teams, we set off. Our final destination was Luzon Island\u2019s southernmost area, Bulusan Volcano. The battle was not far off.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

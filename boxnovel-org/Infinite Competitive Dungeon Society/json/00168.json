Double Crisis (4)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Chapter 168. Double Crisis (4)</p><br/><p>After clearing Beyond\u2019s 4th floor, I immediately continued to the First Dungeon\u2019s 55th floor, as I wanted to make use of the time I had left on Talaria. While I was sweeping my way through the floor, I received a message from a friend for the first time in a while.</p><br/><p>[Crown Prince, are you listening?]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Ren. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re finally picked up. Did something happen recently?]</p><br/><p>It seemed he had messaged me a few times when I was busy clearing Event Dungeons. I must have really been busy if I didn\u2019t notice. I spoke with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been busy with things in my world.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I see. Well, I\u2019m sure all explorers are busy in one way or another\u2026 So, what floor are you on?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to challenge the 55th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 55th floor?]</p><br/><p>Ren became flustered.</p><br/><p>[Just how busy were you? I\u2019m grinding the 55th floor\u2019s elixirs right now.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s one thing, but I entered the dungeon above the First Dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You mean Beyond!?]</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t hide my surprise that Ren knew about Beyond.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know, Ren!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[My fath\u2026 M-My continent\u2019s Hero was Beyond\u2019s explorer. I see. When we first met and you told me you defeated the Lizard Knight alone, I suspected that this might happen, but to think it really would\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cRen\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hm? Wait.</p><br/><p>\u201cRen, did you also defeat all bosses alone until now? I didn\u2019t think you did.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Of course. The reason I took so long breaking through the dungeon before I met Crown Prince was because of it. Fath\u2026 The Hero said I had to defeat the dungeons\u2019 bosses alone, so I defeated the Orc Lord and the Wraith Queen alone. It was just that I didn\u2019t grind the elixirs they dropped.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because he was so happy when he defeated the Lizard Knight alone, I always thought that was the first time he defeated a Floor Master alone, but it seemed he was just happy he succeeded without ever dying.</p><br/><p>[Did I never tell you about it? Regardless, meeting Crown Prince increased my dungeon clearing speed by dozens of times. I really can\u2019t thank you enough.]</p><br/><p>Putting aside the fact that he never told me about it until now, just what was Ren? The son of a Hero and master of a strong knight\u2026 Could Ren be a crown prince or something in his continent?</p><br/><p>Wait, Beyond currently only had three explorers. One was a woman and one was me. Then, could the other man be Ren\u2019s father!? I was curious, but I didn\u2019t feel comfortable asking Ren about it.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, the dense Ren seemed to have read my mind.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s unlike Crown Prince to hesitate. My continent\u2019s Hero is dead.]</p><br/><p>I felt stifled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 see.\u201d</p><br/><p>[There was no time to transfer the position of Hero to me either. Our enemies\u2019 evil hands had already reached the upper echelons of our forces and there was nothing we could do.]</p><br/><p>The position of Hero was transferrable. Loretta had told me about it too. However, it wasn\u2019t something that could be transferred so easily. Both the receiver and the relinquisher had to meet certain conditions and it took a long time. Simply put, once one received the position of Hero, it was extremely difficult to hand it over to someone else.</p><br/><p>\u201cRen, then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[I already told you. I\u2019m the only explorer in Panan continent, including the Second, Third, and Fourth Dungeons. Of course, we have no Beyond explorers either.]</p><br/><p>\u201cRen\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t believe that he could say what he was saying so nonchalantly. The Hero was dead. There were no warriors who could reclaim the world\u2019s power. I could understand why Lebuik had escaped from Panan. In that case\u2026 why\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you staying in that world, Ren?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren became silent for a bit, then spoke. Rather than saying he was choosing his words, it seemed like he was making a vow to himself as he was explaining to me.</p><br/><p>[Because\u2026 there are still things I need to protect there. That\u2019s why, Crown Prince.]</p><br/><p>Most likely, I would remember his words for the rest of my life.</p><br/><p>His resolute heart, expressing that he would not doubt his decisions and actions, caused me to feel respect for him. Thinking that I would never forget this moment, I said respectfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can help you with, tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Thank you, Crown Prince. I\u2019ll remember it. Hahaha, Crown Prince couldn\u2019t be more reliable.]</p><br/><p>After that, we chatted more about trifling matters and ended the conversation. I felt like a new courage had filled my heart. Thinking that Ren and I would develop into a special relationship that was different than the one with currently had, I stopped in front of the 55th Floor Master room.</p><br/><p>The 55th Floor Master was an ogre. It was large and muscular, had rust colored skin, and was said to be the strongest of all biped monsters.</p><br/><p>Strangely, it had two heads, which was said to double his strength. I was curious how having an extra head doubled one\u2019s strength, but I didn\u2019t think anyone would answer me.</p><br/><p>According to Ren, he successfully overpowered it with his overwhelming strength. Though, he said he died two times before he succeeded. As such, I opened the door feeling tense.</p><br/><p>\u201cFight me!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kyahahahahaha!]</p><br/><p>As expected, there was only a giant ogre standing in a spacious wasteland. The moment it saw me, it screamed strangely and charged at me. Every time it stomped on the ground, the ground tremored. Feeling its strength from the ground, I couldn\u2019t help but be shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy god\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was weaker than an Orc Lord with 7 stacks of Warcry! This guy was a total weakling!</p><br/><p>[Kyahahahaha!]</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, materialize!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ve been waiting, Master!]</p><br/><p>The moment Peika appeared in her dragon form, I jumped on her back and held the Chaotic Spear with both hands. Infused into it was none other than Sharana. With her, the chaos flame attribute wasn\u2019t eaten up, as she could amplify it purely.</p><br/><p>The chaos flame blazed ominously and rose up in a whirlpool along with the vigor of Mad Typhoon. I took in a breath and squeezed Peika with my legs. It was the signal telling her to charge.</p><br/><p>[Uhuhuhu.]</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, don\u2019t make weird noises and charge! There\u2019s only one reason I materialized you!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Short-term fight, right? Okay, I\u2019m going now!]</p><br/><p>[Kyahahahaha!]</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know what it found so laughable, but the Twin-headed Ogre continued to laugh as it approached me. As the saying, \u2018fools rush in where angels fear to tread,\u2019 went, this was exactly that. Plus, compared to the Orc Lord, it wasn\u2019t even that fast!</p><br/><p>\u201cEat this!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kyahaha!]</p><br/><p>When Peika shot toward it like an arrow and blasted it with a lightning bolt, it raised its arms and crossed them to block it. Ogre skin was famous for being highly resilient, and this guy was also a Floor Master. I wondered if it would easily block Peika\u2019s lightning, but it seemed the unsealed Peika\u2019s lightning was completely different than her old lightning. It instantly pierced through the skin\u2019s resistance and electrocuted the ogre.</p><br/><p>[Kyaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s what I wanted to hear! Tempest!\u201d</p><br/><p>When it let out a bloodcurdling scream and stepped back, I shot the flame whirlpool enveloping my spear forward! It blocked the Tempest I aimed at its left head with its arm, but the chaos flame devoured its entire right arm and began to scorch it.</p><br/><p>[Kyaaaahak!]</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Leave it to me!]</p><br/><p>The ogre screamed and swung its arm toward us. Although there was no way we would be hit by it, when its menacing claws cut through the air, they drew glowing traces of black aura, which flew toward Peika and me. Peika then skillfully maneuvered its body and dodged the attacks before she spat out another lightning bolt.</p><br/><p>[Kyahahahak!]</p><br/><p>\u201cNot enough!\u201d</p><br/><p>I still had most of my mana remaining. I gripped my spear tightly and fiercely circulated Peruta Circuit so that the spinning sound was even audible from the outside. In an instant, another whirlpool of flame shot up around the spear.</p><br/><p>[Master, the claw attack is coming again!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, damn it!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kyaaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>It seemed to disregard the flame devouring its right arm as it swung its arms violently. With every swing, five aura streams shot toward me. In the end, dozens of aura streams were flying toward me. Peika hurriedly flew up to dodge them, but she soon clicked her tongue.</p><br/><p>[Master, the auras are changing direction and following me!]</p><br/><p>\u201cTurn around and charge toward him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it supposed to be strong physically? How? He\u2019s just playing with auras! I gritted my teeth and tightened my legs around Peika\u2019s back to fasten myself.</p><br/><p>[Ehe, I can die happy now!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t die, Peika!\u201d</p><br/><p>Peika\u2019s body shone with a golden light and discharged lightning. Countless bolts of lightning flickered and dealt lightning damage to the ogre, paralyzing it.</p><br/><p>[Kuoooooooo!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even so, it managed to raise its left arm against me! I instantly widened my eyes and controlled Peika to dodge its thick arm. Although it was weaker than the Orc Lord, it was still true that it was stronger than me in terms of pure strength. If I faced its attack with my spear, I couldn\u2019t guarantee my shoulder\u2019s safety. Thankfully, Mad Typhoon could damage my enemies without ever needing to touch them.</p><br/><p>[Kyagagagak!]</p><br/><p>When it realized it missed, it turned its left head toward me and swung its arm once more. However, its stance was already ruined. I leapt forward strongly and thrust my spear out in full force. The chaos flame enveloping the spear swept over it as if to devour it whole.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll burn your arms off!\u201d</p><br/><p>After we successfully left chaos flames in its left arm, we brushed past its body. Then, we heard the aura streams it flew out striking its body and exploding. Peika instantly turned around and charged toward it again.</p><br/><p>[Master, attack!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m already on it!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I imbued my spear full of aura, Sharana cheered and expanded the chaos flames more strongly. Enveloped by the reddish black whirlpool of flame, the Chaotic Spear looked like a dragon.</p><br/><p>However, the Twin-headed Ogre didn\u2019t seem to want to lose so easily. Although its arms were being eroded by the chaos flames and letting out a strange smell, it raised its arms without a care in the world and screamed.</p><br/><p>[Twin-headed Ogre used \u2018Ogre Power\u2019! Its strength doubles for a period of time!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWow!\u201d</p><br/><p>A skill I really wanted popped out! My eye\u2019s sparkled as I pulled my spear back. With that skill, I could control Gigantic freely!</p><br/><p>[Master, that guy got super strong!]</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you block him, Peika?\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Of course!]</p><br/><p>It clasped its hands and struck down on the ground. The ground then sprung up. It was almost as if it used Dullahan\u2019s Outburst skill, except with its bare fists. However, the lightning shooting out of Peika\u2019s body perfectly struck the earth shards away.</p><br/><p>[Master, are we dodging?]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t need to waste our time on this guy. Charge!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without replying, Peika increased her speed and charged toward the ogre. I also raised my spear high up in the air. Above the whirlpool of chaos flames, white flames began to blaze. The Twin-headed Ogre spread its arms out and ran toward me. It seemed it wanted to capture me, but that definitely wouldn\u2019t happen!</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but\u2026 you\u2019re nothing more than a smallfry!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kaooooooo!]</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>It smashed its arms against each other. Some of the chaos flames around it even fell off because of it! However, immediately before it did so, Peika dematerialized and dropped me, letting me dodge its arms perfectly. Its attack brushed past my head and could only pick off a few strands of my hair.</p><br/><p>Before I landed on the ground, I saw a good target. As expected of a wild ogre, there was something asserting its presence on its uncovered body! Damn, where\u2019s the mosaic!? Otherwise\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cTake this! Egg\u2026 Breaker!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The flame whirlpool accelerated to the limit with Mad Typhoon, didn\u2019t just break, but rather ravaged and ground everything it touched. I dodged the blood, skin, and bone waste flying about everywhere and landed on the ground. Then, I let out a deep sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew. The spear hit an unfortunate area. From now, Teacher Ogre can never have a child\u2026 In other words, he cannot ever have a sexual relationship.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kya, Kyaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>I shook my head and held up my spear. The Twin-headed Ogre could no longer make laughing noises.</p><br/><p>It was already dead. Both mentally and physically.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Panan continent will come up again soon\u2026 ^^</p><br/><p>PS \u2013 The popularity contest has been pushed back to next Monday!

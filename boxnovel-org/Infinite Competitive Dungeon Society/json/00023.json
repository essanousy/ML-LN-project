Fall's New Students (5)</p><br/><p>Because it was the first time I saw a monster outside of the dungeon, I tensed up for a second. But because the monster looked exactly like a pigeon, I relaxed. Of course, I knew better than to let my guard down around a monster, regardless of its looks.</p><br/><p>As I made this mental note, my body shook. I thought I had received a KaTalk, but it turned out Su Ye-Eun was shaking like a vibrating cellphone.</p><br/><p>\u201cM-Monster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Oy? Ability user, oy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cS-S-S-Scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you an ability user?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I c-can\u2019t do a-anything with my a-ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot with that a-a-a-attitude.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people nearby were already running away screaming. With that size, it probably couldn\u2019t chase us underground. I took the frozen Su Ye-Eun by her arm and began running.</p><br/><p>\u201cSnap out of it! We\u2019re running!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-N-N-No, scary. W-We\u2019re going to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on, what happened to the person cornering me asking me if I was an ability user!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Su Ye-Eun was light, so it was not too hard running while dragging her. However, it seemed that pigeon was coming after us. Before we could reach the underground road, the pigeon flapped its wings and landed in front of us, completely blocking the way. I clicked my tongue and began running towards the opposite direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you plaster yourself with honey? Why is it chasing us!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I-I don\u2019t know! I\u2019m scared, save me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t open your mouth! Screw it, I\u2019m holding you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cH-H-Holding me?\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, I lifted her legs and put her in a princess carry. Feeling that my arm had gotten lighter, I continued to run. I was much faster running while carrying her than while dragging her along.</p><br/><p>Should I go to where lots of people are? No, that would only make it dangerous for others. Was that the only underground road entrance? No, but the others were already filled with evacuees. I couldn\u2019t bring the pigeon there. Then do I continue running until either Guardian or Freedom Wing showed up? That would be announcing that I\u2019m an ability user. Then\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, Su Ye-Eun, you\u2019re making this so much harder for me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cM-M-Me? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop shaking!\u201d</p><br/><p>I changed my direction to a deserted alleyway. Would others think of me as a hero leading the monster away from others? Or would they just think I\u2019m a fool? When I reached the alleyway, people watching from the windows screamed and shut their windows. Looking around, I found security cameras installed nearby.</p><br/><p>\u2018Not here.\u2019 I continued running. Buildings became sparse. It seemed I was at a construction site, as building materials were stacked nearby.</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright, perfect.\u2019 It was crucial that I was in a place where no security cameras could watch me.</p><br/><p>I glanced back. The pigeon flew past my head and landed at the construction site. I first let Su Ye-Eun down. She shouted with teary eyes, \u201cW-Why did you come here? Why did you bring me too!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Su Ye-Eun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou better keep this a secret.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>I picked up an iron pipe from nearby. It was 2 meters long with the ideal thickness and weight. Although it bothered me that it had a dull end, I couldn\u2019t do anything about it now.</p><br/><p>Seeing me pick up the iron pipe by my strength, Su Ye-Eun\u2019s eyes opened wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You\u2019re an ability user!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a secret. Keep it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I held the iron pipe with both hands and glared at the pigeon. It was hard to understand why it was targeting us. Was it targeting me or Su Ye-Eun? Although I wanted to know the answer, with no way of talking to it, I could only kill it.</p><br/><p>The pigeon began to flap its wings. Before it could fly up, I switched the iron pipe to one hand and threw it forward. White light spiraled around the entire pipe. It was my mana, one that caused other dungeon explorers to call me a Hero.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>That was it. The iron pipe penetrated the pigeon, pinning it to the wall. Mm, although its size was big, it was incredibly weak. Now I just had to get rid of all the evidence.</p><br/><p>I checked around one more time for security cameras or anyone watching. Then, I put my hand on the bleeding carcass and stuffed it in my inventory. My inventory expanded by 10 slots each time I leveled up, so I now had 190 slots.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it actually goes in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>I ignored Su Ye-Eun\u2019s scream completely and stuffed the bloodied iron pipe into my inventory. Now, I only had to clean the pigeon\u2019s blood. As for the carcass, it would come in useful one day. For example, when father registered as an ability user, he could turn it in for money. It was the perfect crime!</p><br/><p>\u201cSu Ye-Eun, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She still seemed unable to calm down as she trembled with her mouth opened wide. I sighed and held her hand, dragging her.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019re going to get found out otherwise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA-Ability user\u2026 You lied.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an ability user.\u201d</p><br/><p>I refuted her in anger. Then, with a face full of pride, I told her, \u201cI\u2019m a dungeon explorer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, I regretted it immediately. It seemed I needed to raise my intelligence stat more.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>19th floor of the dungeon. Along with the past three floors, it was a place filled with lizardmen, humanoid lizards with hard scales.</p><br/><p>Strangely, these guys wielded spears. Although I battled them at first thinking I could learn something from them, I soon found out they could only stab with brute strength.</p><br/><p>However, because they attacked simultaneously in groups, their attacks were difficult to dodge. Of course, that was for ordinary dungeon explorers, not me. My training wasn\u2019t so soft that they were a match for me.</p><br/><p>\u201cShwik, attack the scraggy human!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe looks flavorless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMind your own business!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a spirited shout, I swung my Orc Lord\u2019s Glaive and shook away the approaching spears. I then lowered my center of mass and charged straight at them. Because the lizardmen\u2019s spears were 3 meters long, there was a huge opening once they missed their attacks.</p><br/><p>Even now, they couldn\u2019t take a counter offensive stance as they watched me rush towards them.</p><br/><p>\u201cShwik, dodge him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToo late!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a short curse, the glaive I struck out pierced through a lizardman\u2019s neck. However, there was more than just one lizardman. I hastily took out the glaive and confirmed my next target.</p><br/><p>\u201cAvenge our brethren!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShwik, avenge him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming like bees.\u201d</p><br/><p>I imbued mana into my glaive, once again swinging and striking down their spear attacks. I tightly gripped my glaive and, in a sequence of fast and elaborate moves, pierced the necks of the lizardmen one by one. Of course, having fought the lizardmen for over a month, I knew their movement patterns in and out, making it easy.</p><br/><p>The only problem was my mana. Because of the lizardmen\u2019s hard leather, it was impossible to kill them in one blow without using mana. As a result, my hunting speed naturally slowed down and it took over a month to climb to the 19th floor.</p><br/><p>Of course, when I told Ellos about it, he bitterly said, \u201cYou bugged bastard!\u201d In truth, I wanted to encounter a real bug. Apparently, Ellos had found one on the 22nd floor and obtained a Unique-grade sword. I was dying of jealousy.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaak! Strong human!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCall for reinforcement!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReinforcement, called!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReinforcement coming! Kruna coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Hm?\u2019</p><br/><p>When I began to quickly dwindle their numbers, they began to spout something different. It was the first time something like this happened since I entered the dungeon.</p><br/><p>Kruna. If I understood correctly, it did not mean reinforcement. It was a name. I had heard of it before. Normally, monsters from dungeon floors did not have names. However, it seemed a named monster appeared with an extremely low chance.</p><br/><p>These named monsters were much stronger than normal monsters and could even use skills. In exchange, they had a low chance of dropping a rare item. Most of the time, however, it ended in disappointment.</p><br/><p>\u2018A named monster on the 19th floor. Curse my luck.\u2019</p><br/><p>Why did it have to be a named monster and not a bug? I complained as I fixed my grip on the glaive. Although I had been repairing it at the Floor Shop, I started to want a new spear. Since all the lizardmen were carrying spears, I expected the 20th Floor Master would as well. No, I sincerely hoped so.</p><br/><p>I leisurely hunted down the lizardmen, when suddenly, I felt a sharp presence. I backed off a little. When I laid my eyes on the presence, I was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was a female!? Shouldn\u2019t you be called a lizardwoman then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuman, don\u2019t stare! You, not my type!\u201d</p><br/><p>How did I know? For one, there was a light pink ribbon on her smooth, scaly head. Unlike the lizardmen who were carrying spears, this guy\u2026 or rather, gal, was wearing a fancy robe and carrying a wooden staff. But wait, what did she just say?</p><br/><p>\u201cHeroic Strike!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShashak, kkueek!\u201d</p><br/><p>Angered by her words, I instantly imbued all my energy in my spear and threw it. It was no doubt the Heroic Strike. Without even a chance to react, Kruna screamed and perished when the spear penetrated Kruna\u2019s abdomen.</p><br/><p>Until now, I had to spend dozens of seconds to concentrate the energy in my body on the spear. However, I had just succeeded in activating the skill in an instant. If possible, I didn\u2019t want it to happen this way!</p><br/><p>[You defeated the named monster, Kruna. You obtained the reward, \u2018Headband of Wisdom.]</p><br/><p>[High-rank Spear Technique became level 4! Your insight into the Way of the Spear increases. The amount of mana required for High-rank Spear Technique decreases slightly. You can display your full strength with any spear.]</p><br/><p>[You created the skill Heroic Strike! It concentrates the body\u2019s energy and mana into one point and strikes out. It uses the HP and MP of the user proportional to the charging time. This skill may only be used by its creator. The skill level is adjusted to lower-rank level 7.]</p><br/><p>[You created a skill! Heroic Strike is a skill that never existed elsewhere. Created with the most exquisite combination of energy and mana, this skill is a feat which must be passed down to future generations. You obtained 1 skill point as reward. Current skill points: 3]</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wait, what\u2019s this? Creating a skill?</p><br/><p>I could not understand why Heroic Strike had suddenly been systematically recognized as a \u2018skill.\u2019 Regardless, an extra skill point was always appreciated. Not to mention, becoming a skill meant that its might was guaranteed. All in all, it was nothing but good news.</p><br/><p>At this unexpected gain, I grew excited and even forgot about the disgust I felt from Kruna. As I was about to check the skill, I finally noticed the lizardmen growling and surrounding me.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe killed Kruna!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMale killed pretty female!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKill Human!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty? What is? The ribbon?\u201d</p><br/><p>At my inquiry of sincere curiosity, the lizardmen reacted sensitively.</p><br/><p>\u201cShaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKilled precious female! Kill male!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShwik, we cut it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cC-Cut what? Y-You bastards! Don\u2019t get near me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Taken by surprise, I couldn\u2019t help but stutter. Only after I blew them away with Tempest did I find my calm.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so harsh. You wouldn\u2019t be able to tell she\u2019s female without the ribbon anyways!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShwiik! Kill Human!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuman insult dead Kruna!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKill Human!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You created the skill, \u2018Provoke.\u2019 Shouting out with a bit of mana, it draws the nearby enemies toward you. A skill suited for a warrior of noble mindset that wishes to protect his weak allies by means of self-sacrifice, it requires 10 MP per use.]</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What?\u201d</p><br/><p>Something was strange. I had not gained any new skills since Spirit Mastery, but I just created Heroic Strike and Provoke out of the blue. But was it me or was this skill description trying to make fun of me?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, fine! All of you, come at me! I\u2019ll reach the 20th floor today!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You used the skill, Provoke! You draw nearby enemies toward you!]</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKill Human!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShwik, avenge Kruna!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuman meat!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeat down there!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDown where? Where do you think you\u2019re aiming!?\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, I ran around so much gathering up lizardmen that blisters formed and popped.</p><br/><p>Killing the gathered up lizardmen with Heroic Strike was much more efficient. The downside was that I paid too big a price to find out. It seemed I needed to raise my intelligence more.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

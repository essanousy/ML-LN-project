Double Crisis (2)</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally, the invasion process is extremely slow. After all, there\u2019s a limit to the number of times that the pathway can be used before it can be used again. But once a Double Crisis occurs, the dimensional pathway widens and the invasion speed accelerates. The world that faces a Double Crisis then faces more enemies more quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta\u2019s explanation validated Lin\u2019s words. Just like he said, Earth looked pretty fucked.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, tell me. How many Event Dungeons appeared this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout 300.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c300... 300\u2026 The invasion of Earth began 1 year and 8 months ago, and it was about two and a half months ago that the Demon Army from the conquered Luka continent began to reach out to another world\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman who was talking to Lin responded instead of Loretta.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like one of the forces invading will completely arrive in 2 years at least\u2026 Isn\u2019t your world over?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut it, Eleine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta said with a smile. The woman, Eleine, flinched. With that, their relative positions were made clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. If it\u2019s Shin-nim, he might be able to do it\u2026 He\u2019s completely rewriting the dungeon\u2019s history. If he can climb to the end of the dungeon within 2 years\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa? You think he can conquer the First Dungeon, which has never been conquered, in just 2 years? What floor is he in? 98th?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c54th.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s an explorer of Beyond.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman called Eleine had a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, are you saying that for real? Or have you finally lost your mind? Fine, as an explorer of Beyond at just the 54th floor, it is true that he is a genius. I\u2019ll admit that. Even so, it\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s physically impossible. He can perhaps barely achieve it if he\u2019s given 200 years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust 1 year and 8 months ago, Shin-nim was on the 5th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh, I knew that expression. That was the expression Ye-Eun had when I first told her about the dungeon. It was the, \u2018What the hell is this person saying?\u2019 kind of expression. However, Loretta gestured at her, as if it was a waste of time to explain things to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cEleine, sorry, but leave. I don\u2019t want non-guild members to hear what I have to say from now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should know this, but Loretta\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Loretta gestured strongly with her hands. Eleine\u2019s words were interrupted and she faded away. With a harrumph, Loretta snorted and explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat woman\u2019s is the guild master of the administrative guild, \u2018Lost Valley.\u2019 Ever since she fell for Lin, she would ignore her status as a guild master and visit Fairy Garden. You don\u2019t need to pay attention to a fool like her.\u201d</p><br/><p>I had the feeling I knew a similar woman, but I didn\u2019t say it aloud. Loretta then began to drink her tea again. Meanwhile, I asked Lin to fix my equipment. As I hadn\u2019t done any equipment maintenance for one month, they were quite bruised. Lin scowled, but still accepted my armor and began to work on it.</p><br/><p>Loretta, who was drinking tea, suddenly grit her teeth after seeing my armor.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin, Shin-nim\u2019s equipment is old. For how long are you going to let him wear such lousy equipment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNoonim, it hasn\u2019t been that long since I made them for him. Plus, they\u2019re Epic-grade items\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me say it twice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk\u2026 Understood. I\u2019ll make him better ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>I had felt it before, but perhaps Loretta was quite a tyrant to those working for her. While I was thinking about their subordinate-superior relationship, Lin glared at me and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I won\u2019t do it for free. Bring me some reasonable material, something that would make me hit my knees and yell, \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat would Lin be impressed by? Flame Drake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease. Where would I use that lizard? If you want to impress me with the type of creature, bring me a dragon or a peak-rank demon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin snorted and answered. He made me remember something. I took out the corpse of the Demon Army Commander Shatuno, which I had just stuffed into my inventory.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about this, Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Lin saw Shatuno\u2019s corpse, he bit his lips and clenched his fists. Then, he muttered like he hated it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, this is it\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you hitting your knees? Go on, I\u2019ll be watching. Do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAgh, how annoying!\u201d</p><br/><p>Besides Shatuno\u2019s corpse, Lin took parts of the Evil Rhinoceros Beetle\u2019s carapace, the Cyclops Lord\u2019s skin and blood, and other monsters which were stuffed in my inventory. Then, he took Red Dragon Felixes\u2019 Cape, which was originally attached to the armor set.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll refine the cape by adding the demon\u2019s skin. It looks like I\u2019ll be busy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat! It looks like you found yourself a job to do, Lin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already have a lot! Do you want to kill me, noonim!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEi, how could my Lin die from something like that? So hurry up~\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta pressured Lin with a bright smile. Lin scratched his head and let out a deep sigh before he got up.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it\u2026 Then I\u2019m going to go work on these. Oi, Kang Shin. It\u2019s going to take me a while, so live without a cape for a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d</p><br/><p>He gave me a snort and left the cabin. Seeing his back, Loretta snickered.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin must really like Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich part of that conversation gave you that idea!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know? No matter how much I plead, Lin never makes equipment for someone he hates.\u201d</p><br/><p>I thought what Loretta did was more like threatening with authority than pleading, but I must have misunderstood. I was certain. It definitely wasn\u2019t because I was afraid of her Last Bullet of Extermination.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Shin-nim, let\u2019s go back to talking about the matter at hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta put down her teacup, placed her hands on her knees, and looked at me intently. Her mystical eyes that occasionally flashed with light seemed to be examining me with worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, don\u2019t worry too much about what Eleine said. It\u2019s not over yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>I remembered what we just talked about. However, the fact that 20 years had turned into 2 years didn\u2019t really strike me as real.</p><br/><p>2 years? I had to face someone like that Demon Lord in 2 years? Compared to the Luka continent\u2019s countless number of warriors, Earth was too ill-prepared. The ability users were not finished growing yet and there were only a few dungeon explorers. We could only now begin to look for trustworthy allies, but to think we only had 2 years left\u2026</p><br/><p>Not to mention, the one behind this crisis was none other than the Demon Lord who attacked the Luka continent\u2026 I asked the suspicion I had since a while ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s a coincidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta interrupted me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not because Shin-nim went as a Dimensional Mercenary. If that was enough to cause a Double Crisis, no one would want to be a Dimensional Mercenary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m Earth\u2019s Hero. Could that have affected\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Shin-nim, I can promise you. That\u2019s not it. Do you not trust me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta brought her face up to mine. Her golden eyes were shining like two bright gems. She was close enough for me to feel her breath. Seeing Loretta\u2019s resolute eyes, I shook my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI trust you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Demon Lord probably doesn\u2019t know about Shin-nim\u2019s existence. He will only realize once he crosses over. He simply invaded another world through a pathway, which happened to lead to Earth. Please, trust me, Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, I trust you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn\u2026 Good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta moved back with a satisfied expression. Then, she suddenly clapped.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then think about what you should do now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should finish climbing the dungeon in 2 years!\u201d</p><br/><p>She said it as if it was simple.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf possible, your allies, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sounds extremely difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Shin-nim is the only one qualified to enter Beyond, right? If it\u2019s just the First Dungeon, Shin-nim\u2019s friends might be able to succeed with a monopoly over the blessings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d like it if that were the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that happens, you have a great chance to succeed. I can guarantee it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want us to do in just 2 years what other explorers couldn\u2019t in hundreds of years?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOtherwise, Shin-nim\u2019s world will come to an end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When I became silent, Loretta also became silent. This time, the silence continued for a long time. When I couldn\u2019t handle the atmosphere anymore and was about to get up, Loretta opened her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf\u2026 If Shin-nim is scared\u2026 I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Loretta?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you abandon your world, I won\u2019t blame you.\u201d</p><br/><p>I doubted my ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would go against the dungeon and the Lord\u2019s philosophy\u2026 but Shin-nim is more important to me. I, I won\u2019t blame you, so if\u2026 if the burden gets too heavy\u2026 if Shin-nim can\u2019t bear it anymore\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I cut her off and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happens if I run away?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 If a Hero stays in the dungeon for too long, it will be the same as his world losing its power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, the same thing that happened to the Luka continent will happen to Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Her silence was the strongest affirmation. Seeing her reaction, I felt alleviated.</p><br/><p>Running away\u2026 It wasn\u2019t that I hadn\u2019t considered it. But if I did, what about my parents? Even if I made mother and Yua into dungeon explorers and brought them to the dungeon, what about my friends? Would they think the same way as me? If they didn\u2019t, would I be able to leave them behind and abandon Earth?</p><br/><p>No, of course not. I didn\u2019t plan to in the first place. Why did I have to abandon my friends and escape to the dungeon? Because of the Demon Lord? Because of the other unknown enemy? I should stay put in the dungeon because I was afraid of them? If I threw away what was important to me and survived, would the life I have be worth living?</p><br/><p>I was certain that the answer was no. I hated losing my freedom the most. No one could tie me down. I hated the people trying to restrain me because I was a Hero, but what I hated the most was throwing away my freedom because i was afraid of monsters.</p><br/><p>I grinned.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou already know my answer, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Shin-nim\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI decided. 2 years, right? Are you sure about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yes. It\u2019s 2 years at the earliest. But\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it within 2 years then.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said lightly and smiled. Then, I wiped Loretta\u2019s eyes, which were beginning to tear up.</p><br/><p>\u201cShort and simple. If I can conquer the dungeon in 2 years, I can destroy whatever comes my way, be it the Demon Lord or anything else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cB-But it doesn\u2019t have to be Shin-nim that does\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s only me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it. I know I can. So don\u2019t worry and just watch over me. I\u2019ll break through the dungeon and save the world. I\u2019ll be the coolest guy in the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-niiim\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta was still frowning. So, I continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Loretta, I\u2019ll make sure I succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor\u2026 me\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, I\u2019m going to be different. Trust me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta widened her eyes. With her already big eyes, she looked slightly scary.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No, Shi, Shin-nim, I, Shin-nim is the only, ah, uuk, did you perhaps meet, ahuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta ended up biting her tongue. I couldn\u2019t help but laugh seeing her clumsiness.</p><br/><p>\u201cI already know. Don\u2019t worry about something like that and wait. The First Dungeon\u2019s 54th floor and Beyonds\u2019 4th floor. I\u2019ll first clear them and come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>I patted her head and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I trust you. I trust in Shin-nim\u2019s potential. So\u2026 let me keep supporting you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Then, I\u2019ll be off.\u201d</p><br/><p>I smiled and left the cabin. I heard Loretta\u2019s sniffling, but I didn\u2019t turn around.</p><br/><p>Now, it was the time to conquer the dungeon! Just you wait, 100th floor!</p><br/><p>\u2026 By the way, I didn't propose to Loretta, did I!?</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>You waited long, everyone. This chapter was of Loretta, for Loretta, and with Loretta! This is what everyone wanted, right!?</p><br/><p>Shin\u2019s heart has been slightly revealed as well. If the others don\u2019t try harder, the fight for the heroine position might just end! We need those popularity contest votes!</p><br/><p>From the next chapter, we\u2019ll go full-speed to the upper levels of the dungeon. There will be Event Raids, other administrative guilds, other strong/famous guilds, etc. along the way, but those aren\u2019t important!</p><br/><p>Editor\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Wooo loretta x shin ship is real</p><br/>\n</div>"}

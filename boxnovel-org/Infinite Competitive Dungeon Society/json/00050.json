Hermes (5)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe 30th and 35th floor\u2019s first achievement have been completed as well by the same Hero from 1,500 years ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow unfortunate, Shin-nim. Luckily, the next one is\u2026 oops.\u201d</p><br/><p>For a piece of information worth 50,000 gold, it made me feel nothing but emptiness. However, from Loretta\u2019s \u2018accidental\u2019 follow up, it seemed the 40th Floor Master\u2019s first had not been taken. That was enough. Until then, I\u2019d refrain from being too adventurous and focus on obtaining the Floor Master slayer title. Afterwards, I could \u2018master\u2019 the 40th Floor Master.</p><br/><p>The only problem left to solve now was to break through the 25th floor and join Ellos and Palludia.</p><br/><p>As the 25th floor had a mix of zombies and ghouls just like the 24th floor, I could easily get through it. However, as it also had a Floor Master room, I could not obtain a title from clearing it. When I arrived in front of the Floor Master door, I stopped and contacted Ellos.</p><br/><p>\u201cEllos, are you on the 25th floor?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Mm, yeah. I\u2019m near the end. I\u2019ll be at the \u2018door\u2019 soon. What about you? Can you really come here on your own? We can party with you if you want.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m in front of the door. The 25th floor\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Really?]</p><br/><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos went silent for a while, then continued after laughing.</p><br/><p>[I see. You are a \u2018Hero\u2019 after all. I\u2019ll hurry, see you in a bit.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>I then contacted Palludia.</p><br/><p>\u201cPalludia, it\u2019s Kang Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>[What? I told you not to contact me before reaching the 25th floor.]</p><br/><p>For someone who said that, she answered extremely quickly, as if she\u2019d been waiting. As I didn\u2019t want get on her nerves, I only said what I wanted to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the 25th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Really?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Okay, good job. Huhu, Shina you liar. As I thought, rather than you, he prefers\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt like I had heard a familiar name. However, Palludia said it was nothing.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ve been on the 25th floor since two weeks ago! But because I was busy with my world\u2019s war, coincidentally, really coincidentally, I couldn\u2019t enter the dungeon for a while. My first time challenging the Floor Master will be with you. You should think of it as an honor!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat reminds me of the first time we fought the Orc Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t bring that up! That was a long time ago. I\u2019m no longer a little kid!]</p><br/><p>If I looked at all the messages she sent me until now, she was undoubtedly still the same little kid. Of course, I didn\u2019t say that to her either.</p><br/><p>\u201cEllos says he\u2019ll be here in a bit. Let\u2019s wait for him and we can challenge the Floor Master together.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Okay. Hey, I heard you stayed in the 5th floor for over 3 years. Are you sure your skills haven\u2019t turned rusty? Since you\u2019ll be in this Palludia Gren Ehuir-nim\u2019s raid party, I won\u2019t allow stupid, orc-like things!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI also climbed to the 25th floor in under a year. Palludia, you\u2019ve heard of my Crown Prince nickname, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Pfft.]</p><br/><p>Palludia snorted. In that instant, I felt my blood boiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t laugh! It\u2019s not funny!\u201d</p><br/><p>[O-Orc is Crown Prince\u2026 Pfft, pff.]</p><br/><p>\u201cEeeek! I\u2019m not an orc anymore, you little kid!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m not a little kid either! Boo, boo! I\u2019ll be the one to judge whether you\u2019re still an orc or not, so look forward to it!]</p><br/><p>\u201cFine! I\u2019ll also be the one to judge whether you\u2019re a little kid or not! Hmph!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, we ended our conversation after a little argument. Ah, I forgot to ask why she wanted to party with me after so long.</p><br/><p>This childish crown princess really was unpredictable. She started an argument when we first met, she charged at the Orc Lord with just her staff because her friend was killed, and she added me to her friend list even though she seemed to hate me.</p><br/><p>I would find out soon enough. Since I promised Palludia, it felt wrong to fight the Floor Master before I met up with her and Ellos. What should I do now?</p><br/><p>Upon thinking about it, the answer was clear. It was to use the Event Dungeon Entrance Ticket I got from the 24th floor and clear the dungeon.</p><br/><p>[Event Dungeon Entrance Ticket: Giant Zombie\u2019s Attack</p><br/><p>An entrance ticket to an Event Dungeon. If ripped in half, it allows up to two people to enter the Event Dungeon. Recommended level: 25-30.]</p><br/><p>Looking at the description, I felt conflicted. Should I contact Palludia again? No, wait, was I high? Why would I enter a dungeon alone with that yappy little kid? With that, I erased the thought from my head. What other choice did I have? Ellos was still trying to get to the door\u2026 What about Shina? No, Shina shouldn\u2019t even be at the 20th floor yet.</p><br/><p>In the end, father was the only choice I had. He was the only person I could fully trust to cover my back.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather.\u201d</p><br/><p>[What\u2019s up, son?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat floor are you on, father?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m on the 25th. Why, do you want to party with your father? I refuse. My contribution will go down if I party with you.]</p><br/><p>Since his reason for saying no was a roundabout way of praising me, I felt a bit embarrassed. Scratching my head, I continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have an Event Dungeon Entrance Ticket.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hurry up and invite me to the party.]</p><br/><p>Father\u2019s attitude took a complete turn. What fervor, greed, and initiative! Though I didn\u2019t want to admit it, I took after him too much!</p><br/><p>After accepting my party request, father appeared. He was wearing the same clothes as when he was in Yeungdeungpo\u2019s Event Dungeon. The only difference was that he was wearing the bracelet he earned as reward on his right wrist.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, what an excellent spear! Where did you get it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, mm, a named monster dropped it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ask that right away! Father\u2019s eyes sparkled at the word \u2018named monster.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cNamed monsters, I love those guys. I wish they appeared more often. They have a nice tactile feeling too, when I hit them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably the only one who wants to fight them because you like the feeling of hitting their flesh. Anyways, are you ready?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. You see, I cleared the 24th floor pretty quick and got a \u2018One Who Dashes Through Graveyards\u2019 title. It lets me deal 20 percent more damage to all undead monsters with physical bodies. Amazing, isn\u2019t it!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it is, father!\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t tell him I received a similar title as well as a god\u2019s true name. I knew how to care for father\u2019s pride. I was a filial son, unlike my childish father!</p><br/><p>After confirming that we were in a party, I ripped the entrance ticket in half. In an instant, the surrounding scenery melted. If Earth\u2019s Event Dungeons could be entered through Gates, entering an Event Dungeon in the dungeon was like us being on TV and someone changing the TV channel with us still standing in place.</p><br/><p>Eventually, the surroundings stopped warping and we found ourselves on a plain with arrows raining down.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwat!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this!?\u201d</p><br/><p>We quickly struck the arrows flying toward us and surveyed the area. It was a battlefield. Soldiers wearing different armor were stabbing each other with swords, while archers and magicians were attacking from long-range even at the cost of hitting their allies. It was a place where humans slaughtered humans. When I realized this, I got a dull headache and my breathing became rough.</p><br/><p>\u2018Snap out of it, Kang Shin! Don\u2019t let something like this scare you! How can you become the world\u2019s strongest if you\u2019re so weak?\u2019</p><br/><p>No matter how I tried to regain my composure, it was true that I was in an incomprehensible situation. Shouldn\u2019t I be in an Event Dungeon?</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I saw a soldier attacking me with his sword as he asked for my identity. As I couldn\u2019t kill another human being, I lightly parried his spear and sent it flying. The spear then landed about 20 meters away, piercing one of the corpses lying on the ground. At least, I hoped that it was a corpse. I entered an Event Dungeon, I didn\u2019t want to suddenly become a murderer.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, let\u2019s get away from here for now. We\u2019ll be targeted if we stay here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soldiers from both sides came after us like fire ants. We sent each of them flying as we ran. As we were like erasers making the part of the battlefield we were in empty, everyone on the battlefield began to eye us.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are they!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKill them first!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAttack, attack!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if the soldiers hit me, they would not even be able to scratch me. However, the magicians were a different story. It was why I was quickly trying to escape this battlefield.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t the entrance ticket say \u2018giant zombie\u2019s attack\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it did.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s this? Are these people even real?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask me, son. Your father isn\u2019t that bright either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because I felt like I was getting stupider the more I talked with father, I stopped thinking altogether. If I knew this would happen, I would have asked Loretta more about Event Dungeons. Was my intelligence not done updating? Just how rarely did I use my brain\u2026 ah, a fireball!</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, dodge it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEit!\u201d</p><br/><p>Father lightly swung his spear and shot out a shockwave. The fireball collided with the shockwave and exploded, killing the nearby soldiers.</p><br/><p>Although a countless number of people were already dying in this battlefield, I became annoyed after finding out people had died from the fireball father exploded. I barely held in my desire to curse aloud. Although these soldiers were trying to kill us, I couldn\u2019t help myself from how I felt.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a message rang out.</p><br/><p>[You obtained 70 gold.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Father, these guys are monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard it too.\u201d</p><br/><p>At least, I did not know any human that dropped gold when they died. Although I had faced numerous humanoid monsters, I didn\u2019t think the dungeon would actually send humans as monsters. I suddenly felt that this Event Dungeon had a terrible personality.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, they were created when we entered the Event Dungeon. They aren\u2019t actual humans, so you don\u2019t need to feel sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about my mental health, father. I know fully well what they are. I just don\u2019t like the fact that I have to kill them, when they are so much like humans.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you want to get away from here first? Going by its name, a giant zombie should appear eventually.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s\u2026 Thanks, father.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that. It gives me goosebumps.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, I got goosebumps too from that.\u201d</p><br/><p>As we both scratched the goosebumps on our skin, we hurried off the battlefield. Although there were soldiers coming after us like flies, we took care of them softly as we made our escape.</p><br/><p>Eventually, we reached a place where the shouts of the battlefield became faint. It was only then that we realized how big the battlefield was. From the hill we were on, we could see the battlefield stretching out across the horizon.</p><br/><p>In the vast plain without even a single hint of greenery, the corpses of soldiers were piled up and blood flowed like a river. Although I had seen a lot of monster corpses, they couldn\u2019t match up to the cruel scene of humans killing other humans. We had escaped the battlefield, but the fight continued. It seemed it would not end until one side was completely eliminated. Just how many people would die here? 100,000? 200,000?</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter monsters appeared on Earth, do you think the conflicts between different countries increased or decreased?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I was watching this scene blankly, father asked me. After thinking about it for a little while, I answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it have decreased? After all, we have to fight against the monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt increased. Countries that shared borders began fighting as they claimed that the other country should be responsible for cleaning up the monsters that appeared on their borders. Countries that had low military strength, but high-valued monsters, were invaded by stronger countries for their monsters, and the ability users of the weaker countries then joined to fight against the invaders. Although it did not lead to full scale war in most cases, there are places where small conflicts expanded into much bigger ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Father went silent for a bit, then continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuman greed draws blood of other humans. This much hasn\u2019t changed. I won\u2019t tell you to do something stupid like trying to stop it, but become stronger. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be swept away by human greed one day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I plan on becoming the world\u2019s strongest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour father will still be the world\u2019s strongest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will be me!\u201d</p><br/><p>There, we had a minor battle. I had come to add another win to my name.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Above the Frozen Land (5)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Chapter 254. Above the Frozen Land (5)</p><br/><p>While being Confused, I examined her more closely. She had long plum-colored hair that seemed to want to melt into the surrounding darkness, and also pale white skin. Her slightly out of focus eyes were plum-colored just like her hair and seemed to suck in all light. Not only was she small, her eyes, lips, and ears were also small. Anyone looking at her would only see a ten year old girl.</p><br/><p>Ah, she also wasn\u2019t wearing any clothes.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, do you have anything to say before I poke your eyes out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m innocent. I\u2019m being falsely accused. If you wish to find fault, go talk to that exhibitionist kid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSometimes, just being somewhere constitutes a crime. When you realized she was naked, you should have turned around!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was expecting a grown woman because of her mature voice. I was surprised she was a kid and was examining her. I acknowledge my fault in this, but poking my eyes out would be too excessive of a punishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I replied calmly and blocked Loretta\u2019s fingers desperately, Sherafina watched us silently. Go wear something, please!</p><br/><p>\u201cLord, wear something!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that was the problem. I apologize, I rarely talk to people.\u201d</p><br/><p>She apologized to Loretta and snapped her fingers. In an instant, she was equipped with a black dress. I pushed Loretta\u2019s fingers away and sighed a breath of relief. At the same time, I couldn\u2019t help but think, was she wearing underwear\u2026? Kuhum!</p><br/><p>\u201cI put on some clothes now, Loretta. There\u2019s no reason to poke his eyes out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026 You did this on purpose, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta should know very well that I don\u2019t usually wear clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm\u2026 I\u2019ll question you later. You know why we\u2019re here, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s about what happened on Earth, correct?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sherafina slowly nodded and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cEarth is perfectly defending against its invaders. If you continue to grow, it might be possible to stop Earth\u2019s enemies before humanity sheds blood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already know that, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, they realized that you were powerful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sherafina looked at me. Seeing her mysteriously charming plum eyes, I could see why Loretta tested me beforehand. Loretta spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Lord seduces Shin-nim, I\u2019ll kill even Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no such intentions. Plus, love isn\u2019t good for administrators. Loretta, I already told you multiple times, not that you ever listen to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Lord talks about someone else, I\u2019ll kill even Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour love troubles both you and your love\u2019s receiver. Your expectations are too high.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta took out her axe.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just kill her now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, please!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that woman just\u2026! Shin-nim, are my expectations too high? Am I overbearing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not at all, so put away that axe before I do feel that way! Where the heck is that axe coming out of all the time!?\u201d</p><br/><p>As I thought, I\u2019m the only normal one out of everyone related to the dungeon! Even this woman didn\u2019t listen to people properly! After I barely stopped the biggest crisis since the dungeon\u2019s founding, Sherafina spoke with a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cAccelerating the speed of invasion isn\u2019t something they would prefer to do because of its high mana cost\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re continuing like nothing happened!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRather than succeeding in their invasion, they\u2019re losing the territories they already gained. In response, they sacrificed some of their forces to widen the pathway.\u201d</p><br/><p>I gave up and just listened to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally, I distributed my power evenly amongst all worlds, administering the dungeon, administering its explorers, and interfering with the enemies\u2019 invasions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of the recent incident with Sipua ran away\u2026 Ah, thank you for that by the way. We were able to protect the dungeon thanks to you. Even If we lost just Lin, the dungeon would have been in deep trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust continue with the explanation, Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta spoke while annoyed. Sherafina nodded and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of the recent incident with Sipua running away, the dungeon had stopped. My sight also became limited. Sipua was returned to her position, but before my power came back, the enemy\u2019s third invasion began. We were struck at an untimely spot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, is my theory correct, Lord?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cyes. The dungeon\u2019s formation wasn\u2019t perfect. In addition, because I quickly reactivated my power, I didn\u2019t notice them gathering in the same spot. Since I didn\u2019t notice the Event Dungeons disappearing and the enemies gathering together in an army, you could say they tricked me completely. At the very least, it means they have an ability that prevents me from finding out when Event Dungeons disappear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur enemy is diverse and possess fearful abilities. Loretta, what we consider impossible will always come back to bite us in reality.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Lord spoke calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember this. There might be someone in their midst who can perfectly see through the nature of my power and can completely ignore it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be the Demon Lord?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. When the final explorer left the Luka continent, he didn\u2019t possess such a power. It must be a new demon born after the Demon Lord obtained the world\u2019s power.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she had a serious tone, I couldn\u2019t focus on her words entirely because of her young appearance. I slapped my cheeks to regain my composure and asked her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd there might be more than one such being.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. I plan on doing everything I can, but what the dungeon can do for you will become less and less.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLord, you\u2019re too irresponsible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have high expectation of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>She pretended to have not heard Loretta as she looked at me fixedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou might not know, but you\u2019re the fastest climbing explorer to have ever existed. Soloing the dungeon, something that you consider normal and easy, is something not even 1% of the explorers can accomplish. The feat of climbing two floors in a day is something not even 1% of that 1% can do. As for your Beyond climbing speed, I have no words. Your strength and bold mindset and the heavenly luck that supports you are something even I find hard to believe. The interest and goodwill towards you by the gods are most likely the first since the universe\u2019s beginning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhehe, you\u2019re making me blush.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you feeling embarrassed, Loretta?\u201d</p><br/><p>She tilted her head at Loretta\u2019s response, then turned to face me again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, the more accomplished you become, the more uneasy I feel. I hate the word \u2018fate\u2019 the most, but looking at your talent and luck, I can\u2019t help but think it\u2019s because a time when such a power is needed is coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLord?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta looked at Sherafina with an extremely surprised face. Seeing the streak of worry on the girl\u2019s small face, she asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cUneasy\u2026? Why? Lord saw and experienced countless worlds\u2019 ruin, and you\u2019re feeling uneasy at Earth\u2019s danger?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThink about the situation Earth is in, Loretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>I could somewhat understand the uneasiness Sherafina was feeling. Loretta seemed to know something too as she became quiet.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe enemies\u2019 leaders have the power to ignore the dungeon\u2019s power. That\u2019s partly why they became leaders. It makes sense. The dungeon was made by the defenders, and the leaders of the attackers were born to defeat the defenders.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s happening right now is too out of line. The Demon Lord who opened a pathway to another world after absorbing a world\u2019s power and the fact that this pathway led to Earth, both of these are something I can\u2019t just wave off. It\u2019s the same for the leader of the monsters, as I am clueless as to what kind of an existence he is. If you fail to protect Earth and they succeed, will they stop there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta and I both became speechless. I didn\u2019t want to even imagine the end of Earth, but if Earth\u2019s invaders started to reach out to other worlds, just how many would be able to defend themselves? The Lord interrupted our silence and continued ruthlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe danger Earth is facing can be fatal. You must stop them. If you allow them land, we won\u2019t know what they will do next. They must be chased out. Furthermore, you must get stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re walking on the correct path. Grow stronger. Climb the dungeon, but don\u2019t become swayed by it. Just like what you\u2019re doing now, grow power that the dungeon can\u2019t give. Also\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt like I didn\u2019t want to hear the next part. Just when I was about to block my ears out of instinct, the Lord announced.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must embrace the human named Ciara Kenex.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather die\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She continued, as if she expected my response.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like you, she is someone who received the world\u2019s power. If you are the Hero, she would be the Saintess. Both are indispensable existences for Earth. Seeing Earth\u2019s current situation, I now understand why she exists. You need someone to read the enemy\u2019s movements. You need her, who was born with an ability that the dungeon can\u2019t give.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease\u2026 Uuu, so you\u2019re saying\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I was about to refuse her straight up, but I hesitated for a moment. I hated her. I hated her personality, and I hated that she admired me just because I was the Hero. I hated her appearance and hated her voice. I hated everything about her. I was sick of her attitude of treating people\u2019s lives as mere numbers.</p><br/><p>But what if I pushed her away just because I hated her personality and action, and ended up with casualties that I could have prevented with her power?</p><br/><p>If included in those casualties was Yua, Ina, Mother, Father, Ina, Hwaya, Ye-Eun, Yua, Ludia, Ina, Daisy, Ren, Yua, Leon, Ina, Walker, Yua, or Ina\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cShe can become stronger in the dungeon. By raising her league, she can strengthen the power she was given. Now, you need her power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Uuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>I had too many people I needed to protect. I always talked big about protecting everyone with my strength alone, but I knew all too well now that I couldn\u2019t solve everything on my own.</p><br/><p>To protect my loved ones\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026 I\u2019ll contact her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Will I be able to rein her in? Hwaya might be able to do it, but won\u2019t she get mad? I sighed thinking about having to see Ciara Kenex\u2019s face. Loretta was also giving the Lord a deathly glare.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m already annoyed by the number of women Shin-nim has, so why are you giving him another one!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen will Loretta go to Earth to help him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Can I?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. You should know this better than anyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta pouted at Sherafina\u2019s cutthroat answer. Sherafina continued without batting an eye.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs having one more woman more important than his safety?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know! Shin-nim, let\u2019s go back. I shouldn\u2019t have brought you here, hmph!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? We\u2019re going back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe already got what we came for! Lord, do you have anything else to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to give more help, but unfortunately\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She shook her head. It was the kind of gesture fitting of the word \u2018oldie\u2019, but since I knew women were sensitive about talking about their age, I wasn\u2019t so stupid as to ask about her age.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope you can pass this danger safely. I\u2019ll look forward to the day I meet you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t bring Shin-nim here ever again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta shouted at her and pulled me away. I bowed to Sherafina and followed her. Just like when I first came here, she spoke as she pulled me.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim will do fine. Don\u2019t worry too much. The dungeon is all the Lord has in her mind. She\u2019s ignoring Shin-nim\u2019s potential. I\u2019m angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think she did\u2026 Rather than that, what is she? She doesn\u2019t seem human.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either. She hasn\u2019t changed at all since I first met her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta added with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe never says anything about herself. It\u2019s been several hund\u2026 a long time since I saw her too.\u201d</p><br/><p>She cut off contact with people and lived two thousands years or even more in that darkness? I thought about the conversation I just had. Sherafina seemed to have had expressed emotions somewhat, but when I thought about it, she didn\u2019t say anything not related to the dungeon. Just why did she spend such a long time\u2026 I knew I didn\u2019t have the time to worry about other things, but I couldn\u2019t help but think about her. When I sighed, Loretta looked at me with worrying eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not interested in her, right? I thought you resisted her charm, but could it be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta\u2019s the only one for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaaah! Wait! I\u2019m not ready to record that! Again, say it again one more time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing, so no.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-niiiiim!\u201d</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t in any position to worry about other people. I had to fight the demons who tricked the Dungeon Lord\u2019s eyes and conquered Oceania. I had to clear my head for battle.</p><br/><p>About contacting Ciara, I\u2019ll put it off until the fight ends. After all, just listening to her will ruin my mood!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Third Season (6)</p><br/><p>\u201cShin is so mean.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI messaged you first though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between seeing Shin-nim\u2019s face and just hearing Shin-nim\u2019s voice! I can\u2019t be assured that Shin-nim came back safely until I see Shin-nim and touch Shin-nim with my hands!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta fretted like a child and hit me lightly. A \u2018light\u2019 hit from Loretta was enough to massacre several hundred Orc Lords, but I endured the pain. Even if we did something couple-like, our bodies made it more extreme. I spoke as I did my best to hide my pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cKkeung. I just wanted to finish everything I had to do before I came to see Loretta. That way, I won\u2019t be distracted by other things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Until when?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta suddenly became quieter as she asked with sparkling eyes. It was extremely cute.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll day!? Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Loretta clap in happiness, I smiled awkwardly. Loretta pushed herself towards me and asked with a flushed face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we play? What should we play?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlaying is nice, but there\u2019s actually something I want to learn from Loretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, Loretta\u2019s face became rotten.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, is it fun inflating my expectation and bursting it in a moment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is, actual\u2026 Sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>After barely consoling Loretta, I had her sit down next to me. Of course, I had to suffer through unspeakable pain before then.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, but only because I\u2019ll be spending time with Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, so what I want to learn is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s punching people, I\u2019m really good at that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta smiled sweetly and threw several jabs. With even a single jab being potentially lethal, I realized Loretta was still slightly angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice, but I want to learn about Dimensional Travel.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta face stiffened.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hold on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta got up and circled around the room. She then went into the kitchen and boiled red tea. After wandering around for 10 minutes without saying anything, Loretta filled her teacup and took a sip. Only then did she finally say something.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, but only because I\u2019ll be spending time with Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going that far back!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, you can\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to learn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at Loretta with a serious face. Loretta then humphed and snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe difficult of the magic is too high. Also, crossing a dimension with one\u2019s own power rather than using the dungeon\u2019s power takes an enormous amount of mana! It\u2019s impossible with Shin-nim\u2019s current strength!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I still want to learn it. If I do, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be useful one day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta wore a exhausted look and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least tell me the reason Shin-nim wants to learn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to be able to use the skills the dungeon gave me on my own power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe more honest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also thought about being stuck in a foreign world where the dungeon\u2019s power didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2026 impossible, I guess.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta turned back from trying to shoot me down. She knew what I had gone through.</p><br/><p>The balance between attack and defense was twisting in a strange way. The Demon Lord wasn\u2019t the only world\u2019s enemy trying to analyze the dungeon\u2019s power to overcome it. Unless I planned on quit being a Dimensional Mercenary, I wanted to learn how to use Dimensional Travel on my own.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Shin-nim, it will be really hard. It\u2019s not something you can master in just one or two days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m prepared. I\u2019ll come learn it from Loretta even if I have to squeeze my available time dry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking about it now, Loretta seemed to have liked what I just said. Loretta ears were perked up. She fell in thought for a moment, then finally nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell this to Lord. Only tell her after you fully master Dimensional Travel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta sighed. She then tilted her head and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, how did you know I could use Dimensional Travel? Even amongst dungeon administrators, I\u2019m the only one other than Lord who can use it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that hard!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, so you were just mistaken on how hard it was.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta gave me a stare urging me to give up now, but I only grinned in return. Loretta then suddenly exclaimed in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, now that I think about it, is that a proposal? It\u2019s the same thing as \u2018I\u2019ll be with you forever,\u2019 right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to learn it quickly, so cut the nonsense\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta\u2019s tutoring starting just like that. In parallel with Dimensional Travel, I also practiced making other skills I learned in the dungeon mine. As long as I could protect myself from Loretta, who was eyeing my body like a predator eyeing a prey, she was the best mentor.</p><br/><p>Ren and Paul\u2019s thrashing phase, Revival members\u2019 Peruta Circuit lessons, learning Dimensional Travel from Loretta, and making Ciara into a person with Hwaya.</p><br/><p>There were many things I had to do, but that didn\u2019t mean I could stop climbing the dungeon. I was sure that my current self wasn\u2019t strong enough to defeat the Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, the Demon Lord wasn\u2019t the final boss. I had to defeat the one above the Demon Lord, and even then, I couldn\u2019t be sure that Earth would be completely safe. Even though I said I would defeat foreign worlds\u2019 enemies, invading their territory was different than them invading mine. Furthermore\u2026 No, even if I thought about that one, I couldn\u2019t do anything about it, so let\u2019s set it aside.</p><br/><p>In any case, I headed to the dungeon. First Dungeon\u2019s 81st floor. It was the true upper part of the dungeon belonging to Platinum rank explorers.</p><br/><p>[If Tamer is not your main class, the number of tamed beast you can take to the 81st floor is limited to one.]</p><br/><p>When I stepped on the stairway with Licorice and Lotte, message noona\u2026 Sherafina\u2019s alert rang out in my ear. I halted my steps and glanced at Loretta who was happily waving her hand from the Floor Shop. Loretta tilted her head for a moment, and hit her left palm with her right fist like she just remembered something. Then, she stuck out her tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cEhet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Inexcusable. Still, since she was cute, I decided to forgive her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou forgot again, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep! It\u2019s been a while since I dealt with a new Platinum rank explorer!\u201d</p><br/><p>I sighed and looked back at Licorice and Lotte.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two should go train by yourselves. Tell Plene to work hard too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both going back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Since it\u2019s like this, I might as well try it on my own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice seemed a bit disappointed, but Lotte simply shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine if it\u2019s Hero. Then I\u2019ll head to Resting Place of the Angels.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go back to Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them nodded and headed back. After sending them off, I looked back at Loretta who was still grinning happily and smacked her forehead with a light aura ball. Loretta frowned and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim is so mean! Give me one hundred kisses as punishment!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a reward, so no.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing what I said, Loretta titled her head for a moment. Leaving the then blushing Loretta behind, I went up to the 81st floor. Loretta was definitely stupid.</p><br/><p>[You entered the 81st floor. Yell \u2018commence exploration\u2019 to start exploring.]</p><br/><p>The 81st floor carried an eerie atmosphere. It felt like ghosts would pop out of the large hallway at any time. It wasn\u2019t just the atmosphere that was eerie. The mana in the hallway was also chillingly cold. I had to summon Ruyue to lessen its impact.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s like this from the beginning, it won\u2019t be easy\u2026 Commence exploration!\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as the words left my mouth, the hallway\u2019s atmosphere changed and its mana pressured me with a killing intent. I poured mana into my choker and summoned Chaotic Spear. At that moment, I felt something falling on my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>I shot my spear up fiercely. However, I didn\u2019t feel my spear connecting. I jumped back and checked my spear.</p><br/><p>There was a lump of blood stuck on my spear tip.</p><br/><p>[The blood is moving.]</p><br/><p>Ruyue briefly spoke. It was as she said. Blood dripping from the ceiling, blood coursing through the walls, and blood crawling on the ground. They were all aiming for me. First, the blood traveling up my spear handle was the biggest problem. I quickly swung my spear, but I couldn\u2019t shake it off.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this even a monster!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I can feel a powerful mana! It\u2019s similar to a elemental!</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, freeze it!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un!]</p><br/><p>Ruyue immediately frozen the spear handle. Surprisingly, the blood absorbed Ruyue\u2019s ice and continued to creep towards me. Mana eater, this was a mana eater! I clenched my teeth and roused Lightning God\u2019s power. Finally, a little bit of the blood evaporated. However, what I did was like peeing on a field of ice. Compared to the amount of mana I spent, the blood only incurred a tiny loss.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo troublesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t just let it continue crawl up the spear handle. When I poured in more of Lightning God\u2019s power, the blood shot up with a crackling noise. It headed towards my face, and I smacked it down with my spear blade filled with Lightning God\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, stop the blood falling from the ceiling! Peika, Sharana!\u201d</p><br/><p>[From the 81st floor, you cannot have three elementals out at the same time.]</p><br/><p>Along with Sherafina\u2019s explanation, only Peika appeared in front of me. When she saw the blood creeping towards me from all sides, she freaked out and released lightning.</p><br/><p>[Creepy! Burn up!]</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, they\u2019re mana eaters. You need to use a lot of power!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Got it!]</p><br/><p>While Peika and Ruyue frantically stopped the blood from encroaching, I hurriedly took out a mana potion and gulped it down.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, more and more blood appeared. Seeing a stream of blood shooting up from the ground underneath me, I got startled and stabbed it with my spear. When the property of a liquid mixed with the property of a mana eater, it became extremely tricky to deal with. As I couldn\u2019t just stand here and block them forever, I began to run. As I saw more and more blood filling up the hallway, I became a bit tired.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell are these things!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I considered using Elemental Tempest, but gave up as I was afraid of the mana eaters annihilating the elementals\u2019 existence. In the end, I used Heroic Strikes to cut apart the flood of blood and shouted in annoyance. Although I wasn\u2019t expecting an answer, a voice replied to the annoyed shout.</p><br/><p>[They are \u2018Crimson Hell\u2019, the world\u2019s enemy that almost ruined the world Pantiran.]</p><br/><p>\u2026 Say what?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

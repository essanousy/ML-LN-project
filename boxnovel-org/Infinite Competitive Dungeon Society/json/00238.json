Guardian (8)</p><br/><p>The bottle of whiskey I brought with me was emptied by the time I detected an unexpected change. While Lin and I were exchanging our final glass, I began to vaguely see Lin\u2019s face. At first, I thought I had gotten accustomed to being in the dark, but that wasn\u2019t it. Lin muttered as he stared at my face.</p><br/><p>\u201cUp close, you look like the incarnation of misfortune.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin also looks like a sissy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The underground base got brighter ever so slightly. The darkness from magic that dulled one\u2019s senses was slowly transforming into natural darkness. There was only one reason this would be happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing we finished the bottle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep, one has to finish a bottle once he opens it.\u201d</p><br/><p>We exchanged such words as if we had already discussed it, and stood up after throwing the bottle and glasses on the ground. Lin was gritting his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat crazy bastard\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt might not be too late. Let\u2019s hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin and I rushed in union. Meanwhile, Daisy messaged us.</p><br/><p>[Found Book Walkers. Ceiling, being broken through.]</p><br/><p>The moment we received her message, the ceiling fell with a thud along with several Book Walkers. Before I could say anything, Lin\u2019s two handguns shot flaming bullets. By the time the magazine ran out, the Book Walkers had all become corpses, but Lin clicked his tongue as he reloaded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese guys got faster. It must be that damned resistance or whatever. How annoying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI should also\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou stay still. Don\u2019t reveal your abilities in front of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis really is annoying. I can\u2019t even fight them when they\u2019re right in front of me\u2026 Ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>We left a passageway and entered a wider residential area. It was the place where we had heard moaning sounds before. In the corner was a gruesomely shredded corpse of a man. That was it. Lin murmured calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe woman was taken.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t open my mouth. If I did, I felt like I would have shouted at the top of my lungs to tear apart this silence. Afterwards, in just three minutes, we found over ten corpses. They were all of men.</p><br/><p>I asked Lin, gritting my teeth and clenching my fists.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdministrative guild master\u2019s power\u2026 Is there a way to retrieve it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is one way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin replied as he reloaded his guns again and shot down the spear of ice coming towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cKilling her.\u201d</p><br/><p>The magic had disappeared completely. There were huge gaping holes in the ceiling. The underground base was no longer safe from light. Beyond the passageway where light and darkness coexisted, the one who sent the ice spear flying appeared. It was Sipua.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin, I didn\u2019t want to do this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten unsightly, Sipua.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin\u2019s words didn\u2019t carry any emotion. He aimed his gun at Sipua and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me, why did you get rid of the magic?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI made a deal, Lin. It was the only thing I could do for our happiness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I take it to mean you made a deal with the world\u2019s enemy?\u201d</p><br/><p>At Lin\u2019s words, Sipua nodded. Then, she spread her arms out. Countless crystals of ice radiating brilliant light filled the space around her. Just like the god\u2019s true name Lodert Hydelcyon had, it seemed she also had the ability to wield ice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t win against you with my strength, so I needed someone to defeat you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Hydelcyon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe darkness magic was very formidable. He had to use his god\u2019s true name.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScizarnath must be lamenting.\u201d[1. Scizarnath is the god whose name Hydelcyon has. Mentioned in chapter 171.]</p><br/><p>Lin looked at Sipua in contempt and spoke with scorn. Then, he turned to face me.</p><br/><p>\u201cFind Ectradion and go back. The world\u2019s enemy will appear soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><br/><p>I knew very well what position I was in. I also knew that the world\u2019s enemy of Panan continent was a special case. Against monsters that obtained resistance against me if I didn\u2019t kill it in one blow, I didn\u2019t dare be so adventurous. It wasn\u2019t my role to face them.</p><br/><p>Above all, finding Daisy was currently the most important thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t let you go. You have to suffer more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, run away! Now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately, a brilliant light erupted from Sipua\u2019s body. The underground base enshrouded in darkness became as bright as day. I heard a message, one that I thought I wouldn\u2019t hear for a while.</p><br/><p>[You entered the EX rank Event Dungeon, \u2018Cemetery\u2019! Before the dungeon is cleared, no one can exit!]</p><br/><p>No, it wasn\u2019t the familiar message noona\u2019s voice. This voice was\u2026 Sipua\u2019s voice!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, just how much are you going to abuse your power!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is it. Once everyone who came to find me dies, I won\u2019t need it anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just to be sure, I opened the gate to the dungeon. I couldn\u2019t enter it. I couldn\u2019t use Return either. It seemed there was only one way for me to leave this place. I quickly messaged Daisy.</p><br/><p>[Daisy, are you okay!?]</p><br/><p>[Too many, Book Walkers. Space is too small, can\u2019t take out all undead. I will use, god\u2019s power.]</p><br/><p>[Make sure you live! And\u2026!]</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Hydelcyon, found him.]</p><br/><p>With that, Daisy\u2019s messages cut off. Damn it! I didn\u2019t think Daisy would lose to someone like Hydelcyon, but the resistance I felt when I kicked him earlier made me uneasy.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know what Sipua did to strengthen him, but with his god\u2019s true name and the Book Walkers helping him, Daisy would undoubtedly have trouble dealing with the situation. Everything was extremely annoying!</p><br/><p>\u201cSipua, what you did cannot be undone. From now on, I won\u2019t treat you like one of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin, you should have done so the moment you saw me. Now, it\u2019s too late! I\u2019ve already surpassed you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the next moment, the entire space exploded. I quickly summoned Ruyue and surrounded myself in a wall of ice, and Lin also protected himself with a wall of fire. However, the explosion only served as a signal. Immediately after Sipua\u2019s attack, something shot towards Lin like lightning.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhahaha! Too easy! Too visible! Draconian, draconians are surprising!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Trash!\u201d</p><br/><p>Despite the lighthearted tone, the voice carried an immense pressure. The owner of the voice was a titan, carrying a book on one hand and a sword on the other. The moment I saw him, I could clearly feel his aura.</p><br/><p>He was the world\u2019s enemy.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re moving like when you killed our kin! But you won\u2019t be able to defeat me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Lin\u2019s movements were quick to the point I could barely see him, the titan easily caught up to Lin. Furthermore, the titan\u2019s attacks flew in from angles Lin couldn\u2019t easily dodge, and eventually tore Lin\u2019s leather armor and shed blood. Lin distanced himself from the titan with a strong kick as he gritted his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cSipua\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou and I have fought together many times. In my head, your movements and your twin handguns are recorded clearly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPuhahaha! The dungeon sure is interesting! Its administrators are interesting too! Truly interesting!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin\u2019s twin guns continuously spat out bullets. Shockingly, the world\u2019s enemy received them directly without even trying to dodge them and wasn\u2019t injured in the slightest.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith data, we have nothing to fear from your attacks! With my power, I can easily defeat you! Draconian, you\u2019ll have to die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think guns are my only weapon, idiot!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin threw away his twin handguns and charged towards him. Flames erupted around him as he attacked the world\u2019s enemy. I could easily tell that Lin\u2019s flames were of EX rank. The Demon Lord would have to give up one arm to ignite such flames? And he was using it as he pleased!?</p><br/><p>What was even more shocking was that the world\u2019s enemy wasn\u2019t fazed at all by the EX rank flames. His resistance had gone past the point of shocking and had reached the level of impossibility!</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhahaha! Futile! Not only your guns, but your flames and martial arts have all been remembered! That bitch gave me all the data I needed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you think some record on a book is enough to defeat me, you\u2019re gravely mistaken!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Lin shouted with a voice filled with rage, he disappeared. In the next instant, a flash of Lin\u2019s foot appeared, enveloped in scarlet flames. The titan\u2019s shoulder exploded.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaak! That hurt!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you a power your trivial ability can\u2019t resist!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnnoying! Draconian is annoying!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Book Walker opened his book. Even as he was being injured by Lin\u2019s attacks, he held up his sword and wrote something down on his book. For every phrase he jotted down, his injuries shockingly healed. He was even beginning to catch up to Lin\u2019s hastened speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this is all, this is the end! You can\u2019t win against me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done yet\u2026 You damned bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this rate, Lin would lose. Since we won\u2019t be able to leave unless we defeated the world\u2019s enemy, if I used Overlord and joined him\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should play with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sipua noticed my movements and created countless spears of ice in the air. I used Ruyue\u2019s power to stop them as I questioned her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaisy couldn\u2019t read your thoughts or Hydelcyon\u2019s thoughts. Is that your work?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI sent Lodert to you on purpose. To trick you into believing us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDefending against Evil Eyes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m originally more skilled in defense than offense! So, Earth\u2019s Hero, you should give up on defeating me and helping Lin!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her mana was indeed boundless. Solely to stop me from approaching Lin and the world\u2019s enemy, she filled the area with ice. Even if I pushed them away with Ruyue\u2019s ability and used Divine Speed to charge forward, with my current ability, I couldn\u2019t deal with the endlessly respawning wall of ice unless I used Overlord.</p><br/><p>\u201cI acknowledge that you\u2019re a talented explorer, but I've lived for 2,500 years as an administrative guild master! You will never be able to obtain what you desire!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, S-Sipua.\u201d</p><br/><p>When a man\u2019s voice suddenly eked out, she revealed an opening. I didn\u2019t miss this opportunity and materialized Ruyue.</p><br/><p>\u201cBreak through!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un! Haaaaap!]</p><br/><p>Immediately after materializing in the air, Ruyue let out a spirited shout and spread her arms out. In the next instant, the wall of ice trapping us exploded entirely.</p><br/><p>Sipua and a heavily beaten Lodert Hydelcyon appeared in front of us. As the saying went, love made one stupid. Sipua had completely forgotten about me and was hugging Hydelcyon tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLodert, how did this happen to you!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I was coming back after destroying the darkness magic, that damned bitch\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Daisy Ectradion, I\u2019ll be sure to kill that wench!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Bitch and Son of a Bitch. You think you fuckers can just kill my precious guild member!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I finally exploded. Although it might be a bit too early to use these skills, I felt okay using them now.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaduceus, Overlord!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I shouted the names of these skills, my body grew enough to pierce through the underground base\u2019s ceiling. Everyone present focused their attention on me. Sipua, especially, had a shocked expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You! How can you have that power\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m different than trash like Hydelcyon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s too late! You've lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>The world\u2019s enemy raised his voice and laughed. He spoke as he threw what was in his hands towards me. The shape of the \u201cthing\u201d he threw seemed all too familiar.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder what kind of power you have! I hope it\u2019s better than this dead lizard\u2019s!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDead lizard\u2026 You\u2019re talking about Lin\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>My hands trembled. I shouted louder than I ever had.</p><br/><p>\u201cYOU\u2019RE TALKING ABOUT LIN!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[You used Frozen Roar! All enemies in the battlefield freezes in place. All allies temporarily become super-armored and have all abilities increased by 50%. Your chance of landing a critical hit doubles when fighting enemies affected by Frozen Roar.]</p><br/><p>[Frozen Roar is suppressed by the world\u2019s enemy\u2019s overwhelming power! Although Overlord\u2019s power offset his power, Frozen Roar\u2019s effect has been halved!]</p><br/><p>In that instant, as ice descended around me, the surrounding became shrouded in darkness. Did my rage finally create a supernatural effect? Of course not.</p><br/><p>[Magic recovery, complete. Book Walkers, weakened.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Daisy. I love you!\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Kang Shin, I don\u2019t know love, yet. So, I apologize.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that. It was a\u2026 cheer!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Human language, too difficult\u2026]</p><br/><p>I gave a short reply to Daisy who rejected me seriously. Then, I infused Sharana into my spear. As both fire and lightning radiated light, I couldn\u2019t make satisfying destructive power in this place. Furthermore, they couldn\u2019t do what I wanted to do.</p><br/><p>Thus, what I needed to wield now was the power of wind! Sharana\u2019s aura strengthened the power of Enigma to the limit and created a threatening whirlpool.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven with the darkness back, you won\u2019t be able to win! Compared to the lizard, your power is too weak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I can hold you back for a bit!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with my reply, a wind aura that converted into a whirlpool shot out from my spear and cut through the darkness. Even if the world\u2019s enemy was much stronger than me, this was the first time I used my power since I came to this world. Plus, the purpose of the wind aura I just shot out wasn\u2019t to tear him apart. Like I said, it was just to tie him in his place for a moment.</p><br/><p>As I had even used Divine Speed, neither Sipua nor Hydelcyon could react to it. Though the world\u2019s enemy snorted and tried to strike it down with his palm, he body was halted in the process. Confused, he looked around his body and soon burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you aren\u2019t completely talentless after all. But this is it! I doubt you\u2019ll be able to do anything by just holding me down! Kuhahaha\u2026 haaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Within the darkness, a single bang of a gunshot rang out. The titan, who was laughing just a moment ago, had his head shattered into pieces.</p><br/><p>Using this opportunity, I grabbed the world\u2019s power that popped out of the titan\u2019s body. The expressions of Hydelcyon and Sipua, who had watched everything blankly, turned pale.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou killed\u2026 the world\u2019s enemy\u2026 Someone even the entire continent couldn\u2019t kill, so easily\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-This\u2026 is\u2026 Im-Impossible\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the direction where the bullet came flying, Lin walked out with the sniper rifle he had been hiding now hanging on his back. Ignoring the reestablished darkness magic, Lin lit the cigarette in his mouth. Sipua shouted in utter shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin, how are you alive? You certainly died! I saw it with my two eyes! Plus, how could you kill him so easily!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Let me ask too, Sipua. How is it any of your business? Even if you knew, nothing would change.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin tilted his head, replying in a slightly murmuring voice. Then, with a single flick of his hands, the twin handguns he threw away before flew back into his hands. He then fired two shots from each handguns, the bullets piercing through Sipua and Hydelcyon\u2019s knee and forcing them to kneel.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to be punished, damned bastards.\u201d</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>If Shin used Overlord and fought the world\u2019s enemy, he would lose in just 2 minutes\u2026 But Lin killed him with one bullet! That said, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible without Shin restraining him. A wonderful coordination for their first fight together!</p><br/><p>Of course, the unexplained parts will all be explained next chapter! I thought about separating the fight into two chapters, but then Shin lasting so long would only be possible if Shenlong was summoned using Dragon Balls and\u2026 Huh? I can\u2019t say this because of copyrights\u2026? Er, um\u2026 goodbye! (escapes)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

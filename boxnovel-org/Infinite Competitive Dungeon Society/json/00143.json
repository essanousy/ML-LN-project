What We Can Do (1)</p><br/><p>There were two skill experience calculations in Beyond. The first was when I used skills while fighting Beyond\u2019s monsters. I didn\u2019t know whether it was because they were Floor Master class, because there were so many of them, or because it was Beyond\u2019s special characteristic, but skill experience undoubtedly increased more compared to when I used skills in other places. For example, Crossbow Marksmanship had soared in levels, and by the time I cleared Beyond\u2019s 2nd floor, it became mid-rank level 6.</p><br/><p>The second was when I cleared Beyond\u2019s floors. The skills I mainly used to clear the floors increased exponentially. Because of it, Elemental Control, Spirit Aura, and Elemental Contract had all risen to mid-rank level 8.</p><br/><p>Although I wanted to raise their levels more, I wanted to increase my Spear Technique levels more.</p><br/><p>Peruta said I would have the qualification to learn his spearmanship when my Peruta Circuit became level 7 and I mastered high-rank Spear Technique. His spear techniques were able to deal irrecoverable wounds to the Demon Army Commander, endlessly attack by continuously recovering mana, and both attack and defend at the same time. To me, who had lived three quarters of my life without knowing mana, he seemed like a martial god. I wanted to learn his skills. This desire was as strong as my desire to climb to the dungeon.</p><br/><p>If there was another skill I wanted to raise using this opportunity, it was Soul Guard. The Wraith Queen\u2019s Vengeful Spirit\u2019s Wail was an extremely strong mental status effect magic. Just by blocking it, Soul Guard\u2019s skill experience would go up by a lot. Beyond\u2019s 3rd floor was full of such wailing noonims. After I used skill points to raise SoulGuard to level 5, I was having trouble training it, so I couldn\u2019t let go of this opportunity to easily train Soul Guard.</p><br/><p>[Kyaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>[Wraith Queen used Vengeful Spirit\u2019s Wail! With high magic, charm, and luck stats, you resist the confusion and fear status effects!]</p><br/><p>\u201cEat\u2026 this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Putting great care to direct the flow of mana from Peruta Circuit to my spear, I struck the Wraith Queen\u2019s face with my spear. The basis of the attack was Tempest, which used up 300 mana. However, Tempest was actually a technique to shoot out the uncontrollable rotational force. In other words, it was an incomplete technique. The true Tempest was different. The rotational force had to be brought out more naturally while being controlled perfectly. To be honest, I didn\u2019t know what it meant.</p><br/><p>[Kiaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>\u201cStop using ectoplasm arrows!\u201d</p><br/><p>One of Wraith Queen\u2019s specialty was shooting out dozens of ectoplasm arrows at once. Although I could just dodge them, because they bounced around, I had to move around to dodge them even when the Wraith Queen died. It was extremely annoying. Can\u2019t they stop using suicide attacks!?</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, freeze only the Wraith Queens\u2019 mouths! Peika, when you see a Wraith Queen, first electrocute her!\u201d</p><br/><p>[T-That sounds fun!]</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t like this place. Those women\u2019s breasts are too big.]</p><br/><p>Since I couldn\u2019t slack off on my Elementalist skills, I had my elementals summoned and on guard against the Wraith Queens. Without the Orc Lords, I could leisurely raise my skills\u2019 experience! I doubt another chance like this would come, so I had to do my best now. Mmm, maybe the Giant Wolf and Wendigo floors might be easy too\u2026</p><br/><p>[Too many humans, humans are scary, the living are scary\u2026!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll let you rest soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Human, a handsome human! There wasn\u2019t a human like that when I was alive!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll send you off too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Time flew when you were focused on something.</p><br/><p>After grasping the 3rd floor\u2019s structure completely, I always turned back a step before so that the final pathway wouldn\u2019t appear. Although the crafty traps would sometimes change their locations, I always detected them with my mana and destroyed them.</p><br/><p>Ludia was fine for the first three weeks, but after that, she began to call me once a day, sobbing and calling my name. Other than that, everything was progressing smoothly.</p><br/><p>Then, a month passed since I entered Beyond\u2019s 3rd floor. It was the end of June. Meanwhile, a huge trouble occurred in the outside world. Hundreds of Event Dungeons had appeared on Earth. It was what Ciara prophesied.</p><br/><p>[There are 18 just in Korea! I don\u2019t understand why there are so many in this tiny country!]</p><br/><p>[Although there\u2019s no guarantee that Event Raids would break out, if we were to leave them alone because we\u2019re afraid, they would only come back as bigger dangers. Maybe, Earth will come to have a similar human to monster ratio as other worlds.]</p><br/><p>[We\u2019ll have to trust Guardian and Freedom Wing. Everyone is well aware of Event Dungeons\u2019 danger now.]</p><br/><p>[Shin, shouldn\u2019t we clear as many Event Dungeons as we can?]</p><br/><p>[R-Right! Once Japan\u2019s Event Dungeons are taken care of, I want to join everyone too!]</p><br/><p>At this time, my Spear Technique was at high-rank level 8. Swinging my spear and killing three Wraith Queens at once, I murmured.</p><br/><p>[Several countries probably want to let low-ranked Event Dungeons turn into Field Dungeons.]</p><br/><p>[\u2026 You\u2019re exactly right. They most likely want a source of Mana Stones that they can regulate and control. As for the high-ranked Event Dungeons, or what they call Gates, most say that they should be destroyed first.]</p><br/><p>[They aren\u2019t wrong, but they\u2019re probably using that as an excuse to buy time. That way, the low-ranked Event Dungeons would turn into Field Dungeons for them to control.]</p><br/><p>The reason was simple. It was lucrative.</p><br/><p>In truth, high-ranked dungeons had much more value. Just look at Britain\u2019s Windermere Lake and America\u2019s Antelope Canyon. After I subjugated the bosses, their monster reproduction rate greatly decreased, giving them a safe and steady source of income. Each melting tuna was 150 million won and each wyvern was 250 million won.</p><br/><p>However, as valuable as these two dungeons were, they were the most troublesome to clear. A countless number of rankers stepped in to clear them, and in Wyvern\u2019s Nest, many rankers died. Countries should have realized that high-ranked dungeons will be more disastrous when they become Field Dungeons.</p><br/><p>[Yeah. A lot of the high ranking ability users were sent to A or A+ ranked dungeons. For Event Dungeons ranked S or above, the Guardian plans on clearing them one by one in order. They\u2019re sending all of their rankers. Freedom Wing and rogues are also being called to prepare for Event Raids.]</p><br/><p>[That sounds like it\u2019s going to take a long time\u2026 It\u2019s perfect for glancing over Event Dungeons ranked B or below.]</p><br/><p>[A lot of people are saying that low-ranked dungeons should also be cleared. But\u2026 they\u2019re all being ignored.]</p><br/><p>It seemed humans were still only thinking about how to benefit from the change brought by Two Moon. I couldn\u2019t blame them. A year and a half passed since the world transformed into fantasy. Civilization remained unhurt by what seemed like a calamity, and monster remains and Mana Stones even improved the advancement in science and technology. It made sense that some called emergence of monsters the \u2018blessing of God shifting the world\u2019s paradigm.\u2019 To them, ability users killed by monsters would only be \u2018pain necessary for change.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was only obvious. As long as they didn\u2019t know about the dungeon, as long as they didn\u2019t know about other worlds heading to ruin, it was only natural. As long as their lives weren\u2019t in danger, all humans, including me, would rather satisfy their hungry stomach than to worry about the future. The reason we were making a fuss over it was that we were dungeon explorers before we were Earth\u2019s ability users.</p><br/><p>To make them understand, the number of dungeon explorers just had to increase over hundreds of years. During that time, countless Event Dungeons would appear and transform into Field Dungeons. Countless Event Raids would also break out and destroy Earth\u2019s civilization.</p><br/><p>Humanity will then understand. That the emergence of monsters wasn\u2019t a blessing.</p><br/><p>[Even if Field Dungeons don\u2019t appear, humanity already lost too much land to monsters.]</p><br/><p>[Philippines, Madagascar, Republic of South Africa, Dominican Republic\u2026]</p><br/><p>There were already several ruined countries, and ten times as many countries relinquished entire regions to monsters. Even so, humans weren\u2019t considering taking back the lands claimed by monsters and were thinking about increasing monsters\u2019 territories just because they would be able to control them. This couldn\u2019t continue. Like this, Earth would only be coming closer to ruin.</p><br/><p>[Hwaya, if you have something you want to say, say it.]</p><br/><p>I thrust out my spear. A whirlpool instantly formed on its tip, which then shot toward the Wraith Queen\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>[\u2026 But I\u2019m not the guild master, Shin.]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m ordering you with full confidence. Do as you\u2019d like.]</p><br/><p>[I want to burn all the thoughtless idiots into cinders.]</p><br/><p>[What you want to do before that.]</p><br/><p>[I want to get rid of all the Event Dungeons\u2026]</p><br/><p>At Hwaya\u2019s words, I became silent for a moment. It wasn\u2019t just because 12 Wraith Queens were flying toward me while shooting ectoplasm arrows. I could simply use Divine Speed once and take care of them all.</p><br/><p>It was because I thought of Ciara. I was displeased and annoyed that what we were about to do was exactly what she wanted. However, since it was unavoidable for me to achieve my goals, I would have to bear with it. If I gave up my goals just because of a slight annoyance in the process, I would only regret it later.</p><br/><p>Besides, Ciara wasn\u2019t completely wrong either. I would be safer if there were more people helping, and if I was safe, Earth would be safe as well.</p><br/><p>Just look at the current situation. Instead of helping Earth become safer, humans were doing foolish things for their own greed. Since Guardian nor Freedom Wing couldn\u2019t get out of their selfishness, Ciara\u2019s suggestion for me to lead Earth\u2019s ability users wasn\u2019t entirely wrong.</p><br/><p>That said, I wasn\u2019t wrong either.</p><br/><p>[\u2026 There should be countries that don\u2019t have the necessary defensive capabilities against monsters. They should be allowing other countries\u2019 ability users to enter their gates.]</p><br/><p>[Shin!]</p><br/><p>[I think you know what I\u2019m trying to say, but\u2026 \u2018for now,\u2019 let\u2019s try to do it \u2018lawfully.\u2019]</p><br/><p>[Th\u2026. Thank you!]</p><br/><p>[I know what\u2019s important, Hwaya. I also know what\u2019s best for the future. If it\u2019s something we can do, we should probably do it. I doubt it\u2019ll be dangerous with our guild members\u2019 strength, but don\u2019t force them to come. Only take volunteers. I don\u2019t want to use my position as the guild master to order them around.]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll help! If that\u2019s what Hwaya unni wants and what Shin-nim recommends, I\u2019ll help gladly!]</p><br/><p>[I want to help too! I want to take this opportunity to go to Earth!]</p><br/><p>[Clearing Event Dungeons give achievements right? I\u2019ll help too!]</p><br/><p>[If it\u2019s what Shin wants, I\u2019ll do anything.]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll help, but I want to do it alone. I want to test my improved spearmanship.]</p><br/><p>[I probably have to help too\u2026 How annoying.]</p><br/><p>[No, Walker. Considering the current state of affairs, you stay home and focus on protecting Yua.]</p><br/><p>[Damn it. While you guys accomplish cool things, why do I have to stay home and be a bodyguard\u2026 Kuk!]</p><br/><p>Wraith Queens were gathering. Traps exploded, spreading poisonous mist, frost crystals, and sleeping gas. Using Tempest, I blew them all away, then gathered my aura in my spear. White aura. It was the Heroic Aura, only allowed for Heroes.</p><br/><p>[As for the \u2018others,\u2019 I\u2019ll take care of them when I get out. Just wait for one month.]</p><br/><p>[Okay!]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll wait for you, Shin-nim!]</p><br/><p>[I love you, I want to see you.]</p><br/><p>[Wait, who was the girl that just confessed her love to Kang Shin? She used the Floor Shop\u2019s voice changing item! I couldn\u2019t even think about buying it because it cost 1.5 million gold!]</p><br/><p>[How can you be certain it was a girl, Walker? There are men in this guild, too\u2026 Could it be\u2026 you?]</p><br/><p>[Do you want to fight, you old\u2026 Kuk!]</p><br/><p>It was impossible to avoid getting attention. We were strong. We would inevitably obtain a special position compared to other ability users. In that case, I would rather do things my way.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t like your methods, Ciara. People should sacrifice themselves to protect the Hero? That\u2019s wrong. That would only be a never-ending vicious cycle. Furthermore, I hate the idea that people should live or die for others. As humans, we have a right to die for our sake.\u2019</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t want to restrict others. For that to be possible, the Hero had to be stronger than anyone else. He had to be so strong that they didn\u2019t need to worry about me. Thankfully, the Hero in question was an excellent man of extreme talent. Furthermore, he still had 20 years left to grow.</p><br/><p>20 years. It was enough time for humanity to grow and come to take care of itself. Coincidentally, I had the appropriate identity to influence them toward that direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuaaaaaaaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kyaaaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>[Kiaaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>I thrust out the aura imbued in my spear. The spiraling aura instantly swallowed all the Wraith Queens and exploded. Perfect.</p><br/><p>One month. I couldn\u2019t wait.</p><br/><p>Author's note: N/A</p><br/>\n</div>"}

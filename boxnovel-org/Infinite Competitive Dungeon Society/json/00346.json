Demon Lord (9)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>\u201cDie!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shouting at the top of my lungs, I concentrated the explosion of thousands of fighter jets to the Demon Lord. However, the Demon Lord\u2019s vigor didn\u2019t diminish and in fact, increased.</p><br/><p>[As if I\u2019ll be taken out by something like this!]</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord\u2019s shout of anger cut through the explosion and rang in my ear. His large bat-like wings spread open and a burst of demonic energy began to devour the damage from the fighter jets\u2019 explosions.</p><br/><p>[I will not yield!]</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it me or is that guy still powering up?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I murmured in a half-joking manner, Licorice narrowed her eyes and glared at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because Dear Husband is too strong. Compared to humans, demons are organisms with no limit. As long as they have the talent, they can grow extremely quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me that now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think Dear Husband would get so strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eventually, the explosions subsided. The Demon Lord appeared from within, his clothes tattered and his body wrought with wounds. Still, the amount of power in his power was more than enough to send a chill down my back.</p><br/><p>[Die.]</p><br/><p>\u201cEk!\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, I got in front of Father. Steel let out a black light, and I spat out a mouthful of black blood. The Demon Lord curled his mouth into a smile.</p><br/><p>[Good defense. I wonder how long you can keep it up.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing now, Licorice?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I knew, I\u2019d be the Demon Lord, not a Succubus Empress. I do have a guess\u2026 Language spell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Language spell?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt skips over all the annoying steps in invoking a magic and manifests whatever\u2019s on the caster\u2019s mind. It\u2019s mana costly but extremely fast and powerful.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Fall.]</p><br/><p>This time, it\u2019s going for Sumire! A spell that I couldn\u2019t see the start of sent Sumire spiraling down in an instant.</p><br/><p>I quickly sent a wave of aura to catch her, but the Demon Lord\u2019s tentacles of demonic energy flew over to cut it off. Father swung his spear at the tentacles and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou keep doing unmanly things!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You can die too.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHa!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed Father got a feel for his attack with the previous one. After creating a powerful vibration in the air, he twisted his body meticulously. Other than coughing out a mouthful of blood like I did, he wasn\u2019t injured.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnless the source of an attack is internal, there\u2019s bound to be a change in external energy. Predicting his attack isn\u2019t hard, just that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Continue dodging then!]</p><br/><p>I understood what Father was worried about. Numerous attacks that came consecutively! I quickly moved my metallic fragments around, but it seemed the Demon Lord\u2019s attacks weren\u2019t something the fragments could block.</p><br/><p>Licorice quickly cast a barrier spell. Of course, even that wasn\u2019t enough to completely block the Demon Lord\u2019s attacks.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe baits have done their work, so send them back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kain spoke as he blocked the attack sent his way. Ye-Eun protested angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a bait!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBait, don\u2019t trouble Kang Shin and get back.\u201d</p><br/><p>When my name came up, Kali\u2019s energy wavered for a moment. At that moment, the Demon Lord made another attack, and when I pulled her out of the way with a string of aura, Ye-Eun reluctantly nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll get back.\u201d</p><br/><p>[As if I\u2019d let you.]</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord was truly shameless. The Demon Lord\u2019s incessant attacks on the weaker members of our party seemed to have irritated Kain, as he hurled his spear towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cTry using that spell again!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You think I won\u2019t!?]</p><br/><p>In the next moment, the Demon Lord flipped upside down. He was bleeding from his entire body. Meanwhile, Ye-Eun took Sumire and safely got out. Father held his spear up as though he didn\u2019t want to leave, but I bowed and pleaded.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, take care of the ground. There are too many monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, fine. I wanted to put in a proper blow, but none of my attacks seem to be working anyways\u2026 Be safe, Son.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>By the time Father finished leaving the area, the Demon Lord managed to stagger up. The wounds on his body were clearly critical, but it felt like he wouldn\u2019t die no matter how much damage he took. A never-ending stream of demonic energy energized and healed his body.</p><br/><p>[Magic reflection, you bastard\u2026!]</p><br/><p>\u201cServes you right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kain spoke boastingly as he received his spear that flew back into his hand. As his previous attack clearly changed the flow of battle, I gave Kain a thumbs up. However, the Demon Lord concentrated his overflowing demonic energy into his eyes and shouted.</p><br/><p>[But it doesn\u2019t look like you can use it a second time\u2026! I acknowledge your strength but in the end, you will also be devoured by me!]</p><br/><p>It\u2019s coming again! The Demon Lord\u2019s language spells flew towards from all sides.</p><br/><p>To analyze his hardly detectable magic, I rolled my brain. At the same time, the halo on my horns accelerated. A mana of indescribable light rose up around Steel.</p><br/><p>[I see, so that\u2019s your final weapon! That incomprehensible mana\u2026 How can you wield that power?]</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s originally mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>I retorted casually and accelerated the concentration of mana. Though it was impossible to see his language spells and break them, strengthened to the limit by Enigma, Steel was withstanding his attacks. The Demon Lord asked in doubt.</p><br/><p>[Your power\u2026?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the same realm as gods\u2019 power, but in truth, it\u2019s no different than gods\u2019 power. Enigma is just a different form of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I obtained a halo, I truly understood Enigma. Although the halo itself was still a mystery, I knew it was a mark that my League had taken a step into the next realm.</p><br/><p>Because of it, I learned that I could wield Enigma with my own power. The Overlord skill simply gave me a sample of the power I would come to wield. Of course, if I didn\u2019t grow since the time I obtained Overlord, I wouldn\u2019t have learned to wield it.</p><br/><p>In any case, I didn\u2019t think this was the power Sherafina wanted from me. If it was, the Demon Lord would have reacted differently, and this much was something Loretta could also do.</p><br/><p>Additionally, wielding this power didn\u2019t make me a god. It could be a requirement to becoming a god but in the end, it was on the same realm as the dungeon\u2019s power Sherafina had.</p><br/><p>[But a power only holds meaning when it works against an enemy. Your mana is indeed lethal and resembles those damned gods! But it will become mine in the end!]</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard, how are you so greedy!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Spells continued to fly without stopping. I spread my arms out and released Enigma out in all directions. Now, I felt like I was beginning to understand how his language spells worked. Converting my mana to bullets of aura, I shot them at the Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>\u201cKain, Licorice! Restrain him for a moment!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kain held his spear up even as he snorted, while Licorice immediately set out with Divine Speed. Approaching the Demon Lord in an instant, Enigma was also gathering on her hands.</p><br/><p>[What!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Dear Husband\u2019s power, so I can use it when we\u2019re together!\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice scratched at the Demon Lord, which he blocked with his hand. Meanwhile, Kain charged towards him on Sleipnir and stabbed his spear in from his blind spot. The Demon Lord\u2019s demonic energy exploded fiercely and pushed them back. All the while, his language spells continued to shoot at them.</p><br/><p>[Die!]</p><br/><p>\u201cEit!\u201d</p><br/><p>While Licorice and Kain resisted his language spells, this time, countless beads of demonic energy rose up in the sky. Having absorbed all negative energy on Earth, the beads were emitting a chilling light.</p><br/><p>[I am the king of all evil!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKyak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them couldn\u2019t dodge this attack. Still, remembering my request to restrain the Demon Lord, they protected me from the beads with their bodies.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m good now!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a flood of metallic fragments swept over the Demon Lord. It happened right after Licorice and Kain were sent back from the explosion of demonic energy. The Demon Lord detonated more demonic energy to stop the metallic fragments, and from the outside, it seemed as though my attack had little effect.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 D-Dear Husband, you asked us to restrain him for just that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you make an error somewhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice and Kain looked at me dumbfoundedly. I replied with a shrug. Licorice nodded in understanding when I transferred some of my consciousness to her, but Kain still seemed clueless.</p><br/><p>However, the mystery was soon solved.</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Kuhuk!]</p><br/><p>The metallic fragments were indeed powerful, but they didn\u2019t have enough power to deal a fatal blow to someone like the Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>However, after the metallic fragments were destroyed by the exploding demonic energy, the Demon Lord became pale and oozed out black demonic energy from his body. This demonic energy didn\u2019t come out of his own will, but because it wasn\u2019t under his control.</p><br/><p>[Y-You\u2026! What did you do to me!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><br/><p>I spoke in awe.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were right about this curse. Not even the Demon Lord can shake it off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right, the metallic fragments I just used carried the blood of the last demon I killed in Luka continent. I was sure he\u2019d be happy if he knew his curse came in useful.</p><br/><p>[Something like this\u2026 Something like this!]</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord\u2019s horn shrunk. In return, his demonic energy exploded in several places. Seeing explosions that could ruin a world, Licorice screamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do, Dear Husband! He\u2019s gotten even crazier!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019ll work now. That curse cut down his League by a step.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWork? What will? \u2026Kyak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice, who turned towards me, screamed as she blushed. Worried that it was too much, I asked Dortu to create a mirror for me to see.</p><br/><p>A woman of unsurpassable peerless beauty was reflected in the mirror.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>I exclaimed in surprise. Then, I was surprised once more at the voice I uttered. All I did was transform into a woman with my power!</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to admit, I\u2019m quite beautiful. What do you think, Demon Lord?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Y-You are\u2026 Hero!?]</p><br/><p>The explosions subsided slightly. Seeing the Demon Lord noticeably flustered, I winked at him and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cLilith\u2019s Temptation!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Above the Frozen Land (1)</p><br/><p>[Wow, Earth has a cool place like this!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is your first time in Antarctica, Ruyue?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un!]</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the first for me too.</p><br/><p>Of course, the last time Event Dungeons spawned, there were some in Antarctica. However, I was stuck training in Beyond at that time, while Hwaya and the other Revival members had taken care of the Event Dungeons in Antarctica. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t have to go all the way to Antarctica last time. It seemed I was paying the price this time as I was even assigned the Antarctica Ocean.</p><br/><p>Licorice, Lotte, and Plene were all frowning, while even Peika, who wasn\u2019t affected by the environmental effects that much, was feeling uncomfortable. Only Sharana, who lived in a place full of freezing energy, and Ruyue, who was an ice elemental, were happy.</p><br/><p>[There\u2019s cold wind here, Master!]</p><br/><p>[Let\u2019s come play here often!]</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, I\u2019ll consider it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Being an elementalist, it seemed I would have to go on vacations to Antarctica\u2026! Of course, Antarctica\u2019s temperature couldn\u2019t affect me in the slightest, but what was there to do in Antarctica!? Do I shave off an icy mountain to make shaved ice? I seriously considered making a special facility for Ruyue in Antarctica as I began to clean up the Antarctic Ocean\u2019s Event Dungeons.</p><br/><p>Most of the Antarctic Ocean\u2019s Event Dungeons were deep underwater. Even if I wasn\u2019t affected by the cold, being in a below \u2018zero-degree\u2019 freezing water wasn\u2019t a particularly pleasant feeling. One positive thing was that monsters seemed to prefer warmth to cold as they weren\u2019t often seen in the Antarctic Ocean. As such, we could mostly just focus on clearing Event Dungeons.</p><br/><p>[You cleared an SS rank Event Dungeon! You gained 2 bonus stats!]</p><br/><p>There was nothing that could stop us, as we breezed through the Antarctic Ocean\u2019s Event Dungeons. As there were less Event Dungeons in the ocean than on the continent, we could finish in just ten days. The reason I hoped to finish in ten days was because the eleventh day was the sixth rest day I designated.</p><br/><p>When the rest day came, we went to the Residential Area, took baths, and rested our bodies. Even after soaking in a warm bath for three hours, Licorice complained repeatedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe cold in my body hasn\u2019t left even now. This is the worst.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hate the cold ocean too. There\u2019s nowhere to swim and it\u2019s not a good place to sing in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Plene pouted like a duck. I asked Sharana to dry them off as I replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Once we go to Antarctica, you\u2019ll think the Antarctic Ocean was warm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a blaze fitting for this Blaze Queen!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI followed Dear Husband all the way to this cold place! I\u2019ll get mad if I don\u2019t get rewarded!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lotte only complained, but Licorice dug into my arms with only a towel around her. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t want to spoil her a bit, but I still pushed her away with a wry smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even do this much? Just a little bit, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to go the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice who was acting cute frowned at my response and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to meet that woman!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf people heard, they\u2019d think that you\u2019re my wife and that I\u2019m going to go cheat on you with someone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow!? Plus, I\u2019m not going to meet Loretta, I\u2019m going to enter Beyond.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRather than that, play with me! Dear Husbaaand, please?\u201d</p><br/><p>I admired Licorice\u2019s persistence in wanting to spend the rest of the day with me, but I couldn\u2019t concede either.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an important battle, so I can\u2019t just relax and fool around.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen should we do something more intense, Dear Husband\u2026? I\u2019d love to!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right, as I had finished grinding the 75th Floor Master today, I had to fight Beyond\u2019s 25th Floor Master today.</p><br/><p>\u201cHero is really different than other men. Strangely different. So different that it\u2019s annoying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin is kind and nice!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about, stupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to think this way, but could Dear Husband be impo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop there.\u201d</p><br/><p>I first grinded the 75th Floor Master in the rest day. I had somewhat expected it when the 71st floor had bats like the 61st floor, but what appeared from the 73rd from onward were vampires. They possessed magic power vastly stronger than succubi or incubi, as they moved extremely quickly while transforming to multiple forms, and aimed for my neck from the most unexpected places. However, the First Dungeon still couldn\u2019t catch up to my level yet, as I still passed with ease through them.</p><br/><p>As I had to make time every night while everyone else was asleep to climb the dungeon, it took a few days to climb each floor. Of course, as I needed to wait for the rest days that came once a week to enter Beyond, the fact that it took a few days to climb each First Dungeon floor wasn\u2019t that big of a problem. I broke through floors with Giant Wolfs, Wendigos, or both, then made time to beat up the 75th Floor Master, Vampire Lord, during the fifth week.</p><br/><p>First, I unfortunately couldn\u2019t get the Vampire Lord Master title. It seemed one of the past Beyond explorers, who were used to defeating Floor Masters solo, had taken the first achievement.</p><br/><p>As the solo clear reward was Mistification, I couldn\u2019t fathom what the first solo clear reward was. But since the Mistification skill was meaningless to me, I didn\u2019t think the higher class version of Mistification would be any more useful. After all, there was no reason for me to turn to mist.</p><br/><p>If I was fighting against opponents that couldn\u2019t wield mana, transforming into a mist would prevent me from being hit and would even let me move easier than with a solid body, but none of the opponents I faced were unskilled in manipulating mana and I had Divine Speed to speed up my movement, so I didn\u2019t need to lighten my body through Mistification. If I used it, I might only end up exposing more weaknesses by becoming more vulnerable to attacks with mana.</p><br/><p>Most importantly, if I needed to transform into a mist, I could simply use Sky God\u2019s Play. In a way, Sky God\u2019s Play was a much higher version of Mistification, and it didn\u2019t lower my defense in any way. It was the transformation skill that reigned over all others. Because Sky God\u2019s Play guaranteed that I would never be seen through, I didn\u2019t really need any other transformation skills.</p><br/><p>Of course, it didn\u2019t hurt to have more skills. The solo clear rewards were really confusing in some ways. Some skills from lower floors were even better than the skills from higher floors, which meant it wasn\u2019t guaranteed that higher floors would have skills any better than Mistification.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the 75th Floor\u2019s elixir didn\u2019t disappoint me. It was called Vampire Lord\u2019s Blood Essence. I felt a bit weird consuming it, but it still raised my constitution and magic by 3 each time. After the tenth elixir, my constitution and magic rose by 30 points each, and my MP broke through 200,000. Even if I used a Heroic Strike that used 50% of my mana, it would have 100,000 points worth of mana condensed into it.</p><br/><p>Finally, the Floor Master set skill was called Blood Curse. It was similar to Deathblood Ring\u2019s \u2018blood contamination\u2019 in that it used my health to activate. I could hit a target with my blood and decrease all of his stats and make him fall into massive hemorrhage status effect. It was a good debuff skill to have.</p><br/><p>When I was about to leave for Beyond after looking through the gains from 75th Floor, Licorice clung to my back and pretended to sob.</p><br/><p>\u201cSob, I\u2019m being neglected by my husband at such a young age and forced to sleep alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that in front of the other girls, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Especially Yua. I didn\u2019t even want to imagine what would happen if she found out.</p><br/><p>\u201cEi, go already. Hurry back and play with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going back to sleep. I\u2019m too tired.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll also be in the resort area. I know Hero won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><br/><p>I lightly patted Licorice and the others and head to the dungeon. Loretta who was waiting for me on the 75th floor flapped her ears and greeted me happily.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou came to play with me, right!? Let\u2019s play, let\u2019s play!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this some new disease going around recently?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just how busy was I that everyone started saying this? I swore to wrap up the remaining Event Dungeons as quickly as possible. I wanted to get some rest too.</p><br/><p>For now, however, I couldn\u2019t make time just for Loretta. With a bitter smile, I pointed at the gate next to the stairway to the 76th floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, Loretta. I\u2019ll be back later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSob, I\u2019m being neglected by my husband at such a young age and forced to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you plan this with Licorice!? Now that I think about you, neither of you are that young\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta looked up at me with fake tears. She had an axe on one hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you say something, Shin-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing, Loretta-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t die without even seeing the Floor Master\u2019s face. I kneeled while facing Loretta\u2019s violence then headed to Beyond\u2019s 25th floor with tears. Loretta saw me off with a smile, but if I didn\u2019t come see her afterwards, I would have to face her wrath.</p><br/><p>It seemed I might have to give myself another rest day. Damn, curse my mouth\u2026!</p><br/><p>The monster I would face had the combined strong points of Giant Wolves and Wendigos. To be honest, neither Giant Wolves nor Wendigos were difficult opponents to face.</p><br/><p>The Giant Wolves in Beyond\u2019s 21st floor were bigger than the First Dungeon\u2019s Giant Wolf Floor Master, but I had ample experience fighting massive monsters and was an expert in detecting presences. To me, they were nothing more than sandbags. The Wendigos, who just had more powerful freezing energy, were even easier to deal with than the Giant Wolves. They couldn\u2019t do anything in front of Ruyue\u2019s ability.</p><br/><p>Even when I was climbing the First Dungeon, I breezed through the first dungeon 41st to 50th floors. It was the same for Beyond\u2019s 21st to 24th floors. It was almost as if someone was being considerate of me since I was busy on Earth. Of course, with Beyond\u2019s floors being much bigger than the First Dungeon\u2019s floors, I still needed to invest a full day for each floor.</p><br/><p>Regardless, Beyond was also\u2026 easy!</p><br/><p>[Guoooooo!]</p><br/><p>Beyond\u2019s 25th floor was a giant snowy mountain similar to the Floor Master room where I fought the Wendigo. There, I met a Skeleton Wolf that was comparable in size to a mountain.</p><br/><p>\u201cEach battle rooms are getting bigger\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me there will be one in the size of a country soon\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As I leisurely murmured, I swung the spear in my hand and fixed my grip on it. A golden lightning crackled around the speartip, while Ruyue materialized into her beastgirl form and got ready to receive any attacks. Both offense and defense were perfect.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s fight. I\u2019ll end this in the blink of an eye.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Guoooooooooooo!]</p><br/>\n</div>"}

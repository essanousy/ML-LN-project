What It Means to Climb the First Dungeon (4)</p><br/><p>\u201cHuk, he can even use that skill!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what is a Hero?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, the ghoul!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dark Thunder Explosion attacked all targets in its area of effect. Even though the Giant Ghoul was huge, his entire body was within Dark Thunder Explosion\u2019s range. He had essentially received the entire force of the attack, which would usually be spread out across dozens of enemies. Plus, at the same time I used the skill, I punched my fist in his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie! Die! Die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>By the time Dark Thunder Explosion came to an end, the Giant Ghoul looked no different than before he used Diehard. I wasn\u2019t done yet. I called Peika. Since I had canceled Spirit Aura after throwing the spear, she answered immediately to my call.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, come inside my gauntlet!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Uu, you\u2019re using that again?]</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, Peika.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Okay\u2026 But you have to listen to one wish, Master!]</p><br/><p>With a bit of complaint, Peika infused herself into my gauntlet. Thinking that her wish was probably for me to play with her later, I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThunder Beast!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing lightning shoot out from my body, Ellos seemed exhausted as he said, \u201cI\u2019m too tired to even be surprised.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, I didn\u2019t pay him any attention. I simply put my first through the Giant Ghoul\u2019s uselessly large head.</p><br/><p>Not long afterwards, he collapsed. He was burnt to a crisp, but let out a disgusting smell that anyone would run away from.</p><br/><p>[You became level 26 and obtained the qualification to climb to the 26th floor.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained 5 bonus stats.]</p><br/><p>[30,000 gold is distributed evenly among party members. You received 4,286 gold.]</p><br/><p>[Rewards will be distributed in order of contribution.]</p><br/><p>[Kang Shin-nim\u2019s contribution is the highest. Choose your reward.]</p><br/><p>[1. Giant Ghoul\u2019s Pants</p><br/><p>2. Double Potion</p><br/><p>3. 10,000 Gold</p><br/><p>4. Skin Strengthening Elixir</p><br/><p>5. Giant Ghoul\u2019s Boots</p><br/><p>6. Rotten Ebony Staff</p><br/><p>7. Giant Ghoul\u2019s Shoulder Blade]</p><br/><p>Hoping that Giant Ghoul\u2019s Shoulder Blade wasn\u2019t part of the set equipment, I chose the Skin Strengthening Elixir. I was glad it wasn\u2019t like the Muscle Strengthening Elixir, where it would only appear with 2 people. Since the Skin Strengthening Elixir came out this time, I suspected one of the Floor Masters would soon have Bone Strengthening Elixirs.</p><br/><p>While I was picking my reward, the party members were going crazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe did it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we cleared it on our first try. This is a miracle!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince-nim, you really are amazing\u2026 you single handedly brought us victory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help but be jealous. Just 4 years ago, he couldn\u2019t even advance to the 6th floor as he lacked mana\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a Hero. This is his destiny.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I got annoyed, as it felt like she was saying I got stronger only because I was a Hero. I didn\u2019t even know what a Hero was! When I snapped my head at them, they all looked away, pretending not to have said anything.</p><br/><p>I smirked and swallowed the Skin Strengthening Elixir. I wasn\u2019t planning on continuing with them anyways, and I only knew them through Ellos and Palludia. I wasn\u2019t motivated to argue with them in the slightest.</p><br/><p>[By consuming the Skin Strengthening Elixir, your skin becomes tougher and more resilient. Constitution and Charm both increase by 1.]</p><br/><p>Since my defense went up, it made sense that constitution went up, but why did charm go up as well? Could this Skin Strengthening Elixir be used as a beauty product? Mother would go crazy if she knew. Alright, I\u2019ll let father grind them. It was his wife becoming more beautiful, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019d do it on his own. Yua? My Yua\u2019s skin was and would always be perfect!</p><br/><p>I turned around. Perhaps it was coincidental, but all the party members were staring at me. It seemed they already finished choosing their rewards.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince-nim, thank you. I\u2019ll be going ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>With just that, the surviving member from the Pilos continent\u2019s party left. I was slightly lost for words at his lightning fast exit, but I wasn\u2019t concerned with him.</p><br/><p>Ellos approached me, handing me my Black Earthen Spear that he likely picked up while I was busy.</p><br/><p>\u201cFriend, we won because of you. Just like 4 years ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you could have won without me, though most people would have been kicked out of the dungeon in the process.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m going to fight him again. I have to help Paul get through.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t help you with that. I joined this party to raid with you, not to help you pass through\u2026 I only helped today because I didn\u2019t want to see people dying in front of me for no reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos smiled bitterly. He\u2019d made only one miscalculation, and that was my strength. He must be thinking our difference in ability made this laughable result.</p><br/><p>However, I thought differently. I didn\u2019t like the mindsets they had showed since the beginning. In attitude during battle or anything else, they could not even compare to Ren, not even Ellos.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is everyone so conservative? It\u2019s not like they\u2019ll really die, so why can\u2019t they be a little more daring? I\u2019ve realized this as I watched different dungeon explorers, but that\u2019s just how you guys looked today. Like people that didn\u2019t want to advance to higher floors.\u201d</p><br/><p>At my words, the people remaining flinched slightly. What, was that true? My mouth half-opened from the shock. Of course, Ellos was the only one who would answer my suspicions.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn truth\u2026 you might be right. After becoming dungeon explorers, they receive the highest treatment from their respective countries. Although it is to be used as tools for battle against the invaders, the good treatment comes before that. After reaching a certain level\u2026 that is, after becoming Silver rank, they\u2019re treated almost like royalty. Until they\u2019re sent to the battlefield, that is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen their level goes up, their countries would treat them better, but they would also be sent to more dangerous places\u2026 All dungeon explorers want to avoid that to a certain extent, and this sentiment might have been reflected as being conservative in Floor Master battles. If they died in the process, they would be safer and they can use the excuse that they did their best, while fully enjoying the benefits of being a dungeon explorer. It\u2019s probably the same in other worlds. For dungeon explorers, their initial ambition of wanting to protect their worlds becomes fainter as they climb\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this, I remembered. At the 5th and 10th floors, the explorers were happy and excited at the prospect of advancing forward.</p><br/><p>But starting from the 15th floor, people were more surprised and shocked than happy. Perhaps that party leader from my first Dark Ratman raid wanted to lead the party to its death on purpose.</p><br/><p>In the one raid party I had on the 20th floor, the party members became angry at Ren for making their friends die. They should have been happy first, or thanked me for my work.</p><br/><p>In other words, they might not have been happy to advance past the 20th floor. Of course, that wasn\u2019t to say they weren\u2019t happy in the slightest, but they must have felt equal or greater pressure from having to advance onward. It was absurd.</p><br/><p>\u201cStupid! That weakness of theirs is going to lead to their deaths one day! That\u2019s simply in the present!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I know. I know full well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why dungeon explorers didn\u2019t adventure. I finally understood a bit of what Loretta and I talked about. These so-called First Dungeon explorers! Even if they were chosen by other explorers and not by the dungeon itself, how could they be so shameful!?</p><br/><p>\u201cBut not everyone is like that, Shin! I hope you aren\u2019t too disillusioned about dungeon explorers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. If the dungeon only had people like them, their worlds would have been ruined already! ... And I don\u2019t think you\u2019re someone like that either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, but in truth, I\u2019m not that different. Both in terms of ability and bravery, I\u2019m no match for you. I learned a lot from you today. 4 years ago, I came to admire you and aspired to become like you. I remembered that feeling today.\u201d</p><br/><p>I hesitated. Ellos\u2019 eyes were sincere. At least in my eyes, his willpower was there.</p><br/><p>\u201cOrc\u2026 Kang Shin! I, I\u2019m the same. Don\u2019t misunderstand! I\u2019m only trying to grow stronger so I can fight the demon race!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Palludia, I know. You were a lot different than 4 years ago. Your performance today was dazzling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHiik!\u201d</p><br/><p>I meant to compliment her, but Palludia let out a strange squeal and shrunk back with a bright red face. She really was weird. Shuna was standing next to her stealing glances at me from behind her shield. I didn\u2019t know why, so I just let her be. Instead, I looked at Ellos.</p><br/><p>\u201cEllos, how about you come with me for a little while? Climb the dungeon with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, I didn\u2019t mean I\u2019d continue with him forever. It was just temporary, until he learned something from me. However, in a way, I already knew how he would respond. It was better to say I was going out of my way to sever the lingering attachment he would have.</p><br/><p>As expected, Ellos shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, Shin. But I have to lead my party members.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Well, you are a leader before you are a warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was enough. Ellos didn\u2019t need to change drastically. Rather, it was his party members that had to change. Both Paul and Baruela had the right mindset. It was their skills that were lacking. But there wasn\u2019t much they could do about it. They could only keep working hard. If that wasn\u2019t enough, although it was a bit cruel, that was the extent of their talent.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to change your party, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I want to keep going with them until the end. I believe I can.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s good enough. Good luck. You\u2019ll all need to change a lot. I\u2019m off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, thanks. I\u2019ll contact you again. Today was a great experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying my goodbye to Ellos and even turning to Baruela and bowing goodbye to her, I wanted to return to the dungeon I came from, but Palludia grabbed onto me. When I looked at her, she seemed to be lost for words as she her lips trembled without making a sound.</p><br/><p>When I urged her on with my gaze, she finally managed to open her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cR-Resi\u2026 Residential Area, have you been there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-If you come\u2026 contact me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason, Palludia looked like she was about to cry. Plus, her face was bright red like it was about to blow up. She looked dejected, yet also happy. I didn\u2019t know what her face was trying to say. Next to her, Shuna glanced back and forth between my face and Palludia\u2019s as if she knew what Palludia meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia! You\u2026 how\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShuna, be quiet! I have no other choice!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not what you said before! Liar! Just admit that you just fell in lo\u2026 ooop! Ooop!\u201d</p><br/><p>Palludia covered Shuna\u2019s mouth with her hands, and dealt a knee kick to her waist. With her high defense, Shuna didn\u2019t seem to be in pain, but seeing two grown-up women in such an active posture made me feel slightly embarrassed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll contact you. Can I go now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cH-Hurry up and leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince-niiim!\u201d</p><br/><p>I turned my eyes away from Shuna, who was trying to tell me something even as Palludia was trying to stop her. My eyes then met the elf archer\u2019s, who gave me a respectful bow. I still didn\u2019t know why she was acting that way. Then I left the party.</p><br/><p>Although a lot of confusing things had happened, the raid had finished successfully.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Kahar (3)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Chapter 269. Kahar (3)</p><br/><p>Just like how it was when I went to Luka continent, I expected to find myself inside a palace when I used Dimensional Travel. I was right. After using Dimensional Travel, Lotte, Licorice, and I found ourselves in the middle of a vast hall filled with knights and magicians. When I looked around, I didn\u2019t see any other Dimensional Mercenaries. Just when I was thinking that they had already left, one of the knights murmuring amongst themselves approached me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Dimensional Mercenary, right? Do you know how many more are coming?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m the last one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you Kang Shin-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>What\u2019s this? They know who I am? As if to prove my suspicion, the knight then bowed respectfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince is waiting for you. Follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>I widened my eyes. The Crown Prince is waiting for me, a Dimensional Mercenary? Could it be\u2026? I shut my mouth and followed the knight. I didn\u2019t need to think too much about it. After all, I would soon see it with my own eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, the people here are pretty strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re doing well against their invaders, so it makes sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTheir gazes are annoying. Hero, can I pull their eyes out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because you two are pretty. Just ignore them.\u201d</p><br/><p>In this place full of men, Lotte and Licorice stood out too much. As we followed the knight, I could feel everyone\u2019s gazes locking onto us. In most cases, stares fixed on women shifted to the man they were traveling with. It was truly annoying. Even on a Dimensional Mercenary mission, I was receiving gazes full of envy. Just focus on your war, damn it!</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t mind them. They\u2019re just mentally exhausted from repeated battles. When they see Kang Shin-nim traveling with two beautiful women, it\u2019s natural that they\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLotte and Licorice are fighters too\u2026 Well, whatever.\u201d</p><br/><p>We arrived in front of the audience chamber. The knight stopped and announced our arrival. A voice of a young man then told us to enter. When the door opened, we walked in in a straight line. In the fairly large audience chamber, there was one man sitting at the head of a long table.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re really here. It\u2019s been a long time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 Paul!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I almost fell over from the surprise. The man wearing a fancy armor and sitting at the head of the table was undoubtedly Ellos\u2019 party member, Paul. Seeing me speechless, Paul seemed a bit down.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so openly shocked. Did you expect Ellos to be here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Paul smiled bitterly at my honest reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, I also think that he\u2019s more fitting for this position. But even if he\u2019s the party leader in the dungeon, in the Edias continent\u2019s Cravis Empire, he is my royal guard as Count Kasina\u2019s eldest son.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a crown prince? Ah, I remember now, your last name was Cravis.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. First, come on in. Ellos will be here soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Like he said, Ellos did arrive soon. He was fully armored and wore a stiff expression. When he saw me, his expression lightened slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFriend, you really came!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry that I came so late, Ellos. It looks like the other mercenaries already left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. They already separated into their own teams. But to be honest, a part of them are dummies. Because the invaders are also looking for the Hero, we have to move secretly and cautiously.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Ellos\u2019 serious expression and Paul\u2019s lax expression, I couldn\u2019t help but compare the two. I wanted to ask if they were pulling a prank on me by pretending to play the other\u2019s role, but I also remembered Ren being a crown prince. If Ren was a crown prince, I had to acknowledge Paul as one too.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, who are they?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, this is Licorice and this is Lotte. Licorice is a Succubus Queen and Lotte is a Blaze Queen, a stronger variety of wyverns. They\u2019re\u2026 my allies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, I heard you\u2019re Dear Husband\u2019s friend. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected of a succubus, Licorice greeted them with a charming smile. Lotte, on the other hand, looked uncomfortable. While I was looking at them and making a wry smile, Paul and Ellos whispered to each other with stiff expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuccubus Queen? Wyvern? They\u2019re both look like beautiful women\u2026 Amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe far-reaching rumors of Revival\u2019s guild master doesn\u2019t even come close to the truth\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I wondered what rumors about me were spreading, but now wasn\u2019t the time to ask. After whispering with Ellos, Paul looked at me with a more spirited face.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me explain to you the details.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 Ellos.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos is explaining!?</p><br/><p>\u201cI explained how we had a huge battle, right? Our continent\u2019s Hero is a great warrior who\u2019s broken through to the First Dungeon\u2019s 92nd floor. In that great battle, he cut down countless invaders and brought victory to our continent\u2019s allied force. The leader of the invaders is a man called \u2018Kain\u2019. At the time of the battle, his strength was similar to the Hero\u2019s. On top of the countless corpses of invaders and of our continent\u2019s inhabitants, they fought fiercely. In the end, neither side came out victorious, and the invader\u2019s retreated. Paul, do you have a map?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOn the wall, here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos congealed mana on his finger and touched a point on the map. A small mark was left by a burn.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom here to here is the invaders\u2019 territory. Here\u2019s our empire. Here and here are independent nations that are allied with us. They ally with us whenever a huge battle is imminent. Although several countries have already fallen, most of the survivors came together and formed an army. Now, they\u2019re a part of us. We\u2019ve been even in size of forces. For the final battle, we planned on using a Dimensional Mercenary request to bring many Dimensional Mercenaries. Until that happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Hero going missing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos nodded and bit his lips. His eyes seemed to be burning.</p><br/><p>\u201cEllos became the Hero\u2019s disciple a little while ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>I remembered Ellos telling me about catching the Hero\u2019s attention. Still, I didn\u2019t think that he\u2019d become his disciple. I checked out Ellos once more. Indeed, I couldn\u2019t tell what league he was in, but he had a formidable spirit. Plus, it was hard to feel his presence. If that\u2019s what I felt, Ellos must have grown immensely.</p><br/><p>The dungeon wasn\u2019t the only place to grow stronger. It was like that for me, too.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we can\u2019t rescue the Hero, there\u2019s no future for Edias. I want to believe he hasn\u2019t been captured by the invaders, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he was captured, he would have been killed on the spot. Don\u2019t worry, Ellos, he should be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos made a strange smile at my encouraging words. It was the type of smile that tried to mask sadness. Ellos then nodded and drew mana on his hand once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have a few places in mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>He drew points on the map one by one. They were all in the invaders\u2019 territory.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter the great battle, when we were retreating, we learned that the Hero had gone missing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the middle, huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne thing we know for sure is that the Hero fought them. Our enemies operate with groups of skilled assassins. I don\u2019t know how they lured the Hero from the barracks, but it\u2019s likely that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA hostage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Paul\u2019s expression was completely stiff. It didn\u2019t fit his character at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Hero used to be a wandering knight. He came to our empire when he became a Hero, so we don\u2019t really know his history. He always said he was an orphan, but that might have been false. Maybe, the invaders took his relative hostage and lured him out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRegardless of how, after luring him out, they must have ambushed him, and although they failed, they most likely injured the Hero greatly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo the point, he couldn\u2019t return to the barracks?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos nodded silently. Paul then continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cMany people speculated where the Hero could be hiding. The easiest place to hide is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut in their territory, you can\u2019t enter the dungeon nor use its messaging system.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>My eyes shot open. Their territory? In this area covering half the map, you couldn\u2019t enter the dungeon or message anyone? For a moment, I thought of Lespina. However, there was a clear difference in their range.</p><br/><p>Why were these things happening so often nowadays? I doubt all worlds\u2019 enemies use this method.</p><br/><p>As a confirmation, I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre the explorers\u2019 power suppressed in their territory?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know? It\u2019s not by a lot, but everyone has their power suppressed by about 10%.\u201d</p><br/><p>10%. Thankfully, it wasn\u2019t a large amount. Still, the range of their suppression was shocking. When I closed my mouth, Ellos continued his explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re proficient in the science of magic. They must have analyzed something about explorers through countless battles. Or maybe, they captured explorers to experiment on them. In the last battle, we found out about their ability. It\u2019ll be dangerous if we let them be. If they reduce explorers\u2019 power by another 10%, their chance of victory will skyrocket.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat aside, the reason the Hero can\u2019t go to the dungeon is that he\u2019s stuck in their territory?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. So he must have found a place to hide. After careful consideration\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He pointed a few spots on the map. Although the circles he drew were small compared to the map, since the map was of the entire continent, the region encompassed by the circles must be fairly big.</p><br/><p>\u201cA mountain range and a forest, both with complex topographies. They\u2019re the easiest places to hide. There are also wastelands and rocky mountains, but they\u2019re unlikely. When we realized the Hero went missing, we immediately sent our troops out to search for him. As you can guess, we couldn\u2019t find him. We couldn\u2019t stay in the enemy\u2019s territory for long, so the search didn\u2019t last long. If we stayed too long, we might have been annihilated before we could find the Hero. In the end, we split off a part of the army to search for the Hero, and the rest retreated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you still couldn\u2019t find him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Paul added.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the ones that remained were all killed. The invaders also sent out troops to find the Hero before us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just one thing after another, huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they capture the Hero, it\u2019s all over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos spoke with a stiff voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we had to rely on Dimensional Mercenaries. With each of them being so powerful, they\u2019re highly mobile, and they have the strength to resist the invaders if they encountered them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMakes sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Dimensional Mercenaries, they were most likely used to missions like this. It was the same for me. As long as I didn\u2019t meet the world\u2019s enemy, I had the confidence to come out unscathed no matter how many enemies I faced.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe managed to contact an administrative guild, and we even received a magical tool to help locate the Hero. That\u2019s the paper you have, Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard. This paper apparently tells me where the Hero is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe problem is that the Hero\u2019s signal is coming from multiple places.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 I thought of a certain ninja\u2019s Shadow Clone Technique, but I stayed quiet. If I said anything, it would end with me being hit.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe think it has to do with the explorers\u2019 power being suppressed in their territory. After all, the administrative guild is part of the dungeon. Still, we couldn\u2019t just disregard it. The only choice we had was searching all the areas pointed out by the magical tool.\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what area am I in charge of?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, Shin. It\u2019ll be slightly dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it wouldn\u2019t be. Just tell me, where is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fighting the world\u2019s enemy was also in my consideration. The words \u2018slightly dangerous\u2019 didn\u2019t bother me at all. Did Ellos know about this? He nodded and pointed at the map. It was a large mountain big enough to appear on the continental map.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeruta Mountain Range. It\u2019s the most dangerous mountain range in the continent and a place with the highest density of mana in the continent. That\u2019s where we\u2019re going.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

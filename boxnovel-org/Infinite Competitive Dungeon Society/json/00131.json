Team Revival (5)</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for the help, but we could have killed it too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya responded with a snort, and the young man made an exclamation of surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya Mastiford, Britain\u2019s SS ranker! I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be here! Nice to meet you. I\u2019m America\u2019s SS ranker, Leon Pepper!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya became flustered at his overly high-tension greeting and nodded her head. I messaged her.</p><br/><p>[Do you know about America\u2019s SS ranker?]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ve heard rumors. I know America\u2019s SS ranker is African-American.]</p><br/><p>After answering me, Hwaya greeted Leon Pepper.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s continue on the ground later. We\u2019re in the middle of our enemies\u2019 territory right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! Alright, then we\u2019ll have to take care of them quickly! See you in a bit!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed he was piloting the helicopter himself. The helicopter turned around and flew away. It met a wyvern not long after, and promptly obliterated it with its machine gun. It was truly mesmerizing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s his ability. Object Control, I think it was.\u201d</p><br/><p>As long as his ability could reach it, he could freely control any object. The SS ranker we met truly had a powerful ability. Unfortunately, as the range of his ability was for now limited to small vehicles, guns, and things like bazookas. Even so, it was an incredible ability. The most important thing was that he could empower objects under his control with mana, giving them destructive force that could pierce through usually impenetrable barriers.</p><br/><p>A cheat, so to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, that\u2019s cool\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Shin\u2019s cooler!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, his weapon is too simple and not sophisticated at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Two of them comforted me, but it only made my sense of competition rise.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s do this. Let\u2019s starting hunting the wyverns! Let\u2019s show them Team Revival will not lose to anyone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOoooh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGeez, men are all kids\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Unlike Ye-eun and Ludia\u2019s eager response, Hwaya\u2019s cold gaze made me a bit embarrassed. In any case, we then started our wyvern hunt.</p><br/><p>To be honest, our party was very, very outstanding. Even without me, who could hunt wyverns alone by flying, Hwaya was a long-range attacker with great firepower, Ludia had an overwhelming defensive and healing capability after obtaining the earth\u2019s power to strengthen her holy magic, and Ye-Eun was a powerful close-range attacker. Ye-Eun could easily jump on approaching wyverns, take its neck, and jump back to the helicopter. Her agile movements almost resembled a spider\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Until lunch time, we continued hunting wyverns on the helicopter. The pilot foamed at my order to charge at any wyverns he saw, but after the first couple times, he seemed to have liked the taste of it, as he ran to any wyverns he saw without even asking us. In the end, we ended up hunting about a hundred wyverns in a few hours.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>When we got down for a lunch break, Leon Pepper was waiting for us.</p><br/><p>\u201cTruly amazing! Is everyone a SS ranker?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, not. Not officially, at least.\u201d</p><br/><p>I retorted mischievously with a smile. Pepper smiled back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith you guys, this tedious subjugation mission might finally end. I got a report that wyverns that left Antelope Canyon are returning too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause we killed so many of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! After all, you guys are killing ten wyverns for every wyvern other people kill. Thanks for coming to America, Thunder Knight, Flame Witch, and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia dodged Pepper\u2019s eyes and hid behind my back. It was the same for Ye-Eun. With a bitter smile, I told Pepper, \u201cThey\u2019re shy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, two girls. How talented, Thunder Knight. Alright, I can always greet them later! I told you before, but we should go out for a drink tonight. How about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he asked, Hwaya immediately messaged me.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s okay, right? It\u2019s our chance to become friends with a foreign country\u2019s SS ranker.]</p><br/><p>[Of course, it\u2019s okay.]</p><br/><p>When I answered, Hwaya looked at Leon Pepper and responded as she nodded her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure. We can leave behind the kids who can\u2019t drink, and go out with just us three.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a kid!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can drink too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Rather than denying Hwaya\u2019s words, you should realize you guys look like kids\u2026 Before Hwaya gets hooked on it at least.\u2019 I sighed and calmed them down.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know how other ability users would react when they heard this, but I thought hunting the wyverns at the Antelope Canyon was enjoyable. No wyverns could even touch our party, and the money we got from selling them was enormous even if it were split among the four of us. Competing with Leon Pepper was fun too. Other than the gazes of envy and jealousy we were getting, there was no problem.</p><br/><p>However, like Leon Pepper said when we first met, the number of wyverns in the canyon was increasing day by day. Wyverns that had escaped from their nest were all returning. Perhaps because they knew they would be in danger if this place was subjugated, they were attacking more actively.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a good sign.\u201d</p><br/><p>Spinning the pistol he always carried around with his finger, Pepper muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt means we\u2019ll run into their boss soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss\u2026 I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWant to bet who\u2019s going to kill it, T.K.?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you, don\u2019t call me T.K\u2026 But sure, let\u2019s bet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the boss of a S rank Field Dungeon. Graveyard Over the Lake was dangerous, so be more careful this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Pepper and I half-jokingly discussed on betting, Hwaya commented with a tired voice. Of course, I didn\u2019t forget about what happened at Windermere. Hwaya was especially surprised at the time and had worried about me. I didn\u2019t think Pepper would punch me to the boss\u2019 mouth, but it seemed Hwaya was worried about the boss fight in general. However, my companions and I were all too strong to be afraid of a S rank Field Dungeon boss. Although I shouldn\u2019t let my guard down, it wouldn\u2019t be good to be too conservative.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Hwaya. We have reliable companions this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you implying I wasn\u2019t reliable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re included, obviously, but you couldn\u2019t intervene last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve only gotten good at speaking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya pouted and tilted her glass of alcohol. Ever since the first time we drank with Pepper, Hwaya and I often sneaked out after Ludia and Ye-Eun fell asleep to drink with Pepper. Though, it was more that Pepper joined in when we were drinking with just the two of us.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you guys dating?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pepper asked out of the blue. While I opened my eyes widely in surprise, he added.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you were dating that blonde lady, but you looked rather uninterested. In that case, the Flame Witch was the next best candidate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, I\u2019m friends with that blonde lady you\u2019re talking about. She\u2019s just overly reliant on me.\u201d</p><br/><p>I\u2019d have to make her stop clinging to me one day. Though, that would be hard now.</p><br/><p>After my retort, Hwaya added.</p><br/><p>\u201cT.K. and I are friends for now too. I don\u2019t know what the future has in store for us though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pepper burst into laughter, and I stared at Hwaya\u2019s strange response. However, Hwaya simply shrugged and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that how man-and-woman relationships are? You\u2019re a good guy, and you\u2019re not dating anyone right now. I just happen to be an extremely good girl, and I\u2019m also single. So if I suddenly jump at you out of the blue, you can\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think something\u2019s wrong with your logic, but I\u2019ll try to avoid being alone with you for now. I\u2019m planning on enjoying my dates with monsters for a while more, so I have no plans on getting a girlfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha! You guys are too funny!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pepper clapped his hands as he laughed. However, I couldn\u2019t laugh along with him. It didn\u2019t look like Hwaya was joking at all. For now, I refused her jokingly.</p><br/><p>I would have thought, \u2018Why would Hwaya like me!?\u2019 but I had already precedent with Loretta and Ye-Eun. Agh, damn, this was all because I was a Hero! Definitely! Maybe, monsters running rampant, global warming getting worse, wars continuing to rage across the globe, and lands cracking from droughts were all because I was a Hero!</p><br/><p>A week after we came to Arizona, the wyverns had suddenly gotten stronger.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019ve seen this phenomenon before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, what a coincidence. Same here.\u201d</p><br/><p>After returning to the helicopter using ice steps, I thought about the wyverns I just killed. Wyverns used to die from a single Thunder Tempest, but now it took two or three of them to barely kill a wyvern. I murmured after drawing my breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut still, they got too strong. They used to not be able to withstand your fire for long, Hwaya.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that the stronger monsters get, the stronger the boss is. Ye-Eun, maybe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fight the boss?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun was exactly at the level of wyverns. Although she could manage to kill the strengthened wyverns, if the boss was stronger than we thought, we would need to pull her back from battle for her safety. We were here to hunt wyverns safely, not to risk our lives.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I want to help Shin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for the sentiment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-Then will you give me a kiss?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was too fast\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The tension was high in the entire Antelope Canyon. Then, one ability user fought against a wyvern without properly assessing its strength, and died. Of course, as there was no one below S rank in this canyon, the one who died was also an S ranker. The canyon\u2019s atmosphere became darker. Pepper couldn\u2019t just laugh and enjoy either.</p><br/><p>Two days after the casualty appeared, a heavy rain poured down. As we couldn\u2019t stop just because of a rain, we got on our attack helicopter, which was completely fine under rain, and set out to hunt wyverns. Ludia had been feeling uneasy the entire day, and after the helicopter took off, she pulled on my sleeve and murmured.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, I\u2019m feeling strangely uneasy.\u201d</p><br/><p>In truth, it was the perfect atmosphere to feel uneasy. Someone had died, wyverns had gotten stronger, and a heavy rain was pouring down today, so much so that it was hard to see in front of us.</p><br/><p>I responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, the boss is going to appear for sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does that mean!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean what does that mean? Can\u2019t you see the powerful mana raging in the distance?\u201d</p><br/><p>Not long after I said that, the pilot screamed. From deep inside the canyon, a dragon-like wyvern twice as large as other wyverns came out. As I thought, it appeared today!</p><br/><p>Then, Ye-Eun, who was likely also sensing the boss, suddenly raised her head.</p><br/><p>[Shin, it\u2019s strange.]</p><br/><p>[What\u2019s strange?]</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t know how to describe it\u2026 But there\u2019s something more.]</p><br/><p>I frowned at her words. It was then that a giant dragon suddenly appeared in the air.</p><br/><p>[An Event Raid has broken out! SS+ rank 100-man, \u2018Flame Drake.\u2019 Because you were at the location of the raid boss, you will be forced to participate!]</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note: N/A</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>This was a little unclear (even in the next chapter), but the \u201cdragon-like wyvern\u201d and the \u201cgiant dragon\u201d are two different beings.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

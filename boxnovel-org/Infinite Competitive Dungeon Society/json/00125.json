You in the World of Sunset (3)</p><br/><p>The next morning, I woke up in the temporary bed I installed next to my bed. Because Ludia wanted to be with me even while sleeping, I had no choice but to install this temporary bed. Plus, because I only needed to sleep two to three hours, I gave Ludia my bed and slept in the temporary bed.</p><br/><p>In any case, because I wanted to sleep for a while longer, I closed my eyes again, but soon reopened my eyes from the slight tingle I felt in my hand. At the same time, I realized what had woke me up. I was holding hands with Ludia, who had stretched her hand out of the bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, you\u2019re up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Un.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, you can change first. I\u2019ll turn around and\u2026 Hm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia peeked her head out of the blanket. When her eyes met mine, her face suddenly reddened as she went back into the blanket. Even so, she didn\u2019t let go of my hand. What was happening?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Ludia?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNoth\u2026. Nothing\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me. I\u2019m worried. Come on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing\u2026 I only just realized that I was the worst piece of human trash\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>What the hell happened last night!?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not \u2018nothing\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cL-Leave. I can\u2019t think straight if I\u2019m with you right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll leave\u2026 but you have to let go of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>I took my hand out forcefully from Ludia\u2019s grasp. This girl, when did she get so strong?</p><br/><p>But after grasping empty air, Ludia\u2019s hand once again took hold of mine. Instead of letting go, she even pulled strongly, and I almost fell into the blanket with her. I held on since I was stronger than a priestess, but I pulled the blanket down and looked at Ludia\u2019s reddened face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, stay with me. I\u2019m sorry. Please stay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, I had to stay within an arm\u2019s reach of Ludia. With my head turned the other direction, Ludia changed. I thought I\u2019d die from embarrassment.</p><br/><p>Ludia was wearing a white dress. Although the ribbon decoration or the dress\u2019 material changed from time to time, she always wore white dresses when she was in my house. Drawing my attention with her white and smooth legs showing under her dress, she casually said something completely shocking.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I just awakened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Was awakening something that only happened to people from Earth!? People from other worlds could do it too!? While I was staring at her blankly in shock, Ludia stared at me with a pleased smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow ugly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, you\u2019re really ugly\u2026 Come closer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow ugly I am doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is your abili\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stayed still, but the floor wriggled and I was moved in front of her. I was shocked once again. What \u2018Earth\u2019? This was the 2nd floor! Shocking things were happening ever since I woke up.</p><br/><p>Ludia reached out and caressed my face. With her hand feeling my defenseless face, I felt quite strange. I tried my best to not bite her fingers and opened my mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, is that your awakened ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. I can control the earth and utilize its power. It\u2019s an ability based on animism. Perhaps it\u2019s better to say it\u2019s based on belief of nature.\u201d</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t lying. Even though I wasn\u2019t on guard, I didn\u2019t notice her moving me at all. Perhaps, her awakened ability was stronger than her healing ability as a priestess.</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. If I had this power when I was in Luka continent\u2026 No, there\u2019s no use in thinking that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d awaken an ability in Earth either. By the way, are you going to continue touching me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn my dream\u2026 I met many people I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen are you going to stop tou\u2026 Dream?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia easily ignored my question and said in a slightly sleepy voice. Dream? Ah, the premonition dream. The dream that acted as the trigger to awakening abilities and showing one\u2019s future possibilities\u2026 Of course, with what happened in Luka continent, I confirmed that it wasn\u2019t absolute, but it was true that something similar would happen. I became curious as to what dream she had.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas I in that dream too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn, you were. That\u2019s why it\u2019s hard to control myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does me being in your dream and you controlling yourself have to\u2026 Wait, you said control?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. Can you\u2026 bend down a bit more?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, your breathing is a bit rough. Are you sick?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feeling a sense of unease, I put my hand up to take Ludia\u2019s hand off. At that moment, the door opened. Mother, who was standing there, spoke with a bright smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, it\u2019s great to be so healthy early in the morning, but can you wait until the night for reproductive acts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!? What reproductive act!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNew daughter, I\u2019ll actively create the right mood at night, so do your best then. Alright, come down and eat breakfast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yes, mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNew daughter!? Why is Mom calling Ludia \u2018new daughter\u2019? Ludia, do you even know what that means? Hm?\u201d</p><br/><p>I, Kang Shin, a man among men, almost became a married man at the age of 21.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, see you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince-nim, see you later!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Ludia. Miss Shuna too, see you both later\u2026 I said, see you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In Marianne\u2019s Garden, which had become a guild house, I saw Ludia and Shuna off. Ludia found it hard to separate from me, as she would come clinging after taking a few steps away from me and being startled. After she repeated it a few times, I couldn\u2019t just let it continue. I took Ludia off and gave her to Shuna.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Shuna, take care of her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yes! Crown Prince-nim, by the way\u2026 Are you dating Ludia\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re just friends\u2026 Ow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u201d</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, Ludia succeeded in getting away from me! Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t know exactly why she succeeded.</p><br/><p>Shuna put on a bitter smile while watching us, but clenched her fists and spoke happily.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I still have a chance\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShuna, let\u2019s go\u2026 forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyak! L-Ludia! No, sorry, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Watching them talking loudly, I saw them off to the dungeon. It looked like Ludia was beating Shuna, but trusting that it was simply an expression of affection, I also headed to the dungeon.</p><br/><p>Time passed slowly when you were bored. After sending Ludia off to the dungeon, all I had to do was to hunt Wendigo three times and train my techniques. Although I knew how important it was, with how boring and unthrilling it was, I felt like I was forcing myself to do so.</p><br/><p>If there was one positive side, it was that I was confident that I had caught up to the Spear Technique and Peruta Circut that I had forcefully leveled up. I considered using skill points to level them up again, but since I couldn\u2019t be sure that I could always get more skill points, I decided to save them for when the two skills were higher leveled.</p><br/><p>[Climbing the dungeon alone is getting boring.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? That\u2019s unexpected. I didn\u2019t think that you\u2019d like being in a party so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Running across Wendigo\u2019s arm, I replied to the message I received.</p><br/><p>[I want to quickly party with Shin. Plus, you don\u2019t come to school nowadays.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but I prioritize solo play.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason I didn\u2019t go to school nowadays was because it was hard to separate from Ludia.</p><br/><p>[I know it\u2019s because you\u2019re embarrassed.]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Replying sincerely, I stabbed Wendigo\u2019s eye and released a lightning attack. I leapt up, avoiding the screaming Wendigo\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat floor are you on now?\u201d</p><br/><p>[40th floor. The reaper killed me twice.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d pass that easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ugh, the first time, it suddenly appeared behind my back and killed me. The second time, I was doing my best to memorize its movement patterns, but it suddenly shot a scythe from its stomach and killed me. When Master finds out I died, I\u2019ll get scolded\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you how the strategy for defeating the reaper?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m not a monster like Shin!]</p><br/><p>It seems the 40th Floor Master couldn\u2019t be defeated easily with just her natural talent and magic. It made sense as the Grim Reaper was one of the strongest bosses. Once she defeated him, she should have no problem until the 50th floor. Plus, she could get even stronger from the 50th floor.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Of course, that was given that Ye-Eun could somehow deal with the freezing energy. While pondering about it, I dodged Wendigo\u2019s whitened hands and landed on his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cSome of my friends are about to reach the 40th floor. Why don\u2019t you try hunting the reaper with them?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Friends? Sure! Shin\u2019s friends must all be nice, right?]</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, well, yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was good timing. Even though Ludia got stronger with her newly awakened ability, adding a powerful damage dealer like Ye-Eun to her party would be like adding flowers to embroidery.</p><br/><p>[Hehe, I want to meet them soon. D-Don\u2019t worry! I just mean I\u2019m looking forward to seeing them as comrades. I don\u2019t mean I\u2019m looking forward to meeting other men!]</p><br/><p>\u201cOne of them is the older sister of your old party leader. She\u2019s called Palludia. If possible, try not to bring up her younger sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 A girl?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, yeah, that\u2019s what sister means.\u201d</p><br/><p>I delivered a Heroic Strike to Wendigo\u2019s forehead. Ignoring the Wendigo trying to shake me off, I used White Lightning Consecutive Strike.</p><br/><p>[A friend\u2026 but a girl? A girlfriend?]</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just a friend. Like you and me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I hate you, Shin.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIn any case, treat her well, okay? She lost her younger sister not too long ago\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yeah, okay.]</p><br/><p>After talking with Ye-Eun, I finished up my fight with Wendigo. Lost her younger sister, huh\u2026 Coming from the one who killed her, I felt nauseous. Even though Shina tried to kill me first, even though she betrayed her world to join the Demon Lord, she was once my friend and was Ludia\u2019s younger sister. It didn\u2019t change the fact that I killed her.</p><br/><p>[Choose your reward.]</p><br/><p>[1. Wendigo\u2019s Fur Boots</p><br/><p>2. Frozen Crystal]</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, I need to let it go too\u2026 *crunch*.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You consumed Frozen Crystal to its limit, greatly increasing your resistance and affinity to freezing energy! Your magic increases by 6! Consuming more of this item will likely have no effect.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>I suddenly realized that a month had passed since I started grinding the Wendigo!</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>PS \u2013 \u2018I\u2019m a person of this world now\u2019 is the hint from 2 chapters ago.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>That\u2019s\u2026 a weak hint.</p><br/><p>EDIT: He's 21, not 26. I don't know how I misread that... It's been fixed!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The Clash Approaches (3)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>After taking care of the bear, we collected its corpse and climbed up the mountain. As no other monsters stood a chance against us, we smoothly finished Alaska in a day.</p><br/><p>I was curious about the energy that ignored the dungeon\u2019s power, but there wasn\u2019t anything in Alaska. I had to suspect that there might be something in Canada or America. Of course, it was entirely possible that Alaska was just a decoy with the real thing being in Greenland.</p><br/><p>It felt like a waste to just leave Alaska, so we spent the night camping out and enjoying the scenery. As promised, I cut off some of the grizzly bear monster\u2019s paw and cooked it for everyone to taste.</p><br/><p>[Kuuuuu.]</p><br/><p>[Kyuu? Kyuu kyuu?]</p><br/><p>It seemed Laki and Luna could communicate, as despite being an undead, Laki had intelligence. While Laki talked to Luna like an elder giving valuable advice, Luna listened in closely. Daisy and Yua watched their undead and tamed beast communicate with interest.</p><br/><p>I, on the other hand, sat on the side and started maintenance on my spear. Since I didn\u2019t know what I\u2019d have to face, I figured I should have my weapon in top condition.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone suddenly called me carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cYe-Eun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I sit next to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stuck my spear into the ground and poured in mana. The ground near the spear rose up slightly, and Dortu coated it with metal to create a simple chair. Finally, Sharana then blew wind to heat up the metal. Ye-Eun sat down on it with surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, it\u2019s warm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the power of elementals.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish I had an elemental too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm\u2026 You have to be born like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied as I scratched my head. Although Ciara gave me the ability to wield elementals, she couldn\u2019t just give it to anyone she wanted. It was possible only because I had the talent. As this talent was extremely rare, not everyone could become an Elementalist just because they wanted.</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun lightly clicked her tongue, let out a dry cough, and spoke carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, sorry. I wasn\u2019t really helpful today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you protected Daisy and Yua.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut my dream was to fight alongside Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe day will come soon. You have the talent and your growth speed is shocking. I don\u2019t know why but everyone in Revival is more or less a genius.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t need to explain for Hwaya, and there were two others with terrifying growth speed. One was Sumire, who might be even more talented than me in spearmanship, and the other was Ye-Eun, who was breezing through the dungeon purely with her talent.</p><br/><p>\u201cUuu, still, I was too pathetic today\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun looked down. She buried her face in her knees and though I felt sorry to say this, Ye-Eun was cute when she was down. I lightly stroked Ye-Eun\u2019s hair. Immediately, she pushed her head towards me. Of course, with her face still buried in her knees.</p><br/><p>\u201cPet my head more, please.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with that request.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It feels like my soul is being healed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat much!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I planned to continue until she told me to stop, but because she didn\u2019t say anything for a long time, I took my hand off myself. Ye-Eun then spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI waited because Shin told me to wait\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>When did I tell her to wait? For what? I tilted my head. Just when I was about to say something, Ye-Eun spoke in a faint voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore I noticed, Shin\u2019s dating another girl\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>So that\u2019s what she meant! I made a bitter smile. The topic matched what I wanted to talk to her about.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember what I told you, Ye-Eun? I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault for not being able to give up. You\u2019re right, Shin. You already told me everything, so you don\u2019t need to feel guilty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Contrary to what she was saying, her voice was full of regret. I stole a glance at Yua and Daisy. Their attention seemed to be on Laki and Luna, but I created a barrier of wind around us just in case they could hear us.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, about that\u2026 I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have the time for relationships, but\u2026 It wasn\u2019t something I could really control. Sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>If I were Ye-Eun, I would have hit me.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, can I ask you something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not dating just one person, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected of an assassin, she goes right for the throat! I sweated as I replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo they both know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 There might not be just two.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at the mountain far away. Ye-Eun coughed incontrollably.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou playboy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis was the only choice I had. I\u2019ve gotten too close to them, and I have to keep seeing them. What would you have done if you were in my shoes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Right, Shin\u2019s the world\u2019s hero. Not just Earth\u2019s, but other worlds\u2019 too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even with a bitter smile, Ye-Eun finally nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. You\u2019ve built bonds I can\u2019t even dream of with those people. Bonds that are too deep for me to talk about and too strong to be cut.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t know things would turn out this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, you don\u2019t have to feel sorry. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun raised her head. I thought she was crying, but she wasn\u2019t. Her eyes were shining with a light I\u2019d never seen before. Feeling the energy squirming inside her, I flinched.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one at fault for not being able to give up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Even if there are more than three?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn.\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t help but think of Ye-Eun as peculiar.</p><br/><p>\u201cI might not look like it, but I\u2019m very tenacious. You know why I\u2019m in Revival, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun was in Revival because of her feelings for me. That was how it began, and it was probably still the same. Although it would be troubling if she said she\u2019d leave now, once the danger Earth was facing was taken care of, things would be different.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you before, right? That thing wouldn\u2019t just end with Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 You also said not everyone has to follow you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Earth\u2019s problem was ours to solve. But that didn\u2019t mean they had to care about other worlds too.</p><br/><p>Because of the promises I made to my allies, my personal goal, the invaders\u2019 and dungeon\u2019s secret, I planned to continue saving other worlds, but that didn\u2019t mean everyone had to follow me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to follow you until the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYe-Eun, you\u2019re twenty-two. There are other things you can do than risking your life to fight worlds\u2019 enemies. Think about it more carefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, you\u2019re also twenty-two.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that she mentioned it\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, I don\u2019t think things will end just by killing this Demon Lord and the other world\u2019s enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It will. On Earth, at least.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to trick me, Shin\u2026 You know something, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>I flinched. Ye-Eun smiled and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m always watching Shin, so I know at least that much. Plus, I\u2019m probably not the only one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, can I continue staying by your side?\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t need to explain about Daisy and Loretta, and Ludia and Hwaya didn\u2019t live ordinary lives either. Ludia experienced many things as an empire\u2019s princess, and Hwaya learned magic from a young age, fighting monsters even before we met. Their values were different than ordinary people\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, they couldn\u2019t like seeing their man being chased by other women. No, perhaps they still didn\u2019t like that but were enduring it. \u2026 They were enduring it, right?</p><br/><p>In any case, Ye-Eun was different. She\u2019s an ordinary Korean girl who suddenly awakened as an ability user.</p><br/><p>Despite that, she had to take on the weight of Revival\u2019s mission and was currently asking to follow me fully knowing the truth behind Earth\u2019s danger. I could simplify everything by calling her foolish, but I knew that wasn\u2019t it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, I think Shin won\u2019t accept me otherwise.\u201d</p><br/><p>She really was honest.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to go through all that trouble just for a man? Even though you don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ll have to wait?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are other fish in the sea, Ye-Eun. Guys that are a lot better than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s only one Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun\u2019s eyes were serious, so I decided to be the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, I still only think of you as a friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hold on, let me go cry in a corner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun was KO\u2019ed in one blow. I stopped Ye-Eun from getting up and sat her back down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you still stay in Revival?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Un, I can\u2019t give up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019ve only known me for a year and a half, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feelings came and went. I couldn\u2019t recommend her to stay in Revival just for me. There had to be some other reason. Otherwise, she would only suffer.</p><br/><p>However, Ye-Eun\u2019s answer was something to behold.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can a love end when it\u2019s hasn\u2019t begun? Also, how can I worry about it ending when it never began? How is anyone going to do anything if they\u2019re afraid of it ending?\u201d</p><br/><p>This is why someone with no relationship experience should say anything. I made a self-mocking smile and hit my head. Then, I looked at Ye-Eun.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 Let\u2019s just wait and see how it goes. We might not know when it\u2019ll end, but that also means we don\u2019t know when it\u2019ll begin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Romantic words don\u2019t fit you, Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun finally smiled. I got up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s try closing the distance between us first, Ye-Eun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cC-Closing the d-distance!? O-Okay, take good care of me please\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I ignored Ye-Eun\u2019s joke and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you remember what I told you before? About compressing your energy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that invisible aura, right? I tried it once when I was resting, but it\u2019s way too difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can do it. Maybe not as well as me, but you can still get stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun was an assassin, someone whose attacks had to be more lethal than anyone else. She learned a special ability to control her shadow from Duca. Once she learned how to compress her aura, I had confidence she would come up with an awesome skill I couldn\u2019t even imagine.</p><br/><p>I took out my spear. An enormous amount of aura began to be concentrated in it, and Ye-Eun gulped when she saw it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have time. Until you can do this with your dagger, I\u2019ll teach you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was already teaching Sumire. Adding Ye-Eun wouldn\u2019t make a difference. With their talent almost being equal, I knew they could do it. Plus, aura compression wasn\u2019t a matter of weapons but a matter of mana. The fact that Ye-Eun used daggers wouldn\u2019t change anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it! Please take good care of me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know what she was so happy about, but she nodded her head vehemently and shouted. Her innocent outer appearance sometimes made people forget, but given the chance, she was a battle maniac on par with Duca. She didn\u2019t have a chance to shine because the enemies we fought were too strong, but as she continued to grow by climbing the dungeon and building up achievements, she would start to change.</p><br/><p>Extremely so.</p><br/><p>Just like that, Ye-Eun started to learn about mana from me. Of course, with Daisy and Yua interrupting us in the middle childishly, we couldn\u2019t get too far that day.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

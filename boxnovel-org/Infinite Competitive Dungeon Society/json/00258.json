Above the Frozen Land (9)</p><br/><p>Lespina had violet hair, light-blue skin, and frightening white irises. Setting these aside, she could be called a beauty by human standard. However, her racial characteristics stood out too much and made her look like a monster than a woman.</p><br/><p>When I pointed my spear towards her, she suddenly started a conversation.</p><br/><p>[Hero, answer me. You\u2019ve been to the Luka continent, haven\u2019t you?]</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>I ignored her and charged forward. After quickly shooting the aura remaining at my spear tip, I gathered nearby elementals and lengthened my spear blade.</p><br/><p>\u201cElemental Blade!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hic, I hate myself for riding this again.]</p><br/><p>[Why are you crying? It\u2019s a fun joy ride!]</p><br/><p>[Roller coaster!]</p><br/><p>[I told you, your skills won\u2019t work against me!]</p><br/><p>It seemed she wasn\u2019t limited to using her power as she held up her sword against me. Although the blade made from Elemental Blade got shorter, I continued to charge towards her. When I used it, I had already assumed she would cancel it. Finding out that her power couldn\u2019t completely cancel my skills was an unexpected benefit.</p><br/><p>Lespina seemed to know that too, as she bit her lips and pointed her sword towards me. If this was all there was to her power, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to use a piece of Antarctica as a vehicle.</p><br/><p>[You won\u2019t even have time to feel pain!]</p><br/><p>A white aura erupted from her body. In an instant, I was surrounded by an incredible freezing energy. It was hard to resist it even with Ruyue\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ve been waiting.]</p><br/><p>Ruyue seemed to be feeling our opponent\u2019s power as she immediately infused herself into my armor at my call. I then infused Sharana into my spear.</p><br/><p>[What about me, Master?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou come inside my body, Peika.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Got it!]</p><br/><p>When I used the three elemental simultaneously as Spirit Auras, a huge amount of mana was consumed. With the mana I poured into Wind King\u2019s Rage earlier, I had to draw Peruta Circuit to its limit to keep up with the amount I spent.</p><br/><p>Of course, with my boundless mana numbering 200,000 MP, I didn\u2019t really worry no matter how much mana I used. As long as I had my mana potions, that is! While she looked at me with a shocked face, I took out about ten of the highest grade mana potions, putting one in my mouth and putting the rest between my belt. It was preparation in case she could seal my inventory like worlds\u2019 enemies.</p><br/><p>Well, I suspected she couldn\u2019t. To confirm my suspicion, I held up my spear again.</p><br/><p>[Elementals\u2026 As I thought, you are\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cHuaaaap! Whirlpool of chaos!\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t use Peika\u2019s energy, but rather ignited chaos flames and strengthened it with Mad Typhoon. When Sharana\u2019s power was added and a whirlpool of white flames surged, she shouted once again. This time, with a hand gesture.</p><br/><p>[I already said it\u2019s useless!]</p><br/><p>Feeling the energy sweeping over me, I nodded. I could somewhat feel the extent of its power. Although it couldn\u2019t harm me directly, this power had the ability to drive away the power that wasn\u2019t mine.</p><br/><p>Rather than a curse, this power was more similar to a blessing. I deduced that it was the ability to turn all things into its pure state. In that case, I could see how she destroyed the Event Dungeons, as Event Dungeons were artificial prisons created by the Dungeon Lord, Sherafina, over the pathways broken through by demons.</p><br/><p>Likewise, the power possessed by explorers didn\u2019t belong to them. It was a power refined by the dungeon so that explorers could more easily wield it. Through the dungeon\u2019s power, it was forcefully made to fit explorers\u2019 bodies. It was still a genuine power, but it was still not a power purely honed by its user. I recently began to break out of this fence, so I realized what her power was doing.</p><br/><p>However, this flame, the chaos flame\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cEven a fistful of this flame will hurt a lot!\u201d</p><br/><p>[If you can burn me with that puny flame, try it!]</p><br/><p>The whirlpool of flames surrounding my spear was far smaller than it was initially. Lotte and I charged towards Lespina with no hesitation, and Lespina swung her sword filled with freezing energy.</p><br/><p>[Freeze!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHa!\u201d</p><br/><p>I snorted and received her sword with my spear. In an instant, a terrifying amount of steam rose up.</p><br/><p>[I can see why you\u2019re arrogant! But your flame still won\u2019t work against me!]</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see if you can!\u201d</p><br/><p>When her sword blocked my spear, I pulled back immediately and attacked her shoulders. Retrieving my spear and quickly attacking again was something I\u2019ve been doing before I ever entered the dungeon. At my current level, my quick stab didn\u2019t allow her to defend.</p><br/><p>[As if that\u2019ll work!]</p><br/><p>However, just before my spear pierced her shoulder, ice shot up from her shoulder and blocked it. Wrapped in chaos flames, my spear clashed with her ice, with only foggy steam being the result.</p><br/><p>[This is all you can do as a Hero!? That\u2019s why you ran when you faced His Highness Demon Lord! I\u2019ll freeze you and offer you to His Highness!]</p><br/><p>\u201cFrozen meat doesn\u2019t taste good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I rebutted nonchalantly, her freezing energy was truly terrifying! Its power was easy to see. After all, it was what froze an entire continent! The moment Ruyue left my armor, it might be able to freeze me in an instant.</p><br/><p>I vehemently thrusted my spear and stopped her sword in its tracks. Steam continually rose and surrounded us, but neither Lespina nor I were rookies who would have our visions hindered by mere steam. At some point, Lespina seemed to have noticed that she wasn\u2019t in her usual condition.</p><br/><p>[You, you have Evil Eyes!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWere you so slow that you just noticed?\u201d</p><br/><p>[You think Evil Eyes of that caliber can slow me? Looks like you got your position as a Hero through a talking contest!]</p><br/><p>Lespina\u2019s movements suddenly became stronger. She injected a large amount of freezing energy into her sword and smacked away my spear. Then, she leaped up by kicking off the air. I encouraged Lotte to not give her any time to prepare her skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cLotte, charge as quickly as you can!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Understood, Hero!]</p><br/><p>I immediately activated Divine Speed and lowered my upper body. Lotte immediately radiated a dazzling golden light and accelerated towards Lespina!</p><br/><p>As a Blaze Queen, Lotte had a close affinity to light and flame. It wouldn\u2019t be an overstatement to say that she was the mixture of light and flame given form. If flame was the symbol of destruction, then the light was the symbol of incredible speed! Her instant acceleration was just as quick as my Divine Speed skill. The day the Lava King became Laki, her technique that pierced through the Lava King was also the result of this aspect of hers. As such, the moment Lespina shot up, we were soon catching up with her.</p><br/><p>[Kuk!]</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u201d</p><br/><p>With chaos flames and the mass acceleration from Lotte\u2019s charge, the Chaotic Spear carried a terrifying power as it shot towards Lespina. It seemed she didn\u2019t expect that I\u2019d chase after her so quickly. Unfortunately, her magic didn\u2019t seem to require a long cast time.</p><br/><p>[Shin!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>My spear stopped in its path. It was only a span of a hand away from Lespina. Could she have been quicker than me? No, that\u2019s impossible. It was just that Lotte and I had been frozen.</p><br/><p>I realized now that the crystals of ice left in Lespina\u2019s path had swarmed towards us and restrained us. Although they were carrying a terrifying energy, they had hidden it while I was charging forward and had suddenly released it when enough crystals gathered.</p><br/><p>[Huhu, that\u2019s right!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[The air is strange! The air in this area must freeze whatever is in it!]</p><br/><p>Ruyue screamed and radiated a large amount of light. Lotte also released terrifying flames she normally kept stored in her body and melted the ice covering us. Although we succeeded in defrosting ourselves before we were attacked\u2026 We had to accept that she pulled one over us. To think she\u2019d leave a hidden magic in the air knowing that we\u2019d chase after her!</p><br/><p>[You can die now!]</p><br/><p>\u201cAs if I\u2019ll get hit by that a second time!\u201d</p><br/><p>A white light shot out from her body. I immediately used Ruyue\u2019s power and created a large ice barrier around us.</p><br/><p>[Lotte, push through! The ice barrier will block her ice!]</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaang!]</p><br/><p>Lotte seemed unhappy that she, a Blaze Queen, had been frozen even for a moment, as she let out a long howl and rushed forward. Before I noticed it, the ice barrier created by Ruyue\u2019s power was cut in half by Lespina\u2019s sword, and my spear barely stopped her sword in time.</p><br/><p>[Kuk, all you have is brute force!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHuaaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t let her fall back. I frantically pushed closer towards her. By continuously using Divine Speed, I attacked with my spear at a speed she couldn\u2019t keep up. However, just like before, ice armor appeared just when my spear was about to reach her, protecting her.</p><br/><p>To prevent my spear from losing speed due to ice, I endlessly poured mana into Chaotic Spear. However, none of my attacks had a great effect. Even though I had far surpassed her reaction speed, she just had too much mana in her body!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow old are you? When were you born?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I was strong from the moment I was born! I could be born because of His Highness\u2019 overwhelming power! My birth became the starting signal for His Highness Demon Lord\u2019s plan to conquer all worlds, and his plan will succeed! Hero, killing you and taking your world\u2019s power will be the first step to that goal!]</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t just stand around and get hit by my spear. Though slower, she also attacked with her sword. I blocked her attack with Ruyue\u2019s power covering my armor, but I couldn\u2019t stop damage from building up. Although I fiercely thrust my spear towards her chest and used Lightning Spear Storm, the skill wasn\u2019t activated properly, as expected. This ability of hers was truly irritating.</p><br/><p>She endlessly poured her unique energy towards me and spoke.</p><br/><p>[Huhu, it\u2019s getting harder and harder to use the dungeon\u2019s power, right? This power was given to me to destroy you, Hero, and all those related to the dungeon!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to die here, so dream on!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m going to die here? \u2026 You\u2019ll be the one who will die, Hero!]</p><br/><p>At the same time that she shouted and slashed down with her sword, the mana inside her exploded fiercely. A truly absolute freezing energy!</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, Sharana!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m already ready!]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll empower Ruyue!]</p><br/><p>In an instant, a barrier was created around Lotte and me. However, it wasn\u2019t enough to block her attack. The barrier was slowly broken, and Lotte spoke out in anger.</p><br/><p>[A mere demon dares to attack Hero and me! Kuaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>Lotte breathed out flames that looked like light! Lespina\u2019s freezing energy, which had penetrated Ruyue and Sharana\u2019s barrier, clashed with Lotte\u2019s dazzling breath. At that moment, someone approached me from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help Daddy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIna!\u201d</p><br/><p>In this potentially dire situation, where extreme freezing energy was clashing with extreme heat, I smiled at Ina. I sounded calm, even in this situation.</p><br/><p>[Your daughter is also that strong? Earth\u2019s power is strangely high\u2026! Still, it\u2019s useless in front of my power!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should only be able to nullify the dungeon\u2019s power!\u201d</p><br/><p>I rebutted and ignited aura around my spear. At the same time, I spoke to Ina.</p><br/><p>\u201cIna, Daddy will take care of that woman. Ina should go help other members of Revival.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy will fight alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, she\u2019s nothing. Plus\u2026 it might get a bit dangerous. Leave the aerial battle to Laki and go fight the demons on land with Mommy. Got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn! I\u2019ll tell Mommy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ina was too innocent and kind. She nodded without a shred of doubt and turned around. At that moment, a spear of ice shot next to me. Its speed was so terrifying that I almost missed it.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll kill your daughter first!]</p><br/><p>\u201cGood joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, I wasn\u2019t worried. If I thought Ina\u2019s life was in danger, I would have made her fall back the moment she arrived. Though I told her to go back, it was only because she couldn\u2019t win against Lespina. Even so, Ina would never die to Lespina. Rather than believing that she could, it was more believable hearing that Walker died in a goblin\u2019s ambush.</p><br/><p>\u201cDangerous. Mean. That was really mean.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ina touched the ice spear with her finger and easily lifted it up. Even though it was under Lespina\u2019s command, the ice spear followed Ina\u2019s commands like a docile sheep.</p><br/><p>[What\u2026!?]</p><br/><p>That was a realm of dominance that couldn\u2019t be explained with mana. I didn\u2019t know how it was possible, but in the past, even without the dungeon\u2019s help, Ina was able to match evenly with Hwaya and me. Now that she\u2019d become a Gold ranked explorer, her control over ice was unmatched by anyone else.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, I want to be with Daddy. I\u2019ll punish evil people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, Ina, with your power\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSkadi.\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, an immense freezing energy swirled around Ina. Though somewhat similar to Lespina\u2019s, the energy that swirled around Ina was holier. Ina looked up with her eyes dyed blue. The ice spear in her hand instantly split into thousands and hovered in air. The sky, which had been Lespina\u2019s territory, had now become Ina\u2019s.</p><br/><p>All freezing energy belonged to Ina, and her breath became freezing energy and gathered in midair.</p><br/><p>The air transformed. Until now, it felt like the world was hostile, but now, it felt like the world had become my ally.</p><br/><p>Ina raised her finger and pointed to Lespina. With just that, the freezing energy in her body scattered. It was so incredulous that I burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you bully Daddy, you\u2019re a meanie! If you bully me, you\u2019re a meanie! If you bully Daddy and me, you\u2019re an even bigger meanie! I\u2019ll punish you!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Impossible\u2026 A little brat!?]</p><br/><p>She was a child given an even greater blessing and curse of ice than the ice elemental Ruyue.</p><br/><p>\u2026 And the fifth member of Revival to have obtained a god\u2019s true name.</p><br/><p>Tell me about these things sooner, Ina!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

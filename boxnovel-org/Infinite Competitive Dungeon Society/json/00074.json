The Elementalist That Sealed, The Elementalist That Saves (1)</p><br/><p>\u201cCold Protection Robe, Return magic scroll, Flame Enchant magic scroll\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t need a Return magic scroll. I already have the Return skill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta, who began to take out all sorts of items seemingly out of nowhere, put away the Return magic scroll after hearing what I said. Although I was watching her with my own eyes, I couldn\u2019t see where she put away the scroll.</p><br/><p>Looking over the items she picked out, she nodded her head, then shook it again. She then took out a book and a small chest from the pile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said you had a crossbow, right? This is Crossbow Marksmanship. This item is sold starting from the 30th floor, and if you learn Crossbow Marksmanship with this skill book, it will be easier to shoot down any enemies. This is Flame Bolt Cartridge. The bolts placed inside it receive the fire attribute and explode when they collide with something\u2026 This is a limited item sold from the 47th floor and above, and only to those who completed a particular achievement, so make sure you keep it a secret from others. Remember, it\u2019s a secret!\u201d</p><br/><p>It turns out that Floor Master Battle Vouchers and Party Member Scarecrows that I\u2019d been buying were also items only those who completed a particular achievement could buy. Although I had the qualifications to buy them, it seemed I had stretched it a bit when I let Ren purchase them. Though, Ren also obtained the qualifications after succeeding in a solo raid.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. So, how much is it for the Cold Protection Robe and the Flame Enchant magic scroll?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s 600\u2026 No, 450,000 gold.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was an enormous discount. Although I sent Loretta an inquisitive, \u2018will that be fine?\u2019 glance, she simply held out her hands, asking me for my money. In the end, Loretta was helping me in various ways.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, 450,000 gold.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, thank you for the purchase, customer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, can you really sell them for this price?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, this place is my area, where no prying eyes can reach. Plus, if the hidden area that just opened is what I think it is, it really is a dangerous place that I\u2019d love to prevent you from going to. If it\u2019s just this much, I\u2019m sure the oldie\u2026 I mean, Lord, would allow it too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I felt a little uneasy, I decided to accept her help. Peika was in danger. I didn\u2019t have time to loiter around. I first learned the Crossbow Marksmanship skill.</p><br/><p>[You learned Crossbow Marksmanship. You can properly handle crossbows to damage the enemy. As the skill level increases, your aim and critical hit rate will increase.]</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, if things get difficult, you have to find elemental-nim and use Return. If Shin-nim dies, it will be the same thing as Shin-nim\u2019s vitality becoming zero, but the elemental-nim won\u2019t be unsummoned and will completely perish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta warned me as I put on the Cold Protection Robe. As her golden eyes staring at me emphasized the seriousness of her words, I could only nod my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful. A crazed elemental is extremely dangerous. Although I wasn\u2019t present at the time, even the Fairy Garden\u2019s Elementalist didn\u2019t have the confidence to subdue the crazed elemental without killing her, and could only seal her in that place\u2026 Even Shin-nim might not be strong enough to do anything against her. Remember, if Shin-nim\u2019s vitality becomes zero, elemental-nim will perish.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. I don\u2019t want to lose Peika either. I\u2019m off, then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome back safely with elemental-nim. \u2026 And.\u201d</p><br/><p>I poured the skeleton bone bolts first into the cartridge I just bought and then put them all in my inventory. As long as there were bolts in my inventory, my crossbow would automatically reload itself.</p><br/><p>When I finished checking over my equipment and raised my head, Loretta was almost right in front of my face. Seeing her frighteningly perfect face up close, my body became stiff on its own. A pathetic sound came out of my mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cH, Huuk?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD-Don\u2019t misunderstand, okay? Don\u2019t misunderstand.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, she placed her hand on my left cheek, and pressed her lips against my other cheek.</p><br/><p>[You received the Queen Elf\u2019s Blessing. For the next 5 hours, you receive the following effects: You are protected against all low-rank and mid-rank status effects. You can maintain your consciousness for 5 minutes after falling into a half-dead state. Your luck increases by 100. All members of the Faerie race will see you favorably.]</p><br/><p>\u201cW\u2026 W-W-W-W-Wha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cB-Blessing, it\u2019s a blessing. I gave you a blessing to wish you safe return! So don\u2019t misunderstand!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta\u2019s cheeks became bright red. However, she couldn\u2019t be redder than me who had just gotten kissed. I could feel my cheeks burning, and I was frozen stiff as if Loretta\u2019s silvery fragrance consumed my body. Just when I was thinking I might suffocate from being unable to let out my breath, I barely managed to exhale.</p><br/><p>\u201cQueen Elf it said\u2026 You were married?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond Bullet of Destruction!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKahak!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a burning sensation in my stomach, I collapsed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m still a young maiden! Queen just refers to my status. How can Shin-nim say that to me!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You could have just\u2026 said that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Shin-nim? Shin-nim\u2026 Shin-nim!?\u201d</p><br/><p>My vitality almost became zero before I could even go to Peika\u2019s rescue.</p><br/><p>[You entered an Event Dungeon.]</p><br/><p>The moment I entered the Event dungeon, a tremendous cold swept over me. Even with the Cold Protection Robe, the chill that reached my skin seemed to want to rip me to pieces.</p><br/><p>\u201cKu, it\u2019s so cold here\u2026 Is this a snow field?\u201d</p><br/><p>How could the warm Fairy Garden have an area this cold? I took out my spear and gasped as I felt the metallic handle of my spear turn cold. I could feel the chill even through my gauntlet.</p><br/><p>\u201cI should use Flame Enchant first.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I brought the Flame Enchant scroll I bought from Loretta to the Black Earthen Spear, the scroll instantly burned up, and, at the same time, made my spear glow with a reddish aura. I could feel the heat emanating off from it. With the warmth coming from the spear, I felt much better. By rubbing my cheeks on the spear shaft, I could forget the cold for a moment.</p><br/><p>With my improved condition from Flame Enchant, I tightly grabbed the spear with my hands and looked around. There was snow as far as my eyes could see, and the trees that I saw here and there had snow flowers instead of leaves. Although I was worried about Peika and wanted to hurry, I knew rushing things would only make it worse.</p><br/><p>I closed my eyes and focused. Thankfully, after I came into this space, the connection between Peika and me had reestablished itself. However, I still couldn\u2019t unsummon her or recall her.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, can you hear me?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Master! You came to find me!]</p><br/><p>Whew. It seemed she was okay. Feeling relieved, I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the situation? Are you in danger?\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s so cold. I\u2019m fine, but the kids I came with might freeze to death. Master, hurry up.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t meet any other elementals?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Mm? No, but I found lots of strange monsters. Be careful, Master!]</p><br/><p>Strange monsters? When I opened my mouth to ask her for more details, I felt a bone-chilling feeling and rolled forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cPtui! Argh, snow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhung!\u201d</p><br/><p>As I complained while spitting out the snow that had gotten in my mouth, someone, or something, had replied. To secure my safety, I first rolled forward once more before I got up and turned around. There, an almost 3 meter tall humanoid monster was looking down on me. Its entire body was covered with white fur, while a small horn protruded from its head.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaooooo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hm, you\u2019re quite big.\u201d</p><br/><p>I casually complimented it and strengthened my grip on my spear. If it was a sociable creature, I hoped it would become bashful and compliment my helmet or spear. Unfortunately, it swung its black claws, the only non-white part of its body, towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuuung!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuuaaang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I had expected as much, there really was another one! At the same time the one facing me attacked me, the other monster suddenly popped up behind me, aiming for my back. Without a shred of hesitation, I charged towards the one I was facing. Although I normally would have spent more time to feel it out, I was currently facing two mysterious enemies. I had to take care of one first!</p><br/><p>\u201cHa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhak!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Heroic Strike, which I thrust out with a spirited shout, drew a trajectory of white light as it pierced through the monster\u2019s neck. Because of Flame Enchant, the moment the spear went into its neck, its whole body burned up in flames. As they were monsters living in the snowy fields, it seemed fire damage was especially effective against them.</p><br/><p>The Heroic Strike just now took about 15% of my HP and MP, but managed to finish the monster off. If that was the case, I could fight the remaining monster without having to use Heroic Strike!</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuuuuung!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026 Hap!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now, I didn\u2019t have Peika, nor could I call upon other elementals. In short, I couldn\u2019t use my power as an Elementalist. I had to rely on my spearmanship and martial arts techniques. However, I became more spirited the more dangerous the situation was. A few strands of my hair left unprotected by the cover of my robe froze. With this, I found out the monster\u2019s attacks had the power to freeze its opponent.</p><br/><p>I lowered my posture and charged towards it. It seemed to be wary of my spear, as it backed away, but it was too slow. By the time it found a weakness in its defense, my spear was already cutting off its left arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>About a third of its arm became severed, dripping blue blood on the snowy field, which instantly froze. For an instant, I doubted my eyes. It wasn\u2019t because the snow was cold. It was its blood\u2019s low temperature that caused it to crystalize. In other words, I had to be wary of its blood as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what are these things\u2026? Hap!\u201d</p><br/><p>In my eyes, the damage I might take from the cold was more dangerous than direct attacks. Especially its left arm that kept spewing out blue blood, it was the most annoying thing to deal with. I had to completely sever it and use the flame energy in my spear to scorch it. So that\u2019s exactly what I did.</p><br/><p>\u201cKiaaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>The spear I thrust out with an ample amount of mana made its left arm drop on the ground, which then disappeared into particles. I held my spear a bit closer to the tip and charged towards it, hitting away the fluttering droplets of blood. Then, I smacked the severed area of its left arm with my spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cKiaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u201d</p><br/><p>I heard the sizzle of my spearhead scorching its wound. It made me\u2026 a bit hungry. It even smelled nice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuk, I can\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuoooooo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Using its cry as a background music, I heightened my concentration and managed to completely scorch its wound. Using the moment where it stumbled after losing its arm, I shot my spear forward. As if my spear was being sucked in, it stabbed at the monster\u2019s neck and managed to deal damage by penetrating its thick skin.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKiaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHu, you\u2019re almost dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>After 5 minutes of carefully stabbing its neck, I managed to completely pierce through its neck. With a strange roaring sound, the monster collapsed.</p><br/><p>[You obtained Yeti\u2019s Blood.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained 5,500 gold.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026 so this guy is a yeti.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yeti. Although my fight with them had ended, the fight wasn\u2019t perfectly clean, nor was it satisfying.</p><br/><p>I was in my worst condition and my opponents were the worst as well. The yetis entire body and blood were weapons, and they even had high defense. Not to mention, the snowy field environment and its harsh, cold winds made it hard for me to even open my eyes and maintain my balance. My feet also kept sinking into the snow. The moment I lost my focus, I could receive a fatal blow. This was truly the worst environment for battle.</p><br/><p>However, it also was the best place to grow myself. I was in similar situations when I was training with father as well. The sense of accomplishment was higher the harsher the environment was for practicing martial arts.</p><br/><p>Yup, I\u2019d think of this as training. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t have the will to continue on in this place.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright\u2026 let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>After resolving myself, I stepped forward, holding my warm Black Earthen Spear in my embrace. The connection between Peika and me was telling me where to go.</p><br/><p>However\u2026 there was something strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it\u2026? Besides Peika, there\u2019s another\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the same direction Peika was in, something that wasn\u2019t Peika seemed to be calling me.</p><br/><p>Something connected to me by a deep bond, something that had to be with me.</p><br/><p>Led on by the unknown calling, I walked onward with a small suspicion in my heart. I knew the answer to my suspicion would be at the end of this snowy plain.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

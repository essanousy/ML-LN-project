Fairy Garden (4)</p><br/><p>[You will be moved.]</p><br/><p>The same phenomenon as when I arrived at the Residential Area happened. When I closed my eyes and opened them, there was a two-story house in front of me. It was an ordinary house with a red brick roof. On it, there was a sign that read Second-grade House. When I looked around, I saw lines of houses that looked exactly the same as this one. When I tried to walk towards one of them, I found myself in the same place I started out. It seemed I couldn\u2019t go to the other houses.</p><br/><p>\u201cPalludia?\u201d</p><br/><p>[C-Come in!]</p><br/><p>I opened the front door and walked in. The house, which was built using bricks, was exceedingly ordinary, and its inside was incredibly clean. In truth, it wasn\u2019t a place where a girl could live by herself.</p><br/><p>Palludia wasn\u2019t wearing her usual priestess uniform, but a light blue dress. It perfectly suited her slender arms and legs. For a moment, I was stunned by her beauty. Plus\u2026 Hm? Something felt different about her face. What was it? Ah, I could smell perfume!</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You came!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, yeah, thanks for having me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though, I didn\u2019t really know why she called me.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want something to drink? R-Right! Tea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>On top of her clothes and perfume, she was noticeably acting strange. Her clumsy movements were\u2026 cute, but that wasn\u2019t important.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I sit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! On the table!\u201d</p><br/><p>She probably meant on the chair by the table. With that, I went and sat down on the chair by the teahouse table. Then, I watched Palludia prepare tea. Even though she was in her own house, she made very awkward movements, like her arms and legs moving in the same direction, or spilling water because her hands were shaking uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>From then, it took 20 minutes for Palludia to calm down and finish brewing her tea. It took another 10 minutes for her to sit down at the table and drink tea while facing me. Drinking the lukewarm red tea, I asked Palludia.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s the reason you invited me over?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 A-Amazing, right? I already have a Second-grade House!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that actually is amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018This girl, she changed the subject!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, it wasn\u2019t by my strength alone. Many people supported me with their gold. You might not know, but I\u2019m equivalent to the representative of my continent. A mere Second-grade House, it\u2019s nothing against this Palludia Gren Ehuir-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yeah. Congratulations, Palludia.\u201d</p><br/><p>For her mental health, I decided not to tell her about my Special Mansion.</p><br/><p>\u201cCall me Ludia! T-That\u2019s what everyone calls me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it...? Okay, Ludia.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuna did call her Ludia. I thought it was a nickname between close friends. When did Palludia start considering me her friend? Because I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d had a chance to become such close friends, I was quite bewildered.</p><br/><p>However, the real bewilderment had yet to happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cS-So you see\u2026 the\u2026 the reason I called you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Palludia, no, Ludia\u2019s face was incredibly red. After taking a sip of red tea, she barely managed to continue her words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s\u2026 something I need to explain to you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cM-My family. I-It\u2019s a r-royal family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>I would never forget her words that followed for the rest of my life.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2026 We\u2019re born with eyes that can discern our fated partners. I, I mean, if I marry this person and have children, the royal family would be destined to prosper.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>A chill suddenly ran down my back.</p><br/><p>\u201cApparently it\u2019s because of my bloodline\u2026 my ancestor\u2019s blood has a Divine race\u2019s blood mixed in\u2026 or so they say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cW-When we first met.\u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason, I didn\u2019t want to hear what she had to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember when I was\u2026 mean\u2026 to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY\u2026Yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>I hoped it wasn\u2019t true.</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew it the moment I saw you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 Really? A girl this pretty, with me? Although I wanted to tell her not to joke around and laugh it off, Ludia\u2019s expression was too serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn truth, I didn\u2019t like it. Why did I have to marry a man I didn\u2019t even know, who even came from another world? That\u2019s why I was so mean to you... I didn\u2019t even think you were an orc! I thought you had an admirable body of a martial artist. I didn\u2019t hate you.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, her voice was getting calmer. She was getting more and more collected.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hated my eyes. I hated my royal bloodline. I hated that I had to marry someone that was chosen without my knowledge. I hated that I was connected to someone that couldn\u2019t even live with me in my world! That\u2019s why I stayed silent. But I didn\u2019t hate you! You saved me twice! You helped me, even when I wasn\u2019t kind to you. In fact, I treated you harshly! When I said I didn\u2019t like you as a person, that was a lie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I see. Is that why you added me to your friend list?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yeah. I didn\u2019t think about marriage, but I didn\u2019t want the connection between us to be severed. Maybe, back then, I was already\u2026 N-No. I\u2019ll continue.\u201d</p><br/><p>She caught her breath, then asked with a quiet voice.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Shina Gren Ehuir. Do you know her?\u201d</p><br/><p>I did.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know Shina. Ah, Shina Gren Ehuir. I see, she\u2019s your younger sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s the second royal princess. Even as a princess, she bravely fights on the frontlines as a knight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s the same for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cM-Me!? I\u2019m a priestess! So it\u2019s not as dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t, this girl. I had to do something. Although she looked calm, she wasn\u2019t calm at all. She got startled whenever I said something, and the tone of her voice randomly changed as she spoke. It was clear she was incredibly nervous. I understood. I was incredibly nervous too!</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2026 She said she\u2019d marry you, so I got scared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time I heard about it. Today, there were many things I was hearing for the first time.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe also said her fated partner was you! She kept bragging about how close she was with you, almost as if to taunt me!\u201d</p><br/><p>My eyebrows trembled. Scary! Even though we exchanged greetings from time to time, I never even imagined Shina was thinking like that!</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if I die, I won\u2019t let Shina have\u2026 I mean! I thought I should meet you because of this problem. I didn\u2019t have any ulterior motives! I just thought it was weird that both sisters picked the same person as their fated partner. I just wanted to confirm, but Mom found out and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFound out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cS-She found out you were another world\u2019s Hero\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Her face reddened as she drooped her head and waved her hand in the air. Although she looked extremely adorable, I understood what she meant in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, t-this house\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yeah. Mom and Dad arranged it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Emperor and Empress did!</p><br/><p>\u2026As a wedding gift!</p><br/><p>\u201cT-Thanks for the tea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I tried to get up from my seat, Ludia hastily grabbed my arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2019m just saying! Don\u2019t jump to conclusions. What, were you worried that I was going to propose to you? You\u2019re not that narcissistic, are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand, so calm down, Palludia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said call me Ludia!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, Ludia. Breathe in. Breathe out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2014Ha\u2014\u201c</p><br/><p>She obediently followed my words and inhaled in and out. Even as she was being feisty, doing what I told her made her look extremely lova\u2026 Huk! I needed to calm down too!</p><br/><p>After recomposing herself, she glared at me with teary eyes and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI calmed down. S-So! I\u2019m just letting you know. Got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I got it. Well, here\u2019s my thought. Marriage should be done between two people that love each other, right? Being able to tell one\u2019s fated partner, there\u2019s no guarantee it\u2019s 100 percent right. So you don\u2019t have to worry, Ludia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Stupid. You\u2019re so dense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing!\u201d</p><br/><p>I wondered why. She seemed calmer, but she also looked angrier. Unable to figure out why, I panicked. Ah, I was also feeling fluttery. In truth, Ludia was the most beautiful of all the girls I\u2019d met. Although I was doing my best to lower my evaluation of her looks by thinking about her younger self, I couldn\u2019t deny that she was beautiful.</p><br/><p>But to think her fated partner was me. My heart had no other choice but to pound! Of course, Ludia didn\u2019t like me at all and was angry about that. Even so, I couldn\u2019t help myself from thinking \u2018what if?\u2019</p><br/><p>But this wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>Something like fate, there was no need to consider it. Anyone that would try to do something with Ludia because of it would be the lowest scum. Ludia trusted me and told me about it honestly. Even if I couldn\u2019t act dignified, I had to at least lessen her burden.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to meet the person you like and be happy with him. You don\u2019t have to worry about something like a fated partner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 How about you? You don\u2019t care at all? Not even a little?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia, who was listening to me, returned with a question. Her eyes were teary like she was about to burst into tears. I felt like I couldn\u2019t lie in front of such eyes and said with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry. I shouldn\u2019t mind, but I actually do. A lot. You\u2019re incredibly beautiful, and even if you don\u2019t act like it, I know you\u2019re kind. If a girl like that tells me that I\u2019m her fated partner\u2026 of course my heart would race. Sorry, I know I shouldn\u2019t, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, it\u2019s nothing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia hastily flapped her hands, but for some reason, her mood seemed to have become much brighter. With a face that was barely holding in a smile, she seemed to be pulling back the corners of her mouth. I didn\u2019t know why, but I felt it was a good thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, mm. Don\u2019t listen to Shina no matter what she says, okay? Engrave it in your mind!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed that was all she planned to say for today. While sipping on the red tea that went cold, I answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if Shina says you have to marry her because you\u2019re her fated partner, don\u2019t listen to her! That girl only likes you because you\u2019re strong, so don\u2019t think she really likes you. Got it, Kang Shin!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I got it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I answered her with an exhausted voice, she doodled on the table using the tea water, and continued with a quiet murmuring voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cContact me more often\u2026 I\u2019ll forget your voice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO, Okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can come by again whenever, too. I\u2019m usually bored.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can go now. I\u2019m going to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, it was fun today.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying goodbye to Ludia, I left her house. Although I heard Ludia letting out a weird sound and falling, I decided to ignore it. After all, she must have had a lot in her mind before telling me.</p><br/><p>I was happy that several questions I had regarding Ludia were solved. Thinking that I could continue being good friends with her, the corners of my mouth went up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright, now let\u2019s go look at my own house!\u2019</p><br/><p>When I touched the key in my inventory, a message rang out in my ear.</p><br/><p>[Would you like to move to Marianne\u2019s Garden?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I closed my eyes and opened them, I was in front of a huge mansion.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too big\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The garden spread out past the front gate was filled with colorful flowers, and further back were several trees forming a beautiful scenery. I stepped past the iron gate opening slowly in response to my key, and leisurely walked through the stone path while looking around the mansion\u2019s land.</p><br/><p>It really was incredibly large. Plus, there were so many fruit trees that I could smell their sweet, subtle fragrance. When I plucked one off and took a bite, an overwhelming sweetness and coolness danced in my mouth. A bit away from the stone path, amongst the trees, I saw what seemed like a spring, but I ignored it for now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mansion\u2026 Ah, I see it now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mansion was also enormous. It had a blue roof and was made of ivory-colored bricks. Without exaggeration, it was as big as a few Giant Iron Boars. Its sheer size almost felt exhausting. Right in front of the mansion was a fountain, and a wide, open space around it.</p><br/><p>Right! I could leave the Giant Iron Boar here! In the future when I needed to dismantle the Giant Iron Boar, I could do it by the fountain. Not to mention, the water would be close by for me to drink!</p><br/><p>After looking around the fountain and the open area, I turned my attention to the inside of the mansion. I climbed the stairs, and another door appeared, which reacted to the key I had and opened.</p><br/><p>[You entered Marianne\u2019s Garden.]</p><br/><p>[The Mana Stone required for authorization has been confirmed. Would you like to be authorized as the mansion\u2019s owner?]</p><br/><p>While I was overwhelmed by the sight of the wide hall that appeared past the door, the messages rang out. I couldn\u2019t help but be confused. Mana Stone? When did I get a Mana Stone?</p><br/><p>But since it said it would authorize me, there was no reason for me to decline. When I accepted the message\u2019s offer, my inventory suddenly opened in mid-air.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What?\u201d</p><br/><p>When did I open my inventory? While I was confused, something was falling out of my inventory.</p><br/><p>It was the Giant Iron Boar\u2019s nose.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

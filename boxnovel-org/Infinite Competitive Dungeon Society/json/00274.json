Kahar (8)</p><br/><p>A presence behind me disappeared. Obviously, it was Ellos\u2019 presence. The world\u2019s enemy in front of me widened his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to kill him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI froze him for now. I don\u2019t want to get stabbed from behind, you see.\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied calmly. The world\u2019s enemy seemed to hesitate for a moment, then he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t feel a thing. How did you a do it so quickly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I tell you, will you tell me too? How you enticed Ellos. I doubt it was your face that did it.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I said that, I held up my Chaotic Spear. The reason I could freeze Ellos so quickly was simple. Ellos had already been within Ruyue\u2019s domain from that time I asked her to cool everyone off.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You\u2019re not bad, even better than Sir Kasina.\u201d</p><br/><p>I aimed my spear at him, signaling that I wanted to fight quickly. However, he didn\u2019t even think to take out his weapon and laughed playfully. As I thought, he was different. He was different than all the other worlds\u2019 enemies. If I had to find someone like him, it would only be Luka continent\u2019s Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe boldness to march in here, fully knowing that it\u2019s a trap. The decisiveness in killing your friend the moment you learned of his betrayal. Most importantly, that mysterious power overflowing within you even with the dungeon\u2019s power gone.\u201d</p><br/><p>He held up his hand covered in his powered suit and rubbed his chin. At the same time, my interest in him grew. From his movements, I could feel a depth of martial arts on a completely different level than any of the enemies I\u2019ve faced so far. He seemed to have thought the same thing. I could tell by the way he was smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is quite troubling. Hm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the next moment, he snapped his fingers as if he came to a conclusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cEarth\u2019s Hero, why don\u2019t you ally with us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, ally. Become my friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was wondering what he was going to say, but to think it would be this dull. I snorted and retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI refuse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t worry. That woman you guys call Lord, her influence won\u2019t reach us here.\u201d</p><br/><p>I flinched. He was a world\u2019s enemy. It made sense that he knew this much. But what made me flinch wasn\u2019t the fact that he knew about the Dungeon Lord, but the way he said it. He was full of leisure as if he knew something much greater.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 What is your plan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo tell you the truth, I planned on joining hands with the Edias continent to propel my plan, but it only makes sense that I change ship now that a stronger partner appeared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPartner, eh? You think that\u2019s an appropriate word between an attacker and a defender?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although that\u2019s what I said, I was still somewhat interested. If he planned on telling me more, there was no reason to refuse. After all, part of the reason I was working as a Dimensional Mercenary was to gain more information about the attackers. I was somewhat hoping that this would happen.</p><br/><p>He spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s appropriate. We\u2019re all being toyed by them, so we\u2019re fellow victims.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me explain something. First of all, I don\u2019t have the world\u2019s power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not surprised?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t a Hero, nor did he carry the world\u2019s power in his body. Because of it, I was wracking my brain at the moment, trying to find out who Edias continent\u2019s Hero was. The man in front of me seemed to be surprised that I could recognize the owner of a world\u2019s power. He probably thought it was the attacking side\u2019s privilege.</p><br/><p>Soon, however, he composed himself. What he then said made me flustered.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you see, I once had a world\u2019s power. To be exact, I retrieved it after killing Keteuce continent\u2019s Hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt like I was smacked in the head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>What did he mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s simple. Edias continent isn\u2019t our first target. Before we came here, we fought the people of Keteuce continent and came out victorious in glory. Sadly, that glory didn\u2019t last long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, what are you saying\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCurious? \u2026 Should I tell you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou liar\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Despite what I said, I was shrinking back. Curious? Of course, I was. But I never expected his story to be so far beyond my knowledge. If what he said was right, the invaders had lost the world\u2019s power even after destroying one world. For a moment, I thought of the Demon Lord. Was he also in the same position\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tell you something you don\u2019t know. Listen carefully. Once you do, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll join my side. Just like how Sir Kasina did not too long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nearby, an invader gritted his teeth. His hostility wasn\u2019t aimed at me. It was aimed at something far bigger and far far away. I felt dizzy. Only when Licorice grabbed me from the back did I realize, I had been staggering.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a simple story. The reason we\u2019re facing each other as enemies. I\u2019m going to tell you about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo on. My ears are open.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. At first, we were just like you and the inhabitants of the Edias continent, normal humans living normal lives. Ah, to be exact, we\u2019re a bit different than you humans. We\u2019re a bit smarter but weaker physically. But, in a broader sense, we\u2019re still humans.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne day, babies stopped being born.\u201d</p><br/><p>He voice was calm, but hidden within it was a clear and sharp fury.</p><br/><p>\u201cBabies were born dead. No magical tool or prayer could save them. There were no new lives, and old lives couldn\u2019t laugh even as they died.\u201d</p><br/><p>He continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrops withered and fell in the middle of growing. Livestock collapsed in the middle of giving birth and died in the middle of giving birth. Even monsters, who were humanity\u2019s enemy, couldn\u2019t escape this fate. The flow of mana became stiff. It became hard to recover from injuries. It was hell. It was as if the world had died. All remaining lives were slowly dying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what happens to a world with its world\u2019s power taken.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. You must have had a clear enemy to direct your hostility. But we weren\u2019t even given that. From when we woke up in the morning to when we barely fell asleep at night, everyone cried tears of pain. They hated the earth, hated the heaven, and hated God. Even so, nothing changed. Except for one thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt like I knew what the one thing was.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe had to grab onto it. We had to throw ourselves at it. We knew. Beyond the pathway that appeared on our continent, we had to kill them, decapitate them, and steal their power of life. We knew that was our only hope. What would you have done in that case, Hero?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI would have marched into them.\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t lie. \u2018I can\u2019t hurt innocent people living peacefully, so I\u2019ll obediently die with my world.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t bring myself to say that.</p><br/><p>\u201cHonest, how honest. As I thought, I really like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust continue with your story. Didn\u2019t you say you conquered the Keteuce continent?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I did, not someone else, but me. With my own hands, I grabbed the neck of their so-called Hero and snapped it off. Then, I obtained his power. Instead of our withered world, we settled in Keteuce continent. We spared those who surrendered and mercilessly killed those who didn\u2019t. It took a long, long time, but eventually, every human in Keteuce continent had the blood of our people flowing in them. Just like that, we reclaimed peace. We didn\u2019t need to do anything anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why did you invade Edias continent?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a silly question, Earth\u2019s Hero. Didn\u2019t I tell you the answer before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Kang Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Kang Shin, my name is Hazen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hazen stared at me fixedly, as if he was waiting for my reaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was because Keteuce continent\u2019s power disappeared. It wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault. It disappeared as if it never existed in the first place.\u201d</p><br/><p>I fell silent.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that I had never imagined it. In fact, I had considered it once before. But I never believed that it could actually happen. I didn\u2019t want to.</p><br/><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t forget that day. When I found out that all babies born that day died, when I found out that the overflowing power of the Hero and the power of the world disappeared from within me, I realized\u2026 The nightmare wasn\u2019t over. No\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice stuck in my ears like tar.</p><br/><p>\u201cI realized, the nightmare won\u2019t end. It simply continues. Infinitely.\u201d</p><br/><p>I shook my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Why did the world\u2019s power disappear again? Overflowing worlds and lack of power to support them. Wasn\u2019t that why worlds were paired up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, that\u2019s what I thought too at first. Were there more worlds that needed to be erased? But that was impossible. World\u2019s power that once supported all worlds couldn\u2019t have had just diminished. Someone, an existence that we can\u2019t even come to perceive, was toying with us. Maintaining worlds? That was all bullshit! A pretext and an excuse! They might even be looking at us fighting each other and leisurely betting on which side would win. Almost like watching warriors fight to their deaths in a Colosseum.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that\u2019s the reason they erased a world\u2019s power and paired up worlds?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. So you understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked back at Licorice and Lotte. They both shook their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard anything like it, Hero. That man\u2026 has lived long. His war began far earlier than ours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same for me, Dear Husband. To be honest, I can\u2019t believe him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hazen smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cRegardless, we crossed over to Edias continent. It was hard. We had obtained peace after a fierce war, so we were too indulged in it. A countless number of our comrades died, and in the process, we killed a countless number of our enemies. Then, a thought suddenly crossed my mind. If this continued, we would eventually perish. We would forever be toyed by them. Unless we took the initiative from them, it would continue until not a single piece of flesh or bone remained from us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd\u2026 This crystal is the answer you came up with?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d</p><br/><p>He nodded excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how many worlds we conquer, we realized we could lose the world\u2019s power in the blink of an eye. At that point, a question popped up in my head. What the hell was this dungeon that helped the defending side? Just who was this Lord woman that she had such an enormous power? Kang Shin, don\u2019t you want to find out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do, but without her, Earth would have been annihilated by our enemies long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh dear, if you trust her just because you received her help, you\u2019ll end up with an axe to your back. Here, look.\u201d</p><br/><p>He pointed at the crystal taking up most of the space in the area. The crystal was sucking in surrounding mana and releasing corrupted mana at the same time. That was what restrained my power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you can probably feel, it\u2019s an amazing thing. While fighting the so-called dungeon explorers from Keteuce continent and Edias continent, we couldn\u2019t help but analyze them. Obviously, we found a way to weaken the dungeon\u2019s power. All we needed were the material to build the magical tool and the mana to control it. We managed to find all the material, but the mana problem wasn\u2019t something we could resolve in Keteuce continent. But this place, this Peruta Mountain Range, was different. There was more than enough mana gathered here to operate the magical tool.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the middle of hearing him brag, I realized something. I immediately voiced my suspicion.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat magical tool, it\u2019s complete?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing! So you see it!\u201d</p><br/><p>He smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s still too big! Its core function hasn\u2019t been realized either. We have to make it much smaller, small enough to carry it. We have to raise its output, too! But it\u2019s possible! We can do it. And when it\u2019s complete, that\u2019s when you, partner, come in. You take it and enter the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want me to kill the Dungeon Lord?\u201d</p><br/><p>He bit the question I asked casually.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should share its power. Then, we\u2019ll form an alliance. Starting with each world\u2019s leaders, we\u2019ll begin to mix. Eventually, all of humanity will intermarry. A countless number of couples will be formed between two worlds, and when their children are born, the two worlds will start to become one. It doesn\u2019t matter even if one of the worlds\u2019 power disappears. Why? Because the blood of both our worlds will be flowing in everyone\u2019s veins!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHo.\u201d</p><br/><p>I let out a short exclamation of admiration. He seemed even more excited at my reaction, as he shouted even louder.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we can control the dungeon\u2019s power, which can open the pathway to countless worlds, what will we have to fear? Nothing! We\u2019ll be able to enter any world as we please!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, with infinite power! In the end, we will become the victors! Indomitable victors that no one can threaten! Invincible victors that won\u2019t be toyed by anyone\u2019s hands!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you were just delusional. I\u2019m starting to doubt whether Keteuce continent even existed.\u201d</p><br/><p>I spoke bluntly. However, he unexpectedly sneered at my response.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you say that when you\u2019re feeling the magical tool\u2019s power? Kang Shin, do you think this power won\u2019t reach the Dungeon Lord?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019ll be that simple? Do you think the Dungeon Lord is even killable? Even if you killed her, will you be able to take her power?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is just a fool with an incredible power! The dungeon is her, and she is the dungeon. If she\u2019s in front of us, we can analyze her. We can even analyze gods! Taking her power after killing her will be even simpler. All power can be held in a container!\u201d</p><br/><p>I was doubtful, truly doubtful. However, I held in my curiosity and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you approach Ellos?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe heard from other explorers that Sir Kasina had ties to another world\u2019s Hero. Plus, he\u2019s currently the true head of the continent\u2019s allied force.\u201d</p><br/><p>True head. I thought of the way Ellos ordered the empire\u2019s knights. He was the disciple of the Hero and friend of the empire\u2019s crown prince. He was fitting of the title \u2018true head\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlus, he was the Hero\u2019s disciple. Right, the person who can most easily lead the Hero into a trap. And, he was wise. He understood what I said, and he had the brains to cooperate with us to save his continent\u2019s people.\u201d</p><br/><p>No, that\u2019s impossible. You don\u2019t know it. That he lost his fianc\u00e9e to your forces!</p><br/><p>However, there was still something I needed to find out, something I needed to confirm. I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you couldn\u2019t take the Hero\u2019s power from that Hero you killed, that means he wasn\u2019t the Hero when you killed him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s also right! The Hero suffered grave injuries in one of our previous fights. He fled with his disciple and transferred the power to him. Besides me and his disciple, no one else knows this. After all, the disciple hid the fact that he became the Hero. If he hides it, no one else can find out, unless they\u2019re people like us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I knew the answer, I still asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the disciple?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious? It\u2019s Sir Kasina, of course! The one you froze.\u201d</p><br/><p>In that moment, I slowly closed my eyes.</p><br/><p>I felt like I finally arrived at the answer.</p><br/><p>The reason Ellos acted so strangely.</p><br/><p>Why we had to come here, and what power he had. How he could hide the fact that he became the Hero from me, and what he planned to do from now.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, I\u2019d like you to make up your mind. Who should we kill? You should know the answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Shin doesn\u2019t have the answer. I do.\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice rang out from above, but before I could look up, I first looked behind. The ice I believed to have trapped Ellos was shattered into pieces.</p><br/><p>I turned to the direction of the voice. There, Ellos was standing on the top of the giant crystal.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe answer was there from the very beginning, from the moment Baruella died from your hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Kasina\u2026!? Who\u2019s Baruella? Are you betraying us because of just one person?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos smirked without answering him.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, you knew everything, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>I answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you still let me be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even go full out when you froze me, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not. You\u2019re nowhere strong enough to break Ruyue\u2019s full-power ice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, friend. You trusted me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should thank me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you shouldn\u2019t have trusted me.\u201d</p><br/><p>I became speechless for a moment. I thought about what to say and chose the easy words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right. I only just found out. If I knew earlier, I would have killed you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut to bring him here without invoking suspicion, I needed you to be the bait. Sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos bowed to me. Soon, he lifted up his head. His eyes were dyed blood red.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Kasina, don\u2019t touch that magical tool!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHazen, do you know? In this continent, there\u2019s a story. A story about a God who conceals himself without anyone knowing. When this god appears, he breaks and destroys everything, including himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos smiled with his teeth bared. Not only his eyes, but his entire body was being dyed red. In that instant, the flash in Hazen\u2019s eyes changed. He hadn\u2019t paid attention to Ellos in the slightest, but he now realized he had the power to make him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSTOP HIM! NOW!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Kahar, God of Concealment and Vengeance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, his ability to conceal himself was top-notch. Neither Hazen nor I could detect him at all.</p><br/><p>A stream of red light shot up from his body and penetrated Hazen\u2019s subordinates. I instantly knew that it wasn\u2019t just mana. Even amongst gods\u2019 powers, that thing was wicked. It was pulling out his blood and soul altogether.</p><br/><p>Ellos held up his sword beginning to drip with bloodred aura. Without even a hint of hesitation, he stabbed it into the crystal.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, die with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>An enormous energy exploded. Feeling the storm of mana that no one, not even Hazen, could come out unscathed\u2026</p><br/><p>I smiled.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

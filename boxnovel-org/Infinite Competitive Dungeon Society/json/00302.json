Lilith (2)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Waves of blood descended towards me as if to overwrite my existence itself. Metallic mirrors spun rapidly, petrifying the waves, as I kicked the waves down to break them.</p><br/><p>Still, it didn\u2019t really matter how we clashed. When I reached out with my spear and reflected my Evil Eyes\u2019 power with Dortu\u2019s mirrors, Crimson Hell turned to stone and broke. He also knew that he couldn\u2019t beat me in a direct confrontation, so from the moment we met, he\u2019s been endlessly using the one ability I\u2019ve been on guard the most against.</p><br/><p>It was the ability to steal mana from me. Even now, as I was constantly moving my body, Crimson Hell was doing its best to try to steal my mana.</p><br/><p>[Let\u2019s see\u2026 how long you\u2019ll last. I\u2019m curious!]</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s what I want to say!]</p><br/><p>This was the first time I\u2019ve put so much focus into Absolute Soul. If I let my guard down even for a second, Crimson Hell would take control over the initiative. Once my mana started being stolen, it would be too late. When I fought the SSS+ rank Mana Eater in Panan continent, I didn\u2019t have Absolute Soul so I had no choice but to let it steal my mana. Now, however, I had a way to prevent my mana from being stolen, and I was gaining more insight into it as time went on.</p><br/><p>[How persistent\u2026!]</p><br/><p>[Try harder, so I can get used to it more.]</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re saying\u2026 you\u2019re still growing? You\u2026 You dare to try to scare me!?]</p><br/><p>Did he think I was bluffing? Crimson Hell shouted in contempt and pushed towards me more vigorously. When I looked down from above, the colony of Crimson Hell was shooting up towards me like a tsunami and was extending invisible arms of depredation. With my eyes opened wide, I stabbed my spear into it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDortu!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. Spreading Master\u2019s power.]</p><br/><p>A grey ripple ran down the wave. Beyond the wave that turned to stone and shattered a beat late, Crimson Hell\u2019s invisible hands tenaciously reached towards me. I set up a hard wall in my mind. I released the power of my soul, which not only protected me but also naturally dominated external mana.</p><br/><p>After I first obtained Absolute Soul, I believed I was doing my best to hone it, but that was na\u00efve thinking. In this dire situation where the only thing keeping me alive was Absolute Soul, I was breaking through all sorts of limits.</p><br/><p>[\u2026!]</p><br/><p>Deep within me, there was something other than Peruta Circuit and Hero\u2019s power that radiated a powerful light. It was the essence of my soul which not even the dungeon nor Sherafina could touch. I felt like this was the first time I was coming into contact with it.</p><br/><p>With an overflowing joy, the way to take the next step, the way to make Absolute Soul my own power flowed through me. Absolute Soul was a process to form the perfect soul. There was something that light lacked. Since I was staring right at it, it would be wrong if I couldn\u2019t figure out what it was.</p><br/><p>I was certain.</p><br/><p>Perhaps because I was staring at that eye-catching light for too long, Crimson Hell was taking a huge chunk of my mana. One hundred thousand, one hundred fifty thousand, two hundred thousand\u2026 Now, I only had 200,000 mana left.</p><br/><p>[Did you\u2026 give up?]</p><br/><p>[No way.]</p><br/><p>I finished observing the light. I already obtained what I needed.</p><br/><p>I opened my eyes widely and struck my spear down strongly. A whirlpool of black flames cut through the wave of blood until it touched the ground hundreds of meters below. I had put all of my remaining mana in that attack.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>The huge blood tsunami split in half as the whirlpool of flames drove by, and a smile bloomed on my face. Blood poured down to the sides like a waterfall, and a blade-like pillar of blood shot up from the severed part once again.</p><br/><p>[Foolish\u2026 Such useless move\u2026! Now, you\u2019re mine\u2026!]</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t think so.]</p><br/><p>I announced with a slight smile. Immediately, Crimson Hell\u2019s flying stream of greed was revealed clearly. What was previous invisible could now be seen. There was only one reason for it, that it was now under my control. Using the countless straws he placed in me to suck out my mana, I began to suck in his mana.</p><br/><p>[What\u2026!?]</p><br/><p>[My mana, I\u2019ll be taking it back.]</p><br/><p>[You mastered Absolute Soul!]</p><br/><p>\u2018No, Sherafina, I haven\u2019t mastered it yet \u2019 I murmured in a voice she couldn\u2019t hear. \u2018You must not know. Otherwise\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>I could clearly see it. Absolute Soul was just the foundation. It was the same for Overlord. These two skills born from the Collector\u2019s Pocket Watch was nothing but a compass pointing me in the right direction. Today, I finally realized it.</p><br/><p>[My mana\u2026 How\u2026!?]</p><br/><p>[My league overwhelmed your entire colony. Simple, right?]</p><br/><p>I retorted bluntly. Was he unable to accept it? Or was he making a final struggle? Crimson Hell, which had used its mass to engulf me until now, changed its colony to hundreds of sharp tentacles which shot towards me.</p><br/><p>However, Dortu\u2019s mirrors didn\u2019t let a single one of them through. With Dortu\u2019s meticulous control, the light of my Evil Eyes, reflected by thousands of metallic mirrors, penetrated the tentacles and destroyed them. Crimson Hell finally screamed.</p><br/><p>[I, I refuse to die like this\u2026 I must take my revenge\u2026!]</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Now that you mention it.]</p><br/><p>The Floor Masters until now used Sherafina\u2019s mana to regenerate after death. Regeneration was similar to revival, yet completely different. If revivals perfectly retained one\u2019s soul, then regeneration simply returned one to his previous condition using mana. Coming back to life with regeneration resulted in a completely different soul than before.</p><br/><p>Could someone before and after regeneration be considered the same person? No. This was also why Licorice negotiated with Sherafina to obtain an Event Dungeon, and Sherafina must have accepted Licorice\u2019s request because Licorice wasn\u2019t enthusiastic about the war. In truth, I thought it was entirely possible that Licorice cooperated with the defending side. I just never planned to talk to her about it.</p><br/><p>In any case, regeneration would still allow one to come back to life, but there had to be something that even Sherafina couldn\u2019t bring back to life. For example\u2026</p><br/><p>I asked Sherafina.</p><br/><p>[Does the 85th Floor Master regenerate?]</p><br/><p>[No. As a result, once cleared, you cannot challenge the 85th Floor Master again. From now on, it will always be like that.]</p><br/><p>As I thought, it seemed not even Sherafina was capable of bringing a world\u2019s enemy back to life. A clone might be a different story, but it just wasn\u2019t possible for the true body. If a genius with the qualification to challenge Crimson Hell appeared in the future, Sherafina would have to prepare a different monster.</p><br/><p>[Secret\u2026 I\u2019ll tell you a secret\u2026! So please, let me\u2026]</p><br/><p>[No thanks.]</p><br/><p>I closed my eyes and increased the radiance of my soul\u2019s light. When I increased Peruta Circuit\u2019s speed and amplified my mana absorption rate, Crimson Hell\u2019s meek resistance disappeared completely.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>That was his end. With a cry that could turn a good dream into a nightmare, Crimson Hell crumbled down completely. The remaining waves of blood turned into grey stones and fell down to the ground like a landslide. I smacked my lips. Contrary to my expectations, there wasn\u2019t much mana to steal from him. With my original amount being 700,000, adding the amount I gained from him probably only brought it up to 800,000.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I guess that\u2019s good too.\u201d</p><br/><p>I finally deactivated Breath of Death. As I used a huge amount of it while fighting Crimson Hell, I didn\u2019t have much of it left. Thinking that I should go around Earth cleaning up monsters, I opened my eyes. In the huge Floor Master room, I was the only one, hovering solitarily in the sky.</p><br/><p>Then, a fanfare I hadn\u2019t heard in a while tickled my ears.</p><br/><p>[You became level 86. You obtained 5 bonus stats.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained the qualification to challenge Beyond\u2019s 35th floor.]</p><br/><p>[You became Platinum rank 6. You obtained the right to appoint a new explorer.]</p><br/><p>[You succeeded in defeating Crimson Hell. No dungeon explorer would be capable of believing such feat. Having defeated a world\u2019s enemy fair and square in a direct confrontation, it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to call you the dungeon\u2019s strongest. You obtained 5 skill points as a reward. Current skill points: 29]</p><br/><p>[You obtained the title, \u2018Crimson Hell Killer.\u2019 All stats increase by 5. The effect of the title will apply without having it equipped.]</p><br/><p>[You defeated Crimson Hell alone. You obtained Crimson Hell\u2019s Tattoo as a special reward.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained 1,000,000 gold.]</p><br/><p>[You received the unique reward left hidden for the First explorer. Congratulations! Your luck stat increases by 10.]</p><br/><p>[Secret. Ultimate Avarice Magic Book]</p><br/><p>I simply smiled. I didn\u2019t think it mattered all that much anymore. Crimson Hell had fought me with all its power, and it was killed by me thoroughly. I planned to take all of its power, but Sherafina interfered and refined it to a more easy-to-learn form. That was the main reason the amount of mana I obtained was so small. That was how dungeon\u2019s rewards worked.</p><br/><p>Secret rewards, special rewards, and event rewards were good because they were unique or few in number. The Orc Lord I faced on the 5th floor must have fought a countless number of explorers and regenerate a countless number of times. So how much power could it have left? Sherafina must have used a huge portion of her power to copy the Orc Lord\u2019s power and stitch it together. The result must have been the Orc Lord Set and Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry.</p><br/><p>To limit their number, she provided those who defeated the Orc Lord alone with a part that contained more of the Orc Lord\u2019s power and gifted them Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry. By doing so, she had increased the value and league of the skill. This didn\u2019t change on higher floors. As the Floor Masters were copied less, the league increased, and when it came to secret rewards, they possessed power close to the original as they were unique. I only figure out something this simple after having broken through the 85th floor.</p><br/><p>And now, with Sherafina refining the reward using all of Crimson Hell\u2019s power, both the special reward and the secret reward were unique, and I ended up getting all of Crimson Hell\u2019s power with the help of Sherafina\u2019s power. Originally, rewards from the dungeon needed a long time to get used to the user. Even then, it wasn\u2019t guaranteed that the user could perfectly wield that power.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m different now. Not to mention, I have Crimson Hell\u2019s mana\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I grinned and received Crimson Hell\u2019s Tattoo. I somewhat expected it, but Crimson Hell\u2019s Tattoo went on my fingers. When I was leisurely watching complex symbols being engraved on my ten fingers, a message rang in my ear.</p><br/><p>[You obtained Crimson Hell\u2019s Tattoo! Your magic power increases by 20%! When attacking an enemy with a weapon in hand, you will be able to steal a portion of the enemy\u2019s mana.]</p><br/><p>[You have Crimson Hell\u2019s mana and can wield it freely. The Tattoo becomes invigorated to its peak!]</p><br/><p>Now, Sherafina, tell me what I can do with a fully invigorated tattoo.</p><br/><p>Though, I already knew the answer.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

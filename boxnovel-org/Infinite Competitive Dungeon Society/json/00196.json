Absolute Soul (8)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the worst situation I could have imagined.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven I can\u2019t win against that. Before we can\u2019t, go back to the dungeon forever\u2026 decide.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aikan stopped in the air hurriedly. Daisy stared at me fixedly and pressed me for a decision. What she wanted was undoubtedly to abandon one child so that the rest can escape.</p><br/><p>However, I didn\u2019t want that. The value of a life wasn\u2019t something I could calculate. Furthermore\u2026</p><br/><p>I took my eyes off of Daisy and looked at Ren. His gaze were fixed on Panan continent\u2019s Hero. His hands were clenching his sword and shaking. As for Lebuik, she initially had a conflicted expression, but after seeing Ren, she took a battle stance with a resolute expression. She spoke with a stiff voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore my head rolls\u2026 Ren-nim must not die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak nonsense, Lebuik. Everyone must survive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cComing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy made a brief comment immediately following Ren\u2019s heartfelt statement. Immediately afterwards, a light flashed on the ground and a portion of Aikan\u2019s body disintegrated. It was an enormous amount of mana.</p><br/><p>\u201cPure aura\u2026!? What kind of brute strength is that!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, Father\u2019s strength is beyond our imagination. Still, he fell to the scheme used against Crown Prince today. Damn\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaisy, Aikan is too big of a target! Move the children to Lotte\u2019s back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat aura, fast! Living pet, more dangerous!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am the queen of the wyverns, Dark Wing Lotte! Do not look down on me, Elf!]</p><br/><p>Lotte quickly transformed into her wyvern form, grabbing children by her mouth and throwing them onto her back. I also helped move the children.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaisy, open the path with your undead. We need to go straight to the ocean! Ren, Lebuik, get on Lotte and protect the children!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Crown Prince!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I held up my Chaotic Spear. It was already surrounded by a whirlpool of chaos flames and Heroic Aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop the Hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith Deific Manifestation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, I had not forgotten about Deific Manifestation. However, now wasn\u2019t the time. Though the situation developed in one of the worst ways it could have, it wasn\u2019t the end. Plus, the moment I manifested Peruta with Deific Manifestation, I\u2026</p><br/><p>I grinned.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll try to kill me too. It\u2019s obvious if you think about why they brought out their head.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince, are you saying you\u2019ll use yourself as bait!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? You\u2019ve gotten smarter, Ren.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right, they were aiming for me. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have sent out the \u2018last remaining one.\u2019 The power of the Hero could only be vested into a living creature. There had to be an El Patiz controlling the Hero inside his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you have a better way of keeping the children safe, tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, there was no such way. I smiled wryly at Daisy, who was glaring at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t die until I save your world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn outstanding warrior must have, a cool mind, a burning heart. You\u2019re too hot, for both. As a warrior, a second-rate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know my faults. Here, take this. It\u2019s the Crystal Lair. With this, the children should be able to stay underwater safely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t accept.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a burst of light surged up from the ground once again. This time, Aikan generated a barrier of light at the area concentrated by the attack, but it seemed it wouldn\u2019t be able to last long.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaisy, hurry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026. Uuu, no matter win or lose, I\u2019ll hit you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unable to win against my stubbornness, Daisy complained and took the Crystal Lair, then summoned her undead army from her inventory.</p><br/><p>\u201cOpen the path! Head straight to the ocean!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>At the same time, the warriors only the ground roared, marking the start of a war.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome the other world\u2019s Hero!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>I jumped off of Aikan\u2019s back without hesitation. I immediately summoned Talaria and accelerated, as my spear continually grinded away monsters in its path. At the same time, I used another one of Hermes\u2019 power, Caduceus!</p><br/><p>[You summoned Caduceus. All physical abilities have been energized. The two snakes have opened their eyes. You can only use one of the snakes power.]</p><br/><p>Last time, I used the destructive power of the black snake. However, this snake would bring about devastating results if used when my opponent was higher leveled than me. Even so,I still chose the black snake.</p><br/><p>While the black snake slowly coiled around my arm, a voice rang out from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwuuuuuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, Ren-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>I turned around and doubted my eyes. Ren was falling along with me. Of course, with the frowning Lebuik.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you two doing!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Ectradion is more than enough to protect the children! Did Crown Prince think I wouldn\u2019t notice Crown Prince trying to keep us out of harm\u2019s way!? This is my world! If Crown Prince shoulders all the heavy burden and ends up dying, I won\u2019t be able to live on as a warrior!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRen-niiiiiim!\u201d</p><br/><p>This\u2026 idiot! His absurd statement almost made me shout at him to stop acting like a kid. However, a golden aura flying toward me wiped the thought off my mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext time, it will be aimed at your friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>That bastard, he knew I was trying to act as the bait! I grit my teeth and glared at the El Patiz comfortably waving his claymore. Not only did it kill the Hero and steal the Hero\u2019s power, it enjoyed itself using the Hero\u2019s power as if it was its own! The enemy in front of me wasn\u2019t a warrior. It was quite literally an insect! Unfortunately, it was an insect with great power!</p><br/><p>\u201cA mere bug dares to dishonor a once mighty warrior! Uoooooooh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he fell onto the ground, Ren roared and stuck his claymore on the ground. The ground fissured and rocks shot up, shooting towards monsters around us. That was Outburst! Even though Ren was wearing Dullahan\u2019s armor, I had forgotten about it.</p><br/><p>Then, Ren took off his armor and threw it away. Underneath was the Twin-headed Ogre Set! Right, no matter how many layers one put on, only one would be recognized as one\u2019s armor. As such, Ren put on the Twin-headed Ogre Set, which was made out of leather, and overlaid it with the metallic Dullahan Set. With that, Dullahan Set would be in effect, but when he took it off, the Twin-headed Ogre Set would take effect! How clever!</p><br/><p>Having to take off one\u2019s armor was slightly annoying, but that was certainly the best thing an explorer without the Collector\u2019s Pocket Watch could do. However, that was no way enough to defeat the El Patiz. I also hurriedly descended. Lebuik followed suit.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t block\u2026 me!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the air, Daisy\u2019s shout rang out. The undead monsters raised their voices and used their skills as they swept through the flying monsters. Though the El Patiz army on the ground looked uncomfortable, they were undoubtedly focused on us. Kuk, the damned golden aura was flying toward us again!</p><br/><p>[You are injured by an aura of a powerful league. It is difficult to heal the injury from natural healing or ordinary potions.]</p><br/><p>Although I dodged the attack, I was still damaged by it. I grit my teeth and circulated Peruta Circuit as I landed on the ground. The enemy was laughing, not far away from me.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeific Manifestation!\u201d[1. Remember, Deific Manifestation = Kang Shin (it\u2019s the same word)]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you calling me by my name now, Ren\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>As I was focused on the enemy completely, I didn\u2019t look at Ren who called me. However, he didn\u2019t respond. Then, the mana in the air began to burn. Wait, was this\u2026!?</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaaang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren roared violently. The roar filled with mana even made my ears ring and caused the enemies to stagger. Using this opportunity, I glanced at the distance. The moment they met my eyes, countless number of enemy soldiers turned to stone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, quite a cowardly move for someone who calls himself a hero!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCut the bullshit and attack!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, Ren-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren charged across the ground before me. A golden aura enveloped his body, as if a golden mane sprouted up. He had undoubtedly used Deific Manifestation. If he solo-cleared the 5th floor, he surely had that skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle kitten, I\u2019ll take care of you today too! The Panan continent belongs to us, El Patiz!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren seemed a bit strange. Though he was beastly, he never only roared. What did you summon, Ren!? Furthermore, the amount of aura in his claymore was powerful enough to contend with a Hero\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, a mere beast!\u201d</p><br/><p>The claymore held up by the El Patiz clashed with Ren\u2019s own. It seemed to have been caught off guard by Ren\u2019s powerful strength as it fell back slightly. Meanwhile, I charged forward. Lebuik also charged on with a stern expression I had never seen before.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let Ren-nim die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuaaaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You used Frozen Roar! All enemies in the battlefield freezes in place. All allies temporarily become super-armored and has all abilities increased by 50%. Your chance of landing a critical hit doubles when fighting enemies affected by Frozen Roar.]</p><br/><p>The moment I used Frozen Roar to help Ren\u2019s attack, all enemies in the battlefield froze. With their resistance lowered during freezing, many fell to my Evil Eyes\u2019 power and turned to stone. However, the El Patiz in the Hero\u2019s body, the world\u2019s enemy, wasn\u2019t affected. He easily bounced away Frozen Roar\u2019s effect. Then, Ren roared like a beast, as if he was stimulated by my roar.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaang!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Golden Lion\u2019s Roar activates! All enemies with resistances under SS rank faints temporarily! All those that wield the Golden Lion\u2019s aura have their attack power tripled for one attack! All those following the Golden Lion have their attack power doubled for one attack!]</p><br/><p>In an instant, Ren\u2019s claymore shone with a brilliant light. As if to cut apart the heavens, his claymore slashed down. However, the world\u2019s enemy snorted and received the attack with his claymore. The earth tremored as if it would crumble, and Ren\u2019s body was pushed backwards. Shouldn\u2019t he be super-armored!?</p><br/><p>\u201cLebuik!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lebuik sped up and received Ren. Damn, he directly received an attack boosted by Frozen Roar and a unique skill. Just how much of a monster was he!? No, rather than that, if things continued, it was possible for Ren and Lebuik to lose their lives.</p><br/><p>\u201cElemental Tempest!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, that was that and this was this. While the enemy was busy receiving Ren\u2019s claymore, I readied my area of effect attack and shot it forward. With the combined effort of Frozen Roar, Evil Eyes, and Elemental Tempest, the army had dwindled down quite a bit. The enemy only realized what I did after it pushed away Ren.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare attack my subordinates like a sneaky rat!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m a rat, you\u2019re a flea! For someone who stole the Hero\u2019s body, you sure must have been afraid if you brought along your army!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>It shot out another terrifying golden aura. This attack couldn\u2019t be dodged with ordinary movements. I used Divine Speed to move far away, then charged towards the El Patiz. I couldn\u2019t let it fight Ren! As such, there was only one thing I could do\u2026</p><br/><p>At that moment, Daisy messaged me. It was the perfect timing.</p><br/><p>[Done! Children, underwater!]</p><br/><p>[That makes it sound like you drowned them!]</p><br/><p>In the distance, I could see Aikan\u2019s large body going underwater. The flying monsters that were fiercely attacking Aikan just a moment ago lost their target and started attacking the other undead monsters in the air.</p><br/><p>With that, I heaved a sigh of relief. Good! The request is a success! The only thing left now is\u2026!</p><br/><p>When I took a step forward with such thought, a large claymore pierced through my stomach. In front of my eyes was a beastman with a golden lion\u2019s mane. I could feel his powerful energy and see his underhanded eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuhu, I aimed for when your guard was down. Weren\u2019t you too relaxed, Hero? After all, you are our target.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk\u2026 Damn, again. How unpleasant\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing his clash with Ren, the only impression I got was that he was incredibly powerful, a critical error on my part. Although I was still under the effect of Divine Speed, he had caught up to me. I could see my HP falling rapidly. In the end, Diehard activated once again. This was the first time Diehard was used so often. It was the second time since I came to the world. Really, Dimensional Mercenary job sucked!</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, you can\u2019t turn into a fly this time, can you, Hero?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you knew.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was a special El Patiz, you see. It can communicate with me. Know thy enemy and know yourself, and you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. Isn\u2019t it the most basic rule?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, what now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSleep. When you wake up, you will be filled with nothing but happiness.\u201d</p><br/><p>The El Patiz twisted its sword. At the same time, countless number of bugs crawled out of the claymore and tried to enter my stomach. Damn, though I was somewhat expecting it, it wasn\u2019t trying to finish me here! Before the bugs could enter my body, I shouted urgently.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaduceus, activate!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Your target\u2019s level is overwhelmingly higher! The physical injuries of the target will be overwritten. The target is currently corroded by an unknown existence! Prepare for corrosion!]</p><br/><p>Hearing the hopeless message, I smiled. Message noona really worried about me!</p><br/><p>\u201cWith this, we, El Patiz, will come to possess two Heroes\u2019 po\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>It's happy declaration was suddenly cut short. At the same time the Hero\u2019s body fell back without strength, something inside my head stung\u2026 and the presence of the world\u2019s enemy completely disappeared.</p><br/><p>[You defeated the world\u2019s enemy of The Panan continent! However, unless you subjugate all seeds, another enemy might appear!]</p><br/><p>The message that popped up proved that the world\u2019s enemy had disappeared. Plus, the ball of light floating in front me was undoubtedly the power of the Hero.</p><br/><p>In an instant, the battlefield became silent and countless number of eyes fell on me. I received them all and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust as planned.\u201d</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>What happened!? Find out in the next chapter! (It will also be the end of the long Panan continent arc). Note that Panan continent\u2019s enemy was special in that they took over the residents\u2019 bodies. They\u2019re very different from the Demon Lord. If he was the opponent, plan aside, they had to run for their lives!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Keikaku doori!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

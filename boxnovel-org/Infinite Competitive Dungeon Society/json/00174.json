What Is Not Allowed for Her (5)</p><br/><p>I ended up coming to the guild house with Loretta without much thought, but\u2026 wasn\u2019t this the first time I brought Loretta here? Yes, it was\u2026 After realizing that, I began to sweat.</p><br/><p>\u2018If Hwaya or Ludia sees me\u2026!\u2019</p><br/><p>A war that destroys the entire Residential Area might break out! However, I soon became relieved after discovering that no one was in the guild house. Loretta pulled on me.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on, Shin-nim. Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta should have an idea about who\u2019s in my guild. Was she not curious? Though that\u2019s why I thought, I didn\u2019t ask her. There was no reason to pull back the disaster I avoided.</p><br/><p>\u201cMake sure to introduce me to Shin-nim\u2019s guildmates next time, okay? Huhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta\u2026 You scary woman!</p><br/><p>As I had already explored Beyond\u2019s Residential Area, there wasn\u2019t much fog, and it wasn\u2019t hard to find the second explorer, Daisy Ectradion\u2019s mansion.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRe\u2026 Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026 I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who suggested coming along.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m extremely happy because I\u2019m with Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t respond and continued to walk silently. She also followed suit without saying anything. After 20 minutes, we finally arrived at the second explorer\u2019s mansion. Only then did I sigh and come to a stop. Really, I thought I\u2019d die from the awkwardness.</p><br/><p>[Go back.]</p><br/><p>Now, I felt like I understood what the mana surrounding this mansion did. As such, I wasn\u2019t surprised when the communication channel got noisy.</p><br/><p>[I came because I have something to talk to you about. Can you make time? If possible, I\u2019d like to add you to my friend list.]</p><br/><p>[Friend list? You don\u2019t even know my name. There\u2019s no way you could\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me.]</p><br/><p>[Can I?]</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Go ahead.]</p><br/><p>I added Daisy Ectradion, and she accepted it. I immediately messaged her.</p><br/><p>[As you expect, I met with Desert Scorpion\u2019s guild master. He talked about you.]</p><br/><p>[Lodert Hydelcyon, head of Cyon Empire\u2019s Royal Knights.]</p><br/><p>[Yes, him.]</p><br/><p>It was the first time I heard his full name, but I still answered calmly. I felt like I was worthy of getting an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.</p><br/><p>[You\u2026 If you fought him at your current strength, there\u2019s no way you could be safe and sound.]</p><br/><p>[The reason you\u2019re cooped up in your mansion is related to him, right?]</p><br/><p>[What if it is?]</p><br/><p>I faced Loretta. She tilted her head cutely. Nowadays, she was trying to show off her charms whenever she could. She must have realized it was working!</p><br/><p>[Him and his guild are over. It was found out that they bribed an administrative guild.]</p><br/><p>[How could that\u2026 Could it be the person you brought along?]</p><br/><p>[Precisely.]</p><br/><p>There was no answer for a while. Then, the fog covering the mansion cleared up a bit, and the mansion\u2019s gate opened.</p><br/><p>[I want to hear what happened.]</p><br/><p>I felt like I would get an alert saying \u2018Quest Success!\u2019 With a smile, I entered the mansion with Loretta. The mansion must have been neglected for a long time as all sorts of thornbushes, vines, and weed covered the area. She must have never left the estate\u2026 I called Sharana and Peika.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you clean up the garden?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Of course! Should I cut everything up?]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll burn everything. Let\u2019s go, annoying wind girl.]</p><br/><p>[After you, perverted worm-ssi.]</p><br/><p>Please\u2026 don\u2019t fight\u2026! Regardless of their relationship, the garden was cleared up in 3 minutes with their cooperation and went back to being a spacious garden. It was as if one hundred professional gardeners had worked on it.</p><br/><p>[Elementals are\u2026 really strong.]</p><br/><p>After we finished cleaning up the garden, the mansion\u2019s front door opened and its spacious hall showed itself beyond the door. I entered the door along with Loretta and the elementals. Even after they finished the job, Sharana and Peika didn\u2019t think to go back. Sharana sat on my shoulder modestly, while Peika coiled around my arm. Since I wasn\u2019t in battle and had to worry about using mana, I didn\u2019t particularly mind them being out.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m on the second floor. The room furthest into your left.]</p><br/><p>I opened the door to that room. I expected it to be extremely messy, but it was actually immaculate. The window taking up the entire side of the room was open, letting air through. Daisy Ectradion was on the bed in the corner of the room.</p><br/><p>She was lying face down, wearing nothing but a white dress shirt. Her black lace panties were in full view, but Loretta poked my eyes to block the view. Ow!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Loretta!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, so the Evil Eyes can petrify me too\u2026 Huhuhu, you\u2019ve grown so much, Shin-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta shook her hands, and her partially petrified fingers went back to normal. She gave me a meaningful smile, but I continued to quibble.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you poke my eyes!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t look away quickly, I\u2019m going to attack you again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn, but I want to see more! I\u2019m kidding, of course!</p><br/><p>While I looked away, Loretta approached Daisy Ectradion and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wearing anything underneath!? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re trying to seduce my Shin-nim!? Do you want to get hit, customer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have\u2026 the strength\u2026 skirts are\u2026 uncomfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and wearing something!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only have the uniform\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuu! Then at least cover yourself with a blanket!\u201d</p><br/><p>It took another 30 seconds before I was allowed to look again. Daisy Ectradion was now sitting on the bed, wrapped in her blanket like a sushi roll. From her uncomfortable expression and her fully buttoned up dress shirt, I could tell that Loretta buttoned her up too.</p><br/><p>I somewhat expected it from what Lodert Hydelcyon said, but she was gorgeous. Her ash-like hair flowed down her shoulders, and her ominous red eyes had a magic power that drew people in. They were undoubtedly Evil Eyes of some sort. I could recognize it more clearly now that I possessed them as well.</p><br/><p>Her facial features were slightly unnatural. Her red irises took up more space in her eyes than the sclera, making her look a bit creepy. Her nose was small and stout, while her lips were overly thin and ash-colored like her hair. Also, her ears were small and sharp. Her lips and ears were especially unnatural. Her skin was also a pale grey-white. After a bit of thinking, I asked her.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I ask what race you are\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn\u2026 I\u2019m a grey elf.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><br/><p>She narrowed her eyes and stared up at me. Then, she asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened\u2026 to Lodert Hydelcyon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSimply put, he picked a fight with my guild and got his guild destroyed. He lost his qualification as a dungeon explorer and was kicked out to his world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo his world? My world\u2026 Sylon continent was ruined. It\u2019s been taken over by the Book Walkers.\u201d</p><br/><p>I immediately made a silent prayer. Good luck surviving, Lodert.</p><br/><p>Ectradion became quiet after that and looked at Loretta who was standing next to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. He can\u2019t set foot in the dungeon anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She seemed to be immersed in thought. Then, she surprisingly bowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but I can't-do it. I can\u2019t enter your guild.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything, did I\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Evil Eyes. They receive others\u2019 thoughts or send them my thoughts. Because you possess Evil Eyes, I can only read a little\u2026 but I thought you were lying, so I read your mind. Sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>She got me! To think she could do it so stealthily without me noticing. Damn, it was my fault for letting my guard down based on her appearance. I hit my cheeks, then asked her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing. I can\u2019t read your mind at all\u2026 Really. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell done, Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pat me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, the woman. I couldn\u2019t read you at all, but I could read it just now\u2026 Why didn\u2019t you do what you were thinking of?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoops. It seems I let my guard down. Geez, I\u2019m still inexperienced. Shin-nim, can you leave the room for a moment? I\u2019ll call you back once I compose myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like you\u2019re going to do something to Ectradion, so no.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta gave up on her plans to bury Daisy Ectradion. Relieved, I asked her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was my final goal to ask you to enter my guild. For now, I\u2019ll be happy if you continue your activities as an explorer. There\u2019s no one to hold you back now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it.\u201d</p><br/><p>She widened her eyes, then blinked a couple of times.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 want to try again. My world collapsed, but if I climb the dungeon again\u2026 maybe\u2026 I can chase them out\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 a necromancer.\u201d</p><br/><p>She continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t obtain corpses in the dungeon\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have any?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOn the decisive day, half. In the dungeon, the remaining half to Hydelcyon. I lost everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, she raised her head and flashed her red eyes. I instinctively knew she was trying to convey something to me. I relaxed my Evil Eyes and let her thoughts flow into me in a way that it wasn\u2019t overbearing.</p><br/><p>Daisy Ectradion was the head of the military unit of Selone, an elven country in the Sylon continent. At a young age, she was chosen to become a First Dungeon explorer. She proliferated and became the strongest in Selone. As she continued to get stronger, she could turn stronger demonic beasts into undead. Eventually, she obtained a god\u2019s true name and entered Beyond. It went without saying that she was the forefront warrior in the war against her world\u2019s invaders, the Book Walkers.</p><br/><p>However, the day her world\u2019s Hero died, she lost half of the army she commanded. The surviving people lost their will to resist the Book Walkers, but Ectradion continued to fight. It was then that a conflict broke out between her and Lodert.</p><br/><p>Lodert had always harbored evil intentions against her, and using the Event Raid that erupted when they were climbing the dungeon together; he crushed the remaining half of her forces. As they belonged to different countries, the Empire who wanted to command Ectradion as they wished supported Lodert\u2019s scheme. As Ectradion knew this, she returned to her mansion without going back to Sylon. Lodert had wanted her to offer her body in exchange for letting her recreate her army, and Ectadion had refused to accept his terms.</p><br/><p>When she tried to obtain corpses some other way, she could not achieve her goals in Sylon because Lodert obstructed her. It was the same when she tried to obtain them from other worlds\u2019 explorers, as the guild Lodert operated, the Desert Scorpion, prevented them. In the first place, monsters strong enough to help clear Beyond didn\u2019t come out for sale. She was no longer allowed to make an army for herself.</p><br/><p>In the end, rather than submitting to such a cowardly man, she decided to give up on her world. Just like that, she became a neet.</p><br/><p>Even if she had a god\u2019s power, as a necromancer, she couldn\u2019t advance in the dungeon by herself. It was especially the case as an explorer of Beyond. Just like that, for the past 73 years, she was lying on the bed of her mansion.</p><br/><p>\u201cI already gave up. Corpses\u2026 To clear Beyond\u2019s 12th floor, normal corpses won\u2019t do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you want to just die in your mansion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn\u2026 Thank you for ruining Hydelcyon and making him so miserable. Now, there\u2019s no reason for me to raise my whip. I have\u2026 no regrets.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, she lay back down and closed her eyes. I could finally see her clearly. For a hero of Selone and an explorer of Beyond, her body was petite. Perhaps it was a trait of the elves, but her chest and butt were certainly voluptuous. However, she still had a small frame. Her shoulders were narrow, and her limbs were pitifully thin.</p><br/><p>I felt like I was watching a withering flower. I couldn\u2019t just let her be.</p><br/><p>\u201cEctradion. If\u2026 If there are corpses you can be satisfied with, will you continue exploring?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I have to enter your guild?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll back down for now. After all, I can\u2019t bother you with my world\u2019s problem. Once I push back the danger my world\u2019s currently facing, I\u2019ll ask you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>At my words, Loretta burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, what are you talking about!? Shin-nim is talking like Shin-nim is going to defeat other worlds\u2019 enemies!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about, Loretta?\u201d</p><br/><p>I tilted my head and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce I defeat the two enemies my world is facing, do you think I\u2019ll have anything to be afraid of? In that case, why wouldn\u2019t I go defeat other worlds\u2019 enemies?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, you really\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As my words were too reasonable, Loretta became speechless. Then, I heard the sound of a blanket falling. I turned my head toward the direction of the sound. Daisy Ectradion, who put her blanket aside, was standing up and looking at me. Her Evil Eyes were shining with an exceptional red light.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe corpses\u2026 Let me see them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Good! That\u2019s what I wanted to see! With a grin, I answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, wear a skirt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Translator's note:</p><br/><p>The popularity contest will be ongoing until the end of this week!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

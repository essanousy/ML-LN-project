The Last Member (3)</p><br/><p>Their methods made me speechless. These beings that called themselves kings not only cooperated together, but they did employ such an underhanded scheme to keep me away from everyone else. I didn\u2019t know what was happening on Earth, but what I had to do was simple.</p><br/><p>I pulled out my Chaotic Spear. Chaos flames naturally ignited above the spear and formed a whirlpool with Peruta Circuit.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like I\u2019ll have to crush you quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I enjoy confidence from warriors, but you should know the difference between confidence and arrogance, Hero!]</p><br/><p>Immediately afterward, the Beast King opened his mouth and roared. Sharana quickly materialized and enveloped me in a wall of wind. When the two collided, my body was blasted back with an inexpressible howl. I barely managed to stop myself by calling Sharana. The Beast King then broke out into an uncontrollable laughter.</p><br/><p>[Kuhahahahaha! How cute!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou came up with this scheme because you were so afraid of me, and now you\u2019re looking down on me?\u201d</p><br/><p>In a case like this, this could only mean one of three things. First was that this was all an act. However, he didn\u2019t have a reason to. He might be setting up a trap by pretending to underestimate me, but he should know I wouldn\u2019t fall for such a cheap trick.</p><br/><p>Second, what he said before was a lie. There was no plan and the three kings weren\u2019t all on Earth. In this case, his goal would have been to provoke me and make me impatient to force me to make mistakes.</p><br/><p>But if that were the case, the way he was acting now didn\u2019t make sense. Lying to the enemy to force a mistake was something the weaker side would do to a stronger side, not the other way around.</p><br/><p>The third possibility was that there was someone else who formulated this plan and made the kings move. This was the most probable situation. I had an idea who it could be too. The one behind the Five Kings, he must have made his move.</p><br/><p>[Will you fight!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I have any other choice?\u201d</p><br/><p>After analyzing the situation in my head, I reached my hands towards the sky. I didn\u2019t have any time to waste fighting someone like him. A beast was best fought with another beast. As I was using this power for the first time, I focused my attention on the principle of this power and guided the power within my body.</p><br/><p>I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cNandi!\u201d</p><br/><p>My sight seemed to be dyed red. It was the result of a single word I shouted. A terrifying energy gathered in the sky, and a bone-chilling cry rang out even though its body hadn\u2019t fully formed.</p><br/><p>[GUOOOOOOOO!]</p><br/><p>[Hm?]</p><br/><p>The Beast King tilted his head. He raised his front leg and slammed down on the ground.</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t know what you did, but it looks like I better subdue you now!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just by slamming down on the ground, he caused the earth to quake and fissure. Shards of rocks sprung up into the air almost like he used Gaia Buster with an increased range. I shot up into the air and checked my current condition.</p><br/><p>First, the stats and skills I earned from climbing the dungeon had decreased by over fifty percent. As unfortunate as it was, with Radiance, Peruta Circuit, and power of gods\u2019 true names, I felt like I could still take him on. At this moment\u2026!</p><br/><p>[GUOOOOOOOOOOO!]</p><br/><p>Along with a terrifying, it made its appearance. Large crimson body, two dignifying horns, and a completely insane pair of crimson eyes. Snorting from its nostrils, the bull, Nandi, stared at the Beast King! Shockingly, it was just as big as the Beast King.</p><br/><p>[Kuhahahaha! I wondered what it was, but it\u2019s just a cow! Kuhahaha, you\u2019re truly adorable, Hero! Are you really the Savior Hero?]</p><br/><p>[GUOOOOOO!]</p><br/><p>Nandi didn\u2019t wait for my signal and immediately charged at the Beast King with its head tucked under. The Beast King sneered and jumped back lightly. Of course, even a \u2018light\u2019 jump from the Beast King caused the earth to cave in.</p><br/><p>As soon as the Beast King moved, Nandi also changed its direction. The boulders shooting up as he charged forward seemed powerful enough to crush a hundred people. It was truly a battle of two monsters.</p><br/><p>[How laughable!]</p><br/><p>[GUOOOOOO!]</p><br/><p>In the end, the Beast King and Nandi clashed. One of Nandi\u2019s twisted horns pierced the Beast King\u2019s shoulder! A fountain of blood exploded in the air.</p><br/><p>[Kuk, this is a divine beast!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou realized it too late!\u201d</p><br/><p>After striking the Beast King once, Nandi didn\u2019t think to fall back as he continued to push forward while waving his head around. Not only was a bull picking a fight against a lion, it was even pushing it back! No, now wasn\u2019t the time to leisurely watch a fight. Although I didn\u2019t tell the Beast King, I only had five minutes to utilize Nandi!</p><br/><p>\u201cSharana, quickly. As quickly as you can!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes!]</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, help me. I need your power.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Anytime!]</p><br/><p>Sharan and Peika both burst with power. I drew out the power of the Lightning God to its limit. Almost as if I transformed into a lightning bolt, I was shining with a golden radiance.</p><br/><p>[A mere bull!]</p><br/><p>At the same time, the Beast King opened his mouth and roared at Nandi. Though he was a lion, he could breathe out acid and his roar evenly carried physical strength.</p><br/><p>[KAAAOOOO!]</p><br/><p>Nandi\u2019s skin peeled off and blood spurted from its body too. However, Nandi was completely unfazed by the injuries and even bucked more fiercely. The Beast King began to shed more blood. At this moment, I landed on his back with my outstretched spear stabbing into it!</p><br/><p>[Kuk!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are huge. You\u2019re even bigger than the Lava King!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Get off my back!]</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you pay too much attention to me, who\u2019s going to feed my Nandi!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nandi seemed to have understood my words as it kicked the ground with its back foot and struck the Beast King once more. When its horn stabbed into the same place it did before, the Beast King had no choice but to take his eyes off me. As he kicked Nandi away with his front leg, he shouted.</p><br/><p>[You impertinent being! Fine, I will end you first!]</p><br/><p>[KAOOOOO!]</p><br/><p>Shiva\u2019s power was truly terrifying. Not even a single one of his power was underwhelming. I raised my spear, and this time, I activated Trishula. Now was the time to do as much damage as I could to the Beast King! I just had to strike him as many times as I could.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you heard of Lightning Spear Storm!? UOOOOOOO!\u201d</p><br/><p>All I saw was a wide open back. I decided to think of it as a plot of land. To make it into a fertile field, I would use my spear as a hoe to turn this land upside down! When I thrust my spear, the Beast King\u2019s powerful resistance tried to bounce me back. Having lost the dungeon\u2019s power, penetrating his skin was honestly difficult, but with Trishula\u2019s divine power and Peruta Circuit\u2019s rotational force, I had enough power to break through. In the end, the spear I thrust forward was barely enough to penetrate his skin.</p><br/><p>[Huhahahaha, this is the power of a Hero!? How laughable!]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll start to itch soon. Nandi, continue!\u201d</p><br/><p>[KUOOOOOO!]</p><br/><p>Now that I broke through his skin once, my job was easy. This small hole I made would soon become a tunnel!</p><br/><p>I thrust out once again, and again, and again. This wasn\u2019t even close to the Lightning Spear Storm\u2019s true speed! I poured mana into the muscles in my arm and used Divine Speed. The speed I was thrust out with increased by several times.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although there were no messages, dozens of white bones shot up from the sky and struck the point I attacked. Thorn Throne\u2019s effect had activated! Immediately, the hole I created expanded and a stream of blood wet my armor.</p><br/><p>[Kuaak?]</p><br/><p>It seemed not even the Beast King could ignore the previous attack. He shook his body fiercely and struggled to force me off his back. As Nandi\u2019s horn was still stuck in his shoulder, its wound expanded and more blood began to shoot out. On the other hand, I desperately held on by grabbing the spear stuck on his back. To think I would become this weak by losing my stats! I couldn\u2019t help but grit my teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I\u2019d loooooose!\u201d</p><br/><p>The techniques I developed didn\u2019t disappear just because I lost a bit of my strength! I held my spear with both hands, focusing my physical power into a single point and striking down. Over half of the spear dug into his back. It seemed he could no longer ignore me.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>The moment he screamed, his body trembled and the hair on his body stood straight. Having a bad feeling, I immediately utilized Divine Speed to pull my spear out and jump into the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un!]</p><br/><p>[Taste the power of this king!]</p><br/><p>And my suspicion became reality. The hair standing on his body began to shoot out! Although Ruyue immediately formed a barrier around me the moment she was summoned, with the tough and sharp thorn-like hair flooded towards me, the barrier couldn\u2019t last long.</p><br/><p>When I realized what was happening, I immediately created a lightning storm using Lightning God\u2019s power and Peruta Circuit\u2019s power. The thorns which lost someone of their strength while penetrating Ruyue\u2019s barrier shot towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>[KUAAANG!]</p><br/><p>My painful scream was immediately drowned out by Nandi\u2019s scream. As I struggled to endure the pain and circulated Peruta Circuit, a voice suddenly whispered into my ear.</p><br/><p>[Master, I will use my final power.]</p><br/><p>This voice was\u2026 Nandi! He was surprising respectful!?</p><br/><p>[If I use this power, I will disappear. The enemy still has his power, so do not let your guard down, Master.]</p><br/><p>Nandi then took a step back, pulling out his horn from the Beast King\u2019s body. Meanwhile, I pulled out all the thorns stuck to my body with my whirlpool\u2019s power. Nandi and I seemed to have shed more blood just now than the Beast King has in the entire fight. There wasn\u2019t a single place that didn\u2019t hurt.</p><br/><p>But it was even more important to focus on Peruta Circuit now. I gritted my teeth and aimed my spear towards the Beast King.</p><br/><p>[Immediately after I use my power, the enemy will be open to attack. Attack then, Master.]</p><br/><p>[Thanks, Nandi. Take care of me from now.]</p><br/><p>[It is my honor to serve you, as you will walk a path worthy of Shiva\u2019s name.]</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Nandi began to glow with a bright red light. He immediately caught the Beast King\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>[You\u2026! Fine, let\u2019s try it!]</p><br/><p>The Beast King\u2019s mane stood up. At the same time, his body began to glow with a golden light! Meanwhile, I prepared myself to deal a fatal attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cSky God\u2019s Rage, Sky God\u2019s Play!\u201d</p><br/><p>I wanted to use Overlord if possible, but the Beast King wasn\u2019t the only enemy I had to face today, and what Ciara said still hung in my mind. In fact, I was hesitant to even use Sky God\u2019s Rage. Still, I had no other choice. Otherwise, I couldn\u2019t beat him.</p><br/><p>Now that I did, I was fully confident in being able to defeat him. All that was left was Nandi\u2019s attack and my willpower!</p><br/><p>[KUAAAAANG!]</p><br/><p>[Then I will see you in a month.]</p><br/><p>Nandi\u2019s gentlemanly voice, which didn\u2019t fit his roar, tickled my ear. With that, Nandi\u2019s entire body transformed into a blood-like form and attacked the Beast King. The Beast King also let out a golden roar.</p><br/><p>[This is the price you pay for challenging the king of beasts!]</p><br/><p>Two giant powers clashed with each other, and spatial rend appeared in this temporary world. With power great enough to overwhelm the power of space, it was possible to break this world created by the dungeon\u2019s power!</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, as their powers weren\u2019t directed at this space but at each other, they couldn\u2019t tear through this space. Still, the shock from their clash was immense. The ground fissured uncontrollably and mana turned into radiant crystals from the fierce explosions they caused. It was a scene I had never seen before.</p><br/><p>In the end, the Beast King was the only one left standing. From a huge gaping wound on his body, blood endlessly poured out, forming a river of blood from the treeless fissured land. Still, he had survived.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaaa! Who dares to stand against me!? Other than him, there is no one that can kill me! Yes, not even the Hero can\u2026 Mm?]</p><br/><p>He finally seemed to have realized I was missing. He was stronger than the Lava King, but he seemed to be stupider to make up for it.</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Where did he go? Did he die?]</p><br/><p>The Beast King murmured. As I heard him, I couldn\u2019t help but grin.</p><br/><p>Then, I immediately made my move.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Hermes (6)</p><br/><p>It was only after about two hours that the situation changed. At that time, father and I were roasting some pork belly over a hot grill. Although the soldiers on the battlefield looked and acted like humans, after we realized they were monsters created by the dungeon, we stopped caring whether they killed or partied with each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, why do you have pork belly in your inventory? Nom, nom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGulp. Don\u2019t you know? If you put meat in your inventory, it\u2019ll be fresher than if you stored it in the most high-tech refrigerator! You can store it right after you cut it for maximum freshness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019ve tested that before too!\u201d</p><br/><p>I used the same principle when I bought Yua a hamburger. I see, so that\u2019s why father carried around meat in his inventory! Although I frequently ate my meals in the dungeon, I had never thought to bring meat. As expected of a dungeon explorer of 27 years! So he didn\u2019t just hunt orcs for 20 years!</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, have a drink.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I should really be the one to fill your glass.\u201d</p><br/><p>After exchanging some soju, we joked around as we talked. Suddenly, however, I felt a gaze on me.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, did you notice that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Notice what?\u201d</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve thought this for a while, but father really did have weaker senses than me. I asked Peika who was sitting on my head drinking drops of alcohol from her mini elemental-sized cup.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, can you go survey the area?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hmnya? Master, what\u2019s a sumvay?]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s not even a word...\u2019 I realized Peika was immobilized. I didn\u2019t know that elementals were weak to alcohol. It was my mistake. I had fallen for Peika\u2019s cute plea of asking me for a juice she\u2019d never seen before!</p><br/><p>While I was distracted by Peika\u2019s drunk appearance, the gaze watching us had disappeared. It seemed father had finally noticed something as he was looking around, but it was too late.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, was it the zombie?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe it was an wild animal that wanted some meat.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Masteeeer! What\u2019s a sumvay!?]</p><br/><p>Of course, I didn\u2019t think it was nothing. Even so, there was nothing we could do now except continue eating meat. As such, I decided to just let things be. Also, Peika, sumvay isn\u2019t a word!</p><br/><p>The twilight had passed and night time approached.</p><br/><p>Father was the first to sleep, and I stood guard. After three hours, father got up and I slept. When I got up after three hours of sleep, it was still middle of the night. Under the dark, starless night sky, only a pale moon was lighting up the world.</p><br/><p>It seemed the soldiers didn\u2019t want to fight at night, as both sides had returned to their camps. However, the corpses of the dead soldiers were still on the battlefield. The nose-piercing stench of blood had permeated the battlefield and was even reaching where I was.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like those corpses will rise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Where else would zombies come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Keeping our eyes on the cruel battlefield, we snacked on some instant ramen. I realized that partying with father kept making me eat things. Usually, people ate less as they aged, but father always had something in his mouth, saying that a martial artist must eat well. With this habit following him into the dungeon, his inventory was most likely filled with food.</p><br/><p>Once I started focusing on the dungeon, I didn\u2019t like to eat anything before I cleared a floor. As such, it was a bit hard to match father\u2019s style. Peika, on the other hand, seemed to like ramen noodles, as she happily ate the ramen one noodle strand at a time.</p><br/><p>[This is yummy. It doesn\u2019t exist in the Spirit Realm.]</p><br/><p>\u201cEat lots.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Master, I love you!]</p><br/><p>When I patted Peika on the head as she slurped more ramen noodles, father interrupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat have you been talking to since a while ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you, I became an Elementalist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I adopt one too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElementals aren\u2019t pets.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, three got up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t count elementals like\u2026 what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree got up.\u201d</p><br/><p>I turned to face the battlefield. Under the moonlight, the once dead were rising. We could notice because of our heightened senses from level ups. It would take a while before each camp found out.</p><br/><p>Father asked, \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHunt them, of course. I hate being backstabbed\u2026 so!\u201d Answering father, I threw my spear into the darkness. I didn\u2019t have enough time to use Spirit Aura, but Heroic Strike was still activated. With its radiant white light, it flew through the air like lightning. It was much faster than before. I was surprised as I did not know the 15 percent speed increase applied to thrown weapons.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You obtained 1,500 gold.]</p><br/><p>\u201cBeldon died!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose guys found out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKill them before they kill us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately afterwards, I pointed my hands toward where the voices came from and ordered Peika.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already too late! Peika!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Thunder Blast!]</p><br/><p>After gulping down the ramen noodle in her mouth, Peika shouted as she shone with a golden light. A bolt of lightning as thick as my arm shot out from her body, lighting up the darkness.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe shield!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, the shield magic got broken!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn elemental? Who are they!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately after I called Peika, I grabbed the Silver Spear from my inventory and charged forward. Thanks to Dash, my running speed was incomparably faster than before. My aim was the crowd in the distance whom I suspected were the ones responsible for making the zombies.</p><br/><p>Father and I had both noticed them at the same time we noticed the zombies. There were five\u2026 no, four of them, since one of them had already died. They all had black hoods draped over their heads and were carrying small wooden staves. They were the extremely small kind that magicians would carry around to hide their identity. With all the clues in front of me, I figured they were black magicians.</p><br/><p>\u201cS-Shield isn\u2019t enough to stop him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, r-run!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should have been under stealth magic!\u201d</p><br/><p>They might have been able to deal with us if they immediately used magic, but instead, they panicked and hesitated. It could just be that their chants were too long or that they didn\u2019t have the materials needed to cast magic. However, that was none of my business.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-Wait! Even if you kill us, you can\u2019t stop what\u2019s happening!\u201d</p><br/><p>One of them shouted in a high-pitched voice. It was a woman. However, since I had already decided to kill them, their sex did not matter. They were monsters. They were monsters.</p><br/><p>Right. They were monsters.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t kill you, what are you going to do to us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course we\u2019d kill\u2014\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cElemental Tempest!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kukuku, owner of a strong power calls me.]</p><br/><p>[Destruction. Flowing blood amidst ear-splitting screams. That is what I want.]</p><br/><p>[He tore apart the black magicians. He\u2019s just my type!]</p><br/><p>Because of the place I was in, the elementals coming to assist me were all dark. Hopefully, they wouldn\u2019t be weaker because of it. My spear was shining with black light from the elementals. I thrust forward, and a storm swept through the entire area.</p><br/><p>\u201cDarkness Arrow! Kuaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cS-Shield! Kuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Elemental Tempest was a skill that gravely injured even the Floor Masters. Some random magicians couldn\u2019t possibly block it. Three of the black magicians failed in their attempts to block Elemental Tempest and were instantly torn to shreds. Although it was only for a moment, my eyes caught sight of a rather gruesome scene.</p><br/><p>Damn it. I had used Elemental Tempest to kill them quickly, but I ended up seeing something unsightly. It was a good thing that the monsters that died in the dungeon disappeared into thin air, only leaving behind their loot and not their remains.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhak! Haa, haa\u2026 damn it, so strong\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Coincidentally, the black magician, who had talked to briefly, was the only one who managed to escape the range of Elemental Tempest. It seemed she gave up trying to block it with magic and instead gave her all in using her legs to run. Even so, she could not completely dodge it. Her hood was ripped apart and her back was severely injured. Coughing up a mouthful of blood, she opened her mouth with great difficulty.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough, Odd Winged Ravens\u2019 dream won\u2019t end in a place like this\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Winged Ravens?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-That\u2019s right. From this war, we will make the world know of our exist\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, okay. Well, goodbye.\u201d</p><br/><p>I cut off her head with my spear. I just had to beat the Event Dungeon. I didn\u2019t really care about the detailed lore. As if to prove she was a monster created by the dungeon, she became particles of light and scattered into the air.</p><br/><p>[You obtained 2,000 gold.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained Odd Winged Ravens\u2019 Journal.]</p><br/><p>[You succeeded in sweeping the mastermind! Points will be added to your final clear score.]</p><br/><p>I picked up my Black Earthen Spear as I spit on the ground. Nauseating things were nauseating no matter what I told myself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel disgusted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s normal. They talked like humans too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re monsters, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, they\u2019re monsters. So don\u2019t worry about it, son.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt much better with father\u2019s reassurance. Although I didn\u2019t expect much from him before entering the dungeon, I was thankful now that he was here. He truly was reliable.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t say my thoughts out loud. Between a father and son, it wasn\u2019t necessary.</p><br/><p>I had also realized something important. Event Dungeons were cleared when their boss monsters were killed. However, we received a message saying that points were added to our final clear score. In other words, the Event Dungeons\u2019 clearing process was also important.</p><br/><p>I wondered if it would have been even higher if we went wild in the battlefield. However, I stopped thinking about it, as it was too late.</p><br/><p>Instead, I opened Odd Winged Ravens\u2019 Journal. It showed how much they hated their countries, the things they had done and what they planned to do in the future. I skimmed through most of the information and looked for the part that helped explain the current situation. With luck, I thought I might find a way to further increase the final clear score.</p><br/><p>Yes, it was there.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one thing left to do then. Huk!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time I tried to change the subject to alleviate the morbid mood, I turned my head to the battlefield and couldn\u2019t help but gasp seeing the zombies getting up one by one. Both armies had realized what was happening, but the number of zombies was increasing too quickly for them to properly respond. In the end, the commanding officers of both armies had led their soldiers into a night battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose bastards used black magic on our comrades in arm!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cKill them! Let our comrades rest in peace!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuooooo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh no, it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>The magicians swept the zombies with a large-scale magic, and the foot soldiers began to fight afterwards. What were they thinking? Unless they were like me or father, they would become zombies the moment zombies even scratched them! The commanding generals who would send their soldiers out to battle in a situation like this couldn\u2019t be sane.</p><br/><p>It turned out, the commanding officers really weren\u2019t sane.</p><br/><p>After reading the journal a bit more, I found out that the black magicians had not used black magic on just the corpses. They had already made their moves on the commanding generals. Being able to affect the higher ups of both countries meant there were spies infiltrating both governments. Surprisingly, this Odd Winged Ravens might be a pretty large organization.</p><br/><p>Of course, I didn\u2019t really care about all this. I simply wondered if stopping their plans would net me more final clear score, but it seemed it was too late.</p><br/><p>The soldiers were fighting each other, and zombies interrupted and bit them. Slowly, the number of zombies on the battlefield was growing. I trembled as I watched what was taking place on the battlefield. What I was witnessing was surely worthy of making me feel fear. However, a fear-shattering voice then reached my ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen is the giant zombie going to appear?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, I really respect this side of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father was stretching his legs like he was unhappy he missed the chance to fight the black magicians. He was almost like a puppy waiting for someone to say \u2018catch!\u2019 My tension died along with it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, what are they, cockroaches? They sure are multiplying fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re seriously creepy. I feel like there are bugs crawling all over me.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, the zombies were overwhelming the humans. The knights who knew how to wield mana and the magicians seemed to have noticed something was wrong, as they had long since escaped the battlefield or had returned to complain to the higher-ups. However, the zombies were rising from their camps as well.</p><br/><p>Realizing that the commanding officers became zombies who could only make groaning noises, the knights and magicians blasted their mana and slaughtered the zombies. The problem was that there were just too many zombies. In the end, most of them ran away after realizing the situation they were in. Now, only ordinary soldiers were left on the battlefield. They were simply food for the zombies. By now, there were more than 100,000 of them. When I was feeling nervous about the sheer number of zombies, father spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see. Every two or so drop an average of 70 gold, so that\u2019s 35 gold per zombie. Since there\u2019s two of us, I divide that by two\u2026 which means 17 gold per zombie. So if I kill them all, that\u2019s 1.7 million gold. That\u2019s 340 million won! That\u2019s an expensive necklace for wife and even solves Yua\u2019s marriage fund. Ooooh, son! This place is a gold mine!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking of in this situation, father!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I cancel what I said about him being reliable! This person didn\u2019t have a moral dilemma in the first place!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

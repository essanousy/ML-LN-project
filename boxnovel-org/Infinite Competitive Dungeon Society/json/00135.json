Team Revival (9)</p><br/><p>At the unexpected situation, I was almost hit by the drake\u2019s fire breath. If Hwaya didn\u2019t send her birds to block the flames in time, I would have been seriously injured.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful, idiot! If you die, I\u2019ll drag you out of your grave and kill you again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Hwaya!\u201d</p><br/><p>I thanked Hwaya, but was still embarrassed and angered by Pepper\u2019s grenade. Even in the heavy rain, I could clearly see the hole in the drake\u2019s neck and the grenade buried in it.</p><br/><p>It was amazing. What was amazing, you ask? It was that the grenade didn\u2019t explode even with the drake\u2019s fire erupting out just now. Those bastards went too far with the safety device!</p><br/><p>\u201cLeon Pepper, I swear I\u2019ll strangle you\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>I gritted my teeth and raised my spear again, absorbing the surrounding lightning energy. Since the easy method was now gone, I could only use the more difficult method. Ugh, it would be fine for SS rankers like me and Hwaya, but S rankers might get hurt, which I wanted to avoid\u2026 Ah!</p><br/><p>[Mega Rock Strike!]</p><br/><p>The drake stomped the ground with both of its feet. Ability users panicked and scattered to avoid its attack, but the a sinkhole appeared in the ground, dragging a few of the ability users underground. Immediately afterwards, a huge rock shot up from the sinkhole.</p><br/><p>\u201cSave them! If they get stuck down there, there\u2019s nothing we can do!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO Earth, give back the ones you swallowed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia and other ability users scrambled to save the ones who fell into the sinkhole, but I was more concerned with the huge rock that was shooting up hundreds of meters up into the air by the drake\u2019s magic power.</p><br/><p>What did it shout just now? Although it didn\u2019t explain what it did, I could tell what it planned to do by seeing the huge rock in the sky.</p><br/><p>That drake was planning on dropping the rock and smashing the ability users!</p><br/><p>Everyone was moving about in panic. Since I was the only one who could block it, I didn\u2019t need to hesitate. I ordered Lotte to fly up. However, Lotte shook her head.</p><br/><p>[We can\u2019t block it! If we get hit, I might be fine, but Hero will die! That isn\u2019t a normal rock!]</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t rush into things knowing I have zero chance of winning. I won\u2019t die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lotte sighed and began to ascend. Just in case, I activated Dragon Skin. With this, even if the method I thought of didn\u2019t work, I wouldn\u2019t die. Although my speed fell with Dragon Skin, Lotte\u2019s speed was unaffected, as she soared up quickly.</p><br/><p>It was then that the rock had reached its peak height, and began to fall. In truth, it was terrifying. Huge didn\u2019t begin to describe how big it really was.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, no!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that time, Hwaya flew over, while riding a flame wyvern. She must have thought I was planning on committing suicide, as her face was pale. As if. I wasn\u2019t remotely close to a martyr.</p><br/><p>I asked Hwaya, who looked like she wanted to drag me away.</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya, can you slow that rock down from falling?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I do, can you do something about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. So, is it possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s just slowing it down\u2026 Yes, a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya took out a potion from her inventory and put it in her mouth. Then, she raised her hand. On it, a spherical white flame appeared. She looked back at me, while putting more power into the white flame. I could clearly see worry in her flame-like eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI only have enough mana to maintain the flame army, so you need to do the rest, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks Hwaya. You really are a cool woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say half-hearted words. I\u2019d rather get a deep kiss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t even let me compliment you\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I murmured, Hwaya smiled and threw the completed white flame at the rock. The moment the falling rock collided with Hwaya\u2019s white flame, its surface became red, and the resistance slowed down the rock. Good! With this, it would be much easier for me to execute my plan!</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya, you can run now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without waiting for Hwaya\u2019s response, I flew higher with Lotte. Lightning flickered in the spear I held up, and Lotte seemed to be slightly terrified at the approaching rock. I couldn\u2019t blame her. It was as big as an apartment building. Hundreds of people could stand on it without a problem.</p><br/><p>The rock was falling. 100 meters, 70 meters, 35 meters, 10 meters! I thrust my spear forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cOutburst!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment my spear collided with the rock, I felt that the spear overcame the rock\u2019s crushing force. However, in order to protect the spear shaft, the spear transferred the crushing force directly to me. Along with an enormous shock in my arms, I felt an electrifying pain in my solar plexus. However, believing in Dragon Skin\u2019s power, I gritted my teeth and continued to thrust my spear forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou god damn lizard bastard! Eat this!\u201d</p><br/><p>The rock split, not from shock of colliding with the spear, but from an unnaturally strong shock. It split into dozens, then hundreds of pieces. Then, just as unnaturally, the broken pieces rained down in a straight line. Of course, their aim was\u2026!</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaa, Heroooo!]</p><br/><p>If I recorded it, I could use it as an alarm clock! The rain of rocks struck the drake\u2019s body. I didn\u2019t think it would receive a fatal blow, but I clenched my fists, as I had prevented S rankers from dying in vain.</p><br/><p>However, suddenly feeling raindrops in my head, I raised my hands to touch it, and saw that my helmet had been split into two. It seemed that a piece of rock had glazed past my head. My mask would still hide my identity, but I would have to pay to repair the helmet. I gritted my teeth and put the two pieces of the helmet into my inventory.</p><br/><p>The fight wasn\u2019t over yet. If I let the drake freely rampage any longer, my companions might really be in danger. Because of its attacks, the Antelope Canyon was already in a sorry state. The damage was even reaching outer perimeters of the canyon.</p><br/><p>Hwaya\u2019s mana wasn\u2019t infinite, and she wouldn\u2019t be able to block its flames forever. Without her, I suspected that half of the people currently alive would be dead.</p><br/><p>As such, I had to kill it before her mana ran out.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>First, I resolved myself. Will one minute be enough? Will I be able to aim properly? Should I really do it?</p><br/><p>No, with Ludia\u2019s buff, it should just barely be possible!</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You used Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry! All party members are cleansed of negative status effects. All party members\u2019 attack power increases by 50 percent for the duration. All party members become super-armored, unfazed by enemy attacks.]</p><br/><p>Strength overflowed in my body. Of course, that wasn\u2019t it. Standing firmly on Lotte\u2019s back, I aimed my spear at the Flame Drake, currently swinging its front paw and breathing fire at the S rankers attacking it.</p><br/><p>\u201cGigantic! Uk!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuk\u2026 It\u2019s heavy, Herooo!]</p><br/><p>\u201cEndure it just for a second, Lotte!\u201d</p><br/><p>The spear grew to dozens of meters in an instant! The spear had become incredibly heavy, and it was devouring an unimaginable amount of mana from Spirit Aura. I gritted my teeth and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cSky God\u2019s Rage!\u2019</p><br/><p>The giant spear transformed into a lightning bolt. Oh, the spear became lighter! Plus, when I activated Sky God\u2019s Rage, thunderclaps rang out consecutively and bolts of lightning fell from the sky. My spear directly absorbed all of the lightning and became even bigger.</p><br/><p>[Hahaha, I feel super high, Master!][1. She literally says \u201chigh\u201d in English. And Shin says \u201cheavy\u201d in English.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel super heavy!\u201d</p><br/><p>At Peika\u2019s spirited shout, I clenched my teeth. The strength from all my muscles surged. Damn it, if I didn\u2019t learn it as a skill, it would have been impossible for me to concentrate all my strength in this situation!</p><br/><p>\u201cHere I go\u2026 Heroic\u2026 Striiiiike!\u201d</p><br/><p>I flung the lightning bolt whole.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk! What is that giant lightning!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThunder Knight, it\u2019s Thunder Knight\u2019s power!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 That\u2019s the power of an SS ranker? It\u2019s well above it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, the drake is moving! Stop it!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>In truth, the spear I threw wasn\u2019t as fast as real lightning. The drake was quite dexterous for its size, so it could definitely dodge it.</p><br/><p>That is, if I didn\u2019t do anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cShadow Blink!\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment, I was on the drake\u2019s neck. It erupted strong flames from its body and threw the ability users back, and was now trying to dodge the incoming spear. Of course, I had no plan of letting it do that.</p><br/><p>I raised my whitened hand and struck down at its neck, shouting, \u201cIce Touch!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Your target freezes for 5 seconds. Afterwards, it can dispel the status effect depending on its resistance.]</p><br/><p>[Kak!]</p><br/><p>Like a lie, the drake froze in place. With a grin, I leaped off. Lotte flew like an arrow and caught me.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice, Lotte.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m falling back!]</p><br/><p>It seemed Lotte could feel the power behind Sky God\u2019s Rage. She flapped her wings quickly and flew off. Less than a second afterwards, the spear I threw out pierced the drake\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[Kyaaaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, a critical hit.\u201d</p><br/><p>I watched, as I stood on Lotte\u2019s back. After glazing past the drake\u2019s neck, Sky God\u2019s Rage burned everything in its path and pierced the drake\u2019s body. Digging deep into it, it dyed the world golden for a moment, as formidable lightning struck its body.</p><br/><p>At the same time, even the grenade that was stuck in its neck exploded! Right, if it could withstand Sky God\u2019s Rage, it would be an SSS rank boss monster, not a grenade! The shrapnel from the grenade shredded the drake\u2019s throat. Although it wasn\u2019t as strong as Sky God\u2019s Rage, with its positioning and the fact that all of Pepper\u2019s strength was imbued in it, it dealt critical damage.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaaa\u2026! The He\u2026ro\u2019s\u2026 power\u2026!]</p><br/><p>The drake screamed. Its voice became quieter and quieter until no one could hear it. If it didn\u2019t die from this, I would have to resort to Deific Manifestation. When I was resolving myself to do so, the tension in my body disappeared. I had heard the voice I was waiting to hear.</p><br/><p>[Event Raid success! Six of Earth\u2019s dungeon explorers and one independent dungeon explorer, a total of seven dungeon explorers has successfully completed an Event Raid! This great achievement increases the rewards greatly! As your average rank is lower than the raid boss, the reward increases again!]</p><br/><p>[Your dignity is worthy of receiving the attentions of Transcendents. All gods that love battles and wars begin to observe you closely.]</p><br/><p>The reward increased even more this time!? Plus, that message\u2026 It seemed I needed to prepare myself for what was to come.</p><br/><p>[You obtained 5 stat points for completing the Event Raid.]</p><br/><p>[Rewards will be distributed in order of contribution.]</p><br/><p>[Kang Shin-nim\u2019s contribution is the highest. Choose your reward.]</p><br/><p>[1. Rage of Vulcan (Epic)</p><br/><p>2. Bride of Ignis (Epic)</p><br/><p>3. Executioners in Two Moon (Epic)</p><br/><p>4. Elixir</p><br/><p>5.

Not the elixirs as in strengthening elixirs, compressing elixirs, etc. The Korean word for that is completely different than this potion, which is literally \u201cElixir\u201d phoneticized in Korean.] If that\u2019s what I think it is\u2026 isn\u2019t it the miracle potion that restores someone to normal from all physical or mental injuries and status effects!? If the potion is Elixir, then what about the other rewards!? I mean, they\u2019re all Epic!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cS-Shin, did the rewards come out? It did, right? You\u2019re the first in contribution, so how is it? Anything good?\u201d</p><br/><p>I was clearly first in contribution. It couldn\u2019t be anyone else. Hwaya, who knew that fact well, approached me and asked with sparkling eyes.</p><br/><p>When I looked at her, the water vapor evaporating from her was lessening. The heavy rain had passed.</p><br/><p>Seeing the ray of light shining down from between the storm clouds, I said with a solemn expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya\u2026 we struck it big.\u201d</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Good for you Peika! You\u2019re feeling super high! The people on Munpia now are feeling super low\u2026 (T/N: this is referring to the fact that Munpia had some server error, and thus the chapter came out late or something)</p><br/><p>PS \u2013 Feeling super high: Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure.

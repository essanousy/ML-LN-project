The Power of the Hero (4)</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, you just turned a small city into rubble and dust.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it awesome? I should take this opportunity to live a grander life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the crumbling concrete, Peika and Sharana shredded computers and other electronics. The giant building that had once stood tall was nowhere to be seen and only an empty plot of land remained. I might have a talent for the demolition business.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You, what\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected of an SS ranker, Brightman was completely fine. He reached toward Peika and Sharana, but there was no way the elementals would be caught by him. Soon, he realized that it wasn\u2019t the elementals he had to aim for. It was me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThunder Knight! You think you can get away with this? Both you and Korea will pay for it dearly!\u201d</p><br/><p>I jumped off Lotte. After recalling Peika and activating Thunder Beast, I pulled my fist back. Seeing me jump down, Brightman gritted his teeth and dodged. However, if I was going to let him escape, I wouldn\u2019t have jumped off in the first place.</p><br/><p>\u201cSharana!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes, Master!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Brightman froze on the spot as if something was restraining him. I suspected that he wouldn\u2019t be able to move for at least 10 seconds. I circulated Peruta Circuit to the limit, and a giant whirlpool of lightning enveloped my fist. I was just about to hit the ground. Seeing Brightman\u2019s face getting bigger, I struck my fist toward him.</p><br/><p>\u201cKak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thanks to hitting his face with full force, I didn\u2019t receive much shock from the fall. Instead, Brightman slammed against the ground and caused fissures to break out.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, Thun-Thunder Knight, you just\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to hit you now, so don\u2019t open your mouth. You might bite your tongue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just committed a crime\u2014 kuhuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>I gave him an uppercut. Immediately afterward, I felled him by kicking his chest and mounted him. His face was swollen.</p><br/><p>\u201cThunder\u2026 Knight\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat one was for the punch you gave me in Windermere.\u201d</p><br/><p>I hammered his face with my fist. His nose, which stood as high as his pride, sunk. I continued with lightning wrapped around my fist.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis one is for hitting on Hwaya when you\u2019re a middle-aged married man.\u201d</p><br/><p>I punched his solar plexus three times. He coughed out blood. As expected of an SS ranker, the way he coughed out blood was different than normal people. I leisurely dodged it and hit him one more time. Then, I focused my mana in my fist and held it up.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd this one\u2026 is for daring to touch my sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKu, huk\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>For the next 10 minutes, I beat him so that he could only barely breathe. There wasn\u2019t a single bone in his body that wasn\u2019t broken. I made sure to break his jaws, so he could only eat porridge for the rest of his life. I made it so that he could never walk, never hold or touch objects, give birth, or have hair.</p><br/><p>At that time, Lotte landed. When Walker and Daisy got off, they widened their eyes after seeing Brightman. When I turned around, Walker surprisingly had his mask off and was revealing his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cEd\u2026 ward\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the words that left Brightman\u2019s mouth, I remembered that Walker\u2019s name was Edward. I was also amazed by Brightman\u2019s rate of recovery.</p><br/><p>\u201cJoshua, what a sorry state you\u2019re in.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Walker was with me, he always called Brightman by his last name. Now, however, he was calling him by his first name. They exchanged glances that I couldn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you really were\u2026 alive\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it\u2026 until I saw you with my own eyes\u2026 But why\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you, Joshua, that the world won\u2019t continue to go the way you want it to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFool! Why did you join hands with this kid!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a kid too, Joshua. But unlike you, this kid isn\u2019t a selfish narcissist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKahak\u2026 I won\u2019t allow a yellow monkey to hold the supremacy over the world\u2026! Edward, it\u2019s not\u2026 too late. Right now, get this monkey out of here!\u201d</p><br/><p>I punched his face again. On the other hand, Walker burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou hit a new low, Joshua. You tried to kidnap an innocent person just for that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKidnap? You destroyed Brightman Group\u2019s building for something like that!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always been like this, Joshua. You treat your belongings like treasures and others\u2019 belongings like pebbles on the side of the road. No, the ones you liked, you tried to obtain by all means. I always found your attitude disgusting. I see that it still hasn\u2019t changed, even in this situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEdward\u2026! I gave you everything you had!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Joshua. You did give me everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker approached us. His fist was enveloped by a black aura. When did he get so strong? His mana was certainly above an SS rankers. He stopped in front of me and raised his fist. While I stared with widened eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>He struck down on Joshua\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there wasn\u2019t a single thing I really wanted.\u201d</p><br/><p>With Walker\u2019s blow, Brightman lost consciousness. He picked his fist back up and shook off the blood. Then, he said with a grin.</p><br/><p>\u201cPunching him like that was on my bucket list.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re pretty cool.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just found out? You really have no eyes for people.\u201d</p><br/><p>While a strange air flowed between Walker and me, Daisy shoved her face toward me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis mind, I read everything. Lacking information, I can make up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Daisy. Then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no reason to hesitate. I removed Brightman\u2019s ability down to the last minuscule piece. For someone with such a dirty personality, his ability was a brilliant ball of light with a golden luster. It seemed abilities don't always match their users\u2019 personalities.</p><br/><p>I held it toward Walker.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake it, Walker, it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d say that\u2026 There\u2019s someone I want to give it to. Is that okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrightman\u2019s younger sister, Sophie?</p><br/><p>\u201cEk!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker looked at me in shock. I made a sly smile and poked his shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot a single thing you wanted, huh\u2026 I think I know what one of them is, eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cK-Kang Shin, you\u2014 khuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just cursed, right? Hehehe, so I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, that\u2019s not it\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>I rolled Brightman\u2019s unconscious body into a random crater in the ground. He would no longer be able to do anything on his own. If this Sophie was the type of person Walker described her to be, I was sure she\u2019d take care of Brightman.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou prepare the Soul Contract. Whether she can accept an SS rank ability is another matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I just\u2026 make her into an explorer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWalker, I didn\u2019t know you were such a pure-hearted guy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you, I have no romantic feelings for her!\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t give someone an SS rank ability just because Walker liked her. Although I wouldn\u2019t impose a harsh condition like the one on Walker, there had to be measures in place to prevent her from doing anything out of place. For example, using her newly acquired ability to create a strange organization like the one Brightman tried to make.</p><br/><p>We told everyone in Revival about the matter and voted on creating a new dungeon explorer. Unlike with Yua, most of the members didn\u2019t know about her. As she was also the younger sister of Brightman, they couldn\u2019t fully trust her either. In the end, most of them agreed under the condition that a Soul Contract would be used. Walker created the contract for Sophie as he trembled.</p><br/><p>Then, we headed to Britain. As we took our time destroying Brightman\u2019s organization on the way, it took about 4 hours.</p><br/><p>Sophie was staying in Brightman Group\u2019s luxury hotel in London. She was in charge of operating Brightman Group businesses in Britain and was 27 years old this year. Unlike her older brother, she was extremely talented in running a business. According to Walker, that is.</p><br/><p>\u201cI get it, so can you stop bragging about your girlfriend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my girlfriend!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment she heard Walker\u2019s voice, she let us into her room. I was grateful. If possible, I didn\u2019t want to deal with Britain\u2019s police.</p><br/><p>Sophie was indeed the type of girl Walker would like. Unlike her older brother, she had a slender and tender figure. Though her grey eyes were a bit sharp, her radiant blonde hair mitigated her cold look. Just like her older brother, she had a sharp nose. With her charming full lips, she exuded the charm of a beautiful woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cEdward!\u201d</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, she jumped into Walker\u2019s embrace the moment she saw him. She didn\u2019t look at us at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have told me if you were alive, stupid!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJoshua would have found out if I did.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you have done it secretly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hate you!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed British people had a custom of kissing people they hated. Wanting to get hated as well, I asked Walker.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot your girlfriend, you said\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026 family intimacy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEdward, I was so worried\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve been well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot without you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sophie buried her face in Walker\u2019s embrace and didn\u2019t look up. Walker sweated. He faced us and shook his head, but it was too late. Daisy said bluntly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumans are\u2026 really weird\u2026 Move imagination to reality\u2026 explosive reproduction rate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere would be all sorts of crime, so stop there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo crime, if there\u2019s love.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about that for Walker\u2019s honor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sophie refused to get off Walker for a while. After 20 minutes, she seemed to have calmed down, as she turned her head and faced us. Of course, she was still in Walker\u2019s embrace. She asked with a cold look.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re the one who ended my oppa? You won\u2019t make excuses, right? It\u2019s all over on TV.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, yeah. You can call me Dragon Knight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you appeared in front of his younger sister\u2026 Did you kill him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s alive. Though, he won\u2019t be able to satisfy any one of human\u2019s three desires.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEdward, why did you go under such an eccentric man\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s better than your oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for anyone to be worse than my oppa. You don\u2019t have to say something so obvious.\u201d</p><br/><p>The ball of light I held began to shine even more radiantly the moment it neared Sophie. It meant she was extremely suited to the ability. There wasn\u2019t even a need to make her into an explorer. Ciara\u2026 why did she turn Brightman into an SS ranker instead of Sophie?</p><br/><p>I glanced at Walker, indicating that it would be fine for her to accept the ability. He sighed and took out the Soul Contract. Then, he began to explain. Sophie\u2019s eyes widened as she listened to Walker. After about 10 minutes, she gave the reaction I was expecting.</p><br/><p>\u201cEdward\u2026 Are you telling me to become the head of Brightman Group!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2026 Can I think of it as a proposal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEdward, stop being to cheeky all the time! This is a proposal, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you and I are in different leagues. With this, you\u2019ll be able to stand in a position you\u2019re suited for.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, I knew that expression. It was the expression Loretta made often. Hwaya also began to make that expression recently. Whenever I saw that expression, things got tiring. It seemed my intuition was frighteningly correct, as Sophie pushed Walker\u2019s chest and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I won\u2019t become the head! I won\u2019t take that ability and become an explorer or whatever either!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSophie, think of the bigger picture!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am! Without you, I can\u2019t focus on any work! The profit this quarter wasn\u2019t that good either, and I wasn\u2019t satisfied with my report for grad school either! If this continues, I\u2019ll be single for the rest of my life and die a virgin! If you won\u2019t become my fianc\u00e9, I won\u2019t agree to any condition!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSophie, you\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Oppa\u2019s out of hope, I\u2019ll have to continue the clan, but I don\u2019t want to marry anyone besides you, Edward! I said what I wanted, so come back when you\u2019ve made up your mind!\u201d</p><br/><p>This woman somewhat resembled Hwaya. Was it a British thing? Was everyone so cool and fiery like Hwaya?</p><br/><p>Sophie pushed Walker away. Of course, as she was not an ability user, it didn't do much. Walker sighed and turned toward me. I\u2019d never seen Walker make a face like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, cooperate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, I will.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I nodded, Walker\u2019s expression brightened, while Sophie\u2019s expression darkened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not satisfied with ruining Oppa and want to ruin my marriage too? If you do, I\u2019ll use The Brightman Group\u2019s full force to annoy the hell out of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cListen to me, Miss Sophie. If it\u2019s what Miss Sophie wants, I can put a clause in the contract that Walker has to become your fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker and Sophie exchanged their expressions perfectly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get along, Dragon Knight! No, my best friend!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin!\u201d</p><br/><p>With this, everyone can be happy! Except for Joshua Brightman, of course!</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>The result of the popularity contest will come out soon. It\u2019s taking a while to count.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Boy Becomes a Dungeon Explorer (4)</p><br/><p>I had no pride to save, nor did I need to. The next week, I stood in front of the same door and obediently shouted that I would enter a party. Then, a translucent window appeared.</p><br/><p>[This is the party recruitment board. Click on the one you want and enter a party.]</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see. Hunting the Orc Lord, looking for healer. Must be above level 5. How stupid, isn\u2019t everyone on the 5th floor level 5?\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking that there were people even more stupid than me, I slowly scrolled through the window and found one that was looking for a front-line damage dealer. Because I started playing games, I knew what a front-line damage dealer was. They were people who attacked in melee range using close-range weapons.</p><br/><p>The moment I clicked on that post, I felt stunned briefly and soon found myself among nine other people.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome. You\u2019re a front-line damage dealer, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>A handsome western-style man began talking to me. Thinking it was English, I was about to yell out \u2018I cannot speak English.\u2019 Fortunately, I found that I could understand what he was saying without problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yes, I use a spear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, a spearman! Are you from the Edias continent?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No, I\u2019m from Seoul.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeoul? It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard of it. Anyone else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not from the Luka continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not from Pilos either.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people around me murmured as they shook their heads. When I glanced at them, I noticed that most of them had white or dark skin, and had blonde, red, or brown hair. They were all foreigners! As I cowered slightly, the man who first talked to me approached. He was wearing a small shield on his arm and had a short sword attached to it. With a sigh, he reached his hand out to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be from a minor place. Nice to meet you. I\u2019m the party leader Ellos Von Kasina. Paul, Celtine, and I are from the Edias continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGasina[1.Gasina means b*tch in Korean.]?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Kasina.\u201d</p><br/><p>I grabbed the hand of the party leader, who looked slightly disappointed. Having played games for a while, I knew what a party was. It was just that I never thought I would be in a party with people from other worlds\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Kang Shin. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a brief introduction with the other party members, I thought we would immediately fight the Orc Lord. I was mistaken.</p><br/><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a small girl from a place called the Luka continent. Besides this small girl, three other members, a woman carrying a rapier, a long-eared beauty with a quiver on her back, and a weak framed girl barely holding onto her wooden shield came from this continent. The small girl was a blonde, twin-tailed beauty, whose hair shone like gold and whose wooden staff matched well. However, the way she talked wasn\u2019t cute in the slightest.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, look at his clothes. Aren\u2019t those the beginner\u2019s clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeginner\u2019s clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>What was wrong with my clothes? I looked down at the clothes I was wearing. Because I wanted to be in clothes suited for moving around, I always came into the dungeon wearing my training clothes. Even if they were ripped, they were restored once I got out of the dungeon.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You haven\u2019t gone to the Floor Shop?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because the other side was talking informally, I did the same. The girl asked again, surprised. \u201cThey sell defensive equipment there. Why didn\u2019t you buy them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>I did remember the Floor Shop selling defensive equipment. However, my goal was to reach the 10th floor and buy a mana cultivation method. I couldn\u2019t thoughtlessly spend gold before then. It was the same for my weapon. I continued to use the Sharp Wooden Spear given to me at the beginning. Of course, it wasn\u2019t so sharp anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to save money to buy a mana cultivation method.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t have a mana cultivation method? What family are you from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFamily? The Kang family I guess?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t that family have a mana cultivation method?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Oh no, we got the wrong party member. Kick him out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, it\u2019s going to be difficult if you don\u2019t have a mana cultivation method.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a mana cultivation method?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other party members began to whisper to each other. Realizing that something was going wrong, I talked to Ellos, who seemed to be the most understanding.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes everyone else have a mana cultivation method?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Wait, I don\u2019t know about the other dungeons, but it\u2019s known to be impossible to climb to the 5th floor of the First Dungeon without a mana cultivation method. How did you get this far?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I raised my skill level. I mastered my mid-rank spear technique\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMid-rank master!?\u201d This time, another person in the back yelled out in surprise. It was a brown-haired man carrying a large shield and wearing a thick leather armor.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie. I practiced my shield technique for 10 years and it\u2019s only just gotten to mid-rank level 2. You said you mastered the mid-rank spear technique!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did\u2026 is that weird?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is! Mastering a mid-rank weapon skill without even a mana cultivation method, I don\u2019t believe it! Don\u2019t tell me, you have the high-rank spear technique?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it said I couldn\u2019t learn it because I don\u2019t have mana.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>All the party members fell silent. Then, Ellos spoke out. \u201cLet\u2019s bring him in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Ellos...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe barely climbed to the 5th floor with the three of us. With the rule, [all players below the 10th floor can only be partied with people from their own continent], he must have climbed to the 5th floor on his own. If he had his own party, he wouldn\u2019t need to enter ours. Am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I nodded, Ellos seemed to gain more confidence and talked louder.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee. Kang Shin alone has the ability of all three of us combined. I can\u2019t speak for the future, but at least on this 5th floor, he has more than enough qualification to fulfill the damage dealer role. He\u2019s a mid-rank spear technique master!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut look at his armor\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKick him!\u201d</p><br/><p>The twin-tail kept on saying to kick me. I held myself back from glaring at her, but she got more arrogant and glared at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cKick him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Palludia, please calm down. We haven\u2019t seen his skills yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to! Look at him, he\u2019s using a half-broken wooden spear!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be too late if we take the time to see it. I don\u2019t know how your continent is, but mine is in a fierce war against the demon race. If I lose the opportunity to get stronger for a whole week, we\u2019ll fall behind in the war!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy continent is also at war with invaders. Hu, fine. Just give us some time. Mister Kang Shin, I apologize, but you\u2019ll need to show us your power. There should be an orc further back, so show us your abilities by defeating it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, it\u2019s not a hard request.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The brat named Palludia stepped back from the negotiation with Ellos, but still bit down on her lips in displeasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an orc yourself\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an orc!\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t help but yell out when she picked on my weak spot. When I faced her and glared, she seemed to be intimidated as she turned away.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>I also snorted. Then I sauntered off. Because there were no orcs near the door, I had to walk for 5 minutes.</p><br/><p>\u201cChwiik, human!\u201d</p><br/><p>Found one. It was wearing a worn-down leather armor and carrying a fearsome glaive. Confirming that the others were watching, I ran toward it. My spear spun in my hand, and I soon snapped my hand, grabbing onto it tightly. Now!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>I lightly dodged the orc\u2019s glaive attack, and the spear I struck out like lightning pierced its target. The orc that was running toward me stopped in its track, let out a burping sound, and began to fall with blood foaming at its mouth. As he fell, I quickly pulled back my spear to prevent it from breaking. Without anything to lean on, the orc fell with a thud.</p><br/><p>At first, I fought with monsters with brute strength, blocking their attacks with the spear. But because the durability of my spear wore off and fell below 10, these days I was doing my best to kill the orcs in a single blow. Because of my mastery of the mid-rank spear technique, it wasn\u2019t too difficult to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-With just one hit\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way, did you see that? I didn\u2019t even feel a hint of mana!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did! Mana aside, that\u2019s not even a skill!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos and the other party members seemed to be awed by my technique. Hm, I guess these days, I\u2019m evenly matched with father just with pure spearmanship. Unfortunately, there was always that one person who likes to rain on your parade.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, that was just a coincidence! If he tried again, there\u2019s no way he can draw such a clean and beautiful trajectory!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cM-Miss Palludia, even if it was a coincidence, he is undoubtedly skilled. He is more than suited to become our party member.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEeek, if you can\u2019t agree with me, I\u2019ll just leave! It\u2019s either my party or him! Your choice!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-That\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll just defeat another one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because Ellos looked troubled, I spoke out. Ellos looked at me with teary eyes. Disgusting. Palludia, on the other hand, snorted and said, \u201cTry it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow convenient, there\u2019s one right there.\u201d</p><br/><p>An orc archer. They were an annoying bunch that shot arrows from afar. Thankfully, they didn\u2019t appear often. When they appeared with other orcs, I had to be prepared to receive injuries as I charged in. But now, there was only one orc archer. For me who could avoid even bullets, avoiding arrows wasn\u2019t much of a problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cChwiik! Orc shoot arrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuman stab orc!\u201d</p><br/><p>Having hunted alone for a year, it became my hobby of sorts to talk back to monsters like them.</p><br/><p>With ease, I tilted my head and dodged the orc archer\u2019s arrow. I took a step forward and shot towards the orc archer. Just like before, my spear beautifully pierced through orc archer\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEe\u2026 Eeeek\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Palludia\u2019s eyes were glaring, she clenched her fists and looked down. She had accepted her loss. I didn\u2019t know just what part of me she didn\u2019t like, but I could think of quite a few possibilities by myself. As such, I decided to not care.</p><br/><p>What was important was not the outside, but the inside! I am Kang Shin, the son of the world\u2019s strongest spearman. I\u2019ll show you the strength I gained by giving up my ordinary life!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

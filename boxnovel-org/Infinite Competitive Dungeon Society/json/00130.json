Team Revival (4)</p><br/><p>After taking a shower, I got dressed and went to the lobby, where I saw Hwaya sitting by herself on a table and drinking. It was whiskey. Because I felt like my hair wasn\u2019t dry yet, I thought about taking off my mask to dry my hair, but I was then surprised when I saw her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here so early in the morning!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone stood me up last night, so I\u2019m here drinking in the morning to make up for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, I already told you that I was going to be out hunting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d stay there the whole night. Do you know how hard it was to make that girl sleep? I was with Ye-Eun too. I really didn\u2019t think you\u2019d hunt wyverns the entire night\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya pouted. With a shrug, I apologized and sat across the table. Hwaya, who was staring at me fixedly, then asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to see your face. I want to know what expression you\u2019re making.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith how strong you are, you can probably show yourself\u2026 Are you still afraid?\u201d</p><br/><p>At Hwaya\u2019s provocative smile, I snorted and took a sip from the bottle of whiskey. My strengthened body barely reacted to the alcohol. Putting the bottle down, I responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t fall for provocations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow rude. You stole my drink. Plus, you\u2019re a coward.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s the reason you\u2019re drinking whiskey alone where everyone can see you?\u201d</p><br/><p>At my question, Hwaya grinned and messaged me.</p><br/><p>[I didn\u2019t think I could say it when I was with the others. I wanted to say it last night, but you stood me up.]</p><br/><p>[Yeah, yeah. I already apologized. So, what is it? Ciara Kenex?]</p><br/><p>[No, Palludia.]</p><br/><p>\u201cUk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya\u2019s eyes were shining strangely.</p><br/><p>[That girl is weird. You didn\u2019t explain yesterday. What\u2019s her problem? Why is she so obsessed with you? I haven\u2019t seen a girl like her in a while.]</p><br/><p>[So there are people like her?]</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s another story. Did something happen in the world you went to as a Dimensional Mercenary? Did she become like that because her world fell? What happened?]</p><br/><p>[Mm, sorry. It\u2019s a secret.]</p><br/><p>[Hey.]</p><br/><p>[Sorry, but I don\u2019t think I should tell you, or anyone else for that matter.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya let out a sigh. She raised her cup to take a drink, but she realized that it was empty. She reached towards the bottle of whiskey, but I took it away before she could get it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour constitution isn\u2019t that strong. Stop before you get drunk. Do you even want to drink something I drank with my mouth?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty good\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya sighed again and took her hand off her glass.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, let\u2019s stop drinking. Sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have asked you so suddenly. I was just feeling impatient, unlike my usual self. It was just completely unexpected, so I was surprised.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a reason for it, so try to understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll try, though I probably won\u2019t succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow honest.\u201d</p><br/><p>I smiled. Hwaya also smiled and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ciara Kenex too?]</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Yeah.]</p><br/><p>Hwaya stared at me for a while, but soon got up while smiling.</p><br/><p>[Alright, I\u2019ll trust you. I was hesitating too, since it would get complicated if the Kenex family intervened. Plus, if there\u2019s an enemy you can\u2019t handle, I doubt anyone from the Kenex family could help.]</p><br/><p>[This is what you really wanted to talk about, right?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s both. They\u2019re both important to me. Anyways, let\u2019s go wake them up and go out for breakfast. I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya answered nonchalantly and left. Looking at her back as she walked away, I thought that it was a miracle that I got to know her.</p><br/><p>The moment Ludia opened her eyes, she jumped on my arm, but since she had to get changed, I got her off with Hwaya and Ye-Eun\u2019s help. As this continued, I hoped her symptoms would slowly disappear. Once she changed, she clung to my arm again, making me somewhat doubtful. After we had breakfast, we went straight to the Field Dungeon. I wasn\u2019t particularly tired and neither were my companions.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, I can\u2019t fly in the air like you, so what should I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see once we get there. Also, make sure not to call me by my name. If you need to, use the dungeon\u2019s message system.\u201d</p><br/><p>I could hunt the wyverns alone, but most melee-range fighters could not do so. Most of the Awakened scattered around the Field Dungeon were members of the American Guardian. They watched over and reported the slightest changes in the dungeon. When wyverns descended, they called nearby parties and hunted them together.</p><br/><p>Those that hunted wyverns more actively always had long-ranged attackers with close-ranged attackers. They first drew the wyverns toward them with long-ranged attacks and had the close-ranged attackers fight them. However, since the wyverns here seemed capable of communicating with each other, they would have to fight two wyverns at once if they were unlucky. As such, most parties didn\u2019t hunt by themselves and cooperated with the other countries\u2019 ability users.</p><br/><p>Some ability users, however, gave up the ground to fight the wyverns in the sky. They rode in helicopters to fight them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that more dangerous?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called an attack helicopter, but yeah, that sounds more dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once hit by the wyverns\u2019 flames, a helicopter would just become a chunk of scrap metal. Even attack helicopters, made from monster materials for the purpose of hunting monsters, could not withstand the wyverns\u2019 flames for long. If wyverns headbutted, clawed, or bit the helicopter, it would go down sooner.</p><br/><p>As such, when fighting a wyvern on a helicopter, the party had to consist of ideal members. One long-ranged attacker, one defense magic user to protect the helicopter from the wyvern\u2019s attacks, and one close-ranged attack who had the maneuverability to jump on the wyvern to take its life and jump back to safety. As that would take time, it was better to have two close-range attackers.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre there teams like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne or two from what I could tell. Most of the others fight on the ground with the method I told you about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing is believing, or so the saying went. In the Field Dungeon\u2019s sky, we could clearly see two helicopters flying around and fighting the wyverns. I couldn\u2019t say they were fast, but they were at least faster than the parties on the ground, who could only wait for wyverns to come near them. Of course, they were incomparably slower than I was last night. Plus, the moment they made a mistake, the helicopter would fall. I heard helicopters made with monster materials cost over 150 billion won, so one of those things had to kill at least 60 wyverns to make up for its cost\u2026 Though, that wasn\u2019t exactly true since they could get lucky and find Mana Stones in the wyverns. After all, a Mana Stone from wyverns were about 10 billion won.</p><br/><p>Since even S rankers had such difficulty fighting them, it was no wonder that the Wyvern\u2019s Nest was taking so long to get cleared. At first, they employed many methods to hunt the wyverns more easily, but mechanical devices were destroyed and magical devices were broken from the wyverns\u2019 high mana resistance. In the end, only ability users were left to toil. Although I had not experienced it myself, when I thought about all the proud rankers having difficulty hunting wyverns, I couldn\u2019t help but feel bad for them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere should be other people who can use ice steps. Or wind steps, maybe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMost ice or wind ability users that are S ranked or above are long-ranged types. There\u2019s no way they would fly in the sky and put themselves in danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t they fly together with close-range attackers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll end up falling to death after running out of mana!\u2019</p><br/><p>Hwaya shouted and stopped my rude imagination. Then, after looking at how people were hunting the wyverns for a bit, she asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we rent a helicopter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a bicycle, you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhuk!?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I turned around, John Smith was there. With an amiable smile, he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to talk about the average cost of wyverns and the ones you\u2019ve chosen to sell. Since you were asking something I could answer, I did so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-Thanks. Let\u2019s start with the wyverns.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. In truth, wyverns are different in sizes and quality of the skin. Most of their skin were in perfect shape, though I can\u2019t say the same for their heads. You are truly amazing. Since the size of the wyverns change their cost, Thunder Knight-nim will have to choose which wyverns to sell.\u201d</p><br/><p>We then went to the area where the wyverns I hunted last night were gathered. Large wyverns over 20 meters long were piled up on top of each other. It was quite the sight. Because of the mountain of wyvern corpses, sunlight couldn\u2019t even reach us.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou hunted all this by yourself\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI expected as much, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun exclaimed in surprise and Hwaya spoke with a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe chose the cheapest wyverns for the ten you have chosen to give us. If you\u2019re curious, we could bring them back and show you. Is that okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t need to move them again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlus, most of their heads were blown up. If you obtained any Mana Stones, we would love to buy them too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but I have my own uses for them.\u201d</p><br/><p>I would get more than enough money from selling the wyverns\u2019 corpses anyways. If they were willing to pay so much for the wyverns\u2019 corpses and Mana Stones, it meant they had appropriate uses for them. In that case, they would be highly valued in the dungeon as well. I wanted to first secure the Mana Stones and the wyverns\u2019 corpses. I might have to visit Lin soon.</p><br/><p>I sold 20 wyverns on the spot for over 60 billion won. Since I didn\u2019t have an account for ability users other than the one for Yeon Hwawoo, they created an account for me with the 60 billion won. That said, I didn\u2019t know where to spend all this money. Maybe I should fill the swimming pool in Marianne\u2019s Garden with shrimp crackers\u2026</p><br/><p>Plus, we could rent an attack helicopter for free. After hearing it was 130 million dollars, I felt a bit hesitant.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, if there\u2019s any problem, I could just buy it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate by barrier.\u201d</p><br/><p>With Hwaya and Ludia\u2019s double attack, I got on the helicopter. Ye-Eun, who considered 100 million won to be an enormous sum, trembled and got on with a frown. Now that she was a high-ranking ability user, I knew her sense of money would change eventually. In a way, it was sad.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should make a team name too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Once the helicopter took off, Ye-Eun made a excited suggestion. Ludia seemed to agree as well. It seemed she was obsessed with making connections with people.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, Hwaya supported it as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, it\u2019s good for fostering a sense of camaraderie and for letting other knows who we are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre there other famous parties?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Guardian\u2019s team names often come up on mass media, and it\u2019s the same from Freedom Wing. Rogue teams get paid according to how famous they are, not the ranking of their team members.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Shin, you should really show more interest in other people.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, but that\u2019s because I only care about people who are important to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>I acknowledged what Ye-Eun messaged. Then, Hwaya swung the staff she was holding at my forehead. I, of course, blocked it with my hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be proud, idiot. If you keep living like a child, you\u2019ll be dead before you even realize.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s a problem\u2026 but I don\u2019t have much free time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Climbing the dungeon every day, going to university, and training\u2026 I was especially busy lately. I had my excuses, but I should really expand my horizon like Hwaya said\u2026</p><br/><p>When I showed signs of self-reflection, Hwaya took back her staff.</p><br/><p>\u201cRevival.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia announced.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has to be Revival.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRevival? That\u2019s unexpected. Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s the guild he made.]</p><br/><p>[Guild!? Shin, you made a guild? Don\u2019t you need a mansion!?]</p><br/><p>[Ah, yeah. I do have one, so I took the opportunity to make a guild.]</p><br/><p>[I want in! Let me in Shin\u2019s guild!]</p><br/><p>[I thought you\u2019d say that. Go ahead. You\u2019ll probably cry if I refuse.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun bounced in joy inside the helicopter. Since the pilot couldn\u2019t hear our messages, he was probably weirded out by the strange flow of our conversation. On the other hand, Hwaya didn\u2019t look happy.</p><br/><p>[If it\u2019s First Dungeon\u2019s guild, I can\u2019t enter it\u2026! No, wait, I should have been the one to create a guild\u2026 But I don\u2019t have a mansion!]</p><br/><p>[Mm\u2026 Right, sorry, Hwaya.]</p><br/><p>[No, I\u2019ll become a First Dungeon explorer for sure. Kuk, since I don\u2019t have a mansion, I\u2019ll have to enter your guild\u2026 Kuuk!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go with Revival for the team name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya looked unhappy that she couldn\u2019t be the leader, but she still agreed on the team name. \u2018You learned to swallow your pride. You matured, Hwaya\u2026!\u2019</p><br/><p>[We can make you the team\u2019s leader, Hwaya.]</p><br/><p>[No, it\u2019s fine. It would look weird if I\u2019m the leader. Besides, you gathered the members, so you should be the leader. But if you ever give me the position of the guild leader, I\u2019ll become the team leader too!]</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen\u2026\u2019 I thought about it, then realized it was Hwaya\u2019s way of acknowledging me as the leader. In a way, she got embarrassed easily.</p><br/><p>Just like that, we became Team Revival. When we yelled hurrah with a sense of camaraderie, the helicopter pilot suddenly shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a wyvern coming straight toward us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tell us earlier!</p><br/><p>\u201cO Mitarus! O Earth!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia quickly created a barrier around the helicopter. The wyvern that appeared in front of the helicopter began to breath out fire. However, it could not penetrate Ludia\u2019s barrier. In anger, it tried to use physical attacks, as it folded its wings and flew toward the helicopter. Although Ludia said it would be fine, I was slightly worried whether her barrier could withstand the wyvern\u2019s attack. I immediately prepared myself to jump out of the helicopter.</p><br/><p>However, before the wyvern could reach the helicopter, the sound of a machine gun rang out like the one I heard in movies. Along with it, the wyvern became a beehive. Without even screaming, the wyvern fell to the ground. I was astonished.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 A gun? Against a monster?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard about it before. It should be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Hwaya looked up, murmuring in a surprised voice, we saw a helicopter approaching us. It was a helicopter just like ours, but it was letting out a black luster. Plus, the machine gun attached under the helicopter was smoking as if it just fired. I was certain that it was that machine gun that killed the wyvern.</p><br/><p>\u2026 But how? Guns shouldn\u2019t be able to kill wyverns, or most monsters with mana for that matter! While I was trying to figure out how it was possible, the black helicopter\u2019s window opened and a young man peeked his head out. He had black skin color and black hair with white teeth that shone under the sunlight. His smile was especially charming.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, guys[1. This was in English]! Don\u2019t forget to buy me a drink when you land!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was my first meeting with America\u2019s SS ranker, Leon Pepper.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>America\u2019s SS ranker, Leon Pepper, has appeared! If you say, \u2018Hey, you said you can\u2019t kill monsters with guns!\u2019 I can only say, \u2018He\u2019s the exception!\u2019 Look forward to finding out his ability and finding out what happens.</p><br/><p>PS \u2013 \u2018Hey, guys!\u2019 Was in English. Why? To add character! That\u2019s it\u2026</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Hey guys, I identify as an attack helicopter. Please no flame\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

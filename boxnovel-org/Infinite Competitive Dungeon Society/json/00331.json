Final Wave (1)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>After leaving Beyond, I slumped down on the chair in front of Loretta\u2019s Floor Shop. Loretta stared at me intently and tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t change much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I have to undergo some super transformation every time I come back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been doing that for a while now. I thought Oldie was pouring she has for Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking about it now, she wasn\u2019t wrong. I scratched the back of my head and retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, Sherafina will have some trouble filling up the higher floors again, but not this time. Even I can\u2019t stick a straw in and suck everything out from every enemy I meet. Ah, by the way\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly remembering what I just experienced, I clenched my right fist and raised my index finger before slowly moving it to the right.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Loretta didn\u2019t seem to understand, I went slower and gestured more clearly. Only then did Loretta seem to understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, I see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great\u2026 I knew my eyes weren\u2019t wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta smiled brightly as though she knew this would happen. I reached out and grabbed her hand before asking her what I\u2019ve been wondering for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you decide it was me from the very beginning?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. When Shin-nim was on the 7th floor, I was already certain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta smiled shyly and grabbed my hand tightly before continuing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThough, I didn\u2019t think I would come to love that person. That was also when I gave you the key.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Really, I can\u2019t win against Loretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow you know how amazing I am.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta strutted her chest and smiled confidently. Seeing her, I spoke as though I only just thought of something.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, I picked up an axe. Do you want it?\u201d</p><br/><p>What I took out from my inventory was none other than the black giant axe which carried the Death Lord\u2019s life.</p><br/><p>\u201cChaotic Spear is full now. I already extracted the skill it had, but it shouldn\u2019t lose in terms of sturdiness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s a present, I\u2019ll gladly accept it. But you should know that giving an axe to your lover isn\u2019t common sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t complain if you\u2019re going to take it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I grumbled and handed her the axe. Loretta swung the axe a couple times and seemed satisfied.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, this is a great weapon. Hm? I can\u2019t appraise it\u2026 It\u2019s beyond what Lord can read!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect for self-protection, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, have the monsters in the dungeon been that freakish lately?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, even Loretta might have trouble dealing with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I nodded seriously, Loretta made a tired expression before swinging her axe like she was angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust how many monsters did Lord put in the dungeon without me knowing? If not for Shin-nim, they might have swallowed up all of the dungeon\u2019s mana! The resources in the dungeon are infinite. Lord seems to be taking in monsters without much thought. How is she planning on dealing with the maintenance cost?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for telling me things I didn\u2019t want to know. Anyways, stop swinging that axe every time you say something. It\u2019s scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta smacked her lips and swung the axe a couple times more before putting it away in her body. I couldn\u2019t get used to it no matter how many times I looked at it. Still, I now knew that it was Loretta\u2019s unique spatial magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take good care of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if I\u2019m not there, that axe will protect Loretta well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOr Shin-nim can just stay with me always.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta murmured as she slowly approached me. Seeing her shining eyes, I could tell what she was thinking about. I scratched my face and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to climb the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat spear, it\u2019ll take some time for it to evolve, right? I\u2019m sure it will.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that she mentioned it, I indeed didn\u2019t have a reason to hold back from evolving the spear. I held up Chaotic Spear. Although it has been sucking in my mana for some time, it didn\u2019t seem close to finishing its evolution. I had to take a seat and focus on pouring mana into it.</p><br/><p>\u201cFairy Garden has great air and great water! I\u2019m sure being there will help Chaotic Spear\u2019s evolution!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have no basis for that, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta nodded confidently. She already had one hand holding onto mine, but now that she put away her axe, she used her freed hand to grab my shoulder tightly. If she had a tail, I\u2019m sure it would be shaking fiercely.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go! I can give it some of my mana too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. Just make me some delicious tea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure!\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as I gave my agreement, Loretta opened the gate to Fairy Garden. With a bitter smile, I walked in with Loretta.</p><br/><p>\u201cNoonim, you\u2019re being rude.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave.\u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason, when she saw Lin at her cabin, she tried to chase him out. However, Lin laughed shamelessly as he shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, now, this is the final evolution of a weapon I made. As its creator, shouldn\u2019t I offer my help?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLiiiiiin\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed Chaotic Spear automatically notified Lin when it became ready to evolve. But still, to think he would predict that I\u2019d come to Loretta\u2019s cabin\u2026</p><br/><p>I pacified Loretta, who was in her battle mode and smirked at Lin\u2019s slyness.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I needed Lin\u2019s help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen it evolved into Chaotic Spear from Gluttony Spear, I think it wasted too much energy. Plus, I thought its attribute would become similar to yours, but for some reason, its fire attribute became strengthened, which I didn\u2019t like.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t Lin a flame dragon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it was made, but it wasn\u2019t supposed to be like that when it evolved.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time I was hearing about this! When I stared at Lin, wondering why he didn\u2019t tell me all this time, he slowly dodged my gaze and looked away.</p><br/><p>\u201cA-Anyways, it didn\u2019t fully digest everything it devoured either. I guess it\u2019s my fault for not knowing it would devour a holy sword. So I went and settled it out with Eleine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow does Eleine relate to any of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin took out a small bead from his pocket.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you know, the magical tool Eleine gave you was quite extraordinary. Until then, I was looking down on her quite a bit. But that magical tool of hers could raise an item\u2019s rank by a stage even when it wasn\u2019t part of the item\u2019s creation process. That\u2019s a feat that\u2019s hard to explain with words. So if we borrowed her power, I figured we could get your spear to evolve without having any energy indigested.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd that bead is what you got from Eleine?\u201d</p><br/><p>I placed Chaotic Spear on top of a table. Lin examined the spear before letting out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cI expected as much, but it sure ate a lot of random stuff. Be thankful for my foresight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m always thankful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLies.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin snorted, but he seemed quite satisfied. At that moment, I saw a kiss mark on his neck. Thinking about the price he must have paid to get this item, a chill went down my back.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin, you going that far for me is a bit creepy, so please\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re trying to say, but this is from Loka.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin almost smacked me.</p><br/><p>I obediently placed my hand on top of Chaotic Spear. Loretta and Lin, whom I trusted absolutely, were both here with me. After gathering nearby mana with Peruta Circuit and Absolute Soul, I began to push every ounce of mana into Chaotic Spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis bastard\u2026 I already had an idea, but just how much mana does he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin, if you\u2019re going to do it, do it properly. If possible, end it quickly and leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand, so stop with that killing intent.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I poured mana into Chaotic Spear, Lin also placed the bead in his hand on Chaotic Spear before drawing out his mana. From the side, Loretta watched the scene of two horned men holding onto a single spear.</p><br/><p>After some time, the spear began to shine on its own. The amount of mana put into it easily surpassed 1.5 million. However, Lin\u2019s gaze told me to keep going, so I continued to pour more mana in.</p><br/><p>After a truly baffling amount of mana went into the spear, the bead placed on top of it disappeared. Lin widened his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew, there. Kang Shin, finish it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, I poured all the mana I had left in a final spurt. Immediately, the spear released a blinding light. Amidst the light, the shape of the spear became more simple.</p><br/><p>After one powerful light filled up the cabin, the spear finally stopped devouring my mana.</p><br/><p>The smooth spear handle was revealed first. The reddish black symbols covering the spear had disappeared, and an absolutely spotless platinum metal filled my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Lin, did something go wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think I know?\u201d</p><br/><p>After leading me on all this time, Lin betrayed me! I examined the spear more worriedly. First, the length didn\u2019t change much. The spear blade was a bit longer, making it more suited to stabbing than cutting, and it was made of an even whiter metal than the spear blade. I had never seen such a metal before.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a beautiful spear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Did it look different to Loretta? Her dazed voice made me reexamine the spear. Because of what she said, the spear suddenly looked prettier.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrab it, Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>I grabbed the spear like Loretta said. Immediately, an electrifying feeling spread from the tip of my fingers. Just by holding onto it, it seemed as though it had become a part of my body. Although Chaotic Spear was a supreme item in its own regard, it was incomparable to this spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it, Kang Shin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, how is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The draconian and elf were waiting for my reaction. I held up the platinum spear and embraced it. After confirming one thing, I spoke confidently.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 I can\u2019t see its information.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sherafina\u2019s indignity had yet to end.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

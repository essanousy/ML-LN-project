The End (3)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>From its birth, the dungeon was deeply tied to Sherafina and undoubtedly belonged to her. It was Sherafina who chose what monsters appeared on the dungeon\u2019s floors.</p><br/><p>That said, there was one rule she couldn\u2019t violate. The dungeon had a clear end and she couldn\u2019t increase or decrease the number of floors as she wanted. As the dragon and the Death Lord showed, she couldn\u2019t control all aspects of the dungeon either.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it closely, the dungeon actually had many flaws. For example, the escape of a single administrative guild master could halt the dungeon\u2019s operations.</p><br/><p>Sherafina surely had the ability to interfere, but she maintained an eerie silence. Because of it, I felt even more rushed.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, the 96th floor was too big. Even if I could ignore magic spells, mechanical traps, and monsters that lied in it, it still took me a long time to break through.</p><br/><p>Having spent five minutes to rush through the 96th floor, I headed up to the 97th floor while gritting my teeth.</p><br/><p>Even though I strongly told Ciara not to become an explorer, she went into the dungeon when she was \u2018selected\u2019. It was vexing to no end. When Ciara couldn\u2019t be located at the time Kune\u0113 activated, I should have known something happened.</p><br/><p>Sherafina was right. I told Ciara not to enter the dungeon because I didn\u2019t want her power to be nullified by worlds\u2019 enemies. That was a lie. The truth was I didn\u2019t want her to be exposed to Sherafina.</p><br/><p>Her innate Evil Eyes were already surprising, but carrying countless abilities in her body and creating new ability users, that was something even Sherafina couldn\u2019t do. Like mine, this authority of hers was an absolute power that had never existed before.</p><br/><p>Though Ciara herself might not be aware of it, she was deeply tied to me. There certainly was a reason that she was born in the same world as me.</p><br/><p>Sherafina said that I was connected to Ciara. Was it because Ciara had part of the world\u2019s power of Earth? Perhaps, but that was unlikely to be the only reason. A Hero with the power to concentrate all powers into one. A Saintess that appeared on Earth only. Though I didn\u2019t want to admit it, her existence had to have been prepared for me.</p><br/><p>Not by Sherafina, but by someone else.</p><br/><p>I broke through the 97th floor and immediately went up to the 98th floor. 13 minutes had passed since I completely conquered Beyond.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now on, it\u2019ll only be a matter of seconds\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I murmured impatiently. I did everything I could and that made me more impatient, as it meant I couldn\u2019t do anything more than that. Sherafina was an enemy in a league of her own, and I couldn\u2019t easily estimate the limits of her power.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the dungeon stopped. The monsters appearing here and there all disappeared, and the traps activating endlessly also ceased their function. This could only mean one thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as I thought.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sherafina was absorbing Ciara. Ciara\u2019s authority was truly powerful. Sherafina, who didn\u2019t have the ability to concentrate all powers into one, couldn\u2019t control the dungeon and absorb Ciara\u2019s authority at the same time.</p><br/><p>If that was possible, Sherafina would not have needed me. Thus, the dungeon was bound to stop the moment Ciara entered the dungeon.</p><br/><p>There was no need to hesitate. I charged through the silent dungeon as if my life was on the line. With no monsters or traps to get in my way, it became much easier to break through each floor. 98th floor\u2026 99th floor\u2026 I hoped Sherafina wouldn\u2019t finish absorbing Ciara by the time I reached her, but it was fine even if she did.</p><br/><p>I arrived.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>For a moment, I stood still without a word. The 99th Floor Shop. Looking at the empty storefront, my worry for Loretta grew. I didn\u2019t think she was in any danger with what Sherafina said, but without seeing her with my own eyes, I couldn\u2019t feel at ease.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 See you in a bit, Loretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>Beyond the storefront was the staircase to the 100th floor. Wasting time here would only benefit Sherafina. Throwing off the remaining worry and hesitation, I climbed the final staircase.</p><br/><p>A place I had visited before was waiting for me.</p><br/><p>The place I had visited from Fairy Garden with Loretta. As the dungeon\u2019s challenger, I had entered Sherafina\u2019s realm.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d</p><br/><p>She turned towards me. It was definitely Sherafina, the one I remembered meeting before. However, what she said next made me freeze in place.</p><br/><p>\u201cHero-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What?\u201d</p><br/><p>I rebutted with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cSherafina, I would rather you not imitate Ciara.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sherafina, who became my enemy, was imitating Ciara who I originally hated. Consequently, I was feeling more uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>Hearing my words, she widened her eyes before suddenly breaking out into a joyous smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my, my apologies. I\u2019m still in this form.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, she changed into Ciara\u2019s appearance. At a loss for words, I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you have a transformation ability. What\u2019s the point of doing this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, Hero-nim. I just forgot to change back to my appearance after checking out this new body. Don\u2019t be so angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, I realized that the girl in front of me was the real Ciara Kenex.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t tell with the energy I could feel from her. Ciara\u2019s energy was incomparably lacking compared to Sherafina\u2019s. However, my intuition, which became strengthened to a level of absolute correctness after obtaining the halo, suggested that the existence in front of me was closer to Ciara than Sherafina.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 How did you survive?\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked in a dumbfounded voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you think I would get eaten or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not. We\u2019re in a completely different League. An old hag who could not even embrace worlds\u2019 powers and at best move them among Heroes. Me who can distribute abilities among people. It\u2019s obvious who\u2019s superior!\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, Ciara had the power to distribute her power to people who weren\u2019t Heroes. However, the scale of the power they wielded was too different.</p><br/><p>But Ciara said this imposingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHero-nim, a stream wanted to devour an ocean and ended up becoming one with it. Then should this stream now be called a stream? Or an ocean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 Are you saying Sherafina is the stream? Someone who had such boundless mana and lofty League?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe amount of mana one has means nothing. Even if Hero-nim has no mana, Hero-nim will still be a Hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>She spoke as though it was the most obvious matter of fact.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same for me. Even if I have no mana, I am a Saintess. A Saintess, whose task is to support Hero-nim by his side and eliminate all who dares to get in his way. Although my League is shabby compared to Hero-nim\u2019s lofty League, I still wouldn\u2019t lose to a mere Irregular.\u201d</p><br/><p>If what Ciara was saying was true, everything Sherafina had done was in vain. Even if she managed to defeat me, she would have failed in absorbing me. I would have just absorbed her back. But of course, there was no way to test this hypothesis at this point.</p><br/><p>No matter how absurd this situation seemed, I couldn\u2019t say it didn\u2019t happen. The girl in front of me was certainly Ciara Kenex and she certainly had Sherafina\u2019s power in her body.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t expect this at all. Really, I didn\u2019t think Ciara would be the one waiting for me here. What I expected was Sherafina who obtained Ciara\u2019s power, that was it.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t stay silent forever. From what she explained to me just now, I picked out the phrase that weighed the most on my mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you say Irregular?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. She suddenly barged into my and Hero-nim\u2019s plan. What else would I call her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlan?\u201d</p><br/><p>At my follow-up question, she answered with a confident smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I say it from the start? That Hero-nim will be the one to rule everything in the end! The plan is to ensure that happens! The plan to concentrate all worlds\u2019 powers into Hero-nim alone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Whenever I heard her say this, I thought she was simply being a kid.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, wait, isn\u2019t that strange? Sherafina created this plan over 4,000 years ago. What do you mean she barged into \u2018our\u2019 plan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about, Hero-nim. It\u2019s only been 4,000 years ago! Hasn\u2019t Earth existed for billions of years?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ciara said as she tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat woman only realized that the number of worlds\u2019 powers were decreasing and tried to snatch them. She\u2019s a bug that shamelessly flew in the middle of our plan. Without her, our plan would have gone much smoother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, just how much do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, of course, I know everything there is to know about Earth!\u201d</p><br/><p>She answered as though it was a simple question.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t like this at first, but Hero-nim helped me open my eyes! Literally! Uhuhu, I still can\u2019t forget the moment when I first opened my eyes. To me who only knew the reason for existing, you gave both power and direction. With these eyes, I came to know everything that happened on Earth and everything that will happen on Earth in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou tricked me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was for Hero-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>She spoke without batting an eye.</p><br/><p>\u201cHero-nim is too kind. You care for even the tiniest insects that have no value. That will only delay our goal. Do you remember, Hero-nim? What happened in Antelope Canyon. I was really shocked. I only did what I did for Hero-nim\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I sighed at a loss for words, I suddenly remembered something. It was because she mentioned Antelope Canyon.</p><br/><p>Not too long ago, something similar had happened, except on a completely different scale.</p><br/><p>\u201cLand transmittance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, that\u2019s right. I knew everything, of course. But if I stopped it, all of humanity wouldn\u2019t be worshipping Hero-nim like they are doing now.\u201d</p><br/><p>2.3 billion people had died. If Ciara really knew what would happen, everything she told me and showed me had just been for show.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I knew Hero-nim would give me a kiss if I did that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I thought Ciara had changed. That she was narrow-minded because she was young and grew up in a sheltered environment. I believed she could change as she spent more time with us.</p><br/><p>But I was wrong. She hadn\u2019t changed at all. She was the same.</p><br/><p>Now, I knew.</p><br/><p>When 2.3 billion people died from land transmittances, all resentment was centered on Revival. But strangely, none of the resentment was directed at me, Revival\u2019s leader. Instead, I was treated as a messiah who would solve everything. Frankly, it was too unnatural. But now I knew why.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone had designed it to happen. That someone was in front of me.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

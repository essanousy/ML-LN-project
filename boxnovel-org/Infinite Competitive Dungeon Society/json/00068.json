Fairy Garden (1)</p><br/><p>The 30th Floor Master, Skeleton Knight\u2019s Undead Roar was an extremely annoying skill. Although Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry countered it perfectly, the fact that I could only use it once a day held me down.</p><br/><p>Was there an alternative? Of course, there was. I could use Dark Thunder Explosion. The Skeleton Knight wouldn\u2019t be able to dodge Dark Thunder Explosion at such a close range, and I could last throughout the Undead Roar\u2019s 10 second duration using Dark Thunder Explosion\u2019s duration.</p><br/><p>Although Dark Thunder Explosion wouldn\u2019t be as potent because the Skeleton Knight was made out of bones, he would at least be paralyzed for the duration.</p><br/><p>As Dark Thunder Explosion could also only be used once per day, I could rely on Dragon Skin for the third raid. If I succeeded in using Dragon Skin, I could last for the 10 seconds no matter what kind of attacks the Skeleton Knight used. At the very least, I wouldn\u2019t die.</p><br/><p>If possible, I wanted to do it without using the limited Floor Master skills. However, unless I brought in a priest who could use Status Effect Defense magic, I couldn\u2019t think of a way to resist the Skeleton Knight\u2019s skill.</p><br/><p>I tried asking Lin, but he said equipment that could block Undead Roar were only sold past the 60th floor. Although I shouldn\u2019t be the one to say this, but all Floor Master skills really were cheats!</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll show you what a true knight looks like!]</p><br/><p>However, the Skeleton Knight that appeared on the second raid said rather interesting things.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould Floor Masters personalities change too?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Floor Masters until now had simple and brutish personalities, so there wasn\u2019t a need to consider their personalities. But here on the 30th Floor Master, the change in the Floor Master\u2019s personality and his skeleton minions\u2019 personalities were clear.</p><br/><p>[Everyone, charge! Make the one who dares to invade the dungeon pay with his life!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhahaha! I\u2019ll change my skull today!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis shinbone is mine!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis armor looks sturdy. I\u2019ll get myself a new armor!\u201d</p><br/><p>The skeleton minions made their desire to ransack me clear, as if they were pirates. As the armored skeletons attacked, the skeleton mages and archers also shot their magic attacks and arrows. They couldn\u2019t be more ready for battle if they tried.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like it\u2019ll be harder than last time. Peika!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Thunder Arrow!]</p><br/><p>Peika\u2019s elemental magic activated and the mages quickly cast defensive magic, while the melee skeletons rushed towards me with the Skeleton Knight taking charge. Surprisingly, half of the Thunder Arrows dissipated without being able to break through their defense. Of course, the remaining half wiped out the skeleton mages beautifully.</p><br/><p>[Master, should I go again?]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. The archers aren\u2019t as dangerous as the mages.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I could consume Mana Potions, they had a cooldown time, meaning drinking other potions would have no effect during that time. My mana wasn\u2019t bountiful to the point I could freely use elemental magic yet. Slowly circulating Peruta Circuit, I thrust my spear forward.</p><br/><p>I was facing an army of skeletons over 200 large. Although it was a different sight compared to the disorderly first Floor Master battle, I preferred the difficulty to be set on high than easy.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone come fight me!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You used Provoke! All enemies will attack you with great hostility!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s trample him! Take his rib bones!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake his skull!\u201d</p><br/><p>The skeletons\u2019 footsteps became faster. With a grin, I shot out my spear. The current of mana spiraling through the spear stormed to the skeletons, wanting to rip them to shreds.</p><br/><p>\u201cTempest!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>\u201cUguk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>The skeletons and the arrows shot by skeleton archers all bounced off of Tempest\u2019s strength. Death Counter made the attack 50 percent stronger and Skull Breaker\u2019s effect increased the critical hit rate and damage. All the skeletons that were struck by critical hits had no other choice but to die.</p><br/><p>[Skull Breaker, you wield elementals!]</p><br/><p>The Skeleton Knight became enraged and charged towards me on his skeleton mount. His terrifying appearance and large sword gave off an imposing aura. Very satisfied at his appearance, I shouted as I ran to meet him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but that wasn\u2019t an elemental magic!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuoooooooo!]</p><br/><p>His sword came from an odd direction and aimed for my neck. Since it was easy to dodge it knowing where it was aiming for, I slid toward skeleton mount\u2019s legs with my spear in hand. As the skeleton mount lost its balance and staggered, the Skeleton Knight\u2019s sword naturally lost its trajectory and failed to even glaze me.</p><br/><p>[Skull Breaker!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll crush your head! First, get off of your cool horse!\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn, his skeleton mount really was too cool. My shout full of jealousy was returned with a counterattack. Just like before, I slid down the skeleton mount\u2019s legs and disrupted his balance. The furious Skeleton Knight then shouted.</p><br/><p>[Kill Skull Breaker!]</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone charge!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis seventh cervical vertebrae is mine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Stop with that cervical vertebrae talk!</p><br/><p>[You obtained 50,000 gold.]</p><br/><p>[Rewards will be distributed in order of contribution.]</p><br/><p>[Kang Shin-nim\u2019s contribution is the highest. Choose your reward.]</p><br/><p>[1. Bone Strengthening Elixir</p><br/><p>2. Skeleton Knight\u2019s Helmet]</p><br/><p>It was here, the Bone Strengthening Elixir! I felt my excitement from battle continuing to the reward picking stage. As expected, the 30th Floor Master dropped the Bone Strengthening Elixir. After all, skeletons appeared from the 26th floor! I chose the Bone Strengthening Elixir and swallowed it without hesitation.</p><br/><p>[Your bones are transformed to become tougher and stronger. Strength and constitution both increase by 1.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOoooooooh!\u201d</p><br/><p>I already expected constitution to increase, but strength increased as well! I did an uppercut into the air and reveled in my happiness. I soon snapped out of it. I had no more business in this wilderness. Just when I was about to leave, I received a message. It was a from Hwaya.</p><br/><p>[Y-Yeon Hwawoo.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Mas\u2026 Hwaya. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><br/><p>[TV\u2026 Are you watching TV?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the dungeon, why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, I received a KaTalk. When I opened it up, father had uncharacteristically sent me a picture. There was no wifi in the dungeon. How mean.</p><br/><p>When I looked at the picture with that in mind\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026 Since when did Osaka Castle have swirling dark red cloud effects?\u2019</p><br/><p>[Most of the Event Dungeons left uncleared turned into Field Dungeons!]</p><br/><p>The question that popped into my head was quickly answered by Hwaya.</p><br/><p>Now that I thought about it, a bunch of messages did ring out in the middle of battle. I quickly asked the message noona to bring up the message log.</p><br/><p>[S-rank Event Dungeon, \u2018Wyvern\u2019s Nest,\u2019 turned into a Field Dungeon! When the boss monster isn\u2019t periodically subjugated, monsters might break out of the dungeon.]</p><br/><p>[B+-rank Event Dungeon, \u2018General\u2019s Honor,\u2019 turned into a Field Dungeon! When the boss monster isn\u2019t periodically subjugated, monsters might break out of the dungeon.]</p><br/><p>[A+-rank Event Dungeon, \u2018Graveyard Over the Lake,\u2019 turned into a Field Dungeon! When the boss monster isn\u2019t periodically subjugated, monsters might break out of the dungeon.]</p><br/><p>[B-rank Event Dungeon, \u2018Ghoul\u2019s Resting Place,\u2019 turned into a Field Dungeon! When the boss monster isn\u2019t periodically subjugated, monsters might break out of the dungeon.]</p><br/><p>[D-rank Event Dungeon, \u2018Goblin\u2019s Den,\u2019 turned into a Field Dungeon! When the boss monster isn\u2019t periodically subjugated, monsters might break out of the dungeon.]</p><br/><p>[C+-rank Event Dungeon\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya, do you know what a Field Dungeon is?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m not sure, but the dungeons that were only accessible through the Gates seemed to have moved to Earth. Not to mention\u2026 It looks like these dungeons won\u2019t go away even if you clear them.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure some people will be happy about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, the world was already overflowing with monsters. There were places where entire countries were felled by monsters and turned into their nests, and places that were specifically given to monsters. Even small village-side mountains were now off limits. For anyone looking to hunt monsters, there were more than enough of them.</p><br/><p>However, monster group colonies were extremely dangerous. No one knew where they would pop out from. Not even satellites could determine their location. Monsters constantly moved, transformed, and became fully grown at the most unexpected times. It really made one angry. It was also the reason Guardians and Freedom Wings traveled in large units. This fact also caused the high death rate of rogues.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, dungeons had many of the same type of monsters. Once the initial exploration was finished, it was possible to estimate the monsters\u2019 level of danger. Plus, as they were limited areas, it was possible to optimize the explorers that went in. Overall, it was much easier to hunt in the dungeons than in the wild.</p><br/><p>[Yep, for dungeons with moderate difficulty, hunters would gather, so there would be no problem subjugating them. However, for dungeons that had A-rank or above difficulty\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cGuardians, who are obligated to go protect the citizens, would die.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Guardian will surely ask Freedom Wing for help. They wouldn\u2019t be able to ignore the public outcry.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya, will you be fine? You\u2019re Britain\u2019s Guardian.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m not. You know about it, right? The A+-rank Event Dungeon turned into a A+-rank Field Dungeon. All Guardians S-rank and above were summoned to assess its danger.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have it rough. Well, if it\u2019s you, you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Thanks for the compliment, but\u2026 huu\u2026]</p><br/><p>Hwaya\u2019s voice was filled with annoyance. I first got out of the wilderness and left the dungeon as well. I had to see what was happening on Earth with my own eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here, son.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not changing the channel, right? Let me see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo ahead. Hm, it\u2019s a good thing we took care of Yeungdeungpo\u2019s dungeon so quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father was sitting on the couch in a casual clothing, while eating popcorn and watching TV. It seemed he didn\u2019t care much about other countries\u2019 problems. Although he was my father, I was jealous of his simple way of thinking. Looking at father from the corner of my eyes, I continued my conversation with Hwaya.</p><br/><p>[You know Britain has another SS-rank other than me, right?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I heard it\u2019s a man.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Joshua Brightman. He\u2019s called the world\u2019s toughest man.]</p><br/><p>\u201cJoshua Brightman, huh. Eh? I\u2019ve heard his name before.\u201d</p><br/><p>[He\u2019s a chaebol. The owner of a famous clothing enterprise.]</p><br/><p>A chaebol awakening as an SS-rank? Why did I feel like that was as cheaty as a dungeon explorer awakening as an ability user? However, since I was also a cheaty person by that reasoning, I couldn\u2019t really complain.</p><br/><p>[He\u2019s 37 this year.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in his late thirties.\u201d</p><br/><p>[He proposed to me.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something to congratulate. Wouldn\u2019t he be the world\u2019s number one suiter?\u201d</p><br/><p>[He already has a wife. He probably has multiple girlfriends as well.]</p><br/><p>Oh, so he\u2019s a bastard.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019d rather die, that pervert! You too! Don\u2019t congratulate me! Worry!]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, well, yeah. I\u2019m worried. You refused, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Of course. I utterly spit on his proposal, but he just won\u2019t give up. I ran away to Korea because I didn\u2019t want to face him, but I\u2019ll have to see him when I go back\u2026 haa.]</p><br/><p>Even with the distance we were separated by, I could clearly picture her frowning face from her sigh filled with despair. Although I almost laughed, I held it in.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s normal for men to hit on girls as beautiful as you. Since you\u2019re strong, you can strike him down.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Say that again.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? Since you\u2019re strong, you can strike him down\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Before that.]</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s normal for men to hit on girls.\"</p><br/><p>[In between.]</p><br/><p>\u201c.. on girls as beautiful as you?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Mmm\u2026 Okay, I\u2019ll try my best.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know which part of that cheered you up.\u201d</p><br/><p>[As soon as I take care of this Field Dungeon problem, I\u2019ll invite you to Britain. You\u2019ve never visited, right? Come visit with Sumire and Yungoong ajusshi!]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, sure\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Good! I\u2019ll contact you later!]</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll gladly go if there\u2019s an invite. I wanted to see Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, and Buckingham Palace. Even while training with father, we strangely never visited Britain. Hwaya\u2019s sudden change in tone did bother me slightly, but it was too late to ask her now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for us to move this time. It\u2019s not something we have to urgently take care of, and other countries have Awakened too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. But the increased chance of an Event Raid breaking out at places that turned into Field Dungeons bothers me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll find out when the time comes.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I retorted to comments father made naturally and glanced at him, he lay down on the couch like he didn\u2019t really care. I went over the conversation with Hwaya with my head tilted. Then, father turned his head toward me and casually proclaimed.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, I\u2019m currently in the middle of breaking through the 37th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. I bet you were itching to brag.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unlike father, I\u2019m taking my time collecting all the things I need! You\u2019re so scared of losing, you don\u2019t even ask me to spar!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Crimson Roar (3)</p><br/><p>Compared to Korean people, British people were more relaxed. No, perhaps I shouldn\u2019t generalize all British people with just them. It could just be that the ability users here were like that.</p><br/><p>Was it because they were repeatedly hunting the same area for several weeks? They didn\u2019t seem concerned with clearing the dungeon anytime soon, as they ate dinner and sipped on red tea while they watched tunas splashing above the lake\u2019s surface.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, it\u2019s raining.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should stop soon, though it\u2019ll come back later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes it snow here too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen it gets cold enough. It\u2019s the same as in Korea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya had rented an entire residence in Windermere as her lodging place. Currently, it was just the two of us in a small room on the second floor of her residence. Hwaya was drinking red tea while blankly watching the rain outside the window. Her flame-red eyes were calm, and her smooth, fluttery red hair was the only bright spot in the undecorated, bland room.</p><br/><p>Seeing her holding her teacup, I thought she really looked beautiful, like she was a painting. Then, before I noticed, she turned to my direction and looked at me with half-closed eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you not stare at me so fixedly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Sorry. You were so beautiful that I lost myself for a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Huu, I\u2019m usually happy to get compliments, but because I\u2019ve been getting them from people I hate recently, I\u2019m sick of them. Sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are honest\u2026 I\u2019m the one who\u2019s sorry for reminding you of them, but I didn\u2019t actually mean it in a flattering way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, and I know you\u2019re not that kind of person. That\u2019s why I\u2019m annoyed with myself who can\u2019t come to like your compliment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya put down her teacup as she spoke bitterly. Brightman really was hated\u2026 Was that part of his plan? Whether positively or negatively, he was making her think about him a lot\u2026 No, not even the Divine Capturer[1. The World God Only Knows reference] would think of such a method.</p><br/><p>I put away my useless thoughts and returned to the main subject.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we should get started. How to check the amount of mana you have available and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, before that, we need to talk about something else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was right, there was something I had to explain to her first. With a bitter smile, I scratched my head. I closed my eyes and checked if there were any other presences nearby. I didn\u2019t think anyone would be hiding and did it as a precaution\u2026 But I couldn\u2019t help but ask Hwaya curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya, is anyone else living here with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? No.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s weird, I can feel traces of someone that\u2019s not you\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s the people who lent you this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe? It hasn\u2019t been that long since I rented it. I\u2019ll check later just in case.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I wasn\u2019t fully satisfied, it was true that we were the only ones in this house, for now. I took in a breath\u2026 and took off my mask.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya quietly stared at my face. As it was a bit embarrassing to continue staring at her face, I turned my gaze away slightly. Soon, she nodded her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re much more handsome than I imagined. Just my type.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for the blatant compliment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, you have black hair and black eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Korean after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, I had considered the possibility that you weren\u2019t Korean.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I am\u2026 By the way, my real name is Kang Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo your last name is Kang\u2026 Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>She tilted her head, and I told her the truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Yungoong-ssi is my father.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou scammer!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuu, you lied to me so easily. I can\u2019t believe you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, that\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you now. It wasn\u2019t easy, you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, so you want me to be happy about it? Like you acknowledged me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 Sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya complained for a little while longer, then seemingly calmed down. Ah, wait, nevermind. She placed her teacup on her plate so angrily that I almost thought the plate would break.</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw the number of dungeon explorers on Earth increased to six. Did you do that too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, a friend of mine is an Awakened. Don\u2019t worry, that person is trustworthy and talented, worthy of being an explorer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUu, so three out of the six are already\u2026 No, but considering your personality\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I knew what she wanted to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan on making an organization like you. It\u2019s just my friend and father. Not to mention, you could make someone an explorer if you wanted to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026 Can I trust you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I lie?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa, I feel like I learned too many things just now. My head feels like it might burst.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take it too seriously. My father made me an explorer, I hid my identity in Earth\u2019s dungeon explorer communication channel, and I made a friend I trusted into a dungeon explorer. There\u2019s nothing more to it. I\u2019m also revealing my identity to someone I can trust.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too hard to accept it so simply.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya put her head in her hands and looked like she was agonizing over something. Then, with a tired voice, she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever, I\u2019ll trust you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuiet! You made me doubt someone I acknowledged as a friend even for a moment. That\u2019s a very annoying and sad thing for me. You\u2019ll have to make it up to me properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said you would teach me! Before I master it, you\u2019d better make time to teach me every night. Got it? This is your punishment! \u2026 But I\u2019ll at least serve you milk tea when you come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Never in my life did I receive such a cute punishment. I grinned and nodded my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, got it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Why are you smiling? It makes you look sly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m just happy I got to know a surprising side of my friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuuk\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya seemed to be embarrassed by my words, as she threw the teakettle at me. It seemed I would need to wait a bit more before I could start teaching her.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>From the 38th floor on, ghost knights appeared. If ghosts were the apparitions of ordinary people, ghost knights were the apparitions of knights riding on their ghost horses. Watching them charge at me on their ghost horses was quite a spectacle.</p><br/><p>[Kill the human!]</p><br/><p>[Living beings, taste the wrath of the dead!]</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I care, move!\u201d</p><br/><p>More importantly, it was much easier to break through than the previous floors.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, run!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Aoooooooooo!]</p><br/><p>As Ruyue ran crazily, the wall of ghosts to my left and right were pushed back at an incredible speed. Meanwhile, I only looked forward as I swung my spear. Although there were also ghosts, because their numbers were low, I was perfectly fine just defending myself while running forward. Ghost knights weren\u2019t my opponents. I was happy that clearing the dungeon floors became easy again. While Ruyue ran carrying me on her back, Peika watched out for the ghosts\u2019 soul arrows. Compared to the 36th and 37th floor, this floor matched my style much more.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaa! Kill that rat! Stab your swords in his neck!]</p><br/><p>[As knights, we\u2019ll recover our besmirched honor!]</p><br/><p>\u201cCome at me! Get in line!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cutting past the ghost knights as I charged onward mindlessly, I managed to break through the 38th floor in five hours, half the time it took me to clear the 36th floor.</p><br/><p>[You became level 39.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained 5 bonus stats.]</p><br/><p>\u201cPerfect timing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Watching me gasping for breath, Lin threw something at me apathetically. I caught it and confirmed what it was. It was an earring, only one of what usually came in a pair. With two oval gems radiating a glowing gold, the beautiful craftsmanship made it more suitable for a woman than a man. I stared at it blankly for a while, then asked Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin, this is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSee for yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Golden Teardrop (Unique)</p><br/><p>Durability \u2013 90/90</p><br/><p>Equipment Limit \u2013 One Who Defeated the Blood Succubus</p><br/><p>Options \u2013 Intelligence +5, Magic +5, Charm +15</p><br/><p>Skill \u2013 Succubus\u2019 Pupil (Passive): Wearing the earring amplifies your charm. You can resist mental status effects more easily, and there is a small chance it can reflect the status effect onto the enemy.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWow\u2026 This really is an amazing item!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Lin put out his hand. As promised, I gave him 100,000 gold. It was my turn now!</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Lin, shouldn\u2019t you start making my other equipment? My weapon and the like.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce you break through the 40th floor, I\u2019ll do it without you having to nag me! Don\u2019t make me remember such painful truths when I\u2019m collecting money!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin, you should really be more honest. You already know I\u2019ll break through the 40th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin shook in rage while holding the bag of gold. It was only then that the emptiness I was feeling seemed to be filled. I couldn\u2019t help but let out a refreshing smile. Then, I equipped the Golden Teardrop. Since I was already equipping the Power Earring and Blood Succubus\u2019 Earring, I decided to say goodbye to the Power Earring, which only raised my strength by 2.</p><br/><p>\u201cEk, disgusting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know, I agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t really care that the earrings were different. As they were both from the Blood Succubus, they went together quite well. The problem was that I was male, but with no other choice, I put on the earrings firmly.</p><br/><p>When I arrived at the 39th floor, the ghosts had disappeared and were replaced by specters. Of course, most of the enemies were still ghost knights. Without a care in the world, I raised my spear. Specters were apparitions known for their ability to possess people. As such, they charged towards me the moment they caught sight of me.</p><br/><p>[Kiikii, it\u2019s a human.]</p><br/><p>[Control him.]</p><br/><p>[Stabbing yourself with your own spear will feel special!]</p><br/><p>I dematerialized Ruyue and infused her into my armor. Now, Peika was in my spear and Ruyue was in my armor. What would happen if specters tried to possess my spear or armor?</p><br/><p>[Ugyaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>[Gyak! Cold! It\u2019s too cold, I can\u2019t move!]</p><br/><p>They were electrocuted or frozen by themselves.</p><br/><p>[Uwaaak, an Elementalist!]</p><br/><p>[Elementalist!]</p><br/><p>[Run!]</p><br/><p>When all the spectres were chased away, the ghost knights that were charging stopped in their tracks. With a smirk, I raised my spear. They were slowly backing off. Of course, I didn\u2019t just leave them be.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>[You became level 40! You obtained the qualification to challenge the Floor Master!]</p><br/><p>[You obtained 5 bonus stats.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are fast. You seemed to be having trouble yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCompared to the 36th and 37th floor, the last two floors were a piece of cake. I was nervous for nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel stupid just talking to you now. Hurry up and go to the 40th floor. Then die and come back a week later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are blunt about it now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as I was dumbfounded, I made sure to buy plenty of Holy Water from Lin. I didn\u2019t know the identity of the 40th Floor Master, but he was sure to be some sort of ghost. With Holy Water, I would have a much better chance!</p><br/><p>\u201cWish me luck, Lin, so that I can get the dragon leather cape!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScrew off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yep, angry Lin was the best! Giving him a thumbs up, I climbed to the 40th floor. As the 40th floor wasn\u2019t any different in structure or the type of monsters that appeared, I got to the end without much trouble. When I was in front of the Floor Master room\u2019s unique black door, it was four in the morning. Since breakfast was at seven, I would be able to sleep for about two hours after defeating the boss once.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nobody had taken the 40th floor boss\u2019 \u2018first\u2019 achievement. There was sure to be a reason that no one had succeeded the 40th Floor Master\u2019s first achievement, even though the 25th through 35th first achievements were accomplished. First, I applied an ample amount of Holy Water onto my weapons.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026 I can do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>I had paid Loretta 50,000 gold for this info. I couldn\u2019t screw up here after doing so well until now! After taking in a deep breath, I opened the door with my Black Earthen Spear in hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cFight me\u2026 Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>What was beyond the door was a dreary land that seemed to have been taken out of hell. There were a countless number of ghosts and specters, and also ghost knights that were ready to charge.</p><br/><p>Floating above them was an existence wearing a worn down cloak and pointing a pitch black scythe at my direction.</p><br/><p>[Kikikik\u2026 It seems I will have to guide another dead soul.]</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Avarice Devours Everything (9)</p><br/><p>The wyvern did not return to the palace, but stopped half-way and dropped us off. It was the rendezvous point we set beforehand.</p><br/><p>Ludia, who had gone to hide in the dungeon at my request, returned and was already waiting there. Others who had safely escaped the demons\u2019 camp were also gathered. As my team was escaping, the ruckus we caused by breaking the barrier had drawn much attention away from the others, letting them escape more easily.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was that message about world\u2019s enemy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you go rescue them? Why are you alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dimensional Mercenaries approached me and asked questions. However, I raised my hand and stopped them.</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, first, get away from the knights.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Kyak!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I said so, the knights made their move. It wasn\u2019t to protect Ludia, but to capture her. Come on! All the surviving knights were traitors!? Even the magicians\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all traitors!\u201d</p><br/><p>I shouted sharply and used Divine Speed. I stabbed my spear into the knight trying to restrain Ludia and held her in one arm. Then I jumped back, all of which only happened in 3 seconds.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat just happened!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNewbie, you\u2019re really fast\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>They were quick to understand the situation. The moment I rescued Ludia, they tried to escape to the dungeon. When I tried to capture them with Ruyue\u2019s power\u2026</p><br/><p>[Explorers that betrayed their world and joined the world\u2019s enemy have been kicked out of the dungeon.]</p><br/><p>[Their abilities as explorers have been recollected.]</p><br/><p>What? I narrowed my eyes. What was this message saying? Why was the dungeon doing this now?</p><br/><p>The knights and magicians, who were trying to open the dungeon, suddenly collapsed. It was likely because they had lost their strength. The Dimensional Mercenaries didn\u2019t miss this opportunity. Without a shred of hesitation, they attacked the traitors\u2019 vital points and killed them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did the dungeon figure out they were the world\u2019s enemies now?\u201d</p><br/><p>[The dungeon\u2019s system automatically provides experience calculation, inventory, and item drops to all explorers, but it cannot focus on specific explorers all the time. Moreover, finding explorers that joined the world\u2019s enemy in a world where their forces are strong is close to impossible. As such, Dimensional Mercenaries serve as eyes of the dungeon to find explorers that betrayed their own worlds.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re smart, message noona\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Message noona who satisfied my curiosity did not reply to my words of astonishment. It seemed the other Dimensional Mercenaries already knew about this. Since they killed the traitors so resolutely, there must be rewards for killing the traitors too\u2026</p><br/><p>[All traitors have been killed. Rewards will be distributed appropriately.]</p><br/><p>[The lover of the Demon Lord was killed. You obtained 5 stat points and 2 skill points as reward. Stats point gained: 13. Skill points gained: 2]</p><br/><p>Tsk, I didn\u2019t want such a bittersweet reward. Seeing my complexion turn dark at the message, Ludia, who was watching me, became startled and separated from me. She then asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cShina, where\u2019s Shina?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Ludia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, where\u2019s Shina?\u201d</p><br/><p>I pointed at the wyvern. On its back was the burnt up corpse of Shina. When Ludia saw the corpse, she didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe confirmed it. Shina was\u2026 an enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 a lie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNewbie\u2019s telling the truth. If it wasn\u2019t for him, we would have all died. Damn, that demonic sword still makes me shiver.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShina had\u2026 a demonic sword?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded my head. Ludia slowly approached the wyvern and pulled the corpse down. Seeing the corpse cut into two halves, she became speechless. I couldn\u2019t help but talk to her.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Ludia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2026 Who killed her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><br/><p>I told her the truth. She shut her eyes tightly then opened them.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie and tell me the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI killed her. Shina tried to kill me, who had transformed into you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease\u2026 Don\u2019t lie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Sorry, but I\u2019m not lying to you. I killed her, Ludia.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia\u2019s lips trembled. She opened her mouth then closed it again, as if to say something. Then, she glared at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia shouted louder than I had ever heard her before.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this what you wanted? Making me escape to the dungeon because it was dangerous, taking my appearance, almost dying to Shina, then killing her? I was waiting for you in the dungeon without knowing anything. Like a clueless idiot! What am I supposed to do after hearing this? What is this!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want this either. I didn\u2019t want it to be true!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve gone with you. Like I first thought, I should have gone with you! Even if Shina killed me, I should have gone! I had to see it with my own eyes and experience it for myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou would have died!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather die! Because you protected me, I became the world\u2019s biggest idiot, fool, and blockhead! Is this what you wanted? Did you want me to obediently stay in the dungeon because you said it was dangerous, then crawl out when everything was over, see my sister\u2019s corpse, and nod my head and say it couldn\u2019t be helped since she was a traitor!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did!\u201d</p><br/><p>I also shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than you dying! I didn\u2019t want to lose my friend. Is that bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause you tried to protect me, I lost my authority as a member of the Imperial family, my pride as an explorer, and even my qualification to be your friend! Because I was afraid of my sister being a traitor, I became a coward, who left my friend to go save my sister and hid in the dungeon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s wrong with that!? You don\u2019t understand your priorities!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who can\u2019t understand! Look at me! Both mother and father were killed, but hiding in that small house in the dungeon, I couldn\u2019t even see Shina die with my own eyes. And I had to hear that my sister\u2019s killer was none other than you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anything anymore! I have nothing at all! There\u2019s nothing to protect, there\u2019s no reason to live! I would have rather died to Shina. I would have rather protected you and died! That way, I could have at least protected my friend!\u201d</p><br/><p>The emperor and the empress died? I wanted to say something, but I was lost for words. I remembered what Shina said, that the highest ranking demons had gone to attack the Imperial Palace\u2026</p><br/><p>Did the emperor and empress leave behind a will for her? Did they meet an honorable end? I didn\u2019t know whether to be sad or happy at the fact that they at least didn\u2019t experience torture without being able to die like in my dreams.</p><br/><p>Leaving my speechless self behind, Ludia fell on the ground helplessly. Then, with a barely audible voice, she murmured.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, Shin. Sorry\u2026 Sorry for only sending you\u2026 I\u2019m the one that made you kill Shina with your hands, I\u2019m the one\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing her suddenly change from condemning me, I became flustered. She wasn\u2019t mentally stable at the moment. After thinking about what to say, I replied in a quiet voice.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s what I wanted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m the worst. I\u2019m worthless. I\u2019m a clueless fool, who gets scared at the most critical moments and can only let others do my job. I don\u2019t have the qualification to be royalty, to be an explorer, or even to live\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, don\u2019t say that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hate you. I can\u2019t help but hate you. I hate myself. I hate myself for hating you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, you need rest. I beg you, don\u2019t think about anything and just rest. If you hate me, I can disappear. I understand why you would hate me, so I\u2019ll go away so that you won\u2019t see me anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia suddenly shouted. Her eyes were full of fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou stole my sister from me, and you even want to take away what I have left?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Was Ludia talking about me? Startled by her words, I stood still without knowing what to say. She staggered up and approached me. Holding on to my arms, she looked up. Her blue eyes were glistening with tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Shin. Don\u2019t. Please\u2026 You\u2019re the only one I have left. I lost mother, father, and Shina. I don\u2019t want to lose you too\u2026 Sorry. I won\u2019t hate you, so please don\u2019t leave. Please\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia had gotten weak. That\u2019s what I thought. She was mentally pushed to the point she would cling to me, who had killed her sister. Since the day Shina was captured by the Demon Lord, or at least thought to be captured, she was broken. The wound she had patched under the goal of rescuing Shina had burst, leaving her helpless.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t go. Don\u2019t leave me alone\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s having a mental panic attack. Thinking that the world would collapse leaving her alone or that she is now worthless\u2026 It\u2019s common among explorers that lost their worlds. At least, she still has you\u2026 Newbie, you better think carefully before you act.\u201d</p><br/><p>The summoner mercenary spoke bitterly. Then, he disappeared using Return. The other mercenaries disappeared one by one. I couldn\u2019t blame them. Once the demons occupied the Imperial Palace, they would be coming for us next. It was the correct choice to go back as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>In the end, only Ludia and I were left in the field. Our surrounding was strangely quiet, almost as if something would suddenly pop out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright\u2026 In that case, I\u2019ll stay by your side. Even if you hate me, I\u2019ll stay with you. I won\u2019t hate you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hate you, but\u2026 thank you\u2026 hic.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia held me and cried silently. I patted her back, feeling a sense of unease. What would happen to the two of us? Would we be able to stay as friends? This dangerous relationship, will it be able to hold on without crumbling down?</p><br/><p>Embracing her, that was all I could think about as she cried.</p><br/><p>\u201cShina\u2019s corpse. Burn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once she stopped crying, that was the first thing Ludia said. She was still clinging to my arm. I couldn\u2019t joke around like I usually would.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, get rid of the traces of Shina.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I was about to burn her corpse, a voice rang out behind me. Now that I thought about it, there was someone here. It was Bellode. I was wondering where he was, but he had been collapsed on the ground the entire time after being hit by the summoner. Did he just wake up and realize what happened\u2026? I suddenly felt sorry for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to send her off\u2026 Please, Your Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBellode\u2026 Fine. You can do as you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia made a surprised expression, but soon nodded her head with a bitter expression. Bellode nodded respectfully, then slowly took out his sword. Fire then enveloped his sword. Just like how Peruta Circuit manifested whirlwinds, he could turn his mana into flames that burned everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness\u2026 May you rest well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The flame he sent flying landed on Shina\u2019s split corpse. As her corpse was burning, we silently watched, while Bellode cried.</p><br/><p>Once Shina\u2019s corpse had burned to ashes, Bellode turned around and respectfully bowed to us\u2026 No, he bowed to Ludia.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re safe, Your Highness. I should have asked for your safety first. I apologize for stepping out of line.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI forgive you, Bellode\u2026 And I\u2019m no longer the Crown Princess. I will throw away my status as royalty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBellode, there\u2019s no time\u2026 You should abandon the Luka continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was concise.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no hope left here. If you don\u2019t want to die with Shina, immediately run away to the dungeon. You\u2019re in a guild.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, Your Highness\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBellode, go. Next time you see me, don\u2019t call me Your Highness. This continent\u2026 is over.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Party member Palludia Gren Ehuir has been changed to an independent explorer. With her consent, you can Return to Earth with her.]</p><br/><p>With trembling eyes, Bellode looked at Ludia, then turned to look at Shina\u2019s ashes, which began to scatter into the wind. He bit his lips, turning back around and bowing deeply to Ludia. Then, he disappeared. He had gone to the dungeon. Seeing him disappear, Ludia leaned in my embrace without strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired\u2026 I want to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>I could feel the weight of her entire body leaning on me, making me realize to my bones how weak she had gotten.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t let her leave to the Residential Area like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, do you want to\u2026 come to Earth?\u201d</p><br/><p>At my question, Ludia opened her eyes widely in shock. Then, she nodded her head. Her complexion was brighter than before. I was worried that she might not like it, but I felt relieved. Even if she returned to the Residential Area now, it would be bad for her.</p><br/><p>However, Luka continent would not let us leave so easily.</p><br/><p>[Savior, Hero. For what reason have you arrived at this fallen world?]</p><br/><p>I knew instinctively. This showy voice belonged to the Demon Lord. Just by hearing the voice, Ludia shook uncontrollably and clung to me. As I turned around, I also trembled from the presence I could feel with my entire body.</p><br/><p>In the sky, there was a bat.</p><br/><p>[Do forgive me for being rude and not seeing a guest with my real body. But my real body is currently in deep sleep to accept the world\u2019s power.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about the power you obtained by killing this world\u2019s Hero?\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s right, Hero. Did you enjoy the game? My concubine should have entertained you.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was distasteful. You aren\u2019t very good at greeting your guests, Demon Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Huhuhu\u2026 You say rather interesting things, other world\u2019s Hero.]</p><br/><p>The bat continued.</p><br/><p>[Last surviving Princess, come to me. You were the one I wanted from the beginning. If you become mine, everything you ever wanted will be yours.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the name of Mitarus, go kill yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia spat. Looking at the Demon Lord\u2019s familiar, her eyes were burning with fear and rage. I decided that it would be the best to stop Ludia from seeing the Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>[Oh, how unfortunate. But even the Hero holding you so reliably will soon die. In the end, Heroes are only scapegoats. With a few petty blessings, they are forced to fight against us.]</p><br/><p>\u201cReturn!\u201d</p><br/><p>I used Return. Immediately, the surrounding scenery became distorted and melted down.</p><br/><p>Before we realized, Ludia and I were in my house on Earth. As Ludia was staring at me blankly, I smile softly and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon Lord that son of a bitch, do you think we made him mad by leaving in the middle of him talking?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Still with blank eyes, Ludia nodded. Suddenly, she laughed. Looking at her, I also bursted out into laughter.</p><br/><p>Demon Lord 0, Kang Shin 1. I had gotten my first victory over him.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Shin: Demon Lord, I don\u2019t want any information from the likes of you! Stay in Luka continent!</p><br/><p>Ludia: Living together\u2026 I accepted it without much thinking, but we\u2019re living together\u2026!</p><br/><p>Shuna, who just woke up from the 2nd floor of Ludia\u2019s house: Eh\u2026? Why do I feel like everyone forgot about me\u2026? Ludia, hurry up and come back T.T</p><br/><p>If Ludia looked mentally shaken throughout this entire arc, yes, that\u2019s what I was going for. She\u2019s in a light mental illness. I tried hard to convey it properly; this chapter was even harder than the last. Breaking things is easy, but portraying emotion is really hard\u2026 T.T I hope the readers liked it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

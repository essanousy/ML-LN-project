Granting Freedom (7)</p><br/><p>The first thing I thought was, \u2018wow, I\u2019ve eaten tuna before, but this is the first time I was eaten by one.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, now isn\u2019t the time to be making stupid jokes\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was slimy, claustrophobic, and irritating. The pressure of the tuna\u2019s insides was no joke. What was this? Were my clothes melting? Acid!</p><br/><p>\u201cGod!\u201d</p><br/><p>The melting tuna seemed to have dived back under the water after swallowing me, as water began to flow around me. Although things were chaotic, I first grabbed the top and bottom of the slimy walls. However, because it was so slippery, I failed to hold on. As if to quickly send me to its stomach, the surrounding walls wriggled and convulsed around me.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Got it!]</p><br/><p>My elementals loved me so much that they came out the moment I called their names. I was thankful, but it was slightly overwhelming. Ruyue was especially so.</p><br/><p>\u201cSurround me with an Ice Wall! Make it especially hard!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Okay!]</p><br/><p>The moment Ruyue started using Ice Wall, I activated my bracelet and equipped my armor. After wearing the armor, I realized I was almost out of mana. As I struggled to keep my balance, I took out a Mana Potion from my inventory and drank it. This place sucked!</p><br/><p>In any case, I now had some breathing room. Although Ruyue\u2019s Ice Wall began to melt the moment it was created, the space around me was getting bigger. However, the melting tuna\u2019s body suddenly twitched violently. It was to be expected. If someone tried to open up its throat, it was bound to be irritated!</p><br/><p>A flood of water suddenly swept over from one side. It seemed the melting tuna had opened its mouth and was letting water pour inside. It thought I was stuck in its throat, so it was trying to flush me down with water! It was pretty smart, though I might drown because of it.</p><br/><p>I considered using Return and going back to Korea, but I decided to endure. There was a reason I couldn\u2019t give up here.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, you can block it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s hard. Shin, I don\u2019t have much mana.]</p><br/><p>Damn, even though I drank the most expensive Mana Potion, I was still running low? In that case, I\u2019d have to ask Peika\u2026 Huh?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Peika, Peika?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Master, are you okay!?]</p><br/><p>[Peika\u2019s outside. It\u2019s just the two of us in here.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Right, I deactivated Spirit Aura! The melting tuna had swallowed me, almost as if it knew. I quickly unsummoned Peika and resummoned her. Watching the vast amount of water pouring in with despair, I took out the Crimson Gluttony Spear. Ruyue\u2019s Ice Wall was making cracking noises and starting to crumble. Please hold out a little longer!</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, come inside my spear.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Okay, Master!]</p><br/><p>The spear that originally carried fire energy began to flicker with lightning as well. Although I wanted to continue watching the mystical and fascinating sight, I didn\u2019t have the time. The water was flowing in!</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026 Haaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuooooooo!]</p><br/><p>I strongly pierced the floor with my spear. Ignoring the melting tuna\u2019s painful cry, I dug the spear in deeper. Then, with one hand, I pushed the ceiling up, and with the other hand, I made the spear stand vertically. Letting go of the hand holding the ceiling up, I let the ceiling crush down on the top of the spear.</p><br/><p>[Kiaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>The melting tuna let out another bloodcurdling scream as its blood splashed on my armor. Although the heat from my armor evaporated the blood almost instantly, the problem was that the melting tuna\u2019s movements had become more violent. Almost as if it was salsa dancing in the water, the ceiling flipped a few times and trembled. I held on to the spear I had wedged in its throat and hung on desperately.</p><br/><p>[Shin, I can\u2019t hold on anymore!]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Ruyue! You can go back now, I\u2019ll call you back later.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You have to love me lots later!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>During the daytime, I\u2019d only been calling Peika, so it seemed Ruyue was feeling left out. Seeing the usually obedient Ruyue speak out before she left, I couldn\u2019t help but smile. No, now was not the time for that!</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026 Dark Thunder Explosion!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it was a very filial skill that had saved me on multiple occasions, I cringed and flushed from embarrassment whenever I used it. Regardless, the violent shaking stopped from Dark Thunder Explosion\u2019s initial paralysis shock. When the following black lightning attack started, I closed my eyes and focused on holding onto my spear tightly. I knew its body would jolt violently.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>It let out a horrifying scream, almost like a human\u2019s, as it shook in a frenzy. The ceiling flipped again and again. The water finally swept over me, but I closed my mouth and held on.</p><br/><p>[Shin, Shin! Are you alive? Are you okay? Oh, please!]</p><br/><p>Sorry, I\u2019m underwater, so I can\u2019t reply! However, Hwaya seemed to have misunderstood my silence as she raised her voice.</p><br/><p>[Shin! Please, Shin! You said you had a way to survive any situation! I won\u2019t forgive you if you die like this!]</p><br/><p>Dark Thunder Explosion ended. Although I wished it would have killed the melting tuna, it seemed a boss wasn\u2019t so easily killed. Its insides were burnt black, but it was still moving. Huu, how uselessly tough! If it was just one month ago, I would have had no choice but to use Deific Manifestation to let Peruta save me with what little mana I had left, or use Return to go back to Korea.</p><br/><p>However, right now, I still had another skill I could use. In fact, Dark Thunder Explosion had only been to see if this skill would be effective. It was the skill that came with my beloved armor, Crimson Roar! Although it would be annoying to roar underwater, now wasn\u2019t the time to be complaining.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You used Crimson Roar. Everything blazes as flames.]</p><br/><p>Roaring while swallowing a mouthful of water, I suddenly thought, \u2018what was the description of Crimson Roar again? Didn\u2019t it turn all air that my voice could reach into flames? Since I\u2019m underwater, isn\u2019t there little to no air!? Did I have to use Return and go back after all?\u2019 Although I was worrying greatly\u2026</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>My worry was soon proven to be unfounded. Everything within the reach of my voice, including water, turned into scarlet flames and blazed. There was one problem. Because the air I needed to breathe also turned into flames, I could not breathe. Even so, the flames blazed imposingly and with grandeur as if to burn away the entire lake.</p><br/><p>[Kuoooo\u2014!]</p><br/><p>An earth-shaking scream struck my ear. I instinctively knew that it was the melting tuna\u2019s death throes. Its shaking was getting less violent, and the pressure from its flesh was decreasing as well.</p><br/><p>I took my spear out. Scratching the burning walls, I walked forward. Suddenly, I felt as if my body was rising. No, it was the melting tuna\u2019s body that was rising to the surface.</p><br/><p>It had finally died.</p><br/><p>[You swept the Field Dungeon, \u2018Graveyard Over the Lake!\u2019 You defeated over 80% of its monsters, two of the Field Dungeon bosses, and forced one Field Dungeon boss to retreat. The reward will be distributed.]</p><br/><p>[Hwaya Eleni Mastiford-nim\u2019s contribution is the highest.]</p><br/><p>[You successfully swept \u2018Graveyard Over the Lake.\u2019 For the next six months, a new boss monster will not appear on Graveyard Over the Lake. The reproduction rate of normal monsters will decrease significantly during this period.]</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I thought, I wasn\u2019t able to overtake Hwaya in contribution just by killing this guy. After all, she had been hunting monsters here for weeks longer than I had. Even so, I had killed this tuna by myself and I had even chased away that singing woman. Perhaps melting tuna was a weaker boss than the toothsaw. That had to be it.</p><br/><p>[Shin, Shin! You\u2019re not dead!]</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, not. Did you ever see a chef getting eaten by his ingredients?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Thank god, Shin! You don\u2019t know how scared I was thinking you were dead. Because of it, I realized that more than I thought before, I\u2026 Ah!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Huu\u2026 Nothing, forget it. I got too excited from the sudden change in the situation.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, well, I\u2019ll be out in a moment so hurry up and choose your reward. I want to pick mine too.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Heh, yeah. This much doesn\u2019t even count as danger to you, right?]</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not. If I died like this, my father would start another season of thrashing phase.\u201d</p><br/><p>I answered Hwaya casually, unequipping my armor and putting my spear back into my inventory. While I was crawling out of its throat, the reward window popped up in front of me. Since Hwaya and I were the only dungeon explorers here, I was the only one left to choose a reward after Hwaya chose hers.</p><br/><p>[2. Great Tooth Sword]</p><br/><p>\u201cWow\u2026 This looks completely useless\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>I chose the reward with a frown and checked the item description. It was a sword breaker with a spiky saw-like blade, just like the toothsaws\u2019 saw-blade snout. It was even larger than most large swords, and had a strong vibration functionality in its options. If the vibration could be controlled, it could be a powerful weapon. It would have been nice if I was a sword-wielding warrior, but\u2026 Yep, it seemed I would have to feed it to my Gluttony Spear. Although I was looking forward to how much the Gluttony Spear would grow, I also knew it probably wouldn\u2019t grow by much.</p><br/><p>For now, I put the Great Tooth Sword in my inventory. Then, the smell of fresh air tickled my nose. The outside was right in front of my nose!</p><br/><p>I pushed the melting tuna\u2019s huge mouth open, and peeked my head out. Hwaya and everyone else had driven the ship towards the tuna when it had floated up to the surface.</p><br/><p>The first person I looked for was none other than Brightman. From the look on his face, he seemed surprised that I was still alive. I simply looked at him and smiled. As he didn\u2019t expect me to smile, that shameless Brightman frowned like he couldn\u2019t believe it. Then, he smirked. I wondered what his smirk meant. Was he looking down on me? I could feel how nonchalant he was, as if to say that I could not stand up to him in any way. Whether that was true or not, it didn\u2019t matter. What mattered was how I now understood him.</p><br/><p>Although it was a bit embarrassing to say it myself, I had a tendency to be soft toward people I considered my allies. My family was obviously included, and I also cared deeply for those I considered my friends.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t come to dislike those that considered me their friend. Palludia was like that. Even though our first meeting on the 5th floor couldn\u2019t have been worse, while I was still grinding on the 5th floor, she had contacted me to cheer me up, changing the impression I had of her from \u2018strange girl\u2019 to \u2018friend.\u2019 Ye-Eun was also like that. Even though she was a nuisance when I first met her, she continually showed her interest towards me and repeatedly wanted to become friends with me.</p><br/><p>Perhaps for the same reason, those that I considered to be my enemies took on my full hostility. Walker was the biggest example, as he sneaked into Hwaya\u2019s lodging and was almost beaten to death by me. Although Walker was now on my side, it seemed there was a new enemy to replace him.</p><br/><p>Brightman. He had to be laughing right now. Why did he hit me? Did Peika\u2019s lightning wake him up? Was he surprised because he saw me the moment he opened his eyes? Did he not like that Hwaya was so close to me? Was he awake the whole time, but pretended to be unconscious just to put me into danger? Was it revenge for losing his subordinate?</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t care. I wouldn\u2019t listen to his excuses later anyways. There was one thing I was sure of. It was that Brightman\u2019s punch was extremely painful, and that I had almost become a fish food because of him. That was enough.</p><br/><p>You are my enemy. I\u2019ll make you bitterly regret this moment one day. Look forward to it. It won\u2019t take long. In the heights I wish to achieve, you are only a stone in the path.</p><br/><p>I took my eyes off of Brightman and took my body out entirely. Then, I jumped on the melting tuna\u2019s head with a thud. Everyone seemed to have gotten back their sense of reality from the sound. Mike shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy god, T.K.! You were alive!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026 Mike, there\u2019s no way I would die without eating this melting tuna.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really love melting tunas\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. From now on, in honor of me killing this giant melting tuna, you can call me \u2018Tuna King.\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>But really, if you actually call me that, I\u2019ll hate you!</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s Note:</p><br/><p>Just like that, the Tuna King was born. (just kidding)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Absolute Soul (5)</p><br/><p>When we defeated the aerial army and entered another forest to escape the reinforcements pursuit, Daisy let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>She was riding on Iana, the Iron Boar. She had somehow modified it to have a steel body, and it even crackled with lightning as he bulldozed through everything. Rather than an undead, it was a futuristic cyborg.</p><br/><p>She looked incredibly relaxed for someone riding on a vigorously moving boar, as she asked me a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnnoying. The whole world, those bugs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Almost all monsters in this world became like that tens of years ago\u2026. Crown Prince, who is this dazzling beauty!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mesmerized by Daisy\u2019s figure, Ren answered instead, then whispered in my ear with a flushed face. If you want to say something secretly, just message me! Are you doing this on purpose to get Daisy to notice you!?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is Crown Prince so popular with beautiful women!?\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed that was what he really wanted to ask. But wasn\u2019t there a beautiful woman who loved you too!? She\u2019s right next to you! Think about where Tyltyl and Mytyl found their bluebird!</p><br/><p>Ah, now that I think about it, that means that my bluebird is in my house too. I couldn\u2019t help but be shocked at the fact that even the world-famous fairy tale was pointing to Yua being my bluebird of happiness. But that was beside the point. There was something I had to tell Ren.</p><br/><p>\u201cRen, Daisy is my guild member. We aren\u2019t in a man-woman relationship. We\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that, Crown Prince. What kind of idiot would come to a ruined world because she was worried about a friend!? Don\u2019t make excuses!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you calling me an idiot? Didn\u2019t I come to help you? Do you want to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, y-you\u2019re right. I\u2019m not calling Crown Prince an idiot. I\u2019m not doubting our friendship either\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When I formed my aura around my gauntlet and glared at Ren, he waved his hands in denial as he sweated. He was brave when he fought, but I didn\u2019t know why he became so pathetic whenever we talked about something like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince and I are both men, but a pure friendship between a man and a woman is harder to find.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too old-fashioned\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, as I had once thought the relationship I had with Hwaya and Ye-Eun were of pure friendship, I couldn\u2019t deny him directly. Though I believed that pure friendship between members of the opposite sex existed, I couldn\u2019t be bothered to argue with Ren at the moment. As such, I simply smiled bitterly.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Daisy\u2019s boar slowed down and Daisy spoke nonchalantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin promised me. To save my world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeeting Kang Shin, I felt\u2026 strength and hope. I resolved\u2026 to rise, once again. Can\u2019t let him die here. So I came to save him.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was talking about why she came to help! It was more or less what I was expecting. More importantly, look! What a pure and wholesome reason! It felt more genuine than saying we had some deep friendship, as we had not known each other for long. In a way, it made me happy. I stuck my tongue out at Ren, then answered Daisy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Daisy. You saved us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeyond\u2019s 13th floor cleared, then came. That\u2019s why I was late.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t that late. It was the perfect timing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn\u2026 I also obtained a good weapon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy held up a silver chain whip, which didn\u2019t look that different from what she had before, with a satisfied expression. If I remembered correctly, she said it was a unique enchanting method from her continent or perhaps from her race. No matter what weapons she had, she could fuse their functions into a single weapon. It was slightly different than how the Chaotic Spear worked, but it was still an infinitely growing weapon.</p><br/><p>Of course, the weapon she enchanted to her chain whip was the Million Tentacle. I didn\u2019t really want to see what Million Tentacle looked like, and it seemed Daisy had thought the same way, as she immediately used the weapon as material to strengthen the chain whip.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was the reward Crown Prince got? I got the Epic-grade hood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I had the highest contribution, the others couldn\u2019t tell what item I chose. However, as there were two Epic-grade items left after I made my choice, Ren seemed to be extremely curious about the reward I got. On the other hand, Lebuik, who got the Elixirs, didn\u2019t look all that curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be a Legend-grade item? Is it truly the Legend-grade I only heard about it stories?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLegend-grade can\u2019t be that easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not. I\u2019ve never seen one before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLegend\u2026 Very few owners. I only have one.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was probably born with her Evil Eyes, so she was probably talking about something else. I couldn\u2019t help but be curious about her Legend-grade item, but I kept my silence. Then, I told the two of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Legend-grade. Maybe you guys will find out later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, the reward I got was the Mana Absorption Magic Book. The skill was registered the moment I obtained it. With this skill, my plan became flawless. I even thought that meeting the Mana Eater was a blessing. Now, if I just had time to use Skill Synthesis, everything would be perfect.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long do we have left, Ren?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll reach the plains in just 70 kilometers\u2026 If possible, I\u2019d like to rest once before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea. The children must be tired too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The children riding on Ruyue, regardless of whether they were beastman or human, were all dozing off. Beastmen only differed from humans in that they had animal ears and tails. Now that they were sleeping, they were folded down and made them look even cuter. If it wasn\u2019t for Ruyue\u2019s carefulness, they would have fallen off of her a long time ago.</p><br/><p>Daisy looked at the children and spoke apathetically.</p><br/><p>\u201cCooperation is good. Acknowledging other race, also good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaisy\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Let\u2019s hurry. I want to go back quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy turned away. Iana kicked the ground and began to march forward quickly. I looked at her back blankly and forgot to run for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s powerful and truly beautiful\u2026 Crown Prince, I might have fallen in love with her. Miss Silver Wolf is also beautiful, but she lacks the elegance that lady has.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Ren. Take my advice, if you don't people around you will only end up hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Namely, you and Lebuik. Just look for your bluebird already!</p><br/><p>As Ren suggested, we stopped to take a rest before we reached the plain. Perhaps knowing that they\u2019ll reach the plain soon, the children seemed to be feeling anxious. It was understandable, as it wouldn\u2019t end with us just running across the plain to the coast. I had already consulted the others about this matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys, make sure you get some sleep for tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa\u2026 I\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMany people died.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill we die too? What happens when you die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like bugs\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Elfa and the other kids barraged me with questions. I wryly smiled and consoled them until they fell asleep. Ren and Lebuik helped me as well.</p><br/><p>After the children all fell asleep, I put down Elfa, who was leaning against me, and put a blanket over her. Then, I stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cRen, I\u2019ll be off for a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it. Um\u2026 Thank Miss Ectradion for today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><br/><p>As undead monsters never fell asleep, never felt tired, and carried out their master\u2019s commands faithfully, they were practically born for night watch. Daisy\u2019s undead minions were guarding the area around the tent. This didn\u2019t mean that Daisy had to be awake. However, she seemed to have found it cumbersome to stay in the tent with others, as she said she\u2019d stay outside.</p><br/><p>Seeing me leave the tent, Lotte, who was only in a light sleep, woke up and rose.</p><br/><p>\u201cHero, I\u2019ll go too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Lotte. I\u2019ll be back in a bit, so sleep. You did well today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm\u2026 If that\u2019s what Hero says\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I then met eyes with Daisy, who was resting on Iana\u2019s hard back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo do some business.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRen says thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLion beastman?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like men. The feelings they have for me, even more uncomfortable. If they put them into action\u2026 Disgusting.\u201d</p><br/><p>She thoroughly stomped on the seed that barely sprouted. I smiled bitterly as I spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s out of respect for your overwhelming power. In his mind, he might be a bit forward, so forgive him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou respect me, too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot really? I do think you\u2019re a reliable ally that I can trust to protect my back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though she was the one who asked, she nodded her head somewhat apathetically. Then, she looked at me and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it really okay, like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Okay. About battles, you\u2019re genius. I trust you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTomorrow, protect the children.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExistences with potential, I like.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust call them children, really.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy shook her head resolutely and added.</p><br/><p>\u201cChildren aren\u2019t, only ones with potential. Others have potential too, like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for the compliment. For the record, you have it too. Potential.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I know. Now, I like me too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yeah, that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Daisy\u2019s lips curled up in a smile. Caught off guard by her mesmerizing smile, I fell in a daze for a brief moment. I then let out a dry cough and walked off after saying goodbye. Daisy sent me off by weakly waving her hand.</p><br/><p>Monsters were active even deep into the night. In this short period of time, I felt like I crushed at least 30 of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m finally alone\u2026 Skill Synthesis.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ve been using it quite a lot in this world.\u2019 I thought as a circular stone slab was summoned in front of me. I then opened my skill window and took out the skills I needed. In the supplement skill slots, I placed Heavy Armor Mastery, Death Counter, then Mana Absorption.</p><br/><p>In the base skill slot, I placed Soul Guard.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026 That\u2019s it, right? Good. Skill Synthesis!\u201d</p><br/><p>The materials were there, and the circular stone slab began to spin as it shone with a golden radiance. I looked at the slab in a daze, forgetting to even breathe. It didn\u2019t take long. A transparent, dazzling symbol appeared, then jumped into my face as if it couldn\u2019t wait any longer.</p><br/><p>[You obtained the unique skill, \u2018Absolute Soul\u2019!]</p><br/><p>When I read the skill description, my eyes widened. It was even more perfect than what I had imagined! Not only would it affect my future dungeon progress and monster subjugation, but it would also deliver me a sure victory in tomorrow\u2019s battle.</p><br/><p>I smiled. My final night in the Panan continent was passing by quickly.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Eh? You thought I\u2019d tell you!? It\u2019s a secret until the crucial moment! (Bang!)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

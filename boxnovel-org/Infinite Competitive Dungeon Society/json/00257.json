Above the Frozen Land (8)</p><br/><p>New Zealand was a nation 2.5 times bigger than Korea, but Australia was easily over 25 times bigger than New Zealand. Although I didn\u2019t think this huge country would be filled with demons in every corner, I still expected it to have more demons than New Zealand. When I thought about facing them, I couldn\u2019t help but hasten myself.</p><br/><p>After leaving Daisy\u2019s Laki to all aerial battles, we quickly began to recover regions of New Zealand. Unlike monsters that moved with their instincts, demons moved with a purpose and goal. It was to destroy human civilization and annihilate humans. There were practically no surviving humans in New Zealand with not a single building standing unfazed.</p><br/><p>\u201cCruel\u2026 It\u2019s only been two days too\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe I should have come even if I was alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>I began to feel rushed. I wondered if I made the wrong choice. If I knew New Zealand was wiped out, I should have gone to Australia immediately. At least, New Zealand and Australia\u2019s population wasn\u2019t too big\u2026 No, I shouldn\u2019t be thinking this way.</p><br/><p>I put away my useless thoughts. The only thing I should focus on right now was getting to Australia as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cAustralia might be in a better situation. Most of the population live in coastal areas. We won\u2019t need to go deep into the continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI cleared Event Dungeons there, so I know that. But having the population close together means they\u2019re easier targets. Damn it. I hope Guardian and Freedom Wing are doing well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking about how unreliable those two groups were for things like this, I sighed. There were definitely troops deployed to New Zealand, but we couldn\u2019t even catch a glimpse of them yet and we were almost finished. I didn\u2019t want to believe they were wiped out, but\u2026 perhaps the damages they received this time were too severe.</p><br/><p>As I boldly claimed, clearing New Zealand only took us a day. With most of the demons\u2019 army stationed in Australia, we mercilessly bombarded the demons, only mindful of any potential survivors. We tried to melt the frozen land with Laki\u2019s and Hwaya\u2019s power, but there seemed to be no end to it. In the end, we decided to look for another way after eliminating the cause of this situation.</p><br/><p>[You will all bow before Lespina-nim\u2019s power!]</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you bowed before mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>[The difference between me and Lespina-nim is like that of heaven and earth! Don\u2019t think you can reach her level by easily subjugating us!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, goodbye.\u201d</p><br/><p>I severed the demon\u2019s head and sighed. With this, we were done in New Zealand. However\u2026</p><br/><p>No matter how hard we looked, we couldn\u2019t discover any specific details on this demon named Lespina. All we knew was that Lespina was female. When Hwaya found out, she wore a worried expression and looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, she\u2019s a demon! Someone who executed a massacre of this level! If anyone finds out, Revival\u2019s public image will plummet. Got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya, do you think I can seduce any and all women?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya\u2019s conscious-stricken face made me feel strange. I, who was once called an orc, was being treated this way by Hwaya Eleni Mastiford. Though, this was most certainly because of my charm stat.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t let a demon live no matter what.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yeah. Good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I swung my spear and dusted off the demon\u2019s blood before looking up at the sky. The aerial battle was also coming to a close with Laki\u2019s lava swallowing the demons. Every last demon in New Zealand was killed. It was the result of a tough day of work.</p><br/><p>But what did it matter? There were too many irreversible damages. The land was still frozen, the buildings were crumbled, and the people were dead. No matter where I looked, ruin was the only word that popped up in my head. I asked in a murmuring voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many survivors are there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are still about 500,000 alive. New Zealand wasn\u2019t their main goal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Let\u2019s hurry to Australia.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thanks to us drawing attention here, by the time we cleaned up the last remaining demon, Guardian and Freedom Wing could enter New Zealand. We made contact with them and left them to take care of the aftermath before immediately heading to Australia.</p><br/><p>Although there were many small islands, Oceania was mainly comprised of the Australia continent. This Lespina should also be there. The plan was to kill her and prevent future harm. If the demons pointed their sword elsewhere, there wouldn\u2019t be disaster quite like it.</p><br/><p>[Guaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>Laki\u2019s roar rumbled far and wide. It was because of the countless number of demons waiting for us above the coastal seas of Australia.</p><br/><p>[He is this world\u2019s Hero.]</p><br/><p>[One who killed our kin.]</p><br/><p>[Make it so that Lespina-nim doesn\u2019t have to come herself!]</p><br/><p>\u201cLaki, clean.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Guooooooooo!]</p><br/><p>Daisy calmly commanded as she swung her whip. Immediately after Laki\u2019s roar rang out, a large number of flames shot out from Laki\u2019s mouth and attacked the demons. We also sniped down the demons dodging Laki\u2019s flames and dwindled their number. Even so, more and more demons were popping up.</p><br/><p>[Finish it here!]</p><br/><p>[Let us decide the fate of Earth, Hero!]</p><br/><p>Although Laki\u2019s flames were endlessly scorching the demons, with their sheer number, we couldn\u2019t stop them from casting their magic. Among them were special demons who gathered to create a giant magic capable of threatening us. In the end, I jumped down from Laki\u2019s back and got on Lotte\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys charge forward!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take half too, Shin. You take care of the left side!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya and Ina seemed to be thinking the same thing, as they both shot up into the air. I trusted the two of them. I nodded and began to charge forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cUoooooo! Try killing me!\u201d</p><br/><p>[The Hero has come forth!]</p><br/><p>[Focus your magic on him!]</p><br/><p>I roused Absolute Soul\u2019s power to the extreme. Peruta Circuit\u2019s spin created a whirlpool of aura enveloping my body, weapon, and even Lotte. A countless number of elementals and a boundless amount of mana layered the whirlpool as if to protect it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWind King\u2019s Rage!\u201d</p><br/><p>I added wind and lightning on top of it. The demons sent innumerable magic flying towards me. Some of them looked powerful enough to make me depart this world, but I simply grinned and charged into the storm of magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>I clashed with them. When these destructive masses of mana detonated, the mana I absorbed with Absolute Soul overwhelmed the life force I lost.</p><br/><p>\u201cLotte, you can withstand it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m fine! Let\u2019s kill them, Hero!]</p><br/><p>When the demons saw me charging continuously without a pause, they became flustered and lost their formation. Although there were demons that continued to shoot magic towards me, unless they used a mass chant magic, none could pierce through my fierce whirlpool of aura. In fact, the moment they touched it, the mana composing them were absorbed by the whirlpool, only strengthening it.</p><br/><p>[He\u2019s absorbing our magic!?]</p><br/><p>[Could he be our kin?]</p><br/><p>[He\u2019s too quick\u2026 Kuhuk!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pierce right through you all!\u201d</p><br/><p>I shouted vehemently, coursing through the air with Lotte. We were like a giant spear. Looking from the outside at the whirlpool of aura centered around us, we would probably look just like it.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Hwaya and Ina\u2019s magic power raged and disrupted the demons\u2019 magic. This was also a good method, and a much better method if one didn\u2019t plan on directly fighting with his body like me. However, for someone like me who was born stupid\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, you blue monkeys! Where did your spirit from earlier go!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[That guy is crazy!]</p><br/><p>[The magic of the demon race isn\u2019t working!]</p><br/><p>It worked. It was just that I was using their magic power to regenerate myself! Peruta Circuit restored the parts of body destroyed from resisting their magic and energized all bodily functions. Just this wasn\u2019t enough to fill up my lost life force. Although I never learned it from anybody, I came to understand my body\u2019s state, and when I became more skilled in Peruta Circuit, I could do this as easily as breathing!</p><br/><p>\u201cUoooooo!\u201d</p><br/><p>My charge became more and more intense. The whirlpool of aura whirling around me became so big that it was getting harder to manage it. The wind and lightning created from Wind King\u2019s Rage also empowered the whirlpool. Now, average magic was ripped apart the moment they touched this whirlpool. The demons were no exception.</p><br/><p>[Stop his charge.]</p><br/><p>[He\u2019s truly the Hero! Contact Lespina-nim!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll all die before that!\u201d</p><br/><p>The amplification of Wind King\u2019s Rage already reached its peak, but I had no intention of stopping it. I tightly grasped onto the spear enveloped by the extreme energy that I might miss in a moment of carelessness. I fluidly changed my direction in the air and charged towards another group of demons with Lotte. It was at this moment.</p><br/><p>[Stop!]</p><br/><p>My body halted. At the same time, it felt like the energy pivoting around me was shaking. Why? I knew the exact reason. Was it because I became so used to feeling and wielding mana?</p><br/><p>The corner of my mouth curled up into a smile. I urgently gathered the dissipating energy and scattered it in all directions. A thunderous sound rang out.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>[Lespina-nim!]</p><br/><p>[Damn\u2026 Kuaaaa!]</p><br/><p>It was only then that I realized how immense the energy I was wielding was. It felt like a piece of the sky was being ripped apart.</p><br/><p>The seemingly infinite number of demons filling up the sky disintegrated without leaving a trace, and my companions also fell back in shock.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take long until the great explosion of mana subsided. It was because Peruta Circuit\u2019s intense rotation didn\u2019t leave the scattering mana alone and pulled it back in.</p><br/><p>The energy created from the explosion was also sucked in, gathering in a single point, the tip of the spear I held out. With that, I regained a clear vision of the surrounding.</p><br/><p>I was facing a demon. She was beautiful just like the power she held in her body.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d meet you so soon. I thought you would be waiting for me deep inside Australia.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I can\u2019t let you freely decimate His Highness Demon Lord\u2019s army any further. I planned on taking care of you lot when you were still in that tiny island country, but\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cThey were all too weak. I\u2019m not done yet though.\u201d</p><br/><p>I grinned. I compressed the mana gathered at my spear tip even smaller. The long-haired female demon gritted her teeth. She was also capable of wielding massive energy equaling me. I could tell just by looking at the longsword in her hand.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, I could tell from the ability she used before that it was fatal to me, who had gotten my power from the dungeon. Since I was hit with it once, I could tell what kind of an effect it had, but I couldn\u2019t quite understand the mechanism behind it. Could she use her ability without knowing the principles behind it just like how I used the skills I had?</p><br/><p>[Arrogant human\u2026 Someone who only relies on power that does not belong to you!]</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, Lespina. I\u2019ll let you know whether this power belongs to me or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the start of a boss fight.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

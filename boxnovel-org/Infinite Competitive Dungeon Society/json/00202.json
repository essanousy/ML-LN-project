Second Season (5)</p><br/><p>With Loretta reluctant to let go of me, I had to buy highest-grade Health Potions, Mana Potions, and some bolts with high-grade magic imbued in them. After that, I headed to the guild house. Of course, getting Loretta off was quite a work.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be the lady of the house eventually anyway!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you get tired? Even if you come, you\u2019ll only see two sweaty men fighting each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to go even more now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEit, go away!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I finally arrived at Marianne\u2019s Garden, the garden, which had now become spacious with the old residents Flame Drake (aka Pookie) and Giant Iron Boar (aka Iana) moving out, had Hwaya sitting under a parasol and reading. It was a rather strange scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Shin. Welcome back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya? Why are you out in the garden? You\u2019re not doing anything either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIna\u2019s going to come soon. She\u2019s hunting the 45th Floor Master right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh. Um\u2026 Sorry. I have to train with Ren for a while, so I\u2019ll have to shamelessly leave you to take care of Ina.\u201d</p><br/><p>At my apology, Hwaya smiled lightly and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m calculating each and everything anyways. I\u2019m thinking about the reward I\u2019ll get out of you with all the points I accumulated. A hug, kiss, dinner, date, and\u2026 Huhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu? What is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhaha, I\u2019m kidding. Well, half-kidding. For the record, I have 2.7 Huhus saved up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have no plans to hide your indecent desires, do you!?\u201d</p><br/><p>At my question, Hwaya narrowed her eyes and smiled. Then, she tapped the seat next to her and gestured me to come over.</p><br/><p>\u201cStay for a while. Leave that lionhead alone. We can spend some quality family time with Ina. How about it, Ina\u2019s Daddy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally\u2026 That\u2019s an enticing offer, but I\u2019ll have to pass for today. It\u2019s an important time for Ren\u2026 I have to teach him how to wield the world\u2019s power too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, you\u2019re feeling responsible for making him a Hero. Ah, I want to take your place as Earth\u2019s Hero. That way, I might get stronger than you and you\u2019ll try your best to protect me too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, this power is mine. I won\u2019t give it to anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I retorted curtly, Hwaya\u2019s smile got bigger.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was kidding, Guild Master. I\u2019ll be the one to protect you. Although it would be nice to be in the Hero\u2019s position, I don\u2019t really want to be a princess to be protected.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like just being protected either. Oh, that reminds me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When the guild advanced to rank B, there was a function it gained. It was being able to appoint a vice-guild master given that the guild had more than 10 members. A vice-guild master could officially complete guild-related business like accepting new guild members or kicking out existing guild members. Vice-guild masters of the First Dungeon\u2019s powerful guilds all held great authorities. Though, I couldn\u2019t say whether Revival would also be like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya, if it\u2019s okay with you\u2026 can you be our guild\u2019s vice-guild master? You\u2019ve done a lot until now, and you\u2019re really the only one I can think of who can fill that position. You have the ability and sense of responsibility, and you\u2019re even close with everyone in the guild. How about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that a proposal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not. Good try though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya pouted. Though she was older than me, she was really quite cute. When I patted her head, she spoke with a softened expression.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Okay. To be honest, I also think I\u2019m the only one who can be a vice-guild master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat. Although something like this should be done through votes, I\u2019m going to ignore all that and use my authority as the guild master to appoint you the vice-guild master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, charming.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hwaya Eleni Mastiford became guild Revival\u2019s vice-master!]</p><br/><p>After confirming that Hwaya became the vice-guild master through the message, I took my hand off her head and extended it toward her.</p><br/><p>\u201cContinue with your excellent work, Vice-guild Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt your service, Guild Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like that, Revival\u2019s vice-guild master was chosen.</p><br/><p>[Guild Revival: Guild Rank B]</p><br/><p>[Guild member: Kang Shin (Guild Master, First \u2013 Gold), Hwaya Eleni Mastiford (Vice-guild Master, Second \u2013 Gold), Daisy Ectradion (First \u2013 Platinum), Lebuik Vandeon Granaris, Kang Yungoong, Su Ye-Eun, Ren Verotude Goldlion, Palludia Gren Ehuir, Shuna Aren Lihita (First \u2013 Gold), Illina Alexandrovna Mikhalova, Kang Yua (First \u2013 Silver), Minami Violet Sumire (Second \u2013 Gold), Edward Walker (Second \u2013 Silver), Sophie Brightman (Third \u2013 Gold). Total: 14]</p><br/><p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying goodbye around the time Ina arrived, I went into the mansion and opened the guild status window. In truth, I was rather surprised. Ludia and Shuna had become Gold rank explorers before I noticed, and with Daisy breaking through Beyond\u2019s 13th floor and entering the First Dungeon\u2019s 81st floor, I naturally learned when Daisy first entered Beyond.</p><br/><p>Hwaya would reach Platinum rank soon to advance to the First Dungeon, and considering the talent Sumire showed in our spars, she would probably follow suit. As for Walker, he\u2019d advanced to the Second Dungeon without telling me anything about it. It seemed Xin Shaomei\u2019s ability was helping him greatly. That said, after he reached the Platinum rank in the Third Dungeon, he went down to the Second Dungeon\u2019s Silver rank instead of Gold rank. I pitied him slightly. It seemed he was either lacking in achievements or some other conditions.</p><br/><p>As for Ina, there wasn\u2019t much to say about her. Even before she became an explorer, she was almost as strong as Hwaya and me. The dungeon was merely a playground for her, as she could use her magic power as much as she wanted. She cleared the 45th floor today and would soon become Gold rank. Only then would her speed slow down slightly. Perhaps, she might even enter Beyond.</p><br/><p>The one I was really worried about was my sister, Yua, and the young lady of nobility in charge of a conglomerate, Sophie. Although they were both elites who weren\u2019t lacking in qualities deemed desirable in society, their constitutions were both far from physical activities.</p><br/><p>However, it seemed my worrying was for naught. The two SS rank abilities I took from Luca Bruno and Joshua Brightman found their respective owners, and they were shining more and more as the girls climbed the dungeon.</p><br/><p>Yua had tamed all 278 mantis larvae, and she was now learning the dungeon\u2019s system step-by-step as she learned and raised new skills. She probably wouldn\u2019t need more tamed beasts. After all, fully grown mantises could even fly. Although ordinary mantises couldn\u2019t fly for long, the ones she tamed came from the Evil Mantis Queen. Their genes were undoubtedly superior to the ordinary mantises\u2019. With Yua\u2019s ability supporting them\u2026 I stopped thinking about it as I started getting goosebumps on my arms.</p><br/><p>As for Sophie, who was the second most passionate woman after Hwaya, she was surprisingly in the guild house at the moment. With her brilliant blonde hair tied up in a ponytail and wearing a tank top and hot pants, she was sparring with Ye-Eun in the underground training room. As Ye-Eun was also wearing casual clothes, they looked quite nice together.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, coming from the back again!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, both sides!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Ye-Eun was right in front of Sophie\u2019s eyes, Ye-Eun\u2019s dagger flew toward Sophie from behind her. Sophie quickly spun around and blocked it with just two fingers, but surprisingly, it was a clone. Ye-Eun was still in front of Sophie, and in an instant, Ye-Eun\u2019s elbow struck Sophie down.</p><br/><p>\u201cA clone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just added mana into my shadow and gave it mass. Master said it was one of the most simple techniques!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, your Master is strange. Realize it already.\u201d</p><br/><p>While I pointed out Ye-Eun\u2019s faulty statement, Sophie got up as she groaned. The spar must have been quite intense as a Gold rank explorer such as herself was dripping with sweat.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu, huu\u2026 So strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, of course. I\u2019ll become a Beyond explorer after all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, when I become Platinum ranked, I\u2019ll advance to the Second Dungeon\u2019s Gold rank, and when I become Platinum there, I can become the First Dungeon\u2019s Gold rank explorer!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that she mentioned it, it was rather scary how fast she advanced. Since she was on the Third Dungeon\u2019s 75th floor while ravaging through all Floor Masters alone, she would undoubtedly advance to the Second Dungeon within the next month.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou might even catch up to Walker at this rate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m only trying so hard so I can be with Edward.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I see. Well, good luck, Miss Sophie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEdward is advancing quickly too. By the time I advance to the Second Dungeon, he\u2019ll be Gold ranked. Don\u2019t underestimate his desire to improve!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s just working hard so he doesn\u2019t have to be with\u2026 Er, nothing, nevermind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mm, her spirit was already stronger than Joshua Brightman\u2019s. Sophie getting his ability was definitely good for Earth!</p><br/><p>\u201cSo why are you with Ye-Eun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer fighting style is the most similar to Walker\u2019s out of everyone in the guild. I\u2019m trying to learn how to work with Walker by sparring her. I have a lot to learn from her, really.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right, as Ye-Eun specialized in sure-kill attacks, Sophie probably had a lot to learn by sparring with her. For example, protecting vital areas, feeling killing intent and dodging and the like. Though, I couldn\u2019t really say out loud with Ye-Eun making such a happy-go-lucky face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is Shin here? To spar with Ren-ssi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that reminds me. I wanted to ask when I first saw him. His ears\u2026 are they real?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s a beastman. Other continents have all sorts of different races. Ren, say hel\u2026 Huu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sophie\u2019s words reminded me to properly introduce them to each other. When I looked back, however, I saw Ren who was fidgeting in front of two girls he\u2019d never talked to before. He really was completely stiff. I slapped his back to bring his consciousness back.</p><br/><p>\u201cRen, snap out of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Crown Prince. They\u2019re both too beautiful, I can\u2019t look at them! Plus, t-their clothes are too revealing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Ren. Unlike you, they don\u2019t really mind it that much. Try to man up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bit hurtful, but regardless, it\u2019s too much for me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Really, not even teenagers would be like him. I sighed. Then, a question suddenly popped into my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t Lebuik just as beautiful as the two of them? Isn\u2019t Ren really casual around Lebuik? Why is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-That\u2019s because I\u2019ve known Lebuik ever since I was little\u2026 She\u2019s not someone I can see as a woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>Did he just drop the bomb\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, Lebuik is also very beautiful. Her popularity among the knights was through the roof, and there were endless streams of proposals flowing in from every country in Panan. She had elegance and beauty, and she even had a kind personality. When I was young, I looked up to her too. However, that\u2019s it. Lebuik is my Master and someone akin to my mother. I don\u2019t see her as a woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>If Lebuik heard about this, it wasn\u2019t going to end pretty! Though I found it quite funny, when I imagined how dejected Lebuik would be when she found out, a sigh naturally came out. Sophie\u2019s and Ye-Eun\u2019s expressions also became rigid as they instantly realized the circumstance.</p><br/><p>\u201cL-Lebuik is the cat-eared unni, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t see her as a woman? Then he has to be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoa, hold it there. You can\u2019t impose your beliefs on others. Let me deal with this.\u201d</p><br/><p>When I cut them off, they widened their eyes and looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t impose our beliefs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to do, friend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, I can\u2019t impose anything on him, but I can help him change his mind. Usually, by beating him up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that the same thing!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I just had to make him miss Lebuik. I just had to beat him up until he wanted to cry in Lebuik\u2019s embrace! I looked back at Ren and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, we\u2019re done with the introductions. Let\u2019s start, Ren.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cC-Crown Prince, aren\u2019t you more spirited than before? Did I do something wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, nothing at all. Ren isn\u2019t wrong. Once the thrashing phase is over, everyone will be happier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething did go wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun and Sophie, who were done with their sparring for the day, sat down nearby. It seemed the phrase, \u2018thrashing phase,\u2019 had interested them. Realizing this, Ren\u2019s ears perked up and sweat began to appear on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, hahaha. Really, Crown Prince. Are you trying to beat me like a dog in front of these beautiful ladies?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRen, how can you say that? I\u2019m not beating you like a dog. I\u2019m just thrashing you for your own sake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the same thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow now, let\u2019s begin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUwuuuuuuuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>For the next 30 minutes, Ren and I both squeezed out our power as Heroes and clashed. While Ren wore a full set of armor and equipped himself with a wooden sword, I only had a wooden spear without any armor. Though it looked like I was lacking in terms of defense, as my armor was in its bracelet form and my spear in its choker form, although I wasn\u2019t affected by their attack and defense, I was still affected by their additional effects.</p><br/><p>My stats were already miles ahead of Ren. With the additional effects from my items added on top of my superior martial arts, there was no way for Ren to defeat me. Not even if he was Hero!</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince is too strong! Too strong I tell you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou only just found out? Don\u2019t think about running away, come at me! Come on, hurry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk\u2026 Kuaaaang!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHaving a wild nature isn\u2019t bad, but we\u2019re doing this because you can\u2019t control yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuak!\u201d</p><br/><p>I mercilessly smacked Ren\u2019s back with the wooden spear. Immediately afterward, I smacked him three more times.</p><br/><p>\u201cKu\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to sleep? Counterattack!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven without Crown Prince saying that I was about to do it! Kuak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Ren\u2019s pitiful cries, Sophie and Ye-Eun, who were still watching from the side, added.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, he really just beat him up for 30 minutes straight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin is so cool!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Priiiince!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have more strength in your sword, but you\u2019re still wide open! Didn\u2019t you learn anything from Lebuik!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>30 minutes wasn\u2019t enough to expend Ren\u2019s stamina. We were both vastly different than when we met on the 20th floor. As such, I beat him up for 2 hours more. My goal was to help Ren hone his bestial instincts while maintaining his sanity. If he could respond rationally even while in his wild mode, Ren could be a powerful warrior.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaang, kak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust because you open your mouth while you run, the enemy won\u2019t let you bite him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, he was still far from that point.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Ren, you can do it! Just endure the beating for now!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

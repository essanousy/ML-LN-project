Kahar (2)</p><br/><p>\u201cLin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know what you want to say, but that\u2019s a misunderstanding.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin threw the remaining bracelet at me and took out a cigarette. Even though he didn\u2019t do anything, his cigarette lit up. Without being surprised, I received Daisy\u2019s bracelet and also appraised it. Just like mine, it was full of question marks.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose are masterpieces I created with all my strength. There won\u2019t be anything like them ever again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin puffed a smoke as he stared at me. I shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. After all, Lin\u2019s been working on them for two months. But why can\u2019t I see their information?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? It\u2019s because the Lord can\u2019t see through them.\u201d</p><br/><p>It felt like someone smacked me on the head. Lin was smirking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Dungeon Lord isn\u2019t omnipotent or omniscient. She can measure rewards she gives out, but these are equipment I made with my own power. If the Lord could read them so easily, my pride would be hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t give your all for the equipment you made for me so far?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on\u2026 I just didn\u2019t have enough time. I could only do it this time because I was stuck here for my punishment. Also\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He continued after a bit of hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cItems don\u2019t become unknown just by having good effects. Those bracelets might surpass the Legend grade, but if you ask whether they\u2019re on the level of Divine grade\u2026 Then I can only shake my head.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo like Enigma, yet not absolute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><br/><p>I grinned. It seemed these items were similar to Enigma, the mana I could wield when I used Overlord. Objects that surpassed the dungeon\u2019s influence. They were objects created to resist the worlds\u2019 enemies.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo? What do they do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Draconian\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, quantifying and qualifying an object\u2019s ability isn\u2019t easy! How am I supposed to see through something that even the Lord can\u2019t? Huu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin dodged my gaze and puffed another smoke. I would have pulled his hair out if I could. Did Lin feel my bloodlust? Or did he feel sorry to not say anything? Regardless, he let out a dry cough and gave an explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the very least, they aren\u2019t cursed. Yours even has dragon\u2019s blessing. The experience I gained from fighting the Book Walkers was used to make it. If you fight them again, as long as that bracelet is protecting you, they won\u2019t be able to write about you. Not even a world\u2019s enemy can nullify that bracelet, so it\u2019ll work against anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>I decided to trust Lin\u2019s words. After all, Lin, the great blacksmith, took two months to work on them.</p><br/><p>I put the bracelet on my left wrist as Pure Black Desire was already on my right wrist. Immediately after I put it on, I felt my senses change.</p><br/><p>How do I explain this? It was almost like my senses got sharper. Right, it was as my sensory organs doubled. Eyes, nose, mouth, ears. The four organs perceiving outside information all became heightened. To be honest, I experienced this feeling whenever my levels and stats rose, but it was just too extreme this time. For a moment, I felt so dizzy that I had to stop to catch my breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, looks like it\u2019s working. I haven\u2019t tried them because you can\u2019t take them off once you wear them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 like you said.\u201d</p><br/><p>I raised my left arm. The bracelet shrunk to fit my wrist and gripped my arm like it was a part of it. Although it shouldn\u2019t be stuck, it really didn\u2019t budge. After a while, I finally got used to the change, but a new twisting pain struck my insides.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI imitated the way Lord raised your league. Don\u2019t glare at me like that. I didn\u2019t know how to do it, so I had to use a little bit of draconic power. A lot, actually\u2026 I scraped a dragon\u2019s body clean, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin flicked his cigarette and fell in thought. Then, he snapped his fingers.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s elevating your body to be similar to a dragon\u2019s. If your achievements and league aren\u2019t enough, you\u2019ll die from having your body twisted, but you have more than enough qualification.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this isn\u2019t giving me another ability, but rather\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight! Excluding everything you got from the dungeon, purely based on the achievements you\u2019ve made, it\u2019s using draconic power to adjust your ability to fit the true league you should have. That\u2019s why it\u2019s lacking compared to levels or stats. Mm, now that I think about it, it\u2019s completely different from the method Lord uses. After all, Lord directly bestowed you with league. She\u2019s really something else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026! Did you know about this, Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I did. That\u2019s why I made you an equipment like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, I finally overcame the extreme pain and stood up. Just like how my external organs were improved, I could feel that my internal organs improved. The flow of blood sped up, my bones got tougher, and my heart and other organs became reinforced.</p><br/><p>When I clenched my fists, Lin added a small remark.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one will be able to take that away from you. It won\u2019t be as useful as the boundless stats you possess, but it\u2019ll still be useful. After all, it\u2019s purely your power now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin!\u201d</p><br/><p>I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way you can make something like this with just a dragon\u2019s body. You threw away your own power, didn\u2019t you!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot too much. The one for that girl only has a fraction of what I put in yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why would you go so far?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen someone with the talent to accept a dragon\u2019s power. I was curious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I wanted to give them a good punch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin spoke quietly. I shut my mouth and stared at him. Now that my body was reforged with draconic power, I could finally see that he had gotten weaker than before. If I used Overlord, I was certain my attacks would reach him. Not too much? How was this \u2018not too much\u2019?</p><br/><p>Lin raised his slender arms that looked incapable of even lifting up his guns. Feeling like his arms were chained up, my breathing stopped for a moment. I didn\u2019t know if Lin knew how I felt, but he spoke with a rigid voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou do it in my place. Give them a good punch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI felt something from the Sipua incident. Countless bastards are countlessly screwing with countless worlds, and I\u2019ll continue to get tangled with them. How would you feel if you were me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike a piece of shit, I guess?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. Who wants to live a piece of shit life? Unfortunately, I can\u2019t leave this place. The only choice I have is to leave everything to someone I can trust.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know how to respond. Should I thank him for trusting in me? Lin grinned at my speechless self and added.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou got it now? Before you kill them, shout, \u2018This is for Lin!\u2019 I\u2019ll ask that grey haired girl if you did or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHu, got it. Leave it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since I already received it, there was no way to give it back. I answered with a smile and put away Daisy\u2019s bracelet into safety. I wanted to ask her to come with me, so I could give it to her then.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Lin, one of my friends is an ability user that uses guns.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Like me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin took out another cigarette and bit down on it. As he asked with a uncertain voice, I immediately nodded. Then, he smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cInteresting. Bring him to me later. I\u2019ll check him out myself. Be thankful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d say that. It won\u2019t take too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>For someone who always complained, he never let me down. Tsundere, how cute! I waved my hand in thanks and turned around. Leon, you better thank me!</p><br/><p>\u201cDaisy, where are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Beyond\u2019s 16th floor. Just came in, today.]</p><br/><p>I cursed inwardly. Although Daisy was an excellent warrior, she still couldn\u2019t conquer a Beyond floor in a day or two. I couldn\u2019t receive her help this time.</p><br/><p>When I didn\u2019t say anything, Daisy asked.</p><br/><p>[Do you need my help?]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll, die now. So, wait.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, really! Don\u2019t die on purpose, please.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Tsundere?]</p><br/><p>For a moment, she made me lost for words, but I quickly regained my composure and retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Who even taught you that word?\u201d</p><br/><p>[But Kang Shin needs, my help.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 Well, I do, but I\u2019ll be fine by myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I knew it. Tsundere.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Wait 10 minutes.]</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Not being able to enter the dungeon for a month is too damaging right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Tsk.]</p><br/><p>Daisy seemed to understand. Even as she clicked her tongue unhappily, she stopped saying she\u2019d purposely die.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going on a Dimensional Mercenary mission. Lin gave me the reward he made for you, so I\u2019ll give it to you when I get back.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un.]</p><br/><p>She answered quietly, then asked a question.</p><br/><p>[Where are you going?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t follow me, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll rush Beyond and go.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just accept your thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Tsk.]</p><br/><p>After talking with her, I opened the guild communication channel and told them I\u2019d come back after a Dimensional Mercenary mission. Hwaya was upset, but she knew she had to stay by Ciara\u2019s side right now.</p><br/><p>Since I was done with all the business I had to take care of, it was now time to go find Eleine again. Before that, however, I contacted Ellos. Since the Hero of his world went missing, I wanted to check up on his safety. Thankfully, he replied as soon as he received my message.</p><br/><p>[Shin!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Ellos, it\u2019s great that you picked up.\u201d</p><br/><p>[If you contacted me, does that mean\u2026?]</p><br/><p>\u201cEarth is pretty calm right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos breathed a sigh of relief. His voice was extremely heavy.</p><br/><p>[Huu\u2026 I\u2019ve been waiting for you. Something troublesome happened to my continent, so I\u2019ve been wanting to get your help.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I heard from others too. I\u2019ll be there soon, so wait for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, I headed back to the pavilion. Loretta was choke-holding Eleine.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgyagyagyagyak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still at it!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been at it since you left. Do you want some popcorn?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lotang, the Dwarf, shoved a bowl full of popcorn towards me. I grabbed a handful and shoved it in my mouth. Then, I plopped down next to him. The rest of Fairy Garden\u2019s members were munching on popcorn and enjoying the scene. These guys were all evil.</p><br/><p>After Eleine\u2019s face mysterious turned white, then red, then white, then red, Loretta seemed to have gotten tired of strangling her as she changed to a crossface hold. Eleine\u2019s tone was about to break the Guinness world record. She was tapping on the ground furiously, but unfortunately, there didn\u2019t seem to be a tap-out rule in Fairy Garden\u2019s rulebook.</p><br/><p>\u201cKkkuk, if, you\u2019re, here, stop, her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Shin-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps because she was seen last time, Loretta got up leisurely. Eleine fainted with bubbles foaming from her mouth, but no one paid her any attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were just discussing our friendship between women. I put in good words for Shin-nim, so she won\u2019t try to flirt with you again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood words\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>If what I saw were \u2018good words\u2019, Loretta\u2019s \u2018lecturing\u2019 just might kill. With that in my mind, I asked Loretta.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not talk too much from now, Loretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO, Oh. Then\u2026 U, Uhehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta interpreted my words as she liked and fell into her own imaginary world. I guess that\u2019s another talent of hers\u2026</p><br/><p>I waited for Eleine to recover. When she did, I received a piece of paper from her. Loretta was still in her imaginary world, smiling creepily.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the request form? It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen one in paper.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll work as a road sign. A part of the Hero\u2019s item is engraved in it, so it\u2019ll tell you where the Hero is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, there\u2019s a total of twenty five people including you. They should all be gathered where you\u2019re heading. There\u2019s just one goal, saving the Hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eleine spoke with dignity as she fixed her ruined dress. Of course, there was no dignity to be felt.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be extremely dangerous. You might even encounter a world\u2019s enemy. I\u2019ll ask one more time. Will you really go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>She spread her arms out to hug me, then lowered them with a noticeably flinch.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood luck! I\u2019ll pray for your victory!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like that, I headed to the Edias continent with Licorice and Lotte. Ah, with Loretta\u2019s blessing too, of course.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I couldn\u2019t help but doubt my ears. Evolve? Into what? What\u2019s a higher species of Dark Wings!? Licorice, who was in my arms, expressed her shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cEvolution\u2026 It\u2019s because she contracted Dear Husband. She received a portion of the dungeon\u2019s power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA portion of the dungeon\u2019s power?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way something like that is natural. Because she's gained worthy achievements, she received the dungeon\u2019s blessing through Dear Husband. Though, I never would have thought a mere wyvern could have gained enough achievements to cause an evolution\u2026 Just what was she?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe used to the boss of a region. Rather than that\u2026 let\u2019s go see Lotte.\u201d</p><br/><p>With Licorice fretting about not wanting to let go, I gave up on getting her off me. When I was about to approach her, Lotte who had bathed in the falling lava suddenly shone and was encased in a red light. Even I could feel the intense heat emanating from her.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, what happened!? Did you defeat that\u2026 Hup.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya, who quickly flew towards me, saw Licorice in my embrace and narrowed her brows before closing her mouth. Hwaya was indeed quick to understand the situation. I was truly thankful. I expressed my thanks with my eyes and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cLotte\u2019s evolving.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEvolving!?\u201d</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take long before the shining light subsided. However, at the same time the light enveloping Lotte subsided, Lotte also seemed to be shrinking in size. Lotte, who had been gotten a lot bigger since our first meeting, was now doing the opposite.</p><br/><p>Eventually, Lotte shrunk to about 4 meters. The light then flowed into Lotte\u2019s body and she made her appearance. Although she was still black, there were red lines trimming the edges of her wings. She seemed to have gotten swifter, and her eyes were a deep red color. Her evolution indeed seemed to be related to lava!</p><br/><p>[Dark Wings are a rare species of wyverns capable of controlling cursed flames. They are well acknowledged for their swift wing beats and powerful flames, but in truth, they are simply the fallen results of a powerful species of ancient dragon being cursed.]</p><br/><p>[Dark Wings that transcend their limits are said to be able to return to their original form, but not only are there very few Dark Wings, even their fallen forms are so powerful that it is hard for them to reach their limit. Dark Wing Lotte will become the first Dark Wing to regain her original form!]</p><br/><p>[Dark Wing Lotte evolves into Blaze Queen!]</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know how the dungeon helped her, but her evolution was closer to a return. Lotte, who easily shattered everyone\u2019s imagination, approached and spoke.</p><br/><p>[Hero, have you seen my transformation!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I did. Your energy seems to have doubled.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just by getting close to Lotte, I could feel an intense heat. It seemed her energy became compressed as she got smaller. Lotte flapped her wings excitedly. Winds carrying flames blew and stirred the surroundings.</p><br/><p>[Huhu, so this is my true form. Reclaiming my true form in exchange for betraying other monsters and choosing the life as a human\u2019s servant, truly strange! Huhahaha!]</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you even know what you\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hero, it seems you truly are my blessing!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m happy that you\u2019re happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though it was a bit difficult as I was holding Licorice in one arm, I pat Lotte who approached me with the other hand and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to hold a congratulatory party, but you should know our current situation. Wait just a little bit more.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I can wait however much you want, my Hero!]</p><br/><p>Lotte replied spiritedly and pushed her back towards me. Before I got on her, I pat Licorice who was still in my embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cLicorice, you used up your mana, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. Sorry, Dear Husband. I knew we still have to face the king, but I couldn\u2019t control myself\u2026 It won\u2019t recover for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it couldn\u2019t be helped. It\u2019s fine. You can go back to the mansion and rest. We\u2019ll deal with the Lava King.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I trust you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Licorice replied silently and gave me a kiss on the cheek (Hwaya\u2019s brows twitched). Then, she returned to the dungeon before I got on Lotte\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, now it\u2019s time to\u2026 Mm.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the Lava Heart died, I thought that everything he owned would turn into lava and disappear, but surprisingly, his giant spear was still there stuck to the ground. Imbued with the Lava Heart\u2019s remaining mana, it had been maintaining its weapon form!</p><br/><p>\u201cEit.\u201d</p><br/><p>I lightly hurled the Chaotic Spear. The moment it hit the giant spear, it shone and was absorbed into the Chaotic Spear.</p><br/><p>[Crimson Chaotic Spear absorbed the Lava Giant Spear. Growth: 77%]</p><br/><p>\u201cHuk, so much!\u201d</p><br/><p>Previously, the growth wasn\u2019t even at 70%. Even after eating all those Event Dungeon weapons and Floor Master weapons, it hadn\u2019t grown by even 23%, but this time it had grown by almost 10%. Although I didn\u2019t know how I was going to fill the remaining 23%, I believed it was possible to evolve it to the next level before the two year mark.</p><br/><p>\u201cS-Should I have checked its item description? No, it would have been eaten by the Chaotic Spear regardless\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Chaotic Spear spun through the air and returned to my hand. I then faced Hwaya who had been standing with her mouth open and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are the two that got hurt? Are they okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks to Ludia\u2019s quick healing and the Elixirs\u2026 they\u2019re fine, though they lost some of their equipment... It was Walker and Sumire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can see how they got hit by the lava.\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker most likely got hurt trying to protect Sophie, and it was probably the same for Sumire except with other guild members. As I could imagine how painful it must have been for them, I grit. my teeth and turned to face where they were. It was best to take care of everything as quickly as possible!</p><br/><p>The number of Destroyers and Sweepers was only half of what it was when they first appeared. Beyond them, a new wave was beginning to appear. They were most likely the last wave of soldiers, as although there weren\u2019t many, each and every one of them seemed powerful.</p><br/><p>I aimed my spear towards them and quietly spoke to Hwaya.</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya, you protect the others.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m more worried about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, really.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>In all honesty, having used Sacrifice for that last attack, my health was quite low. I gulped down a potion and threw the leftover bottle on the ground, breaking it. It was a signal of sort.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be going ahead!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, be careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><br/><p>Having evolved into a Blaze Queen, Lotte\u2019s speed far surpassed my imaginations. Even when she was a Dark Wing, she displayed a shocking speed with that large body. Now, it almost seems like she was traveling at the speed of light.</p><br/><p>[Hero, ready your spear!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m ready!\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied energetically and ushered Mad Typhoon\u2019s power up. The enemies I now faced were Lava Knights who were seemingly shrunken versions of the Lava Heart. Since I was able to defeat the Lava Heart, there was no reason for me to be afraid!</p><br/><p>\u201cFight me, you goddamned bastards! Open the path towards your king!\u201d</p><br/><p>My roar thundered throughout the volcanic region. Seemingly having understood my words, the Lava Knights held up their weapons and charged towards me. Almost as if she was waiting for this moment, Lotte raised her voice and laughed.</p><br/><p>[I shall allow you to feel the dignity of this Blaze Queen!]</p><br/><p>Her body shone in a brilliant light like when I used Divine Speed. Without giving me a chance to do anything, she charged towards the Lava Knights, shattering their bodies upon contact. Although their bodies erupted into lava the moment they died, Lotte seemed unhurt.</p><br/><p>[Hero, my body has gotten stronger against flames. Don\u2019t worry about me and fight them freely!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice to hear!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a growth worthy of the word \u2018evolution.\u2019 I grinned and pointed my spear crackling with lightning towards the Lava Knights.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome at me! I\u2019ll destroy you all!\u201d</p><br/><p>After some time had passed, when I looked back after hearing the death throes of a Lava Knight, only Revival\u2019s members were remaining on the battlefield. The numerous Destroyers, Sweepers, and Lava Knights were nowhere to be seen. The battlefield, which had been filled with noisy cries and erupting lava, was now dominated by an odd silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it\u2026 over?\u201d</p><br/><p>I murmured, unable to believe it myself. The other members also looked around them as they dripped with blood and sweat.</p><br/><p>[Indeed it is, Hero. There is only one remaining presence in this area.]</p><br/><p>Lotte retorted in a calm manner. It was clear who the one remaining presence she was referring to was. It could only be the Lava King.</p><br/><p>\u201cVolcano\u2026 Large energy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy approached me, seemingly looking extremely tired. Although she always maintained a neat appearance when wearing her uniform, her clothes now were messy and she was also full of sweat. It felt like this was the first time I saw Daisy sweat.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy undead, many gone. Lava King, give me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Do you think you can control him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably? Giving up control of all other undead, possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor times like today, ultimate weapon needed.\u201d</p><br/><p>At her words, I hesitated. She was right. Although her undead monsters were strong, it was sometimes better to have one with absolute strength. That said, Daisy was truly amazing. Even though we had not won yet, she was already thinking about obtaining an undead.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to my answer, Daisy smiled. I then gathered the other members together. Their poor states couldn\u2019t be described with words. It seemed Walker and Sumire, who had lost their equipment, had even more difficulty as they fought with low tier equipment.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the succubi battle units also had additional casualties. I was glad that this damned lava army was taken care of, but I could only sigh at the succubi\u2019s death.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally\u2026 Thanks, everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did well too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe won somehow. I thought we were going to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m exhausted.\u201d</p><br/><p>While everyone threw in their comments, Ina jumped into my embrace silently. She was probably the one who did the most work today. She must have killed far more soldiers than me, and must have used far more mana as well. Feeling like I had made Ina suffer needlessly, I hugged her and pat her back.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Ina. You did well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuung, I\u2019m not done. I\u2019ll fight with Daddy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy lack of ability is making my Ina suffer\u2026 Sorry, I still need Ina\u2019s power. Can you help me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. I\u2019ll protect Daddy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feeling even sorrier, I held Ina tighter. Leon then asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cFriend, is that guy not coming out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. He apparently doesn\u2019t fight unless he\u2019s in an environment where he has the most advantage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat an annoying guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, now\u2026 let\u2019s pick the members.\u201d</p><br/><p>At my words, a few reacted immediately. The first to jump was none other than Sumire.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can still go on, Shin-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Sumire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I haven\u2019t even used my god\u2019s power yet! I only got hurt before because I wanted to save it for the boss fight\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSumire.\u201d</p><br/><p>I shook my head once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m only looking at one condition for the members I\u2019m selecting now. Will they die in one hit or not. Even though you have your god\u2019s power left, you\u2019re too exhausted. It\u2019ll be difficult to fight again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, I can go on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t either, Father.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t back down even with Father\u2019s protest and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll the succubi did amazingly today. Go back to the Resting Place of the Angels and rest. We can hold funerals for the fallen comrades when the battle is over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, I\u2019ll announce the ones coming with me to fight the Lava King. It\u2019ll be me, Daisy, Hwaya, Ina, and Ye-Eun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What about me, Shin!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot you, Ludia. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll let Su Ye-Eun go!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf anything, Ye-Eun\u2019s evasive ability is the best among us. Look at her.\u201d</p><br/><p>I pointed at Ye-Eun. Not only did she have very few injuries, they were all light and her clothes were much cleaner than the others. I wasn\u2019t bringing Ye-Eun for no reason. Her evasive ability was number one in the guild. As for her strength\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYe-Eun has \u2018that\u2019 thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUu\u2026. Yeah, I\u2019ll use it\u2026 Uuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun seemed to have realized what I was referring to, as she frowned a bit and murmured.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Master is aiming for Shin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t do anything funny in the middle of battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Ye-Eun. If she tries to do anything, this Unni will stop her. Even if I have to burn her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my body, Unni!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Ren spoke in a dissatisfied tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince, I also have Deific Manifestation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Ren uses Deific Manifestation, you\u2019ll jump straight into the mouth of the volcano. You need to wait until the thrashing phase ends.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that I wouldn\u2019t be taking Ren, Lebuik sighed openly. I spoke with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyone else will just get in our way. Just stay back and rest, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, I\u2019ll leave you to heal the others at the mansion. Please.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Shin\u2026 Uuuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia puffed up her cheeks, then turned away in the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo whatever you want. Go die if you want, stupid Orc!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for listening to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEit!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even after telling me to go die, she threw a few bottles of Elixirs towards my face. I easily caught them, after which Ludia turned away again with a humph before returning to the dungeon.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll be off, Father. Don\u2019t secretly follow us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhum! You\u2019re looking down on your father too much!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen Father gets a god\u2019s true name, Father can come with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuuuk! Fine, I swear I\u2019ll get that damn thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>After having everyone return to the mansion, I looked at the remaining members and declared.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go hunt the king!\u201d</p><br/><p>Our destination was the mouth of the Bulusan Volcano. There, the Lava King was waiting for us!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What We Can Do (8)</p><br/><p>Although bonus stats were indeed something to look forward to, the rewards were undoubtedly more alluring. Other than a few that looked like traps, they all looked great.</p><br/><p>After a bit of consideration, I chose the Deathblood Ring. It was a black metallic ring adorned by red gems. Just like its name suggested, it was quite chilling.</p><br/><p>[Deathblood Ring (Unique)</p><br/><p>Durability \u2013 120/120</p><br/><p>Equipment Requirement \u2013 Level 50+, Magic 100+</p><br/><p>Option \u2013 All stats +5, Magic +10</p><br/><p>Skill \u2013 Deathblood: 1. On attack, 2% chance to absorb 10% of enemy\u2019s mana to recover your mana. 2. On attack, 1% chance to inject your blood into the enemy. In exchange for 5% of your HP, the enemy falls under irresistible \u2018blood contamination\u2019 status effect.]</p><br/><p>Well damn! I might have to kowtow to the dead Cyclops Lord for this!</p><br/><p>I took off my gauntlet for a moment and equipped the Deathblood Ring. Although it looked a bit scary, it was also fashionable in a way. While I was looking at my hand satisfactorily, the female S ranker approached and asked with widened eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-Where did that ring come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCuriosity will only bring your harm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the others were also choosing their rewards. I was most curious about who would choose the Cyclops Lord\u2019s Golden Eye and the Lump of Refined Blue Iron. In the end, it seemed they were taken by Hwaya and Shuna, respectively.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh wow, this is an Orb!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 A what?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I turned around, a golden eye was shining on her palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought it was a magic material, but look!\u201d</p><br/><p>On top of Hwaya\u2019s palm, the golden eye ball that made me hesitant to touch it began to emit brilliant light and spin. It seemed Hwaya could move it as she pleased.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was something called sub-weapon. I didn\u2019t know about it before. How lucky.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that you got what you needed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD-Damn it\u2026 A freaking rag\u2026 Wait, this thing\u2019s defense is amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed Walker was satisfied with the reward he chose too.</p><br/><p>\u201cSumire, you\u2019re still waiting to choose your reward, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. We have to recover our strengths before we get out in case an Event Raid breaks out.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know about ability users, but for dungeon explorers, they could not leave the Event Dungeon until they picked their rewards. The Event Raid would only break out after this phase. As they spent the past month clearing Event Dungeons, it seemed they were quite familiar with the process.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-Where did everyone just\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? An extradimensional storage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, extradimensional storage. It\u2019s my ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a smile, Hwaya lied without blinking an eye. She was currently elated from receiving a sub-weapon, and the rankers also looked happy to see her smile, as they didn\u2019t say much else about it. Seeing others starting to rest, I approached the Cyclops Lord\u2019s corpse. Ludia tilted her head and asked through the guild message.</p><br/><p>[Are you going to put that corpse into your inventory?]</p><br/><p>f</p><br/><p>[Ah, that\u2019s that, but more importantly, my weapon was responding to this guy.]</p><br/><p>[Weapon?]</p><br/><p>The four weapons the Cyclops Lord was holding. As Gluttony Spear didn\u2019t eat the same weapon it already ate, it only ate one of the cyclops\u2019 club and stopped responding. Although the Cyclops Lord\u2019s weapons looked the same, it was possible that they were slightly different. Since no one used clubs in our party, I obtained their consent and brought Gluttony Spear up to one of the Cyclops Lord\u2019s weapon. Gluttony Spear devoured the club instantly. I brought it up to the other club just in case, and it really did eat it!</p><br/><p>\u201cOoooooh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing my weapon eat another weapon, the female ranker, though it was annoying to keep referring to her this way, screamed. Of course, I didn\u2019t pay her any attention and let Gluttony Spear absorb the other two. Immediately afterward, the Gluttony Spear radiated a brilliant light. Finally, finally\u2026!</p><br/><p>[Gluttony Spear reached 99.9% growth. To reach 100% growth, you must imbue all of your mana into it.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that now\u2026! Why are you shining then!?\u201d</p><br/><p>As full of expectation as I was, I became angry enough to almost snap the spear in half. If I consumed all of my mana now, I would have to make everyone wait for over 20 minutes while I waited for two Mana Potions worth of cooldown time. It was probably better to wait until the fighting was over. With a bit of disappointment, I put the Cyclops Lord\u2019s corpse in my inventory and turned around to face the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s done resting, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-That! Was that also an extradimensional storage!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Sumire chose the final item, a message appeared in front of us.</p><br/><p>[You completely cleared a S+ rank Event Dungeon! All party members receive 3 bonus stats!]</p><br/><p>[You will now return.]</p><br/><p>The raid boss did not appear. Some clicked their tongues while some sighed in relief. Not long afterward, we were outside the gate.</p><br/><p>The moment we came out, we found ourselves surrounded by countless Guardians. What was shocking was that most of them were at least S ranked Awakened. In other words, it wasn\u2019t just Korea\u2019s Guardians that were here. Behind them were soldiers armed with guns and tanks.</p><br/><p>A man who seemed to be the representative of Korea\u2019s Guardian stood in the front. After meeting my eyes, he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Guardian and the government have decided that they cannot allow you to rampage any longer. We recommend that you surrender peacefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>Come one, if you were going to do this, you should have done it earlier! No, were they waiting for us to tire ourselves out from clearing a S+ rank dungeon? I first turned around. Woo Youngha and one other S ranker were collapsed on the ground. Seeing as how father was taking his hand back, it seemed they were trying to do something and got beaten up. That would mean\u2026 I looked at the female ranker, who was blinking her eyes in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Shin. That looks to be the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa, whatever then. Just stay put, got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Good, she\u2019s listening. I turned back around to the man. Then, I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, first\u2026 Mmm, did you watch the video?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re still using force.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. You are bringing danger by being too confident in your strength. You entered a S+ rank dungeon without the country\u2019s permission. As the citizens were not evacuated, if a large S+ rank monster appeared and you could not defeat it, countless civilians would have been exposed to danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? You mean destroying low-rank gates won\u2019t be a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to the New Moon Law, gates ranked A or below are under the jurisdiction of Guardian and Freedom Wing. What you are planning on doing is simply illegal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd it can\u2019t be helped if they let gates turn into dungeons because of their \u2018lack of ability\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Will you be okay with S or S+ ranked gates turning into dungeons? If the three remaining gates in Korea turned into dungeons, you should know well enough that Korea will be powerless against them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. We want to get rid of gates just as much as you do. We need to have a conversation. Not with such ill-planned and ill-considered method, but with a method that would secure the safety of Korea and the interest of\u2014\"</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you want to negotiate.\u201d</p><br/><p>They wanted to destroy S or S+ ranked gates, but they wanted to keep the Event Dungeons A ranked or below for themselves. That was what that oldie was trying to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just have to promise that you will not enter foreign countries\u2019 gates without their permission. If you do, we will spare no efforts to help you get rid of the gates. Of course, we will also take your words into consideration regarding the removal of gates.\u201d</p><br/><p>We realize that you\u2019re strong, so we\u2019ll put a collar on you and erase only the gates we want to erase. If you listen well, we\u2019ll even give you a couple low-ranked gates.</p><br/><p>How surprising. His words were being translated automatically. Though, it\u2019s funny to think that Korean needed to be translated.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are already no gates left in Korea, so I don\u2019t understand why\u2026 No, nevermind, I understand. It\u2019s probably for shares, support from other countries\u2019 Awakened, or something along those lines. Fine, I\u2019ll keep this short.\u201d</p><br/><p>I raised my spear and slammed it down. Other than the female S ranker, Korea\u2019s other two S rankers had their legs broken.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome at me, you fuckers.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Prince is angry!]</p><br/><p>[He says not to kill them.]</p><br/><p>[What does killing mean?]</p><br/><p>[Killing is\u2026 Elemental Blade!]</p><br/><p>First, I shot an Elemental Tempest to the front. All ability users surrounding us were sent flying. Since they were all at least S rankers, I believed that they wouldn\u2019t die.</p><br/><p>\u201cS-Shoot! Fire!\u201d</p><br/><p>The soldiers panicked and began to shoot, but unfortunately, none of us were weak enough to be hurt by guns or cannons. Weapons without mana could not penetrate our bodies, which were brimming with mana. In fact, most S rankers were immune to guns. Since they should have known this already, they probably expected us to give up after seeing their numbers\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t stop shooting those annoying things, I\u2019ll blow them up. When they do, we won\u2019t be the ones dying.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Hwaya\u2019s words, the firing immediately stopped. They had lowered their tail after being threatened with death. Modern weapons did not mix well with Hwaya. Just by snapping her fingers, they would become ineffective and might even blow.</p><br/><p>While Hwaya neutralized the soldiers with all sorts of magic, I counted the number of ability users who withstood my initial attack. Although Walker and Ye-Eun were disarming the ability users taken out by Elemental Tempest, there were still over fifty ability users that were totally fine. To think they could gather so many rankers while we were clearing the Event Dungeon\u2026 It seemed Korea\u2019s Guardian wasn\u2019t so bad. Perhaps they considered us to be serious threats.</p><br/><p>I fixed my grip on my spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cI counted heads, so don\u2019t you think about running away. As long as you don\u2019t die, our kind healer will heal you, so relax and come\u2026 Otherwise, I\u2019ll make my move!\u201d</p><br/><p>Only after my shout did the rankers start moving. S rankers should be more than strong enough to fell a few buildings by themselves. Lightning, flame, arrows, restraining power, clumps of metal. All sorts of abilities were being used. Meanwhile, I extended my spear with Elemental Blade and swung it in an arc.</p><br/><p>[I, I knew it! Ueeeeeeeeek!]</p><br/><p>[I think that guy actually really enjoys Elemental Blade!]</p><br/><p>[Wheeee!]</p><br/><p>[Ah, wind! That\u2019s mine!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou poor bastards, go to sleep!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO Earth!\u201d</p><br/><p>Father\u2019s shockwave swept the area. A few ability users attempting to approach Ludia were struck by the wall of earth that suddenly popped up from the ground and were sent flying away. The area was becoming a total chaos. Only 10 minutes had passed since we came from the Event Dungeon, but the earth was fissuring, nearby buildings were falling, and trees were being rooted. At the same time, all rankers collapsed. The army already fell back with tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cSatisfied now?\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked the man who made the offer. He had run away the moment I neutralized Korea\u2019s two S rankers, but now that I looked, he was back.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m satisfied.\u201d</p><br/><p>He answered. On his face was a faint smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cGeez, you didn\u2019t have to make it so difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI apologize, but currently, no matter what you say, you cannot become justice. Even so\u2026 there are people who wish to be on your side. We just did what we could do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It seems Guardian isn\u2019t completely rotten.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is an organization formed to protect Earth. Please remember that.\u201d</p><br/><p>I smiled and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want anything, tell me. I\u2019ll sell it for a cheap price.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know how to trade! In that case, we would like some materials you obtained inside the gate. I don\u2019t know about other countries, but Korea\u2019s ability users often cannot hunt properly from lack of equipment. It is so bad that even I was tempted by the idea of letting gates become dungeons.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll contact you separately. Do you need help cleaning up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe already have people ready, but thank you for the offer. Rather than that, you should go do what you want to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m liking you more and more. Good, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><br/><p>I grinned and turned around. Ye-Eun tilted her head and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, why are you being so friendly with that guy? What happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked back at my companions. It seemed Walker really was tired, as he leaned on a wall and fell asleep, while father was looking at the collapsed S rankers like he had not gotten enough exercise. Hwaya forgot about the rankers and were playing with her golden Orb, while Ludia was treating the injured and Shuna was bringing the fainted people together. Sumire was assisting Ludia beside her with her own unique healing spell.</p><br/><p>In other words, Ye-Eun was the only one who went wild without fully understanding what was happening. Mm, how do I explain this\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBasically, we got an unofficial approval to do whatever we want.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cE-Eh!? What? When did we discuss that!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, if everyone\u2019s done resting, let\u2019s go! We have to finish Korea before the day breaks!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already past midnight, Kang Shin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we have to hurry!\u201d</p><br/><p>I snickered and retorted. Walker muttered, then grabbed his head in pain again. I couldn\u2019t tell whether that guy was smart or dumb.</p><br/><p>That day, before dawn, we took care of the three remaining gates in Korea. No one dared to bother us.</p><br/><p>It was just that the word \u2018Revival\u2019 became the most trending word on the internet.</p><br/><p>Now, it was time to leave Korea and party on the world stage.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>If you noticed from the beginning, you\u2019re a genius! I would have noticed when I saw the army there. The only ones that aren\u2019t aware that the army is ineffective against high ranking ability users are ordinary citizens. In other words, the army was there to appeal to ordinary citizens, not the Guardian or the Freedom Wing. ^^</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>If it sounds weird with all the \u201cS or above / below,\u201d it\u2019s because in Korean, the word \u201cabove/below\u201d is inclusive, while it\u2019s exclusive in English. For example, \u201cabove S rank\u201d in Korean would include S rank, but it wouldn\u2019t in English.</p><br/><p>Also Equipment Limit has been changed to Equipment Requirement</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I Can Hear Your Voice (5)</p><br/><p>The sky was dyed black. Under the artificial sky where not even a stream of light shone through, the dungeon, having swallowed all challengers, opened its mouth as if to seek more prey. From it, the screams of the dead and the smell of blood were still leaking out.</p><br/><p>[Son, are you ready?]</p><br/><p>Holding a spear over 3 meters long, he looked back at me. He was a veteran Hero, a Hero of the human race. Not just him, but all those who gathered to clear the dungeon were the same.</p><br/><p>[Yes.]</p><br/><p>Answering him lightly, I checked my equipment before entering the dungeon. An armor made from five-colored metal, a strange gauntlet emanating otherworldly aura, and plate boots that wouldn\u2019t melt even in lava. Finally, in my hand, a spear of pure white that rejected all darkness.</p><br/><p>Finally.</p><br/><p>[Sharana, Ruyue, Peika, Dortu.]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m ready!]</p><br/><p>[What? Let\u2019s just go in already. I\u2019m ready to rampage.]</p><br/><p>[Let\u2019s get this boring dungeon over with! Then we can go play.]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m Dortu. I will follow Master\u2019s command.]</p><br/><p>With them by my side, I would not be afraid no matter who I was up against. I gave the girls a big smile, and they also smiled back. I could do this. I was filled with confidence.</p><br/><p>I raised the pure white spear in my hand and pointed it at the entrance to the dungeon.</p><br/><p>[We're going in!]</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I woke up. I calmly raised my hand. It was my hand, the one I had seen for 19 years. I then touched my body. It was the same, wearing the same shirt I always wore as pajamas.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026 Huu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt like vomiting from a splitting headache. How many times had I now seen dreams like this? I could remember at least three\u2026 five\u2026 twenty\u2026</p><br/><p>I could not remember the faces of people that appeared in my dreams, but I vaguely remembered our conversations or the scenery. Were the dreams from my future? No, it could be from a ruined\u2026</p><br/><p>[Prince-nim!]</p><br/><p>[Ce-le-bri-ty-!]</p><br/><p>[He smells nice.]</p><br/><p>[Kyaa! He looked this way!]</p><br/><p>By the slightly open windowsill, I saw the air swirling. A few masses of blue light were frolicking about. They must be the owners of the voices I\u2019d been hearing recently and trying to ignore. These small and rowdy existences held incomprehensible powers. Elementals.</p><br/><p>I became certain at this moment. I had awakened.</p><br/><p>Spirit Mastery and Deific Manifestation. Was it really coincidence that I learned these two skills? I remained doubtful. At first, I thought Deific Manifestation was a skill that would allow me to learn a mana cultivation method, and I thought Spirit Mastery would only make Deific Manifestation stronger.</p><br/><p>Now that I had awoken to my ability, these two skills had entirely different purposes. Was this by someone\u2019s design? If so, who was this someone? Was it the one who created the dungeon? Would that existence even be a person?</p><br/><p>Things I had never thought about flooded my mind. However\u2026</p><br/><p>Clap!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright\u201d</p><br/><p>As I rubbed my swollen cheeks, I returned to reality. Even if I tried to remember, I couldn\u2019t remember what I couldn\u2019t remember. I just had to do the things within my power. Then what were they?</p><br/><p>It was to form a contract.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are many elementals on Earth, but I can\u2019t just go around searching for my partner.\u201d</p><br/><p>I realized from hearing the voices of many elementals in the past few days. Earth was full of elementals. Though, I did not know whether they were always there, or whether they appeared after Two Moon.</p><br/><p>I slowly recalled my ability. Elementalist. If I were to call it something, that would be it. I could feel elementals, see them, and use their powers by forming contracts with them.</p><br/><p>Contracts.</p><br/><p>The language for it was already prepared. Almost as if I had known it my entire life, it was ingrained into my mind. Although I felt unfamiliar with myself, I soon became numb to the feeling. I had to acknowledge what I had to acknowledge. However, I was curious as to whether all Awakened experienced the same feeling.</p><br/><p>Of course, just because I could hear the voices of elementals and form contracts with them, it did not mean I could form a contract with any random elemental. An Elementalist could only see and form contracts with elementals on the same wavelength as the Elementalist\u2019s soul.</p><br/><p>As the quality of the Elementalist\u2019s soul increased, he would be able to see more elementals. However, I was still a rookie Elementalist who had not formed a contract with a single elemental. The first thing I had to do was to find an elemental on the same wavelength as me.</p><br/><p>How could I go about doing that? I, of course, couldn\u2019t travel the world searching for the right elemental. That was why the contract circle existed. It was something ingrained into my mind when I awakened as an Elementalist. It was a magic circle that connected me to the elemental whose wavelength matched mine.</p><br/><p>First, I pushed my bed to the side, then began to draw the magic circle on the ground. I bit down on my finger, tracing the outer perimeter of the circle with blood. Then, I engraved the inside of the circle with symbols that popped up in my head. At the same time, I imbued my mana into the symbols, giving them power.</p><br/><p>[Look! It\u2019s a contract circle!]</p><br/><p>[Really?]</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s an Elementalist!]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ve never seen one in this world before.]</p><br/><p>[I want him to contract me! Then, I\u2019ll ask him to embrace me snugly.]</p><br/><p>[Dream on, weakling.]</p><br/><p>The nearby elementals seemed to have noticed what I was doing as they made circles around me. However, I ignored them completely. Although I could hear their voices, I could not clearly see their forms. It meant their wavelengths did not match mine.</p><br/><p>I used over three hours to draw the circle. Of course, I had my door locked. I did not want to be disturbed. It was Sunday, so I did not have to worry about much.</p><br/><p>After I finished drawing the circle, I imbued my mana into it to check that it worked properly. There was no problem.</p><br/><p>I got down on one knee and chanted as I placed my left hand on the contract circle.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, Kang Shin, request the world\u2019s help. Draw a connection between me and the one who will become my friend and strength. Let us come together like we were in the beginning of the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ooong.</p><br/><p>As soon as I finished, the contract circle began to vibrate, radiating light. It not only sucked in my own mana, but it began to absorb the mana in the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>[Kyaa, run! We\u2019re being sucked in!]</p><br/><p>[As I expected, he\u2019s a-ma-zing-!]</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s the birth of an Elementalist!]</p><br/><p>[You stupid elementals! I said run!]</p><br/><p>Even as the elementals near me ran away in a hurry, the contract circle sucked in more and more mana. This continued for a while before it began to calm down. Then, after radiating out with a final burst of light, it calmed down completely. At the same time, I confirmed that a connection had been made between me and someone beyond the contract circle.</p><br/><p>I whispered softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you hear me?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Who\u2026 are you? This strong and familiar feeling of lightning\u2026]</p><br/><p>I consumed Thunder Crystals to the limit. Since my affinity to lightning increased, it was obvious that I would be connected to a lightning elemental. I continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Kang Shin. Who are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am a lightning elemental, Peika. I\u2019ve been sleeping in a place where no one could find me.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI found you. I want you to become my strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am the same. I also want you who holds the power of lightning. I want the outside world.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThen form a contract with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Okay.]</p><br/><p>In the next moment, the contract circle let out a resplendent light. It was so bright that I could not help but close my eyes. When I opened them, an adorable girl, whose height did not seem to reach 20cm, was floating above the contract circle. She wore a delicate black silk dress and silk gloves, and had straight black hairs that curled at the ends.</p><br/><p>She had snow-white skin, eyes that shone with noble gold, and appearance like a porcelain doll. It was a shame. If she were human, she would have been a girl of incomparable beauty.</p><br/><p>She closed the folding fan in her hand with a thwack, then pointed it toward me.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m here to form a contract.]</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Kang Shin. In exchange for my mana, I wish to form a master-servant contract with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>[My name is Peika. Until the day I perish, I solemnly swear my loyalty to thee.]</p><br/><p>In that instant, the connection between me and Peika transformed to an inseparable bond. An indescribable pleasure swept through my body. At the same time, I heard messages that I could only see in the dungeon.</p><br/><p>[You formed a contract with the lightning elemental Peika! Your affinity and resistance to the lightning element greatly increases!]</p><br/><p>[You obtained the class, \u2018Elementalist!\u2019 Successful 1st class advancement increases your magic and charm by 10.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained the active skill, \u2018Spirit Aura.\u2019 By infusing a weapon with one\u2019s elemental, you can increase the weapon\u2019s strength. The strength increase depends on your mana and your affinity with the elemental.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained the passive skill, \u2018Elemental Contract.\u2019 As the skill levels increase, the number and quality of elementals you can form contracts with also increases. At the same time, it has a positive effect on already contracted elementals. Summoning elementals and maintaining them increases skill proficiency. Currently available number of contracts: 1]</p><br/><p>[You obtained the class passive skill, \u2018Elemental Control.\u2019 You can further control your contracted elemental. You can temporarily call upon ownerless elementals in nature in exchange for your mana. As the skill level increases, you can use less mana to more strongly control more elementals. Commanding and communicating with elementals increases skill proficiency.]</p><br/><p>[List of Contracted Elementals</p><br/><p>1. Peika \u2013 lightning elemental. Unique elemental. Locked. Locked. Unawakened.]</p><br/><p>[Low-rank Spirit Mastery becomes level 4! Your affinity to all souls and spirits increase, allowing you to wield even stronger power.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>I finally obtained a class. Although I had lingering attachment to the Spearman class, it was easy to see that Elementalist was a much rarer class. No, setting aside the matter of its rarity, I knew I could not be anything else but an Elementalist. I was certain that it was coded within my soul\u2019s essence. Was this what awakening was? Was this what becoming an ability user was? I did not know how the dungeon managed to find out and turn my ability into skills, but at this moment, I was too enraptured to care.</p><br/><p>Elemental Contract. It allowed me to feel an existence completely different than my own, and the feeling of being able to control it allowed me to experience a drug-like ecstasy. I felt her powerful existence, and even as it scared me, I smiled. Peika floated up and came right in front me. Then, using the hand not holding the folding fan, she touched my left eye.</p><br/><p>[I will engrave the contract symbol in Master\u2019s eye. It\u2019s going to hurt a bit, Master.]</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a pain like stabbing one\u2019s eyes with a needle. However, the pain only lasted for an instant. When I picked up a mirror to check my eye, I was startled. The center of my iris was radiating with a golden light.</p><br/><p>[You won\u2019t notice it unless you look closely.]</p><br/><p>Peika grinned and spoke. I could see the symbol of our contract on her as well. A black dragon symbol was tattooed on her cheek.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that, a dragon?\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s the creature closest to the essence of Master\u2019s soul. That\u2019s what a contract symbol is.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 Well, it\u2019s nice to meet you, Peika.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Nice to meet you too, Master. I don\u2019t know why, but Master has a very nostalgic scent. It\u2019s very fragrant, I like it. I hope Master can continue summoning me.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I plan on doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>If I summon an elemental and maintain the summoning, I would increase my proficiency in Elemental Contract, Spirit Mastery, and Elemental Control. This applied not only inside the dungeon, but also outside in the real world.</p><br/><p>Although my mana would be drained continuously, that was an issue I could easily solve by periodically initiating Peruta Circuit. Peika made a happy smile and sat on my shoulder.</p><br/><p>I put my bed back in place so that the contract circle was covered, then stepped out of my room.</p><br/><p>The world looked different. It was full of elementals.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

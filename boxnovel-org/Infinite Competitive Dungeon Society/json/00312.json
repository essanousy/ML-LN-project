Breakthrough (5)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>After breaking through the First Dungeon\u2019s 86th floor, I entered Beyond straight away with little rest. As the succubi told me to wait a week, I planned to clear as many floors as I could before that.</p><br/><p>Beyond\u2019s 36th floor had mobs of Vampire Lords. They were undoubtedly copies of an original Vampire Lord created by Sherafina. Still, that didn\u2019t mean they were any weaker than the Vampire Lord on the 75th floor. In fact, they were much stronger and annoyed me to no end.</p><br/><p>They maneuvered around freely, making it seem as though they were everywhere at the same time, and with their boundless mana, they constantly aimed for my neck with their blood magic attacks.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately for them, I had gone through too much hardships for them to faze me. The enemies I had faced just before them was a world\u2019s enemy\u2019s army. Though it took some time, four days to be exact, I cleared the 36th floor with little problem.</p><br/><p>Loretta seemed to be waiting for me to come out, as she welcomed me on the 86th floor and gave me a Fatigue Recovery Juice. While I drank it and relieved myself of exhaustion from the past four days, Loretta asked me a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, so how did you get through 31st to 35th floors so quickly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe succubi and incubi knew they weren\u2019t a match and made way for me. They just told me to go fight Lilith.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta flapped her ears and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow smart of them. Thanks to that, they\u2019ll get to live peacefully for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLilith died and Sherafina said she wouldn\u2019t be revived, so who\u2019s going to fill her place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSherafina will probably make a fake by picking one of the succubi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unfa\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta put her hands over my mouth. Then, with a cute smile, she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to restore an original from nothing, but it\u2019s easy to make a fake by giving power to what already exists. With Lord\u2019s power, it will be easy to make an acceptable Floor Master. In truth, Lilith was just too strong. Though, I\u2019ve only seen her once\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta made a slightly worried expression. Ah, thinking about it now, Loretta had the Evil Eyes of Charm. I quickly glanced at her shining eyes. As my charm rose, I felt like Loretta was lessening the restraint on her Evil Eyes.</p><br/><p>No, it wasn\u2019t just a feeling. Her eyes openly shone just now. Even so, I wasn\u2019t affected whatsoever. The reason was simple. It was because of my incredibly high charm and the fact that I had become part-Mare\u2026 Ugh, just thinking about it made me mad. In any case, considering that Lilith might have had her horn when Loretta met her\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You lost?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to be hit?\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed I was right. Loretta trembled and clenched her fists as though her pride has been shattered. Thinking she was cute, I put my hands around her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Loretta is the most charming person to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you say that to everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta snorted, but she couldn\u2019t hide her reddened cheeks and flapping ears. When it was her puppet at the Floor Shop, I remembered her being good at hiding her emotions\u2026 It seemed that her real body wasn\u2019t too skilled at it.</p><br/><p>I could have simply laughed in this situation, but where the conversation was headed made me a bit nervous. Although Loretta hadn\u2019t mentioned it until now, it was a mine that could detonate at any time! My brain was at work harder than in any battle. But I still couldn\u2019t figure out what to say. How can I be two-timing anyone if I\u2019m not even dating anyone? Not knowing what to say, I kissed Loretta\u2019s on her cheek and whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve only said this to Loretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally. You can ask Hwaya and the others.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you like this Hwaya more than me, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Of course not.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t answer instantly. I had unknowingly ranked them in my head. Ah! Loretta\u2019s gaze is heavy! Is this the price I have to pay for walking this road!?</p><br/><p>Loretta glared at me with puffed up cheeks, then sighed. I quickly added.</p><br/><p>\u201cI like Loretta the most, really. Look at me. I can only see Loretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Uuu, I hate myself for falling for these sugar-coated words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Really, Loretta was too eas\u2026 kind! Seeing the tension leave Loretta\u2019s body, I lightly embraced her and stroked her hair.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for understanding. I really do like you, Loretta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s my fault for falling in love. And considering what Shin-nim needs to do in the future, making them not have any other thoughts is certainly good, but still\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Not just in a practical sense, but how I felt about Hwaya or Ludia also\u2026 No, I buried these emotions deep inside my heart. I recalled the advice Lin gave me.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you want to take in many women, be confident and commanding. Still, make the woman you\u2019re facing believe that she\u2019s the best.\u2019 To do this, I shouldn\u2019t think of other girls at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Lin, you playboy, thank you for the advice!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Shin-nim, I\u2019m the best, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta looked up at me with worried eyes. Kuk, did I let my thoughts show!? I cleared my thoughts with Lin\u2019s advice in mind and brought up the truth within me. Don\u2019t lie! Fight head on with nothing but the truth!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was the first confession of love I made ever, can\u2019t you believe me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWords aren\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta pushed her lips out. Her eyes were closed, but her ears were flapping as if to make a storm.</p><br/><p>\u201cProof. I need proof.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were aiming for this from the start.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProof. Hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta said the same thing repeatedly with her lips out. She was too cute and Lin\u2019s manual for responding to such situation disappeared into the back of my mind. In front of this adorable bird asking to be fed, I wholeheartedly did my duty. However, it was hard to make a baby bird full.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSherafina should be watching.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho cares if that oldie\u2019s watching? Let her watch if she wants! So quickly, quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, I kept feeding the baby bird until she was satisfied. The succubi were waiting for me on Earth this entire time, but I ended up being an hour late.</p><br/><p>\u201cSweet scent.\u201d</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t sure how she knew I would come here today, but Daisy greeted me at the guild house in her full beret, uniform, and enamel boots and commented out of the blue. I asked back.</p><br/><p>\u201cSweet scent?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElf Queen\u2019s scent.\u201d</p><br/><p>I almost touched my lips subconsciously, but I managed to catch myself before the act. I decided to be shameless.</p><br/><p>\u201cI stopped by the Floor Shop, so Loretta\u2019s scent might be on me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScent, every time you talk\u2026 You ate the Elf Queen?\u201d</p><br/><p>She came up with a truly original conclusion and, in a way, she wasn\u2019t completely wrong. Daisy\u2019s senses were too sharp. I smiled and shook my head, but Daisy tilted her head and asked a follow-up question.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to eat me, too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will, eat Kang Shin\u2019s lips.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as I heard her words, I activated Divine Speed and jumped back. Daisy swung her whip wanting to capture me, but missed. She narrowed her eyes and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cFair play violation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou knew everything! Why did you act innocent? Plus, you took out your whip first!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d run.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy prepared a second attack. Her whip control had long since reached a pinnacle. If I wasn\u2019t careful, I could really be done in. Thrown off guard, I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever happened to easygoing!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSometimes, youth explodes. Elf Queen\u2019s scent, unpleasant. I will overwrite it with my scent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even that young\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy\u2019s whip flew in. That wasn\u2019t for capturing, but for shattering someone\u2019s bones! When I dodged it in shock, Daisy spoke with a stiff voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn elf age, I\u2019m a girl in the flower of youth. What Kang Shin said, very rude.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>I quickly gave up and apologized. Daisy put her whip down as though she was content and began to approach me.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Oppa, you\u2019re here!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this desperately dangerous moment, Yua\u2019s voice rang out. Her baby dragon, Luna, was in her arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cYua, you\u2019re here too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Everyone else is busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Yua didn\u2019t say much, seeing how Daisy and Yua were both here, I knew that what I planned to do on my own had gotten a bit out of hand.</p><br/><p>Daisy controlled the undead and Yua controlled an army of mantises. They were both perfect for dealing with a large number of monsters, even the ones that already became petrified.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa can just go alone, you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe, climbing the dungeon is important, but didn\u2019t Oppa say this? That there\u2019s something you can\u2019t learn in the dungeon. Not to mention, it seems these kids get stronger faster by defeating monsters in the outside world than in the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>I could immediately guess a reason. Monsters in the dungeon were all fakes under Sherafina\u2019s power. On the other hand, monsters roaming around on Earth were real monsters that had crossed over a dimension.</p><br/><p>Monsters ate the flesh and drank the blood of the enemies they killed and grew stronger by absorbing their mana. It made sense that monsters on Earth were better at helping Yua\u2019s mantises grow. Even the monsters that already became petrified\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about you, Daisy? Aren\u2019t you busy climbing the dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy flinched and looked away. I could guess as to what happened. I asked after waiting a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Vital zero?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy covered her face with her beret. It seemed I was right on the mark. But I knew it was unreasonable to ask someone to climb the dungeon without ever dying. This was especially so if that person was someone like Daisy, who was climbing the top floors.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy spoke quieter than a walking ant.</p><br/><p>\u201cI got too excited\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcited? About what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Mating with Kang Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do nothing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy realized her mistake and corrected herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI meant, dating Kang Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou got that wrong on purpose, right!? And when did we start dating!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOwowowowow.\u201d</p><br/><p>After paying the appropriate price, Daisy held onto her aching forehead and explained what happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cGot too excited, couldn\u2019t focus on battle\u2026 and made a mistake on the 88th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaisy, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Because of how Daisy always showed her emotions in a joking manner, I thought Daisy was odd, but it seemed that wasn\u2019t it.</p><br/><p>Daisy seemed to be embarrassed by what she said, as she covered her face with her beret again. I decided to not poke her dignity any further. Moreover, this topic was making me embarrassed too.</p><br/><p>I changed the topic slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least you didn\u2019t die in Beyond.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dying in the First Dungeon only came with a week-long rest period. In comparison, Beyond had a month-long period. I sighed in relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do about it now. But you should take this opportunity and take care of things you couldn\u2019t do because of the dungeon. You don\u2019t really have to come with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026? What I neglected because of the dungeon, I\u2019m doing now.\u201d</p><br/><p>What Daisy said touched me. I knew that Daisy cared about Earth\u2019s safety more so than other members of Revival, but I didn\u2019t think she would be this caring for Earth. Just when I was about to put this thought into words, Daisy continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpending time to mate\u2026 date Kang Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy lowered her beret slightly. Daisy\u2019s crimson eyes looked pure and innocent, but they also contained an unconcealable heat. At this instant, I realized two things. First was that easygoing was a dead word.</p><br/><p>Second\u2026 Loretta, it looks like you aren\u2019t the only elf devoted to your desires!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

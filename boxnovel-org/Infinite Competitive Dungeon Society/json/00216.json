(2)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know where to begin.\u201d</p><br/><p>With how huge the Dragon Zombie was, it didn\u2019t feel real. As a test, I aimed my crossbow at its eye\u2026 No, they had already rotted away into oblivion! That meant the effect of my Evil Eyes would be halved. Furthermore, since it was an undead, charm wouldn\u2019t work on it either. There was no chance to use all the weapons I honed through grinding the 65th floor.</p><br/><p>[Guooooooooo!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, it\u2019s coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>For a zombie so big, the Dragon Zombie charged towards me with an incredible speed. I hurriedly soared into the air and dodged its charge. However, when it smashed into the wall, a countless number of bone spears shot out of the walls toward me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shocked, I twisted my body in the air. However, with how many there were, it was impossible to dodge them all.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un!]</p><br/><p>Thousands of ice crystals formed around my armor, blocking the bone spears. Even so, a few managed to break through the ice, damaging me. I could feel a considerable amount of mana flowing into me. it meant that although this Dragon Zombie was an undead, it possessed an enormous amount of mana.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat this!\u201d</p><br/><p>I consecutively fired dozens of bolts brimming with lightning. Thanks to its huge body, the bolts hit their mark without any resistance and crackled with lightning. Even so, they didn\u2019t seem to affect the Dragon Zombie too much.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk, there goes my bolt spamming plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without hesitation, I swapped my weapon. At that moment, the Dragon Zombie roared. \u2018Your roars won\u2019t work!\u2019 was what I wanted to shout, but contrary to my expectations, terrifying bone spears pierced through its rotted skin and shot out of its body similar to when it hit the wall before.</p><br/><p>[Guooooooooooo!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThis bastard\u2026!\u2019</p><br/><p>It was like a machine gun endlessly firing bullets. With how many bone spears it was shooting out, it was difficult to even get near it. However, the crossbow bolts had little to no effect, and it was impossible to tell how long it would take to kill it with just the power of my elementals. Just like always, I had to take part in this fight by close combat.</p><br/><p>I grabbed one of the thick bone spears that shot towards me. With Chaotic Spear in one hand and the bone spear in the other, I charged forward. Of course, I didn\u2019t forget to activate Divine Speed.</p><br/><p>[Guooooooo!]</p><br/><p>\u201cUraaaaaaaaaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>All the bone spears seemed to be traveling slowly. Using the spears in my hands, I hit them away like a headless chicken. What was a mere 3 second period felt like 30 seconds as I closed the distance between me and the Dragon Zombie.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat this. Heroic Strike!\u201d</p><br/><p>By sending the aura-filled bone spear in my hand flying, I obliterated the clump of bone spears in my path. Then, holding onto the Chaotic Spear with both hands, I shot towards the Dragon Zombie\u2019s neck. Even though it didn\u2019t have any eyes, it managed to detect me, as it opened its mouth to swallow me whole. Hmph! I stabbed my spear into its nose bridge and let the gathered energy detonate.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on, even a critical hit can\u2019t cut off a bit of its flesh!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaang!]</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue!\u201d</p><br/><p>As I was expecting, it shot out a large bone spear from the attacked area. Honestly, it looked like a dragon, but it really was a damn cactus! I quickly pulled my spear out and drew forth Ruyue\u2019s power. When the bone spear was close to piercing my chest, the freezing energy made it flinch, and I safely escaped using this opportunity. A moment later, the giant bone spear passed by my head and shredded through the air.</p><br/><p>[Guoooooooooooooo!]</p><br/><p>Immediately afterwards, the Dragon Zombie charged! Though I knew what would happen when it hit a wall, I had no choice but to get out of its way. After all, I couldn\u2019t take a charge from its 200 meter long body!</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, barrier! Sharana, strengthen it!\u2019</p><br/><p>[Got it!]</p><br/><p>[Yes, Master!]</p><br/><p>I distanced myself from the walls as much as possible and ordered my elementals to create a barrier around me. Then, I troubled over what to do. Should I continue?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll die if I do.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Heroic Strike just now had a good amount of my mana, and was even a critical hit. Ordinary Floor Masters would have lost half of their health with that attack. However, that bastard didn\u2019t even flinch! Damn! Plus, I would be in trouble the moment I was hit by even a single bone spear. Could this battle get any more unfair?</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone would have taken out their god\u2019s true names here and still died.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, I wouldn\u2019t die. I had two god\u2019s true names! Plus, I had\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll show you my full strength, you goddamned lizard!\u201d</p><br/><p>I frantically dodged the bone spears that broke through the ice barrier as I shot my body upward. Soon, this huge space\u2019s ceiling was in my view. Though I didn\u2019t know what material it was made of, there wasn\u2019t even a scratch even with all the bone spears that struck it.</p><br/><p>\u201cFound it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The special large sized bone spear it shot out when I attacked it before! I flew up and grabbed it. Then, I moved Peika, who was inside the Chaotic Spear, to the bone spear. The Dragon Zombie was watching me with its hollow eyes. It then flapped its rotting wings. It was trying to fly!</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026 Gigant Time!\u201d</p><br/><p>The already big bone spear became a hundred meters long. The weight in my hand caused me to groan, but it was still acceptable.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, materialize into human form! Hold that guy!\u2019</p><br/><p>[Un!]</p><br/><p>After leaving my armor and materializing into the form of a beast girl, Ruyue drew a silver trajectory as she shot toward the Dragon Zombie. Human-form materialization had granted her a terrifying upgrade in power, as she grabbed the bone spears the Dragon Zombie shot out one by one, froze them, and shot them back.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, I activated the skill I received from the 60th Floor Master Superior Doppelganger.</p><br/><p>\u201cPowered Form!\u201d</p><br/><p>In that instant, a thicker and sharper armor appeared over my armor. The Superior Doppelganger possessed the ability to copy the powerful genes of its enemies to strengthen itself. The skill I received somewhat reflected this characteristic.</p><br/><p>[You activated Powered Form. Your defense and attack power increases by 30% for 5 minutes.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSacrifice!\u201d</p><br/><p>A black aura enshrouded my spear. With this, the spear had doubled in power. If I used Heroic Strike, it would undoubtedly hurt. However, I wasn\u2019t done yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cSky God\u2019s Rage!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Good, Master! I\u2019ll maximize its power!]</p><br/><p>Zeus\u2019 lightning descended on the 100 meter long spear. Any impurities left in the bone spear was completely washed clean, as it overflowed with pure golden divine power. It was almost as if it was a completely different weapon. Seemingly understanding the power behind it, the Dragon Zombie desperately shot out bone spears.</p><br/><p>[Careful!]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that I\u2019d used Sacrifice, if it didn\u2019t die after this, I would likely die. However, a real man didn\u2019t hesitate! I threw the 100 meter long lightning. One could imagine how large this space was with how long the spear flew. Right, such an enormous spear could fly for 2 seconds, even when it was so fast that I could barely discern it with my eyes!</p><br/><p>[I can\u2019t hold it back anymore!]</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go! Now!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I gave the order, Ruyue let go and flew back to me. At the same time, the lightning spear flew by her side and pierced through Dragon Zombie\u2019s neck, skewering it perfectly.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>I immediately coughed out a mouthful of blood. It also hurt like hell. My head felt blank. Because of how much life force I lost in an instant, I felt my body go limp. However, I grit my teeth and raised my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid it die?\u201d</p><br/><p>[It didn\u2019t die!]</p><br/><p>Peika exclaimed as she left the bone spear and flew back.</p><br/><p>I barely steadied myself in the air and examined the Dragon Zombie. The bone spear was still skewering it and erupting out with Zeus\u2019 divine power. With how the spear was sticking out from its mouth, it really did look like a kabob skewer.</p><br/><p>[Guoooooooooo!]</p><br/><p>However, even with a giant spear penetrating it, the Giant Zombie Dragon only let out pained screams as it flapped its wings to fly up. To think it was still alive\u2026 it really did have a zombie-like life force. Wait, it really was a zombie! Damn!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa, haa\u2026 Kuk, this feeling.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Devourer activates! Choose a target!]</p><br/><p>With my HP hitting 10%, Devourer activated. I was thankful Sacrifice left 10% of my HP. Otherwise, Diehard would have undoubtedly aviated.</p><br/><p>That said, I didn\u2019t think this Dragon Zombie could withstand the attack that crushed the Power Basilisk. Not to mention, it was even stronger than before. Though there were other explorers attacking the Power Basilisk, even taking that into account, this bastard was stronger than the Power Basilisk! How is that fair!?</p><br/><p>[Guooooo!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not completely absurd, I guess.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dozens of dark spheres rose up in the air. Seeing as how strength was leaving the Dragon Zombie\u2019s body, these dark spheres seemed to be the demonic energy forming its body. Even if it couldn\u2019t use magic, it looked like it could still utilize this energy.</p><br/><p>For getting rid of disgusting things, burning it was the best.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, it\u2019s your turn. Materialize.\u201d</p><br/><p>[But Master, Master\u2019s mana is\u2026!]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now, it was time for my tattoo to shine. I immediately activated the Succubus Queen\u2019s Tattoo. My mana, which had fallen to the bottom of my reserves with Ruyue\u2019s materialization and the Heroic Strikes, skyrocketed, only stopping when it reached double the usual amount. My body was still worn-out from Sacrifice, and with mana suddenly filling up, I felt short of breath. Peika seemed to have realized how I was feeling, as she hurriedly materialized.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll protect Master from that evil energy!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>My HP was at 10%. Although I gulped down a Health Potion, my HP only went up slowly. It seemed the recovery was being hindered by Devourer\u2019s effect. It was as if it was telling me not to play any tricks. I clicked my tongue and held up the Chaotic Spear. Then, gathering up the overflowing mana within me, I formed a whirlpool of chaos flames.</p><br/><p>\u201cDesire Thorn, Sacrifice.\u201d</p><br/><p>I activated the other two skills my armor, Pure Black Desire, had. The former increased the power of charge type attacks by 50% and helped me regain HP, while the latter doubled a skill\u2019s power in exchanging for making me take 25% of the damage. Since Devourer was also active, Pure Black Desire\u2019s abilities were in full effect.</p><br/><p>[Guoooooo!]</p><br/><p>[Hmph!]</p><br/><p>The demonic energy balls flew toward me. Peika harrumphed and burned them up with her lightning. I also charged as I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You activated Frozen Roar! All enemies in the battlefield freezes in place. All allies temporarily become super-armored and all abilities are increased by 50%. Your chance of landing a critical hit doubles when fighting enemies affected by Frozen Roar.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re alive after this, then I\u2019ll call you Hyung-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Twin-headed Ogre\u2019s Tattoos on my arms let out a bright red glow as if they were on fire. Once per day, increasing close-ranged attack skill\u2019s damage by 50%! It went without saying that charge type skills were close-ranged skills.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat this! Wind King\u2019s Rage!\u201d</p><br/><p>I shot down towards the Dragon Zombie. As there were no trash monsters between us, I charged in full throttle. Focusing the enormous wind and lightning energy at the tip of my spear, I thrust forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaaaa\u2026 Kuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately before my spear stabbed it, a bone spear struck my chest. Although it didn\u2019t penetrate my armor, the enormous shock devoured what little HP I had left. I couldn\u2019t believe it still had bones to shoot out!</p><br/><p>[Guoooo!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dead yet, fucker!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although I thought I would die for a second, Diehard activated soundly and raised my HP back up. With how low my HP was, there was no way I would\u2019ve charged head on without an insurance.</p><br/><p>Although Devourer tried to hinder Diehard\u2019s recovery, my HP was thankfully going up. Although my charge\u2019s momentum was cut short, I continued forward and stabbed my spear in the Dragon Zombie\u2019s head. At the same time, Desire Thorn and Devourer\u2019s effect activated. Black energy left the screaming Dragon Zombie\u2019s body to become absorbed by me, but dissipated due to Sacrifice\u2019s penalty.</p><br/><p>As I gasped for breath, I examined the Dragon Zombie, hoping it would scatter into particles of light.</p><br/><p>[Kuooo, kuooooooooo!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, you\u2019re still not dead!?\u201d</p><br/><p>It roared. Lumps of flesh sprung up from its body like boiling water. It was trying to spit something out. In panic, I shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust die already! Crimson Roar!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the next moment, everything within my sight turned red. The Dragon Zombie\u2019s roar and my shout both became flames. In this space, only flames existed.</p><br/><p>With that, it was over.</p><br/><p>[Congratulations! A first in Beyond\u2019s history! You defeated the Floor Master, Dragon Zombie, on your first try!]</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Kang Shin didn\u2019t want to serve the Dragon Zombie as his hyung.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

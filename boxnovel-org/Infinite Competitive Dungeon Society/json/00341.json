Demon Lord (4)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>I saw it the moment I came back to Earth. It was hard to miss something so big flying in the sky. How big was it? You could most likely see it no matter where you were on Earth.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I immediately got a headache. When I first awakened as an elementalist, I saw a dream. This dungeon looked exactly like the dungeon I saw back then.</p><br/><p>In that dream, the sky was reddish black, the sun couldn\u2019t shine down on earth\u2026 and countless number of people had died in the dungeon. If I remember correctly, Father and I talked before entering the dungeon\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cO-Oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>Turning around, I saw Yua walking in through the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cYua.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is Oppa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yua murmured seemingly in disbelief. Luna wasn\u2019t in her arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Luna?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLuna grew up. I can\u2019t carry her around anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn just one month?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA lot happened. Follow me. Many people have been worried sick about Oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>We were seeing each other for the first time in a month, but Yua was acting strangely calm and collected. I thought only a month passed, but did ten years somehow go by? I was filled with all sorts of thoughts, but I decided to be content with seeing Yua safe and sound.</p><br/><p>As we came out through the door, Yua spoke in a soft voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re safe, Oppa. I was worried so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s almost over too.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, I made a bitter smile. Yua looked a little surprised as she looked up at my face, but she soon nodded and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI trust you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut is Oppa\u2019s confidence coming from that strangely shaped horn? Ah, you have two of them now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind the horn, hahahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rubbing the two horns curving up on my forehead, I smiled sweetly.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin! Where were you until\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya, who was looking at a projection screen on the wall, shouted the moment she saw me entering with Yua before stumping down on her seat.</p><br/><p>With her eyes trembling and tearing up, she spoke as she glared at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like I lost 30 years of my lifespan worrying about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I couldn\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What about now? Are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew\u2026 Hic.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Hwaya break out into tears, I softly stroked her head. Hwaya then let out what she had been holding in for the past month.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was so hard by myself. Everyone only listens to you. It was so sad and annoying at the same time, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did well. I won\u2019t suddenly cut off contact again, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya pouted and rebutted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019d always be by my side before you disappeared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut for real this time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI pinky swear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though I didn\u2019t have much choice, since I had left everything to Hwaya for a month, she deserved some praise and comfort. Just looking at her, I could see she was on the verge of collapsing.</p><br/><p>She might have looked fine to others, but I knew how troubled she must have been.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Hwaya. I\u2019ll take care of everything now so don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuu, I, I have to endure it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed Yua was feeling great pain from my intimacy with Hwaya. There were many things I wanted to say, but I decided to wait until later.</p><br/><p>Looking up, I happened to see the screen Hwaya was looking at.</p><br/><p>Then, I froze.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAreas that underwent land transmittance. Look at the areas in red.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 That\u2019s how it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya spoke rather calmly. I pointed at Jongno, where our guild house was located, and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t there an Event Dungeon here before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, but that Event Dungeon had monsters, not demons.\u201d</p><br/><p>I immediately felt a chill go down my back. I had understood what she meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Shin. It\u2019s not your fault. We were all fooled.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Hwaya seemed calm about it, I couldn\u2019t calm down at all. We had made a critical miscalculation.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it now, the previous land transmittances had only been between the Luka continent and Earth. But we included Event Dungeon areas from the monsters\u2019 world into our safe zones. We didn\u2019t even stop to think.</p><br/><p>Why? Why didn\u2019t I think of it? Why did I assume the Luka continent and the monsters\u2019 continent operated under the same rules?</p><br/><p>I knew the answer. It was because the demons\u2019 Event Dungeons had never overlapped with the monsters\u2019 Event Dungeons. As a result, we concluded that the land transmittance would follow the same rule.</p><br/><p>But that had been a trap. The demons might have even planned their invasion paths to be that way for this moment. When I thought of it like that, the hair on my body stood on ends.</p><br/><p>We were played for a fool. We thought we were prepared, but that was arrogance. The Demon Lord and the demons had completely tricked us.</p><br/><p>I asked solemnly.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 How many died?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c2.3 billion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing my expression stiffen, Hwaya added.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt all happened in an instant. Land transmittances in areas that we believed were safe zones\u2026 My heart dropped when I heard the news.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been taken care of. It happened about a week after you disappeared. Almost as if they knew you weren\u2019t here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya\u2019s expression darkened as she recollected the past few weeks.</p><br/><p>\u201cNone of Revival\u2019s members died. Ilayda and Ludia made sure everyone survived\u2026 That\u2019s why people resent us more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cResent? It\u2019s not like we wanted other people to die! How can they resent us just because Revival members didn\u2019t die!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s precisely because we didn\u2019t die against those strong and fearsome demons. Countless number of ordinary people died\u2026 but we didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>I could imagine how hard Revival\u2019s members worked to protect others. But people were resenting us because none of us died? The absurdity of the situation left me speechless.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the door opened. Ludia quietly walked in.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I only planned to listen in\u2026 But I couldn\u2019t calm down until I saw you with my own eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia looked just as exhausted as Hwaya. I then remembered they were on the same shift. Ludia quickly approached me and closed her eyes as she held me. After the energy she released covered me, she got off with a satisfied expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat, you\u2019re not hurt\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I planned on seeing everyone after talking to Hwaya\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia didn\u2019t seem to mind it too much, as she turned towards Hwaya and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou forgot something important.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething important?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia nodded her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Shin is seen as separate from Revival.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? I\u2019m Revival\u2019s master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis disaster happened when you were gone. People are saying this wouldn\u2019t have happened if you were here.\u201d</p><br/><p>I understood what Ludia was saying, but I was still dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of a nonsense is that? Nothing would have changed even if I was here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without replying, Ludia put up another video on the screen. It was a live news coverage.</p><br/><p>[The voices of condemnation against Revival is becoming louder and louder. Many are supporting the theory that Revival\u2019s members have plotted against Kang Shin, who has not appeared for the past month. Revival\u2019s spokesperson, Miss Hwaya Mastiford\u2026]</p><br/><p>Hwaya sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is why I didn\u2019t say anything. I was afraid you\u2019d get angrier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince when did you become a spokesperson? Aren\u2019t you the vice-guild master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t care about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya spoke bluntly.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo them, Revival is Kang Shin and Kang Shin is Revival. Without you, Revival is nothing more than a militant group that can\u2019t be controlled.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 The timing was too perfect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ludia said with a shrug.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt first, we ignored it and thought it would go away, but the voices became louder at a speed we can\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo the people, you were no different than God. It became worse over the past month, practically to the point of blind worship\u2026 And we were the devils that killed God.\u201d</p><br/><p>I pressed my forehead. I began to understand Yua\u2019s strange calmness and Hwaya\u2019s frustration. Even I wanted to cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, why now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I thought to the month I spent absorbing the dragon\u2019s power. It was a necessary time to grow my strengths and reaffirm what I learned about my halo and Enigma.</p><br/><p>But during this time, the demons made a frontal assault as though they knew about my situation. Revival\u2019s members managed to stop them, but it couldn\u2019t be called successful by any means.</p><br/><p>A third of humanity had died. It was hard to say whether the world could go on the way it was.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe demons must have taken a catastrophic damage too. What they did wasn\u2019t what invaders would do. They were practically on a suicide mission!\u201d</p><br/><p>Or maybe, they didn\u2019t care about the number of casualties.</p><br/><p>After thinking that far, I raised my head.</p><br/><p>I looked at the entrance to the dungeon in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cHas anyone entered that dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot if you were here, Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Hwaya\u2019s words, I shut my eyes. Ludia added to the explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how many demons we killed, people wouldn\u2019t believe us. Almost like they were being controlled, they hated us and cried out your name. We were certain the Demon Lord was in that dungeon, but we didn\u2019t have the confidence to go in without you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. I would have been furious if you went in without me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 But other people didn\u2019t listen to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>I slammed my fist down on the table.</p><br/><p>Ciara\u2019s prophecy was coming true.</p><br/><p>Even after devouring the blood of countless number of ability users, the dungeon in the sky seemed hungry for more, spreading blood red light across the entire world.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

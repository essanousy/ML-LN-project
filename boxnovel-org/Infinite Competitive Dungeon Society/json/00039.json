Event Dungeon (2)</p><br/><p>Midterms ended. I had no classes on Fridays, so Thursday was the last day of my midterms. It was also the class I happened to share with Su Ye-Eun.</p><br/><p>I vaguely thought she\u2019d hit me up to go eat fries again. Since I started having classes with Su Ye-Eun, I started avoiding food with potatoes.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s celebrate the end of midterms with beer and fries!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI expected nothing less.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Shin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did the test go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Ye-Eun answered my question with a scream. How did this girl get into college?</p><br/><p>\u2018Something always happens when I eat fries with this girl\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>When the communication channel opened last time, I was almost scared out of my wits. It was almost like it happened because I went to eat fries with her. In a displeased tone, I asked Su Ye-Eun.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have any friends other than me? Anyone you have classes with?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No one talks to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen stop always wearing your hoody.\u201d</p><br/><p>With the hoody covering her face, Su Ye-Eun\u2019s presence disappeared completely. I almost thought it was some passive skill. With her pretty face, people would be all over her if she just dressed up a little\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI hate getting attention.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really have a tiresome personality.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I have you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>For a moment, I saw tentacles with suction cups stretching out from her body and wrapping around me. Was I caught in a trap? By this zero social skills, zero presence, monsterphobia, potato witch?</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>They said words sowed seeds. I didn\u2019t believe in it, but I decided to believe it from today. When I was taking a breath after ordering a beer and fries, the TV on the wall was showing a strange place.</p><br/><p>It was suspicious. I began to hate this shop famous for its fries.</p><br/><p>[Breaking news. At a shopping mall in Seoul\u2019s Yeongdeungpo District, a black pillar of light suddenly shot up to the sky. This phenomenon which was first seen two minutes ago is also being observed in other countries\u2019 main cities\u2026]</p><br/><p>On TV, I saw a shopping mall I visited in the past totally enveloped by black light. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, the black light was shooting up into the sky, forming a pillar visible from quite a distance away. There were also images from major cities in other countries. Japan\u2019s Osaka, America\u2019s New York, China\u2019s Beijing, Britain\u2019s London, etc. They were all large cities with huge population densities.</p><br/><p>[Experts consider this phenomenon as a continuation of Two Moon, and have advised governments to dispatch Guardian to affected areas. According to Article 7 Section 1 of New Moon Act, the government has begun to evacuate all Yeongdeungpo District residents and has dispatched Guardian\u2019s Special Forces.]</p><br/><p>New Moon Act. It was a law created after Two Moon to deal with monsters and monster-related work. It outlined the government\u2019s response when a monster-related disaster occurred. For example, the code of conduct, safety measures for citizens, and federal assistance for any material damage received.</p><br/><p>Although it had many faults and led to endless protests, it was still convenient in times of crisis like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cS-Scary... Right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. I wonder what it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Black light. Major cities.</p><br/><p>Just looking at them through the TV screen, I could feel the ominous aura emanating from them. However, I knew what those lights were. That was the feeling I had.</p><br/><p>\u201cDungeons.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, did you say something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? Did I say something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Ye-Eun looked at me like I was acting strangely.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you just say something about pancakes[1. The \u2018geon\u2019 in dungeon sounds like the word for pancake]? I like pancakes too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPancakes? What pancakes? I\u2019m not in the mood to eat. In fact, I think I have to go to the\u2026 dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDungeon!\u201d</p><br/><p>I shouted out loud. As if in response, the black light shooting up from the shopping mall subsided and revealed the building\u2019s appearance. No, it was wrong to say it was a building. It was a whirlpool of black smoke emanating an ominous aura. It was just like teleportation portals in games!</p><br/><p>At the same time, I heard message noona\u2019s voice in my head. She\u2019d been making a lot of business trips recently.</p><br/><p>[Event Dungeons have been created on Earth! When cleared, you can obtain various rewards such as stat points or skill points!]</p><br/><p>All Awakened on Earth likely thought this: It\u2019s finally here.</p><br/><p>All dungeon explorers on Earth likely thought this: Those are Event Dungeons!?</p><br/><p>I quickly opened the communication channel. Sure enough, Mastiford was chatting away in it.</p><br/><p>[You all heard it right? Those are Event Dungeons!]</p><br/><p>[Unni, you\u2019re going to go?]</p><br/><p>[Of course! You should come with me, Sumire!]</p><br/><p>[B-But\u2026]</p><br/><p>[If you die in an Event Dungeon, aren\u2019t you dead for real?]</p><br/><p>At Edward Walker\u2019s words, the two girls became quiet. I was thinking the same thing, even if it was something I did not really want to admit.</p><br/><p>This world was different from the dungeon. We were not given second chances.</p><br/><p>As such, adventuring had a danger incomparable to losing a week\u2019s worth of time.</p><br/><p>[These Event Dungeons are dangerous. I can smell it. The sweeter the reward, the more lethal the poison they bear.]</p><br/><p>[Then are you just going to leave them be? The rewards will disappear if other Awakened clear them. Are you that much of a scaredy-cat? How can you call yourself a British citizen?]</p><br/><p>[Shut it, Mastiford. I don\u2019t see what that\u2019s got to do with it. Me being British has nothing to do with acting like a fool who doesn\u2019t know fear.]</p><br/><p>Well said, Mister Walker!</p><br/><p>[The dungeons we\u2019ve been going to until now were like games. There was no risk involved. Although being hit by monsters may have hurt, you were guaranteed your lives. And when you won, you were guaranteed rewards. But not now. It\u2019s a gamble with your life on the line. No matter how sweet the reward seems, it\u2019s not worth it.]</p><br/><p>[Ho, you\u2019re more prudent than I imagined, or should I say cowardly? Shouldn\u2019t a man charge in no matter how dangerous it is and come out victorious!?]</p><br/><p>Father, who had fought against a tiger barehanded and won, had the right to say that. That said, I won\u2019t forgive him for making me fight one when I was only 13 years old! Even if I won in the end!</p><br/><p>[Hmph, are you saying you\u2019ll go into those dungeons?]</p><br/><p>[Think about it. I\u2019m not active yet as an ability user. If I go into a dungeon, I would be advertising to the whole world that I\u2019m an ability user.]</p><br/><p>[So you were just talk after all.]</p><br/><p>[\u2026 You, do you want to make a trip to Korea? I\u2019ll welcome you wholeheartedly. With my spear, that is.]</p><br/><p>Father\u2026 I felt I needed to interfere before father started fighting Walker. I also needed to point out something everyone was missing.</p><br/><p>[Sorry everyone, but before we talk about the benefits we can gain as dungeon explorers, there\u2019s something important we need to address.]</p><br/><p>[Ah, Yeon Hwawoo! Great! Why did you ignore me until now!? I\u2019ve been calling you for a while!]</p><br/><p>[Hm? I had the communication channel turned off, why?]</p><br/><p>[Ugggaaaah! How annoying!]</p><br/><p>I ignored Mastiford\u2019s screaming and continued.</p><br/><p>[You guys know what happens when you clear an Event Dungeon, right?]</p><br/><p>[I haven\u2019t entered one before, but I\u2019ve heard about it.]</p><br/><p>[Ah, I\u2019ve cleared it before. Huhu, twice in fact! And for one of them, an Event Raid hap\u2026 Ah!]</p><br/><p>Mastiford who was excitedly bragging cried out in shock. It seemed everyone had an idea what I was trying to say.</p><br/><p>[The Event Raid\u2026 You\u2019re right.]</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s right. I remember now.]</p><br/><p>Eh? Father, you\u2019re on the 21st floor now!? I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d catch up to me so quickly. Though, as I was completely into raising my stats through the Muscle Strengthening Elixir, I didn\u2019t pay much attention to leveling up.</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s right. If we rashly clear one, a raid boss might appear and make the situation worse. We need to come up with a solution before we do anything.]</p><br/><p>[Hmm, but even if we don\u2019t do anything, wouldn\u2019t the Awakened be dispatched?]</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s true\u2026 Mastiford, didn\u2019t you brag about being a SS-rank ability user with public trust? This is your opportunity to shine. Send the world a warning.]</p><br/><p>[Mmm, I\u2019ll try. I\u2019ll try but\u2026 I don\u2019t really have much power, you know? Britain has another SS-rank ability user so my words won\u2019t have much weight. Plus, Korea isn\u2019t a powerful country. This is exactly why I wanted to create an organization of dungeon explorers!]</p><br/><p>[Miss Mastiford, I\u2019m saying you should use your personal authority as a SS-rank ability user. Don\u2019t you understand the weight your words carry? Don\u2019t talk to the government, talk to the mass media! You can even hold a press conference if you want. We need to prepare the entire world, whether we clear the dungeon or not!]</p><br/><p>[E-Even if you suddenly compliment me, I can\u2019t do anything! Hmph!]</p><br/><p>[Unni\u2026]</p><br/><p>As I was chatting in the communication channel, I naturally had my hand over my mouth. Su Ye-Eun, who had three fries sticking out of her mouth, was staring at me like I was the weird one. I ignored her gaze and turned to the TV. There, I saw a letter written on top of the Dungeon Gate. It was undoubtedly the letter \u2018A\u2019!</p><br/><p>[Mister Walker, if you knew what difficulty the Event Dungeon you had to enter was, what would you do?]</p><br/><p>[I would still hesitate. That said, given that I have some information about the dungeon, I could prepare myself to challenge it. Compared to the huge danger I would have to eventually face, overcoming the current smaller danger would have some merit.]</p><br/><p>[Good. Korea\u2019s Event Dungeon Gate has the letter \u2018A\u2019 above it. I think this is like the rank that classifies ability users. How about other countries?]</p><br/><p>At my words, everyone became quiet. Sumire was the first to respond.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s true! Osaka Castle\u2019s Gate says B+!]</p><br/><p>[The entire Osaka Castle disappeared!? I wanted to go see it eventually!]</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s not important right now, Miss Mastiford!]</p><br/><p>[Hey, you stop picking faults at whatever I say. I\u2019m at my mom\u2019s house right now, so I can only see Yeungdeungpo\u2019s Gate! I\u2019m a Yeundeungpo resident too!]</p><br/><p>\u2018Like I care! Turn on your TV and look at the other countries! I\u2019m in a place where I can\u2019t even change the TV channel!\u2019 I growled at her in my head.</p><br/><p>[I confirmed it. Britain\u2019s Event Dungeon says A+. It seems America\u2019s Event Dungeon is S.]</p><br/><p>[Hm. France has B, China has C. Although China has the lowest difficulty, five Event Dungeons appeared there. 3 Cs and 2 C+s.]</p><br/><p>If the alphabet above the Gates were really based on ability users\u2019 rankings like I thought, wouldn\u2019t a single S-rank ability user be enough to clear a S-rank dungeon? Wasn\u2019t solo play the standard for all dungeons?</p><br/><p>[Huu, this is hard. If you consider a 10-man party as the standard\u2026 No, since you can\u2019t quit and come out like in the dungeons we go to, we\u2019ll have to consider at least 20 people for taking shifts. Since they don\u2019t have inventories like us, we\u2019ll need to add 5 more people to carry daily necessities. That\u2019s 25. Even if porters can be low-rank ability users, wouldn\u2019t America\u2019s S-rank dungeon need 20 S-rank ability users? That\u2019ll be difficult.]</p><br/><p>[There\u2019s a possibility that only 10 people can enter a dungeon. In that case, we\u2019ll need ability users with higher ranks than the dungeon itself.]</p><br/><p>I decided to stay quiet. Although I was also a dungeon explorer, the amount of common sense knowledge I knew seemed light years apart from theirs. Not to mention, not all ability users on Earth were dungeon explorers.</p><br/><p>[Plus, if an S-rank raid boss appears, we\u2019ll need at least 100 to 300 people to come out victorious. That\u2019ll be a disaster among disasters.]</p><br/><p>[Now that you put it that way, Yeungdeungpo\u2019s boss would be A-rank too\u2026]</p><br/><p>Mastiford seemed to be immersed in her thoughts, when she suddenly said,</p><br/><p>[Everyone, I need your help. My mom\u2019s feeling uneasy. I want to get rid of the dungeon quickly and calm her down. Help me beat this dungeon. As a magician, although I have strong firepower, I\u2019ll be taken out if I leave any openings. I can\u2019t do it alone.]</p><br/><p>\u2026 Just like I thought from the beginning, she was honest. People usually found it hard to acknowledge their weaknesses. For someone like Mastiford who seemed like a blob of self-esteem, I didn\u2019t think she would so easily admit her weakness. Right now, she not only revealed it, but she was also asking for help. It meant she knew her weaknesses just as much as her strengths. I began to see her in a more favorable light.</p><br/><p>Plus, I knew she really liked her mother.</p><br/><p>[I refuse. There\u2019s no reason for me to put myself at risk.]</p><br/><p>Edward Walker was the first to answer. In a way, it was the logical answer. On the other hand, Minami\u2019s answer was the complete opposite of Walker\u2019s.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll help, unni. I\u2019ll fly to Korea right now! I have confidence in my defense, so I can withstand most attacks!]</p><br/><p>[Sumire! Thank you, I love you!]</p><br/><p>That girl was still too kind. She should really think things through a bit more.</p><br/><p>[Miss Minami, I\u2019m not trying to be condescending, but I don\u2019t think a explorer on the 18th floor can take on an A-rank monster.]</p><br/><p>[Y-You\u2019re right, but I have confidence in my defense! I can even take a Floor Master\u2019s attack head on!]</p><br/><p>[Really?]</p><br/><p>This young lady was certainly not normal. Climbing 18 floors in 2 years, plus\u2026 Eh? 2 years? There were 5 dungeon explorers right now, and there were 5 dungeon explorers when I became one 5 years ago\u2026 A question emerged in my mind. But now was not the time to ask. I reluctantly put it away in the back of my mind.</p><br/><p>[Miss Mastiford, what are our plans if a raid boss appears when we clear the dungeon?]</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t worry. I have an SS-rank firepower. If I\u2019m properly protected, I can deal with an A-rank raid boss by myself.]</p><br/><p>With that, I made my decision.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll participate too. Although I might be lacking, I can at least protect Miss Mastiford.]</p><br/><p>[W-What\u2019s up with you suddenly? What are you scheming? Is it the stats? Is that what you\u2019re aiming for?]</p><br/><p>[That one thing. More importantly, I\u2019m confident I won\u2019t die in an A-rank dungeon. Plus, if someone can guarantee to kill the raid boss without suffering losses, it would only be proper to lend a hand to the person capable of doing it.]</p><br/><p>Objectively, I assessed my ability to be about B+ rank. Of course, that was only taking Peika\u2019s ability into account. Adding on my physical strength and techniques, plus my abilities as a dungeon explorer\u2026 I was probably A-rank. Even without my spear that is.</p><br/><p>[Hmph! Even if you change your mind now, I won\u2019t put you in our organization!]</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t want to go in your organization, you witch.]</p><br/><p>[W-Witch!?]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll cooperate too. Since my so\u2026 I mean, since Yeon Hwawoo is cooperating, it\u2019s only proper as a fellow Korean to join in.]</p><br/><p>\u2018Just say the word son, father!\u2019 I complained in my head. That said, father seemed to be worried about sending his son to such a dangerous place alone as he also joined in.</p><br/><p>But do dungeon explorers have to be the ones to go?</p><br/><p>[Miss Mastiford, you\u2019re a SS-rank ability user. Why can\u2019t you just bring other ability users instead?]</p><br/><p>[What other ability users? Do you think people would choose to barge into a suspicious and dangerous place like that without receiving any rewards?]</p><br/><p>[An SS-rank ability user\u2019s name doesn\u2019t even have that much weight?]</p><br/><p>After hearing what I said, Mastiford let out a deep sigh.</p><br/><p>[You see, British Guardians are busy with the Gate that appeared in London. Korean Guardians would be all over me, but I\u2019m afraid of the aftermath.]</p><br/><p>[Aftermath? Ah.]</p><br/><p>The scene of Mastiford entering Korea\u2019s Gate with other Korean ability users would be the perfect advertisement for the proud Korean image the government was trying to sell. Once I understood, I nodded my head instinctively.</p><br/><p>[Even though we\u2019re doing a good thing, we have to sneak into the Gate. Do you understand, Yeon Hwawoo?]</p><br/><p>[Yeah, I got it. You have it rough, Miss Mastiford.]</p><br/><p>[Thanks for noti\u2026 wait, why am I talking so friendly with you!?]</p><br/><p>Mastiford suddenly yelled after talking well for a while. Reaffirming that this woman wasn\u2019t normal, I shook my head. At the same time, Mastiford put the conversation to rest.</p><br/><p>[Then we\u2019ll gather in front of that shopping mall in two hours!]</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s too fast! Miss Minami has to fly over from Japan! I know you want to take care of the dungeon as fast as possible, but calm down.]</p><br/><p>[Ah, you\u2019re right\u2026 Then 2 o\u2019clock tomorrow afternoon.]</p><br/><p>[Fine.]</p><br/><p>[Got it, unni!]</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s fine with me.]</p><br/><p>[Ho? The four of you are gathering? Yeon Hwawoo, I thought you\u2019d be different\u2026 well, good luck.]</p><br/><p>With that, Walker went silent. It seems he turned off the communication channel.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m off too. I\u2019ll be there on time so don\u2019t worry.]</p><br/><p>[W-Who\u2019d worry for you!? Ah, wait, you\u2019re about to turn the communication channel off, right? Don\u2019t--!]</p><br/><p>I turned it off. Letting out all the tension I built up with a sigh, I gulped down on lukewarm beer in front of me. At the same time, I caught sight of Su Ye-Eun staring at me strangely.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Shin? You seem to be trembling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just nervous. It looks like I\u2019ll be doing something dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stared at the Gate on TV. A whirlpool of grey smoke. Although Mastiford didn\u2019t say much about it, I still had a lot on my mind.</p><br/><p>It was different from the dungeon.</p><br/><p>If I died, that was it.</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t they be fine even without me?</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk. I can\u2019t turn tail in front of just this much danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>It had been a while since I thought about it, but I remembered.</p><br/><p>The superhero I dreamt of becoming when I was a little kid was not a coward. From the dungeon, I learned that a coward cannot get stronger. If everything ended when I died, I just had to not die.</p><br/><p>What was the reason I raised my strength in the dungeon? Before monsters began appearing on Earth, it was to see just how far I could go. I also wanted to know what was at the end of the dungeon. That was the same even now when monsters began appearing on Earth.</p><br/><p>Until now, I ignored Earth\u2019s monsters because I could not gain skills or level up from hunting them.</p><br/><p>It was different now. If that dungeon\u2019s difficulty really was based on A-rank ability users, then it was worth taking it on with my current strength. If things went badly with that dungeon, there was the possibility that ordinary people, not ability users, would die. Just like when the second moon first rose in the skies.</p><br/><p>\u201cThough, I only said I\u2019d go because I was confident I wouldn\u2019t die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD-Die? It\u2019s that dangerous?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, I won\u2019t die.\u201d</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t a saint. I had no plans to throw my life away for someone I didn\u2019t even know. But Yeungdeungpo wasn\u2019t that far from here. If a raid boss appeared, it was possible that someone I cared about would get hurt. I had to prevent that at all costs.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Most importantly, there were rewards in that dungeon. Although it was only temporary, I had an SS-rank ability user in my party! It would be hard to find another opportunity to leech rewards so easily! Whoops, my real intentions were leaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, huhuhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD-Don\u2019t suddenly laugh. It\u2019s scary\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, the world is vast and there are truly lots of things to grind.\u201d</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll get stronger! Overcoming danger and getting stronger from it is what excites people! Thinking that, I tightly clenched my fists. Although I sneered at father\u2019s simple personality, I had yet to realize I was just like him in the most crucial area.</p><br/><p>\u201cI should really take you to the doctor\u2026 Uuu, I\u2019m worried.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mind your own business!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

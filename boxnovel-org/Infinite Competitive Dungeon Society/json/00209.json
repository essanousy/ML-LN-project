The Qualification of an Explorer (6)</p><br/><p>As I had just taken off my shirt to go take a shower, I looked back at Hwaya in an awkward state.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!? Why did they suddenly die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey were contracted to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cContract? You mean\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I asked her, dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean they died because they went against the contract?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I put my familiars on the rankers we took in. As you see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can put familiars on them without being discovered?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI got some help from dungeon items. It\u2019s not like the dungeon only has battle-related items.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Sorry, I only got battle-related items...\u2019 While I murmured inwardly, Hwaya\u2019s finger danced in the air, and took out a small ball from her inventory. It was then that I suddenly remembered something.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you in my room?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour mom let me in. By the way, you\u2019re not really engaged to Ludia, right? She was cooking in the kitchen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask that while you\u2019re making fireballs. The answer is no. Also, stop staring at me like it\u2019s normal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you build your body to show off to girls? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re losing anything by showing me some muscles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI naturally became like this while training!\u201d</p><br/><p>I hurriedly summoned Ruyue and cleaned myself of sweat and dust. While I was at it, I put on fresh clothes as well. Although I didn\u2019t like cleaning myself like this, as taking a shower was more refreshing, I couldn\u2019t stay topless with Hwaya staring at me.</p><br/><p>Hwaya smacked her lips seeing me put on my clothes. She then fiddled with the ball she took out, making it enlarge to the size of a soccer ball. In it, we could see a video. It was like a magical crystal ball.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a device that links to familiars\u2019 eyes. I can just link my eyes to theirs, but I don\u2019t like it because it makes me dizzy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd I won\u2019t be able to see it either.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the crystal ball, one of the new explorers we chose appeared. He was talking with another person.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s another ranker from his country.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo the part of the contract he violated is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everything happened incredibly fast. When the explorer reached out to put his hand on the ranker, strength left his body and he collapsed. The frightened ranker screamed. The view then changed to the other explorer. It was the same with him. They had both met the same death in the same way.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of them, all I got were two items called Soul Crystals. It\u2019s gross, really.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I was dumbfounded. They didn\u2019t believe us even after all that? Did they think the contract was just a piece of paper? I thought we took the necessary care to prevent such a thing from happening so that we could steadily increase the number of explorers\u2026 It seemed I didn\u2019t put enough faith in people\u2019s ability to be stupid.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026 If this happens a few more times, Earth\u2019s forces will\u2026 Maybe, we should just give up on the Soul Contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe only asked one thing from them. To not make explorers without permission. What do you think they were trying to do by going against us? It\u2019s simple. They were trying to create their own group of dungeon explorers to decrease our power. If we give up on Soul Contracts now, it\u2019s going to become a total mess. Think of how troublesome it\u2019s going to be when hundreds or even thousands of dungeon explorers are going against us. Then, the problem won\u2019t just be saving Earth. Be firm. They simply paid the price.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya was right. If they couldn\u2019t keep such a simple condition, it meant they didn\u2019t care about dungeon explorers\u2019 duty in the first place. Even though we explained to them so thoroughly, they were still more concerned with playing Monopoly. To be frank, I was disgusted.</p><br/><p>I gritted my teeth and closed my eyes for a moment before opening them back up. Then, I asked Hwaya who was staring at me fixedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere were they from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGermany and\u2026 Britain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now on, we won\u2019t\u2026 Britain?\u201d</p><br/><p>I paused for a moment and fell into silence. Hwaya then continued where I left off.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t choose explorers from Germany or Britain from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, Hwaya!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI decided within my authority as the vice-guild master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I burst out, Hwaya pushed her face into mine and said threateningly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine! As long as we take care of the world\u2019s enemies, there won\u2019t be any problem! Or what, are you not satisfied with just this? Are you going to attack Britain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it, but Britain is still the country you were born in. I know you want to protect\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already fulfilled my duty by including them in the first wave of appointments. It\u2019s them who betrayed me. Just do as I say.\u201d</p><br/><p>She took the crystal ball again and stuffed it in her inventory. Then, she snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go eat now! When you\u2019re angry, you have to fill your belly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>That day, we revealed the video to the world and announced that we wouldn\u2019t take explorers from Germany and Britain. That also meant that explorers we appointed couldn\u2019t appoint new explorers from those countries. With this, people of Germany and Britain couldn\u2019t become dungeon explorers unless they were chosen by the dungeon itself.</p><br/><p>Of course, we faced massive protest, as the mass media criticized Revival for \u201ckilling\u201d people. Although there were those that supported us, the amount of criticism we received from most countries was almost as if they had already prepared to do so. I was even beginning to suspect that they sacrificed the two explorers to push the narrative that we were criminals.</p><br/><p>Regardless, we knew we were in the right. I made an announcement. As it was annoying to hold a press conference every time, I just sent a recording to a broadcast agency.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe emphasized twice or even thrice that those who violate the contract will die. Now that you see that they actually died, you think we killed them? So you\u2019re saying you planned on violating the contract from the beginning, right? From this point on, whoever talks bullshit and blames us will receive the same treatment as Germany and Britain. If you\u2019re okay with that, keep talking. You won\u2019t even see an explorer in your country. Also, Event Dungeons and Event Raids that you won\u2019t be able to handle, what do you think we\u2019ll do when the so-called giant monsters and gates appear in your countries? We don\u2019t have any intention of helping countries that treat us like murderers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once the announcement made its round, all talks to criticism thoroughly disappeared from the mass media. It was a refreshing feeling. Really, we should have threatened them from the beginning.</p><br/><p>That said, I couldn\u2019t feel good about how things went. Threatening them with Event Dungeons and Event Raids was the worst. I murmured with frustration.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut they weren\u2019t listening to us when we were being nice. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure there are people who think like us. Right now, the people that support us and the people that doesn\u2019t like us should be fighting each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the Demon Lord is in front of us, do you think they\u2019ll realize that what they\u2019re doing is useless?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe other two S+ rank explorers are doing well, so don\u2019t be too sad. It\u2019s not like we didn\u2019t expect this to happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheer up Daddy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ina jumped into my embrace and buried her head in my chest. Was she trying to comfort me!? It\u2019s super-effective! I hugged Ina back.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Ina. I\u2019m fine, I was just feeling a bit annoyed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you feeling better now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, thanks to Ina.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You might be feeling better, but I\u2019m feeling a bit strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya was looking and Ina and me doubtfully. I looked at Ina and tilted my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, nevermind\u2026 I can\u2019t be jealous. She\u2019s a kid. I\u2019m an easy-going woman\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMommy is weird.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Mommy is weird.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Hwaya murmuring to herself, Ina and I laughed.</p><br/><p>Thanks to Ina, I was able to cheer up. With this incident, I realized how foolish people could be. If I couldn\u2019t resolve things peacefully, I just had to use my strength. After all, I wouldn\u2019t have revealed my identity if I didn\u2019t have the power to suppress anyone who opposed me.</p><br/><p>In the end, we were the ones holding the right to appoint explorers, and it was other countries that needed it. At the same time, Revival had Earth\u2019s most powerful people in it. As long as this remained true, others couldn\u2019t meddle with our will. We would continually increase the number of explorers for the benefit of our world.</p><br/><p>Germany and Britain had also turned their tails, and other countries used this opportunity to push their own ability users to become dungeon explorers. Though I found it disgusting, if they would defeat monsters, we had no choice but to use them.</p><br/><p>We then appointed five more explorers. There was no real reason other than that they needed to grow and acquire dungeon explorer appointment rights as soon as possible. I emphasized the danger our world was facing and made sure they saw how the two explorers that went against the contract died.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope that you won\u2019t do something so foolish and that you\u2019ll do your best for our future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t forget it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Earth!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll only believe in you, Revival\u2019s Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, I returned to the dungeon. Although the 65th floor\u2019s succubi attempted to seduce me, I easily turned them to stone and shattered them. There were no succubi that could escape my gaze and with Elemental Blade\u2019s reach, my spear plowed through everything in my path.</p><br/><p>[Master! Master\u2019s going too fast!]</p><br/><p>[Shin is angry.]</p><br/><p>[You guys are noisy! You just have to follow Master!]</p><br/><p>I tore apart the succubi without a shred of hesitation. In just 30 minutes, I began to see the door to the Floor Master room. At that moment, the door undulated as if it was an illusion, and a strange fanfare rang out in my ear.</p><br/><p>[Amazing! You met the condition for opening the Floor Master Event Dungeon that no one has done since the creation of the dungeon!]</p><br/><p>[Floor Master Battle Room transforms into an Event Dungeon!]</p><br/><p>[SSS rank 1-man Event Dungeon, \u2018Succubus\u2019 Castle\u2019, opened! You cannot refuse to enter, so please be careful! This Event Dungeon is in a dimension partly outside of the dungeon\u2019s system\u2019s jurisdiction. Death in this dimension means real death. If you feel lacking in strength, it is recommended that you immediately use Return to escape!]</p><br/><p>Message noona, you\u2019re too kind! Wait, before that, what did you say?</p><br/><p>\u201cEven the Floor Master room had a next level!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I only realized that on the 65th floor? What a waste!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

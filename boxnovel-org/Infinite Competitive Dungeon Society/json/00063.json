Draconian Lin (1)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Chapter 63. Draconian Lin (1)</p><br/><p>The Giant Ghoul was big even among Floor Masters. His claws were imbued with a mana of death, and when he rampaged, you took mild damage just from being in contact with the ground. Not to mention, he endlessly spawned hordes of zombies, forcing you to stay wary at all times.</p><br/><p>However, I could already easily dodge its attacks, had immense attack power, and had defensive power that mere zombies could not break through. When I obtained a certain skill on top of all that, the Giant Ghoul raid simply became too easy.</p><br/><p>It was the reward I received from solo clearing the Giant Ghoul raid.</p><br/><p>[Death Counter (passive) \u2013 You will not get intimidated against the undead. Against the undead, all attack skills become 50 percent stronger and you cannot become an undead. This skill has no skill level.]</p><br/><p>I found it quite ironic that a skill perfect for fighting against the undead only appeared after defeating the Giant Ghoul solo, but there wasn\u2019t much I could do about it.</p><br/><p>The part about not being intimidated by the undead was a strong effect. It was only after I obtained the skill that I realized my attacks were unnatural when fighting the undead compared to when I was fighting other monsters. Not only were my attacks unnatural, my defensive or evasive maneuvers all had strange, unnecessary movements mixed into them.</p><br/><p>When I asked Loretta about it, she said living beings instinctively became weaker in face of the undead, who defied death and desired the living. I felt that skills really were amazing, being able to defy something instinctive.</p><br/><p>Plus, the 50 percent attack boost when using attack skills was the main charm.</p><br/><p>\u201cGUOOOO!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll return you to hell soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>I slowly disabled the Giant Ghoul. When a target was this big, it was best to gradually make parts of its body incapable of fighting. First, I worked on the Giant Ghoul\u2019s left arm. Starting from the back of the hand to the wrist, forearm, and shoulder, I precisely pierced target locations with my spear. The Giant Ghoul then became unable to move his arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>I then continued to his left leg. It only took about 10 minutes to completely render half of his body useless. At this point, the Giant Ghoul began to look for zombies to consume in order to recover his injuries. The problem was that since he could only use half of his body, only his right hand could help him in this task. The Giant Ghoul was truly too predictable!</p><br/><p>The Giant Ghoul quickly dragged his body to where the zombies were. Before he could grab any, I shot a Tempest forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuooooo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd take this!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the Giant Ghoul missed his targets and let out an annoyed roar, I shot forward and stabbed my Black Earthen Spear into its right forearm. Then, I exploded my Spirit Aura.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>\u201cKUAAAAAA!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Giant Ghoul screamed and tried to shake me off of his right arm. Before I could fall on the ground, I pulled out my Black Earthen Spear and jumped off. I had grown too used to fighting large monsters lately. I found myself getting on and off their bodies with familiarity.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do now without your arms? Want to try using your mouth directly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKIAAAAAA!\u201d</p><br/><p>It went without saying that he tried to do exactly that. However, his target was no longer the zombies, but me. As if to devour me along with all the zombies slowly approaching me, the Giant Ghoul opened his mouth wide and shot forward. This was also the moment I was waiting for.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat this! Heroic Strike!\u201d</p><br/><p>I threw my Black Earthen Spear imbued with a generous amount of Spirit Aura. It shot forward like lightning and accurately hit the Giant Ghoul\u2019s face, piercing through his skull. The Giant Ghoul\u2019s head exploded, scattering rotten blood and other substances into the air. With his defense being so easily broken, I didn\u2019t understand all the complaining other explorers did about it having impenetrable skin.</p><br/><p>The Giant Ghoul eked out a cry with its possibly broken vocal cords as it thrashed about. His health was likely reaching its bottom. He would soon use Diehard and try to recover his health and restore his injuries.</p><br/><p>Of course, I wouldn\u2019t just sit still and let it happen! I took out my Silver Spear and aimed at his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere\u2019s another one! Divine Speed, Heroic Strike!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Silver Spear combined with Spirit Aura and let out a dazzling light. In truth, I thought that the Silver Spear looked cooler than the Black Earthen Spear. Thinking rather useless things while Divine Speed\u2019s time was ticking, I shot the Silver Spear toward the heart of the Giant Ghoul, who had just used Diehard and was in the process of recovering.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>\u201cGu\u2026ooooooooo\u2026.!\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, my attack hit its target perfectly. The Silver Spear pierced the Giant Ghoul\u2019s heart, which was strangely pumping out cold, rotten blood, and exploded it. After finding out Diehard activated using the heart as its basis, I always killed the Giant Ghoul without giving it time to complete Diehard.</p><br/><p>[You obtained 30,000 gold.]</p><br/><p>[Rewards will be distributed in order of contribution.]</p><br/><p>[Kang Shin-nim\u2019s contribution is the highest. Choose your reward.]</p><br/><p>[1. Skin Strengthening Elixir</p><br/><p>2. Giant Ghoul\u2019s Shirt]</p><br/><p>Seeing the Giant Ghoul\u2019s Shirt on the reward list, I let out a sigh of relief. When I used a Party Member Scarecrow, the dungeon didn\u2019t consider the fight as a solo raid. As such, neither the special equipment piece nor the \u2018Death Counter Magic Book\u2019 dropped. There were two normal rewards to choose from, one of which was the Giant Ghoul\u2019s Shirt I had been waiting for.</p><br/><p>In truth, I didn\u2019t know what material the Giant Ghoul Set was made out of, and I didn\u2019t want to wear them because they felt dirty. Even so, I had to equip them once to confirm the set skill. With a frown, I equipped the Giant Ghoul Set.</p><br/><p>[You equipped the Giant Ghoul Set. Your strength and dexterity increase by 12. When the Giant Ghoul Set is equipped, you can use \u2018Diehard\u2019 once per day.]</p><br/><p>As expected, Diehard was the skill I received. I quickly stored it in my pocket watch\u2019s 5 o\u2019clock position and threw off the Giant Ghoul Set. Then, I closely examined Diehard\u2019s skill description.</p><br/><p>[Diehard: usable once per day. Automatically activates when HP falls below 3 percent, restoring all injuries and filling up your HP to 50 percent of its maximum.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAma\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Amazing! This skill! What a cheat! As long as I didn\u2019t die in a single hit, I could recover up to 50 percent of my max HP even from 1 percent HP. Realizing once again that all Floor Masters\u2019 skills were cheats, I rubbed the pocket watch on my cheek. I couldn\u2019t be reckless just because I got this skill, but I could at least be more daring in the way I moved. Just that fact made this skill valuable!</p><br/><p>Just like that, I obtained the skill that would later give me the name \u2018Undying Crown Prince.\u2019</p><br/><p>[Name: Kang Shin Race: Human Sex: Male</p><br/><p>Class: Elementalist (Sub \u2013 Skill Collector) Title: Giant Ghoul Slayer Rank: Silver 7</p><br/><p>Level: 26</p><br/><p>HP \u2013 10,120/10,120 MP \u2013 6,230/6,230</p><br/><p>Strength \u2013 80(+35) Dexterity \u2013 74(+21) Constitution \u2013 78(+28)</p><br/><p>Intelligence \u2013 20(+11) Magic \u2013 79(+11) Charm \u2013 57(+11) Luck \u2013 21(+11)</p><br/><p>Normal Skill \u2013 High-rank Martial Arts (Lv 2), High-rank Spear Technique (Lv 5), Mid-rank Heroic Strike (Lv 4), Mid-rank Provoke (Lv 3), Divine Speed (Lv 3), Return (Lv 1), Low-rank Dash (Lv 9), Peruta Circuit (Lv 4), Deific Manifestation, Death Counter</p><br/><p>Class Skill \u2013 Mid-rank Spirit Mastery (Lv 1), Low-rank Spirit Aura (Lv 8), Low-rank Elemental Control (Lv 8), Low-rank Elemental Contract (Lv 8), Low-rank Elemental Tempest (Lv 9), Thunder Beast (Lv 2)</p><br/><p>Subclass Skill \u2013 Endow Skill, Spirit of the Collector]</p><br/><p>[Equipment:</p><br/><p>Power Earrings (Strength +2)</p><br/><p>Flesh Golem\u2019s Second Finger (Strength +7, Constitution +7)</p><br/><p>Lizard Knight Set (Strength +10, Dexterity +10)</p><br/><p>Arachne\u2019s Black Earthen Spear (Strength +5, Dexterity +10, Poison damage on all basic attacks, inflicts poison status effect.)]</p><br/><p>[Collector\u2019s Pocket Watch:</p><br/><p>1 o\u2019clock: Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry</p><br/><p>2 o\u2019clock: Vengeful Spirit\u2019s Wail</p><br/><p>3 o\u2019clock: Dark Thunder Explosion</p><br/><p>4 o\u2019clock: Dragon Skin</p><br/><p>5 o\u2019clock: Diehard]</p><br/><p>[2 Event Dungeon clears, 1 Event Raid clear, accumulated bonus stats: 3]</p><br/><p>[Current skill points: 10]</p><br/><p>[Six title-effects: (Orc Lord Slayer, Wraith Queen Slayer, Dark Ratman Slayer, Giant Ghoul Slayer, Lizard Knight Master, Hermes).

It was a much better skill than I expected\u2026 I\u2019m looking forward to the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, seeing you get stronger makes me all happy. Good luck going forward as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cM-Mmm, thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh\u2026? Didn\u2019t she seem closer just now? When I tilted my head and pondered, Loretta interrupted like a thunderbolt from a clear sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like we won\u2019t meet at the Floor Shop for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my resting period, one that lasts for 1 year every 100 years. I\u2019m operating countless Floor Shops with my consciousness split into puppets. I sometimes need rest too, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes. Mm, I\u2019ll miss you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You really will miss me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta suddenly put her face close to mine and blinked. Although I was a little flustered, I answered her honestly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019ve always been with Loretta. I had fun these past 5 years and even received a lot of help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you miss me that much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, of course\u2026 uuu, how embarrassing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Shin-nim\u2026 I\u2019m embarrassed too.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Loretta smiled bashfully. For an instant, I fell into a trance at her beautiful expression, and had to make an active effort to snap myself out of my daze. Then, Loretta put her hands in her shop apron pocket and took something out after rummaging through.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you say that, this here is perfect for customer!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEk! Are you selling something again in this timing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Erm, well\u2026 I-It\u2019s not being sold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta shrunk back after shouting out full of spirit. She wasn\u2019t selling it? I looked at the object in her hand. It was a light blue crystal shaped like a small key. It was a truly elaborate and beautiful key.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, you know, Shin-nim. Shin-nim will become the owner of a mansion called Marianne\u2019s Garden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I remember from last time. You said Marianne\u2019s Garden was the only Special Mansion without an owner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta nodded her head silently and seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpecial Mansions aren\u2019t something you can buy with money. They\u2019re a sort of special reward given out to explorers who made important achievements in the dungeon. When people realize Shin-nim is the owner of Marianne\u2019s Garden, all other dungeon explorers will come to look at Shin-nim with admiration. Ah, not that I think someone would go out of their way make trouble, but it\u2019s best that you don\u2019t go around telling everyone you meet that you\u2019re an owner of a Special Mansion. Claim it silently and enter it silently. The Residential Area has marketplaces and even adult entertainment districts, but residents have to use a special method to enter their houses. Unless they reveal where they live and lead others to it, no one can find out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat makes me even more curious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll receive something that looks like this key. You can use it to enter Marianne\u2019s Garden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Then what about this key?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta became silent. Her cheeks flushed red.</p><br/><p>\u201cJ-Just like its name suggests, Marianne\u2019s Garden comes with a beautiful garden. In the center of that garden, there is a spring called Fairy Spring. It\u2019s not only Marianne\u2019s Garden. Other Special Mansions also have special devices like the Fairy Spring. This key reacts to those devices and operates.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOperates?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find out when you bring this key to Fairy Spring. T-Take it as a goodbye present!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta handed the crystal key to me. As I accepted it, I tilted my head. Operates? Will a giant robot pop out from the spring or something? Or will a door to a new world open? Although I wanted to ask Loretta, it didn\u2019t look like she would answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cM-Make sure you do it. Okay, Shin-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I got it. I got it so don\u2019t look at me with those teary eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta was a bit strange today. When I looked at her, I felt stuffy and my heart pounded faster. I felt a bit hot, but I didn\u2019t think anything was different than usual. Did I catch a cold?</p><br/><p>\u201cT-Then you should head up. I also have to get ready and scrap the puppets.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. Thank you for everything until now, Loretta. I\u2019ll see you in a year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It\u2026 might not take a full year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019d be great!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I gave her my wholehearted smile, Loretta smiled wholeheartedly in return. It was a beautiful smile without a single blemish. She then said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about you buy 100 bottles of Holy Water to say goodbye? If you buy all 100 bottles now, I\u2019ll give you a one-time 15% discount! That\u2019s only 1,275 gold!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe 26th floor is undead too, huh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, I parted with Loretta. Because I felt like I lost a friend of 5 years, I felt extremely sad. Of course, at this point, I did not know where and how I would come to reunite with her.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

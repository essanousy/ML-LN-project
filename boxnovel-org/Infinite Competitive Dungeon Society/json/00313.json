Breakthrough (6)</p><br/><p>The balance of the party was perfect. I handled the firepower, while Daisy attacked me and Yua defended me. I know, this party is fundamentally wrong!</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, there won\u2019t be any strong monsters. Of the remaining regions, we picked the most dangerous places, but their bosses are SSS rank at most.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>I followed the red line on the 3D hologram map.</p><br/><p>\u201cSSS rank\u2026 That used to scare me in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband had such a time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I was born with a god\u2019s true name?\u201d</p><br/><p>I flicked one of the succubi\u2019s forehead and memorized the route on the map. As monsters were practically extinct in Asia and Oceania, we planned on cleaning up North America this time.</p><br/><p>\u201cI've always wanted to go to Greenland with Oppa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreenland sounds great. It should have the highest quantity of monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, as I had already seen endless snowy land when I was in Antarctica, Greenland\u2019s sceneries didn\u2019t give me much joy.</p><br/><p>In any case, Greenland\u2019s population was only around 60,000. There was nothing they could do against the initial monster invasion and, as a result, Greenland became an island of monsters with no humans to be seen.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes? Oh, monsters\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yua made a wry expression. She might have been excited because this was the first time she participated in a hunt. But Yua, this won\u2019t be anything like what you\u2019re thinking.</p><br/><p>Daisy also seemed to have no interest in corpses she could acquire from this trip.</p><br/><p>\u201cSSS rank, nothing special. But killing monsters is, important. So they don\u2019t cause a problem later on.\u201d</p><br/><p>The words of someone with experience was always important. Monsters had a higher chance of crossing over the dimension when there were monsters already on the other side. This property was what made this dimensional pathway so troubling. I pointed at the regions I and other Revival members had cleaned up and asked the succubi.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce we\u2019re done with North America, will we be half done?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, about so. When Event Dungeons appeared in mass last time, most of the Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean were cleaned up. But\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I knew what she wanted to say, that the monster outbreak wasn\u2019t over. If even a single Event Dungeon was left untouched, it would explode and cover the land with monsters. If all monsters of the other world planned on crossing over to this side, we couldn\u2019t relax. I had a feeling the next outbreak would occur soon, and after that event would surely be the descent of the Demon Lord\u2026</p><br/><p>With a bitter smile, I touched my forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really wish I had three bodies.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the past, I just had to take care of myself and my family. But now, I knew too well that the danger Earth was facing was a danger I had to solve, especially because I knew the truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already doing great, Dear Husband. No one else can do what you\u2019re doing. Cheer up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the succubi here had lost their home, but rather than resenting others, they placed their hopes on me and followed me. It would be wrong of me to show my weakness in front of them. I grabbed the hand of the succubus who encouraged me.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell Licorice and the other succubi that I said thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaaah, me too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too, me too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, he\u2019s already leaving!\u201d</p><br/><p>I waved my hand and bid farewell with Yua and Daisy. As the door closed, I could see the succubus I held hands with about to get lynched by the others.</p><br/><p>I then recalled something.</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t those girls just share their sense of touch\u2026!?</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, are we going right away?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I saw Mother before, so we can go.\u201d</p><br/><p>For the record, Mother finally broke through the 20th floor thanks to receiving help from others. Though she could kill a single orc by herself, I made her stop climbing the dungeon for now and made her enter the guild. Just like Father, Mother also treated the guild house as hers, but that didn\u2019t change the fact that I was the guild master. I assigned her to the same room as Father.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa\u2026 After we\u2019re done, can we spend a few hours sightseeing\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, as long as it's only for a few hours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yua clenched her fists in happiness. Seeing Yua jump around in joy, Daisy tilted her head and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s, sightseeing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s when you travel to a foreign place and see its famous monuments or sights.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Daisy nodded her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s looking at another country\u2019s culture, comparing them to our own and mocking them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should do something about your twisted way of thinking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though the last part of what she said was completely wrong, I could somewhat relate to the beginning part. If I went to a foreign country and saw the same things as if I was home, the trip would feel like a waste. What made traveling fun was seeing and experiencing new things.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce we reclaim Sylon continent, Kang Shin should come sightsee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see it while I\u2019m reclaiming it anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn. Let\u2019s see it, together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChild in my tummy will see too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that won\u2019t be happening.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaisy Unni\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yua, who was burning with her passion for sightseeing, glared at Daisy when she heard what she said, but Daisy easily pushed Yua\u2019s gaze back. As I thought, Yua can\u2019t win against Daisy!</p><br/><p>Our travel route was extremely simple. Starting from Alaska, we would receive Guardian and Freedom Wing\u2019s guide and clean up any monster we see up to our final destination which was Greenland.</p><br/><p>But before we left our guild house in Jongno, a long-haired girl wearing a black leather suit hurriedly entered the guild house. \u2026 Eh?</p><br/><p>\u201cYe-Eun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuff, huff, I\u2019m not late. Thank god\u2026 I saw the helicopter outside, so I didn\u2019t think you had left yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun caught her breath and approached us.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me join in. I want to be of help too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe already have three people going. What about the dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI broke through the 70th floor!\u201d</p><br/><p>This monster.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can take some time off now, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all too amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>We were making a trip to clean up a continent, but Yua was treating it as sightseeing, Daisy was treating it as relationship business, and Ye-Eun was treating it as something to do while resting. If Ye-Eun had broken through the 70th floor, she was on a much quicker pace than many of the others, especially considering when she first entered the dungeon. Plus, with me next to her, there shouldn\u2019t be any trouble\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, Ye-Eun. I\u2019ve been wanting to talk to you for a while. We can do that once we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun spoke with a bright smile. Daisy clicked her tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cMore hindrances\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you calling a hindrance! You\u2019re the hindrance!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour teachers are friends, so you guys try to get along too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHecate told me, watch out for Duca. Her greatest enemy. Steals all good men, and their purities.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duca? Well, I guess Hecate would know more about her than me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t argue with that, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuu, my cozy trip with Oppa is being ruined\u2026 No, four people are better than the usual anyway\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yua murmured to herself with a frown. Afterward, we got on the helicopter, which would fly us straight to the airport.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, by the way, Shin. Ciara told me to tell you something. She wanted to tell you by telepathy, but she couldn\u2019t because of your magic resistance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCiara did?\u201d</p><br/><p>I left Ciara to Hwaya after the last time I talked to her, so when did Ye-Eun get that close with Ciara? Seeing me tilt my head, Ye-Eun spoke with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cLast month, we formed a second alliance as a sign of letting bygones be bygones.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a secret. Ehehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 That alliance, can you let me in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not Daisy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what did Ciara want to tell me? Just that she couldn\u2019t send me telepathies?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun spoke while she continued to be on guard against Daisy.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe said there might be an enemy stronger than the last time. She said she\u2019s not sure, but told us to be prepared for anything that might happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe apparently foresaw it this afternoon. When I told her I was going to follow you, she told me to pass on the message.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Ye-Eun clapped her hands and added.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, she said it\u2019ll be the demons\u2026 But what does this all mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know for now. I\u2019ll tell you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>My head suddenly began to throb. It felt like this happened every time I went out. Was I just picking places that are likely to cause trouble? After thinking for a little while, I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are no survivors in Alaska, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Oppa. Alaska has been completely taken over by monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yua immediately answered. I checked the map again.</p><br/><p>It shouldn\u2019t be the middle of America, right? Places with nothing but monsters. The most probable place had to be Alaska or Greenland.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Should I go alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTogether.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me go, too! I told you, I won\u2019t get in the way!\u201d</p><br/><p>To be honest, I wasn\u2019t worried about Daisy or Ye-Eun. I didn\u2019t need to say much about Daisy, and Ye-Eun could always summon Duca and run.</p><br/><p>The person I was worried about seemed to know it too.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it dangerous to the point I\u2019ll cause trouble for Oppa?\u201d</p><br/><p>Right, the problem was Yua. Her mantis army was powerful. With them around, she could take care of most monsters. But her army was useless in front of a single enemy with absolute power.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Oppa. I have Luna.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLuna?\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at the yawning baby dragon in Yua\u2019s arms. Realizing that I was looking at her, Luna looked back at me with clear eyes. Cute.</p><br/><p>\u201cLuna is really strong. She has abilities even I don\u2019t know about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>I tilted my head and checked Luna\u2019s mana. Indeed, she had an unbelievable amount of mana within her. How so much mana could fit in her tiny body was a true mystery.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason I\u2019m going with Oppa is more for Luna than the mantises. Luna eats a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I reached my hand towards Luna\u2019s head. The singular horn on Luna\u2019s head was small, yet tough and sharp. When I touched it, Luna flinched, but she stayed still realizing that I meant no harm. After petting her for a while, I took my hand off. Luna cried quietly and rubbed her face against my hand. Yua smiled sweetly and whispered to Luna.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Luna, it\u2019s Daddy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Yua is good at making jokes.\u201d</p><br/><p>With those words, I stroked Luna again. Good, I made my decision.</p><br/><p>Two hours later, the four of us arrived in Alaska.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Draconian Lin (2)</p><br/><p>When someone heard the word \u2018undead,\u2019 what were the monsters people would usually think of? Right, first were the zombies. The wraiths that appeared on the dungeon\u2019s 6th floor also counted as undead.</p><br/><p>The ones people would think of second were of course\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHuman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuman with juicy ribs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSplint bone is mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScrew off, I can\u2019t even make beef bone soup with you guys!\u201d</p><br/><p>Skeletons. They were undead creatures without a single bit of flesh and were made of white or black bones.</p><br/><p>[Lightning doesn\u2019t work well on bones, Master\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sad, Peika. We just have to thoroughly crush them to make up for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Using my spear like a club, I shattered the incoming skeletons. They were much tougher and had much stronger attacks compared to the zombies or the ghouls. Even so, they were much weaker than me. Their attacks were only strong to the point that they could scratch my armor if I just let them freely attack. In other words, they could just barely break through my defense to deal a tiny bit of damage. Of course, they were embarrassingly weak.</p><br/><p>However, their defensive power was quite good, and they were more troublesome than zombies or ghouls in terms of their regenerative powers. If I broke them without pouring mana into my spear, they regenerated, so I had to go through the trouble of destroying them with my spear imbued with a mix of lightning elemental power and mana.</p><br/><p>Although they didn\u2019t smell as bad without rotting flesh, they were still extremely dirty and annoying to deal with. Just the way they moved irked me. For mere skeletons, they moved with dance steps as they tried to attack me with their swords. It really wanted to make me crush them.</p><br/><p>Plus, these guys loved bones too much!</p><br/><p>\u201cHis skull looks good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like his third cervical vertebrae.\u201d</p><br/><p>Every time they saw me, they charged towards me as they complimented my bone structure. I wondered if this floor was designed to irritate me. Perhaps it was a common feature of undead-type monsters, but their attainment in martial arts was pitifully low. I simply put one spear in each hand and flowed Spirit Aura into them to use them as electric beating clubs. Just like that, I crushed the skeletons\u2019 skulls as I made my way forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cT-The bones I spent my entire life polishing up\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe breaks skulls\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cS-Skull Breaker!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRun away, it\u2019s the Skull Breaker!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut it!\u201d</p><br/><p>These guys! For monsters without brains, they sure were smarter than the zombies! I should\u2019ve known when they said something like third cervical vertebrae!</p><br/><p>[Thunder Bomb!]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Skull Breaker!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Skull Breaker is coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re calling me Skull Breaker no matter where I attack you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They called me Skull Breaker when I broke their ribs. They called me Skull Breaker when I crushed their arms. I didn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t just charge forward like I did in the 21st floor. Thus, I took a fast-walking pace, swinging my two spears and shooting out Thunder Bombs until I reached the 26th floor. The time it took to accomplish that was about 7 hours. After confirming that my level had gone up to level 27 and confirming that there were no more skeletons nearby, I put away the spears and sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, I\u2019m he\u2026 Ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the 26th Floor Shop, I couldn\u2019t find Loretta. Instead, there was a young man resting his chin on the shop desk as he smoked a cigarette. Discovering me, he looked around and muttered as he chewed on his cigarette.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? \u2026 Oh, right. It was from today. Welcome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, are you Loretta\u2019s replacement?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, you really do look like noonim\u2019s[1. Noonim is a more formal version of noona.] taste... What, a Hero? Noonim\u2019s quite skilled.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man glanced over me with sparkling crimson eyes. Although he sounded mumbly as he was still chewing on his cigarette, his voice was still extremely pleasant to listen to. He had snow-white skin and was pretty enough to be mistaken for a girl. However, there was something else that caught my attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 on your head\u2026 there are horns.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYea, I\u2019m a Draconian.\u201d</p><br/><p>After answering me casually, he puffed out the cigarette smoke. Then, he put the cigarette back in his mouth. Don\u2019t tell me he thought that was enough of an explanation? Dumbfounded, I stared at him smoking his cigarette.</p><br/><p>His hair was black just like mine. However, his hair was extremely long, which was tied at the top of his head in a ponytail. On each of his temples, a curly silver horn was protruding out, forming a symmetry. Finally, his eyes were a bit dirty.</p><br/><p>He had a black garment draped over his body, which didn\u2019t seem to have any muscles. I then noticed the area behind his butt, where a scaled tail dozens of times larger than a lizard\u2019s tail swayed gently. It was then that I remembered something.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, are you perhaps a beastman?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeastman? Mmm\u2026 no. Beastmen are beings blessed by God to take animals\u2019 traits. On the other hand, Draconians get their traits from their draconic bloodline.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDragons?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s all you need to know. It\u2019s nothing important.\u201d</p><br/><p>He seemed too lazy to explain further as he waved the smoke away with his hands. Although there was a mountain load of questions I wanted to ask, I decided to just let it go. However, he seemed to have his own questions. After finishing his cigarette, he glanced at me and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re Kang Shin, right? Earth\u2019s Hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really like being called Hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Mm, then just Kang Shin. Know this. Noonim pestered me quite a bit to take good care of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe pestered you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta noonim was in charge of almost 4,000 explorers. Don\u2019t think my real body will be at all those places.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so you aren\u2019t a puppet, but the real one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, she even told you about the puppets? \u2026She fell deep, that person.\u201d</p><br/><p>What did he mean Loretta fell deep? This new Floor Shop owner was unfriendly and liked to talk to himself. When I was already starting to miss Loretta, he blurted out as if he had just remembered something.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin. You can call me Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, Lin. Take good care of me for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, yeah. I\u2019m curious as to how many floors you can climb during this one year. According to noonim, you\u2019re a real one that hasn\u2019t been seen for a while. I can expect at least five floors, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>He glanced over me with narrow eyes as he spoke arrogantly. Oh, you\u2019re provoking me? I, Kang Shin, manliest of men, will take on that challenge.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin, do you like betting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKukuku, I love it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin and I exchanged smiles. As expected of Loretta\u2019s replacement. He was walking the same path Loretta once walked! I had to rein in my laughter from bursting out. Lin, on the other hand, was looking at me like I was a na\u00efve child. I was already looking forward to the day his expression would change.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, let\u2019s decide on our bet. There\u2019s what noonim said, so I doubt you won\u2019t make it to the 30th floor in 1 year. Right, if you defeat the 35th Floor Master by yourself within one year, I will make a gauntlet suitable for you. If you even defeat the 40th Floor Master by yourself within one year, I will make you a weapon that contains my essence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin, you\u2019re a blacksmith?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep. I\u2019m the Red Dragon\u2019s descendent, so I have close affinity to fire. In any case, if you can\u2019t break through the 35th floor within one year, I will take the pocket watch back from you. Along with your subclass of course. I\u2019ll also take away the pocket watch if you party with other people to clear the 35th Floor Master, though, I doubt you have many skills in there anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>I already had five. Not that I\u2019d tell him, of course.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it possible to take away someone\u2019s class?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have said it otherwise. Though, not anyone can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, it was a scary penalty. The pocket watch was a treasure that made up quite a bit of my overall strength. That said, this person was too soft. Did he think I couldn\u2019t climb 14 floors in one year? I asked with a bashful smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, what if I break through the 40th floor even earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Earlier than 1 year? Puhat.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Draconian snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no record of such a thing happening. Don\u2019t look down on the 40th Floor Master. He forced countless First Dungeon challengers to their knees. The legend says that he\u2019s even stronger than the 45th Floor Master. You think you can reach the 40th floor and defeat him within one year? Don\u2019t kid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut a man should dream big. If there\u2019s a bigger reward, wouldn\u2019t I be more motivated to try?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You aren\u2019t wrong. Right, explorers these days really lack that sort of attitude. Hmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin started a second cigarette. He didn\u2019t take out a lighter, but the cigarette was set on fire on its own. It seemed the power of the Red Dragon was used to set cigarettes on fire. While I nodded my head in appreciation of gaining new knowledge, Lin murmured with the cigarette in his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you can do it within 9 months, I\u2019ll make you a helmet along with the weapon. If you do it within 8 months, I\u2019ll add in the gauntlet. 7 months, I\u2019ll add in boots.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I already have boots to wear though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you manage to succeed, you can give me your boots. I\u2019ll do some work on them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, got it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFinally, though I think it\u2019s completely impossible, if you succeed within 6 months\u2026 ha, I can\u2019t even say it with a straight face. Anyways, if you succeed in breaking through the 40th floor within 6 months, I\u2019ll make you a full plate armor set. Along with a weapon, of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, you really are generous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPuhahahaha! Climbing 14 floors in half a year, I think you\u2019re a lot more generous than I am! Ku, kukukuk! I know you\u2019re a Hero, but your liver is so big that it\u2019s hanging outside your belly[1. Korean proverb meaning you\u2019ve got a lot of nerve.]! Agh, my sides! I understand a little bit why Loretta noonim likes you so much!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEk, but I\u2019m into women\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m into women too, you bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because he suddenly emphasized his words with sharp eyes, I flinched a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, do your best, Kang Shin. Don\u2019t give up in the middle. I hate people that give up the most.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a coincidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>After getting ample rest, I stretched and loosened my body. Holding up my Black Earthen Spear, I shouted at Lin as I took a step on the stair to the 27th floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hate giving up the most too.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

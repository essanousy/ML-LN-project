I Can Hear Your Voice (3)</p><br/><p>If I involved myself with her, others might find out that I\u2019m an ability user. Even worse, the fact that I\u2019m a dungeon explorer might be revealed. Mm, I still couldn\u2019t believe that I told Su Ye-Eun that I was a dungeon explorer. What was I thinking? I could only hope that she wouldn\u2019t sell out someone who saved her life.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin. Kang Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, hi.\u201d</p><br/><p>I tried to turn away again, but this time, she held onto my arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, stop!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you avoiding me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPut your hand on your chest and ask yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Pervert.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I hit you just once?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Ye-Eun let go of my arm then asked in an even quieter voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to know what your ability is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to know yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Do you hate me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bother.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, she didn\u2019t grab onto my arm. I wondered if I was too harsh, but soon told myself I wasn\u2019t. It was because Su Ye-Eun was still following me.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you picking a fight?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t go to the opening party because of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any friends to talk to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Was I wrong to sympathize with her? No, I wasn\u2019t! We were both innocent! I suddenly felt my hostility dwindling and I let her sit in an open seat next to me. She seemed surprised at this unexpected action as she opened her eyes wide under her hoody and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hmph, it\u2019s not like I did it for you. I just didn\u2019t want to talk more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, maybe that wasn\u2019t the right response. I regretted inwardly. What I knew for sure was that I couldn\u2019t fully shake myself loose of her, and that she became my first friend at college. Haa, life really didn\u2019t turn out as one expected.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>I had a dream. I was shouting, but I couldn\u2019t hear myself in the noisy background.</p><br/><p>The sky was dark and full of storm clouds. Crimson devils filled the earth and the sky, and only she was by my side. There were comrades nearby that weren\u2019t human, but she was the only human.</p><br/><p>[If I told you that I love you, what would you say?]</p><br/><p>I stopped my shouting and looked at her unbelievably beautiful face.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019d say that I hate you. Because I do.]</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Nothing ever goes my way with you, huh?]</p><br/><p>I looked lovingly at her blazing eyes. Before she obtained her ability, she set herself ablaze. After she obtained her ability, she set everything apart from her ablaze.</p><br/><p>I held in my desire to embrace her and said,</p><br/><p>[This isn\u2019t the end. The end won\u2019t come. Ever.]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m surprised you can say that in this situation.]</p><br/><p>[We\u2019re going to survive, XX\u2026 until the end, together.]</p><br/><p>[And if we do?]</p><br/><p>[Then I\u2019ll tell you I love you.]</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Stupid Orc, acting superior.]</p><br/><p>[XX said that! XX said that! Grr!]</p><br/><p>I opened my eyes. It was the worst wake up I\u2019ve ever head.</p><br/><p>\u201cH\u2026 Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>My head hurt and so did my eyes. My throat was parched. Did I dream? No, I couldn\u2019t remember anything. I felt like I saw a dark sky but my head hurt when I tried to remember it. I gave up and opened the windows, letting the autumn wind tickle my hair.</p><br/><p>[Good morning~]</p><br/><p>[I came all the way from West Sea~]</p><br/><p>[Ah, the smell of the sea!]</p><br/><p>I shook my head to shake the sleepiness off. It seemed fatigue had built up from staying in the dungeon for too long. Plus, I had to go to school now too. Two weeks had passed since school started, which was enough to take its toll on me.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s not overdo it,\u2019 I murmured to myself. Immediately after, I was preparing to fight the Dark Ratman three times in the morning. My classes were in the afternoon.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>[Palludia contacted me recently.]</p><br/><p>\u201cTo meet on the 25th floor?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yup. As I thought, it\u2019s because of you.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean it\u2019s because of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Haha, Shin, you aren\u2019t good with women, are you?]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, and you are?\u201d</p><br/><p>[At least more than you, friend. I have a fianc\u00e9e after all.]</p><br/><p>\u201cFianc\u00e9e!?\u201d</p><br/><p>It surprised me. Ellos sounded content as he chuckled.</p><br/><p>[Mm, yes. Well, you better hurry, friend. There\u2019s only a month left until the promised day.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll try. What floor are you on now?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m on the 24th floor. Since I\u2019m near the end, I should be able to reach the 25th floor in time.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then see you on the 25th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes, see you there.]</p><br/><p>I finished my conversation with Ellos and thought back to the boss fight I just had. It was overall a success. There were three people including me and we all survived without a hitch.</p><br/><p>However, I could not see the path ahead. I did not have the confidence to take on so many ratmen along with the Dark Ratman. I had the key to the solution, but using it would decrease my attack and defense significantly\u2026</p><br/><p>When I noticed the stinging gaze and turned to face it, I found Loretta staring at me intently.</p><br/><p>\u201cWah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCustomer, why do you always leave me standing here like a fool while you exchange messages with others? Are you mistaking the Floor Shops as rest stops?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t? There are lots of foods to eat and a beautiful server as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t fall for any lip service. Not to mention, I\u2019m not fazed by such an obvious truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen give me a 5 gold fruit juice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, customer!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta really was simple-minded. I took the fruit juice from Loretta (it had an effect of quickly relieving fatigue), and asked her a question that suddenly popped up in my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, you\u2019re always at the Floor Shop whenever I come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Isn\u2019t it the duty of a shopkeeper to meet her customer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do you do when I\u2019m not here?\u201d</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve been meaning to ask it for a while. She was there on every Floor Shop I went to. I was curious what she did when I wasn\u2019t here. Loretta answered with a chortle.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy, customer, are you hitting on me? Not yet, it\u2019s too early for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOw ow ow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta approached me without any change in her expression and pinched my cheeks without mercy. It hurt extremely.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t tease girls like that, customer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? When did I\u2026 Sorry, spare me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Loretta bring out a double-sided axe from the back of the shop, I acquiesced. Loretta returned the axe with a humph.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was the question? What I usually do? That will be 500 gold, customer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou cheapskate! I won\u2019t ask!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, girls have many secrets, customer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA secret worth as little as 500 gold?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no fun. How will you get along with your girlfriend like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, she\u2019s not my girlfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta remained silent at my tiresome reply, and only when I was about finished with my juice did she speak out of the blue.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m not a human, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI expected as much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am a member of a race well known for our aptitude for magic. I won\u2019t tell you what race it is until later, though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMagic?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Did you think you were my only customer in this dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Eh? You mean you trade with other dungeon explorers as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta lightly nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the power of magic and also the power of the dungeon. I can take pieces of my consciousness and put them in puppets, thus spreading my consciousness to countless places in the dungeon. Although I don\u2019t trade with all dungeon explorers, I do trade with about 10 percent of the First Dungeon explorers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUk, that sounds exhausting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, are you worrying about me? Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m also resting in my house located somewhere in the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good then.\u201d</p><br/><p>In other words, the Loretta I was talking with was a puppet. I was truly surprised. It was something I had never considered. After all, her skin was just like a person\u2019s, her eyes were also\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to try touching me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, I\u2019m scary, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScary? What is?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I asked with a look of confusion, Loretta naturally answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not normal. Being able to split one\u2019s consciousness and control puppets. Even dungeon explorers can\u2019t help but be shocked when they hear it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s certainly shocking, but I don\u2019t see why it would be scary?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Are you not scared of me, customer? I hate to be the one to say it, but I\u2019m an amazing magician, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe moment I saw you sitting in the Floor Shop of this mysterious dungeon, I knew you were someone amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one in front of you is nothing but a puppet controlled by a piece of consciousness. Doesn\u2019t it disgust you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Disgust? I took the time to think about it. What was in front of me was a puppet with Loretta\u2019s consciousness. It was seemingly no different than a real person. Through this puppet, Loretta cried, laughed, and got angry.</p><br/><p>\u2026 What disgust?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m supposed to be disgusted by\u2026 Loretta is Loretta. Just because you are in a different form, doesn\u2019t change the fact that you are Loretta. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, um\u2026 mm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta suddenly stuttered. Her cheeks were slightly red.</p><br/><p>\u201cUuu. Certainly, this is how I hoped you would react, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes? What did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing! You can go now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm? No, why so suddenly? Okay, I\u2019ll leave, stop pushing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta screamed and tried to chase me out. She was now red as a tomato.</p><br/><p>Hm. Did I just make Loretta mad? What did I do wrong? I wasn\u2019t sure exactly what I did wrong, I told myself to apologize to her the next time I saw her. Then, I got out of the dungeon. It was now time to go to school.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

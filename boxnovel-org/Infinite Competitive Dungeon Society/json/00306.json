Lilith (6)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>\u201cPeika!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Nom, nom.]</p><br/><p>\u201cNom, nom!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The light filling up the palace disappeared completely. Something exploded in Peika\u2019s mouth, and crimson blood dripped down from Peika\u2019s mouth. Flustered, I stared blankly at Peika. Meanwhile, the palace changed significantly. Lilith\u2019s mana that dominated the area lost power completely, and though not perfect, it was Peika who was taking in that mana.</p><br/><p>[Gulp.]</p><br/><p>\u201cGulp!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Peika swallowed what was in her mouth. Immediately, Peika\u2019s body grew longer, her scales became more luscious, and another horn shot up from her head. It seemed eating Lilith helped her growth immensely.</p><br/><p>\u201cPEika, are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Un. She was almost dead from Master anyways.]</p><br/><p>Peika spun in the air in response as she approached me. From that, I realized that Lilith hadn\u2019t recovered from her injuries and that she was just tricking me. Still, to think she could hide her injuries so well\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did she do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m surprised she could trick Master, but it\u2019s useless against this Peika-nim! I\u2019ll protect Master from strange women like her, huhu!]</p><br/><p>Peika must have forgot what form she was in, as she boasted and laughed. But it was true that I could defeat Lilith thanks to Peika, so I thanked her as I patted her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou made this an easy win. Thanks, Peika.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Huhu, I should say the same. Thanks to that woman, I feel like I\u2019ll get back my real body soon!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean your final seal?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes, Master.]</p><br/><p>Peika grinned. The flesh and blood covering her teeth made me freeze. Lilith, who had given me so much trouble, had such a pitiful end.</p><br/><p>Without Peika, she would have driven me to a corner. She still had that much magic power left, and her charm was truly terrifying to the point of affecting the world\u2019s laws. However, Peika ignored all of that.</p><br/><p>Peika\u2019s ability surpassed my imagination. Even with Absolute Soul and Peruta Circuit, I couldn\u2019t see through Lilith\u2019s trick, but Peika did so easily and even ate her. Was it because Peika was an elemental? Was it because she was female? Perhaps it was both or perhaps it was neither.</p><br/><p>But one thing I was sure about was that there was something special about Peika, something more special than Dortu who was already so extraordinary.</p><br/><p>I knew I would find out eventually. When her final seal came undone and when her real self was revealed. With a furtive smile, I asked Peika.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to try eating other monsters?\u201d</p><br/><p>[No! Eating random monsters will make me sick!]</p><br/><p>Peika grumbled like a picky eater, and immediately afterwards, a fanfare rang out.</p><br/><p>[You succeeded in defeating Lilith alone. Like with Crimson Hell, you defeated a world\u2019s enemy no explorer has ever defeated nor has ever seen. Until the day the dungeon disappeared, your achievement will be honored among explorers. There will be no dungeon explorer who will dare to go against you. You obtained 5 skill points as reward. Current skill points: 34]</p><br/><p>[You obtained the title, \u2018Lilith Killer.\u2019 All stats increase by 5. The effect of the title will apply even when it is not equipped.]</p><br/><p>[You cleared Beyond\u2019s 35th floor. You obtained the qualification to challenge the First Dungeon\u2019s 86th floor.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained 5 bonus points. Your maximum HP and MP increases by 2%.]</p><br/><p>[Experience has been added to skills you frequently used to progress through Beyond\u2019s 35th floor.]</p><br/><p>[You received the unique reward left hidden for the First explorer. Congratulations! Your luck stat increases by 10.][Secret. Lilith\u2019s Horn.]</p><br/><p>Horn? But Lilith didn\u2019t have a horn?</p><br/><p>[Of Lilith\u2019s body parts, her horn contains the biggest amount of her power. The dungeon has kept the horn cut off by the Hero.]</p><br/><p>I needed a long time until I could fully understand what this meant. When I finally came to the simple answer, I couldn\u2019t help but drop my jaws in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cLilith\u2019s power was already limited\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>And she still had that much charm? This seemed like a bad joke. Among all the worlds\u2019 enemies I\u2019ve met, she had the most terrifying special ability. I inwardly thanks Peika one more time.</p><br/><p>If I faced her with other members of Revival, I would have had a harder time, as Lilith would surely have turned them against me.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, so depending on the enemy\u2019s special ability, it\u2019s sometimes better to have just a few people or even just me. Huu\u2026 At least it\u2019s all over now.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Good job, Master!]</p><br/><p>[Congratulations, Master.]</p><br/><p>After the fanfare confirming the end of the battle rang out, Peika and Sharana had returned to their elemental form. I wasn\u2019t one percent sure, but Peika looked a bit different even in her elemental form\u2026 Right, it was almost as if a young girl had become an adult.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, if it\u2019s important, I\u2019m sure Peika will tell me.\u2019</p><br/><p>I chose to remain silent.</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. That was an unpleasant woman. She made Dortu fell unpleasant.]</p><br/><p>On the other hand, I could tell from Dortu\u2019s voice that he was vexed. Since he didn\u2019t have a materialized form, I couldn\u2019t pat him to console him. I could only do so with words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still did well, Dortu. It was just that her ability was weird. From now on, we won\u2019t be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 Mm, I guess I can\u2019t be certain. Among the countless worlds, who was to say there wasn\u2019t someone with the same ability as Lilith?</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now on, we\u2019ll get stronger so we can better deal with an ability like that in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. Master is cold.]</p><br/><p>Hearing Dortu\u2019s dejected voice, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><br/><p>In any case, the battle was now over. Although Crimson Hell and Lilith had their powers suppressed by the dungeon, I succeeded in defeating two worlds\u2019 enemies. With how strong they were, I certainly had many benefits.</p><br/><p>Especially in my fight with Lilith, I clearly remembered compressing over 100,000 points worth of mana in my spear. Generally, one\u2019s aura became more visible as it got stronger. At that moment, however, my aura had become unrecognizable my others.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure this can\u2019t be done by just anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lilith\u2019s shocked reaction said everything. It wasn\u2019t a skill, and I concentrating mana was all I had done.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika, is it hard to concentrate mana into one point?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Master, do you think you can turn inanimate objects to metal after watching Dortu do it?]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>[But Dortu can do it like it\u2019s the most natural thing.]</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. She is right. Dortu can turn all inanimate objects to metal.]</p><br/><p>Peika affirmed Peika immediately. Hearing her, I became speechless. There was no way I could figure out how Dortu turned things into metal.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that the same thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Let me say it more clearly, Master.]</p><br/><p>Peika folded her fan and pointed it at my face.</p><br/><p>[Concentrating a power into one point is impossibly difficult, especially if that power is mana.]</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though it\u2019s so easy?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ask another explorer to do the same.]</p><br/><p>With that, Peika didn\u2019t speak further. Thinking about her words, I fell into silence. Mm\u2026 No\u2026 But\u2026 In that case\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 So that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t remember exactly when, but when I was young, I saw Father thrusting his spear. We had both trained using our ancestors\u2019 training method and learned how to thrust with the power of the entire body concentrated into one point. At the time, I felt that Father\u2019s thrust was different than mine. Because Father was so strong, I believed his was a more perfect version. But now, that might not have been true.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>I murmured quietly. Everything made sense now. The first time I manifested the power of the Hero, it was none other than when I concentrated my body\u2019s power into one point and shot it out, the moment I learned Heroic Strike. A power that was mine, a power that I was born with. Too strange to be called a power. Formless, yet definite.</p><br/><p>Talent.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the same tone, I murmured the same thing as if to engrave the words in my heart.</p><br/><p>I closed my eyes and opened them back up. Nothing had changed, yet everything had changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI found the path.\u201d</p><br/><p>The attack I once made in front of Sumire. I wasn\u2019t using any mana, but I believed Peruta Circuit\u2019s was naturally reacting in its own way.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t it. That was the most powerful power I could show. Though it wasn\u2019t perfected, it was an attack made by concentrating all the power I could muster. An attack I made subconsciously at a time when I didn\u2019t fully understand the power I had, an attack that was the result of luck.</p><br/><p>If I could fully comprehend each particle of my mana, each fiber of my muscles and each drop of my blood, and if I could condense and compress them all into one point\u2026 I could go further. When that time came, I would have nothing to fear.</p><br/><p>I had finally figured it out. I always had the answer, but I had only now noticed it.</p><br/><p>[Master is so cool\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>I smiled and calmed my internal energy. I knew it couldn\u2019t be in just one or two days. But now that I knew what to do, I knew it was only a matter of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, let\u2019s obtain a new power.\u201d</p><br/><p>You\u2019ve waited a long time! I reached my hand out towards the reward, Lilith\u2019s Horn.</p><br/><p>What came out in my hand was a reddish-black horn that strutted up proudly. Its explanation was also extremely simple.</p><br/><p>[Lilith\u2019s Horn (Legend)Option \u2013 If you make a weapon using this horn, the enemy you cut with the weapon will have a random chance of becoming charmed. With a low chance, you can turn the enemy into your loyal subordinate. If you make an accessory with this horn, your charm will increase significantly, and you will be able to use a portion of Lilith\u2019s power as a skill. The horn is too dangerous to use without refining it.]</p><br/><p>It seemed Sherafina was worried that I would put the horn on my head. With how kindly she explained the horn\u2019s use, if I was still a Gold ranked explorer, I might have really refined the horn into a weapon or an accessory.</p><br/><p>But there was no way I would do so now. Without a shred of hesitation, I tightened my grip on the horn and roused Peruta Circuit. A boundless mana was contained within the horn. What I assumed to be Lilith\u2019s unique charming energy began to pulsate. I didn\u2019t plan to go easy on it. Immediately and mercilessly, I began to pull it towards me.</p><br/><p>From the top, the horn began to turn to dust. Flowing into me, the horn\u2019s energy seeped into me completely. With a thump, my heart made a beat, and the energy instantly began flowing through my veins.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuuuu\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>It felt like my blood was boiling. Though defeated, Lilith was still a world\u2019s enemy. As her power was more special than Crimson Hell\u2019s power, there was more resistance than when I absorbed Crimson Hell\u2019s power. Still, it was a power I had felt before! I drew Peruta Circuit and Absolute Soul to the peak. If needed, I was ready to infuse Peika into my body.</p><br/><p>However, that wasn\u2019t needed. Though I only had a few seconds of it left, I was still under the effect of Overlord. Within me, Enigma helped suppress Lilith\u2019s power. Lilith\u2019s power slowly bowed its once highly held head and began to fuse with my blood, mana, and body.</p><br/><p>Before I noticed, Overlord had ended and Enigma disappeared, yet the process was continuing. It took a long time. A really long time. Really, this energy was too great!</p><br/><p>\u201cHu, Huu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Some time later, I slowly opened my eyes. Unlike previously when I learned of my talent, this time, everything had really changed.</p><br/><p>With a slightly stiff voice, I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s a horn, Master.]</p><br/><p>Peika answered in a lovable voice. So that\u2019s what it was. I nodded and stroked my left forehead.</p><br/><p>On one side of my forehead was a sharp, dark-red horn that anyone could see with a single glance.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Granting Freedom (5)</p><br/><p>Walker carried out his mission swiftly and precisely. Although he looked pathetic when I was beating him up, his stealth ability was truly good enough to trick an SS ranker. In just two days, he brought us all of the data Brightman had on Hwaya.</p><br/><p>\u201cI destroyed or burned everything that I couldn\u2019t bring. There isn\u2019t even a single word or photo left of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker assured us. Since neither the contract nor his personality made it likely that he\u2019d lie, Hwaya quickly burned everything in front of her and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut he will definitely find out I was the one who did it. Simply put, I just burned the bridge connecting us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, Walker. You can now stay in the dungeon until I\u2019m done with my business here. You can come with me when I go back to Korea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Even if I use my stealth ability, Brightman will find out if I leave the country with you. He\u2019s watching you closely. You already know, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be any problem\u2026 Don\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t want him to discover my identity either. He doesn\u2019t know how I came here, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one here knew you were coming until you arrived at Windermere. Mastiford was thorough in hiding her tracks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, it wasn\u2019t much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya was wearing a proud smile. Of course, as Hwaya was an SS ranker, it wasn\u2019t weird that she had allies that could hide from Brightman.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine then. When I go back, I\u2019ll be using my own method. You can come with me then, Walker.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour method, huh\u2026? You must have a special skill.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep, exactly. So you can just focus on the dungeon before then\u2026 Ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>I almost forgot.</p><br/><p>\u201cWalker, here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2026 This is Serina\u2019s Guardian Bracelet!\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker grabbed the bracelet I held out and his eyes opened wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, it\u2019s a bit different. Lin said he added something to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut how\u2026? Didn\u2019t you shatter and burn it!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, yeah, but it seems the important parts were fine. It\u2019s a reward for doing your job well and for all the work you\u2019ll do in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>In truth, I took the remains of the broken bracelet to Lin at Fairy Garden, thinking maybe he could make a new item. As the important parts of it were still okay, a new bracelet was made using First Dungeon\u2019s monster drop items. The resulting guardian bracelet was even better than the old one, but unfortunately, it was still bound to Walker. Although I thought about breaking it again, since he would be in charge of protecting my sister, I decided to give it back to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cKu\u2026 I thought I\u2019d never see it again\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker looked touched as he rubbed the guardian bracelet on his cheek. I tried my best to ignore the rather disgusting scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re the one who broke it in the first place, I won\u2019t thank you. But I can promise I will do my utmost to fulfill the contents of the contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although we wouldn\u2019t ever come to like each other, Walker\u2019s hostility toward Hwaya and me seemed to have lessened now that he got his bracelet back. After equipping the guardian bracelet, he went back to the dungeon. According to him, he was on the 44th floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, Shin, what dungeon are you from? You said you weren\u2019t Gold ranked yet, right? But since you overwhelmed Walker like that, are you perhaps also in the Second Dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya asked casually. I also responded casually.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the First Dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, why are you in the First!? Even I\u2019m in the Second!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yep, I knew she\u2019d get angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy father is a First Dungeon explorer. Since he appointed me as an explorer, I\u2019d naturally be in the First Dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuk, t-that means your friend is also in the First Dungeon\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuguu! But I\u2019m stronger! I want to be in the First Dungeon too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 You should give up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t! I\u2019ll become Platinum ranked and go to the First Dungeon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>I raised my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? You\u2019ll become Platinum ranked and go to the First Dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know? The way to go to a higher ranked Dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve heard about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I wore a dumbfounded look, Hwaya began to explain.</p><br/><p>\u201cI only found out after I broke through the 65th floor. In the Second Dungeon, you\u2019ll become a Platinum ranked explorer after the 80th floor, and if you complete a certain achievement on top of that, you can become a First Dungeon explorer with your level adjusted!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the achievement?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at her like she was an idiot. She seemed to have noticed what I was thinking, as she pinched my arm, then writhed in pain with her hurt fingers. However, she soon continued triumphantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you know, if it\u2019s an achievement, it\u2019s probably something like that. I already have one. Huhu, burning over half the monster in the dungeon floor at the same time! I even got a title, \u2018Incarnation of Agni.\u2019 Amazing, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAgni. The god of fire from Hindu mythology. T-That\u2019s amazing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t bring myself to tell her that I had a god\u2019s true name.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you get an achievement yet? Ah, it\u2019s fine even if you haven\u2019t. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m too amazing. I think you\u2019re skilled too. Plus, you\u2019ll continue to get stronger, so you\u2019ll have lots of chances to obtain an achievement.\u201d</p><br/><p>I completely ignored her consoling words and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya, I don\u2019t know what achievement you have to make to become a First Dungeon explorer, but I\u2019ll tell you the achievements I\u2019ve made so far, so you can refer to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAchievements, plural!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, breaking through four floors in 7 hours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Are you human?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond, challenging a Floor Master alone on your first try and defeating him. The achievement is better if you\u2019re the first one in the Second Dungeon\u2019s history to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you aren\u2019t the first, defeating a Floor Master alone still counts as an achievement, and beating an Event Raid with few participants also counts as an achievement. But they aren\u2019t anything big, so I doubt those will be it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cObtaining a god\u2019s true name can be a great achievement. Since you already have Incarnation of Agni, you might be able to obtain Agni\u2019s true name if you try harder. Like if you could burn all the monsters in a dungeon floor at the same time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Huu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya, who was listening to me silently, became dispirited. Then, she blurted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m jealous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are honest\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuu, I hate it. I hate myself and I hate you. Why am I jealous of you\u2026? Our dungeons are different and our battle styles are different\u2026 but still\u2026 I\u2019m jealous!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Hwaya play with her hair, not knowing what to do, I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, are you just going to stay jealous?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not! God\u2019s true name, right? Defeating a Floor Master alone? Uuu, just you watch! I\u2019ll achieve them and become a First Dungeon explorer. Prepare yourself. Now will be the only time you can talk so arrogantly! Got it, Kang Shin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ooh, she\u2019s fired up! I answered her enthusiastic words with a smile. I really liked people that weren\u2019t overconfident. I liked hard-working people even more.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood luck, I\u2019ll be cheering for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cheer me on with such a kind face! My hostility is disappearing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be hostile towards your friend\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As I answered Hwaya with amusement, a question suddenly popped up in my head.</p><br/><p>If there was a way to go from the Second Dungeon to the First Dungeon\u2026 Where could I go from the First Dungeon?</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>After I joined Hwaya\u2019s team, our hunting speed more than tripled. As I easily took care of the fishmen that were causing the most problems for them, it was only natural. Furthermore, every time I screamed on the ship, monsters flocked toward us, allowing us to take care of them in one go.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing. How can T.K.\u2019s voice provoke other monsters?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe they know I\u2019m strong, so they\u2019re coming to fight together?\u201d</p><br/><p>I gave a half-hearted reply and punched a nearby fishman. Hwaya, who could surmise the reason, grinned and sent her fireballs flying without saying anything.</p><br/><p>Just like that, four days passed. By the time I stored over ten melting tunas in my inventory, the lake had begun to change. Simply put, the monsters became stronger. The number of fishmen decreased, and the number of melting tunas and toothsaws increased. Although it was a very good thing for me, it was undoubtedly an unusually change.</p><br/><p>Then, on the seventh day after I arrived at Windermere, while we were fighting melting tunas and toothsaws wildly, our ship came face to face with Brightman\u2019s ship. Although there were only five people on our ship, Brightman had seven people on his. Besides Tommy, who was on the ship even though he still hadn\u2019t fully recovered, Brightman was the only British ranker. I knew they had an A+ rank healer, so four other S rankers had come to aid Brightman.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Mastiford, you\u2019ve been doing extremely well lately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe only have elites. You and I aren\u2019t close enough to be chatting like this, so why don\u2019t you turn your ship around and leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu, how cold, even though I\u2019m always thinking about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always thinking about me, you say\u2026? That\u2019s really, really creepy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brightman flinched, seeming having sensed something from Hwaya\u2019s sizzling voice. Then, he continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, Miss Mastiford, I forgot to put a collar on my pet dog, and he ran away. I\u2019m looking for him, but I can\u2019t seem to find him. He\u2019s a brown-haired dachshund. Have you seen him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re asking me about your lost dog, Brightman. Ah, I don\u2019t know about a dog, but I did see a black cockroach in my house\u2026 I instantly burned it to cinders.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Ah, I see. My bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Brightman glared at me for some reason. What, why are you looking at me? Hwaya seemed to have noticed who Brightman was looking at as she snorted. Then, she lowered the tone of her voice and growled at Brightman.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrightman, I\u2019m warning you. If you overstep your boundaries, I\u2019m prepared to do the same. I\u2019m proud that you are British, but I\u2019m disillusioned the more I interact with you. You\u2019re one of the superhumans representing our country. You should know what that means. Understood?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, you\u2019re funny, Miss Mastiford. Of course I understand what that means. Miss Mastiford is also a superhuman representing our country. Don\u2019t you think we\u2019re perfect for each other?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you to shut up before the number of superhumans representing our country is reduced to one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brightman was the one who ordered Walker to observe Hwaya and even take pictures of her secretly.</p><br/><p>Just like I thought when I first obtained the evidence of Brightman\u2019s wrongdoing, the British government would most likely refuse to do anything that would harm Brightman. It didn\u2019t matter what crimes he committed. Although I didn\u2019t know it at first, Brightman supposedly had an overwhelming influence over the British government and Guardian. Since he had political power, monetary power, and military power, it was understandable.</p><br/><p>In other words, although they were both SS rankers, Brightman had a higher standing in Britain. There were undoubtedly many supporters of Hwaya, but it was probably only to the extent that they didn\u2019t get in the way of Brightman.</p><br/><p>No matter how much Hwaya loved her country, if Britain continued to ignore Brightman\u2019s overbearing actions, Hwaya might lose her patience. That was what Hwaya was warning him about.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Mastiford\u2026 How can you say that? As fellow British nobles, aren\u2019t you embarrassed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmbarrassed? Would someone who knows what embarrassment is do what you\u2019ve been doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk\u2026 Miss Mastiford, you weren\u2019t like this before. As I thought, you shouldn\u2019t hang out with people outside of your class.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya made a huge flame and threw it. It hit the water between our ship and Brightman\u2019s ship, exploding with a thundering roar and making an enormous amount of steam rise up.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Insult. My. Friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although her voice wasn\u2019t loud, her voice reached my ears clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the very least, they\u2019re better than a piece of trash like you. Brightman, if you really are a noble, if you really think about Britain and its future, you should screw the hell off and not involve yourself with me. Dig open those filthy earholes and let my words stick in your mind! I won\u2019t ever like a scumbag like you! I never did and I never will! So turn your ship around and screw off, you oldie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a beautiful speech\u2026 If I do say so myself, her speech from just now should be placed above Churchill\u2019s commencement speech. She managed to pack her spirit and intentions into such a short speech.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Mike, that\u2019s too much. I\u2019d say it\u2019s about on the same level as Steve Jobs\u2019 commencement speech.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys shouldn\u2019t make fun of commencement speeches like that. You\u2019ll get arrested.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I clapped, I warned Mike and Paul who were saying some nonsense drivel. When they both gave me a thumbs up, I got the strong urge to break them, but I restrained myself.</p><br/><p>However, rather than making Brightman turn his ship and leave, her shouting and flame seemed to have first called something.</p><br/><p>Oooooong. For a moment, something created a strong vibration in the water.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMike!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment something popped out of the water, Paul quickly pushed Mike away and blocked that something with his shield. Thanks to Paul\u2019s timely defense, we were able to see the thing that was vibrating so strongly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a saw!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA really big one too!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the words left my mouth, I created a specially large Thunder Arrow in my hand and threw it forward. When it hit the eye of the giant toothsaw, which was about to break through Paul\u2019s shield with its sharp saw-snout, the giant toothsaw screamed and fell back.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you could use lightning outside of just your fists!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore that, take care of him! He has to be the Field Dungeon\u2019s boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although normal toothsaws were large too, just this guy\u2019s body was over 20 meters long. Naturally, his saw-snout was several meters long too. With that huge saw and its unnaturally strong vibration, it was possible that the ship would be cut in half. Hwaya gritted her teeth and created flames in both her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019ll need my help!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t bother us, Brighman!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Hwaya shot down Brightman\u2019s offer immediately, as the boss of an A+ rank Field Dungeon could easily kill a ranker, refusing his offer wasn\u2019t necessarily the best idea. Hwaya naturally became quieter, and knowing that, Brightman moved his ship forward towards us.</p><br/><p>[Master, careful.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I can hear a singing voice. Other people will hear it soon too.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSinging voice\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Protect your mind!]</p><br/><p>Hearing Peika\u2019s warning, I circulated Peruta Circuit, when a thought suddenly crossed my mind.</p><br/><p>That giant toothsaw charging at us to cut our ship probably wasn\u2019t the one singing. In that case\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are\u2026 two bosses?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I murmured\u2026</p><br/><p>[Lala~ Lalala~]</p><br/><p>I began to hear a beautiful female singing voice. It was the kind of heavenly singing voice that charmed whoever heard it and made even the most tearless person cry.</p><br/><p>It was the singing voice that gave this Field Dungeon the name, \u2018Graveyard Over the Lake.\u2019</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s Note:</p><br/><p>Upping Walker\u2019s goodwill with a carrot and a stick method! And a slight foreshadowing to go with it!</p><br/><p>Will British rankers + other countries\u2019 rankers + our MC be able to kill the Field Dungeon\u2019s boss safely? Look forward to the next chapter ^^</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The Rondo of Scarlet Flame and Silver Ice (4)</p><br/><p>After we finished eating and resting, we climbed the stairs. What awaited us was a large hall and giant chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. Of course, it was also made out of ice. In addition, there were thousands of ice bats hanging on the chandeliers. Although we took care of them easily, we became slightly worried, realizing that the castle might be much bigger than we anticipated.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long do we have left until uncleared Event Dungeons turn into Field Dungeons?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the exact time, but it shouldn\u2019t be long. Last time, they turned into Field Dungeons on the 61st day exactly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd today is the 59th\u2026 No, 60th, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>In other words, if we assumed that it was the same as last time, we had less than 24 hours until the Event Dungeon turned into a Field Dungeon. I didn\u2019t want to rush, but it was true that we had been taking it a bit leisurely.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we split up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we should prioritize our safety. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to come out, so we should stick together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if we were late and the dungeon turned into a Field Dungeon, it didn\u2019t mean that we would die. It was just that humanity would continually be afflicted with a hell hole. Mm, maybe the situation was serious after all.</p><br/><p>Personally, I thought we could more easily clear the Ice Castle if we had Illina by our side. After all, her ability was practically made for this place. She didn\u2019t know that Event Dungeons could turn into Field Dungeons. If she did, she wouldn\u2019t have ignored me just now and would have lent her help. If we didn\u2019t clear the dungeon, the Field Dungeon might take countless people\u2019s lives.</p><br/><p>With a glimmer of hope, I tried to detect Illina\u2019s mana with Mana Detection. Of course, I couldn\u2019t do something like that suddenly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I burn the entire castle down with my flames\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, before we use such a brute force method, we need to see if there are any survivors. At the very least, France\u2019s SS ranker might be alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think he got done in by Illina?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope that SS ranker didn\u2019t have an aggressive personality\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Considering Illina\u2019s temperament, it was unlikely that she attacked people first. It was probably her overly sensitive self-defense mechanism that poured in boundless mana of ice into whoever touched her. In other words, if France\u2019s SS ranker didn\u2019t try to touch her, he might still be alive.</p><br/><p>However, if he tried to capture her, seeing as how Illina was fine, he probably froze to death somewhere in this castle. Thawing someone and bringing them back to life was something only possible in science fiction novels. It wasn\u2019t something we could do. Once someone froze, they were dead. If a ranker died in a place like this, that would be troublesome. Though, I wouldn\u2019t mind if it was Brightman or Bruno.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hurry up from now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWalking faster makes it colder\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but bear with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>High stats were made to last in situations like this. For a month for me and two months for the others, we cleared hundreds of Event Dungeons without rest and obtained over 200 bonus stat points.</p><br/><p>We obtained the maximum amount of bonus stats from Event Dungeons ranked A+ or below, a feat that I would have thought was impossible. HP and MP. According to what I heard from Loretta some time ago, there were some things one gained just by leveling up, depending on what dungeon he was in. Even without taking that into consideration, 200 bonus stats equaled 40 levels worth of stats. Although we each had our own strengths, we all had at least S ranked abilities. After gaining 200 bonus stats, it was safe to say that we had far surpassed the realm of human beings.</p><br/><p>Ordinary people would have instantly frozen to death just by stepping in this place, but we only complained that it was cold. After Ye-Eun became an ability user and a dungeon explorer, leveling up and increasing her stats, she probably never felt too \u2018hot\u2019 or \u2018cold.\u2019 When she came to this castle and felt the coldness she hasn\u2019t felt for a long time, she probably exaggerated it a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo bear with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo? You can\u2019t say, \u2018so bear with it,\u2019 when you didn\u2019t say anything beforehand!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn, I was connecting my internal monologue with what I was saying aloud! But I thought everyone would still understand\u2026 Realizing that reality was different than my ideals, I despaired. Then, I explained to Ye-Eun about the reality of the \u2018cold\u2019 she was feeling.</p><br/><p>On the castle\u2019s 1st floor, we ran into what Illina casually mentioned. The armor made out of ice. I couldn\u2019t understand. Living armors were supposed to pretend like normal armors, then attack unsuspecting adventurers. But what was it disguising itself for when this castle was only full of traps!?</p><br/><p>In any case, there wasn\u2019t any time for questions. As spacious as the 1st floor was, it was filled with enemies, and had numerous ambushes set up.</p><br/><p>\u201cEiit!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are more coming to your left!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe chandelier is alive!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUwoah, the wall is moving too!\u201d</p><br/><p>This better not end like, \u2018Hey, the entire castle was a monster, too!\u2019 If it did, I\u2019m going to tear the castle apart!</p><br/><p>Thankfully, the chandelier and the wall were both disguised ice mimics. There really wasn\u2019t anything we could trust in this castle.</p><br/><p>At the same time, with us destroying every enemy in our path, the castle was getting noticeably cleaner. We ended up clearing the 1st floor in just 2 hours, much quicker than we took to clear the basement. Immediately afterward, we climbed up to the 2nd floor using the staircase we found on the west side of the castle\u2019s 1st floor.</p><br/><p>The 2nd floor didn\u2019t have a hall but had a long corridor with many rooms. Surprisingly, I could feel the presence of humans from them. It didn\u2019t belong to Illina! I urged the others on.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are survivors, let\u2019s hurry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, I\u2019ll just burn the 2nd floor! I\u2019m going to run out of mana, so make sure to catch me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, thanks!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya\u2019s white flames spread out in all directions, and we ran toward the presence. The enemies we faced on the way were quickly taken care of by Hwaya\u2019s Army of Flames. In exchange for our extremely quick advance, Hwaya was turning pale and was looking like she was about to faint.</p><br/><p>[Guaaaaaang!]</p><br/><p>After some time, bats, rats, paintings, chandeliers, and armors were all melted away by Hwaya\u2019s flames. We thus ran to the presence without hindrance, and soon arrived in front of a large door.</p><br/><p>[Uooooooooooh!]</p><br/><p>A giant golem standing in front of the door like a gatekeeper roared. It raised its giant ice mace but was melted by several white flame beasts before it could swing it even once. It must have been pretty strong as it took a majority of the beasts with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, I\u2019m about to\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya!\u201d</p><br/><p>As I thought, it seemed the Army of Flames, especially one with her white flames, took a heavy toll on her body and mana. The moment the Army of Flames disappeared, Hwaya fell backward powerlessly. I hurriedly ran behind her and caught her. Her body was cold. It was the symptom of one being completely out of mana.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t move at all?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess there\u2019s no choice. It might be a bit uncomfortable, but I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll carry you, unni! You must be more comfortable with a girl than a guy, too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYe-Eun, you\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Hwaya responded to Ye-Eun touched, she silently smiled. Ye-Eun then made me get back and carried Hwaya on her back. To think they had developed such a close bond! I was touched. Next to me, however, Walker whispered to me seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Shin, I think you should go die, kuuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? What?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel complicated. I should cheer on unni, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No, it has to be Ludia. That way, there will be some hope for me\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026? What\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><br/><p>When we opened the gate, the tragic scene in front of us was more than enough to shut out such trivial thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy god.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo many people are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Frozen corpses were everywhere. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if someone mistook them as ice sculptures. There were at least 40 of them, each with different faces, but the same miserable expressions. Was this Illina\u2019s doing? In front of the absurd horror, we couldn\u2019t hide our shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I thought, there was a survivor. He was in a miserable state, as he was frozen from his feet to his right under his nose. He noticed us and opened his eyes widely. He seemed to want to say something, but his mouth wouldn\u2019t open. In truth, I was shocked that he was still alive in such a state. I first made sure that there were no monsters nearby, then asked Ludia.</p><br/><p>\u201cLudia, can you save him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot as he is now. We have to thaw him.\u201d</p><br/><p>To think we\u2019d actually have to do it! In any case, it was probably better to move him to a safe area before we\u2026</p><br/><p>KRRRRRR.</p><br/><p>A loud sound rang out. When we turned around, the door we opened was shut tightly. Plus, the surrounding had gotten even colder, so much so that even I could feel it. Was I mistaken? When I was about to move the man, father called out.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, something\u2019s not right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, father?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy fingertips are freezing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s serious\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>I immediately turned around and checked on father\u2019s status. Although he spoke nonchalantly, it wasn\u2019t just father\u2019s problem. Aside from me and Hwaya, everyone\u2019s hands and feet were slowly freezing. In other words, the frozen corpses weren\u2019t caused by Illina, but by some other existence in this space!</p><br/><p>[Guuuuuuuu\u2026.!]</p><br/><p>[Kuhaa\u2026]</p><br/><p>The corpses I thought were dead began to move while making strange noises. The Awakened\u2019s corpses were being used!</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya, how\u2019s your mana!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI still need more time before it\u2019ll fill up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMana Elixir! Ludia!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t open\u2026 my inventory\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn! If I could, I would open Ludia\u2019s inventory for her. However, inventories could only be opened by their owners. Could this be considered a status effect? If it was, I could dispel it with Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry! However, after I thought about it, I realized that although Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry could cancel frostbite or paralysis from the cold, it could not prevent someone from being frozen. Plus, if I super-armored them haphazardly and forced them to move their frozen bodies, it could have devastating effect afterward. I didn\u2019t want to imagine such a thing happening.</p><br/><p>In that case, I could only do something about it myself! Frozen corpses. Seeing the ice zombies closing in, I bit my lips and dispersed my mana outward. No matter who or what was freezing us, something had to be caught!</p><br/><p>Then\u2026</p><br/><p>[Humans\u2026 Humans always worry about their own lives in critical situations, so why do they all pretend to care about others?]</p><br/><p>A voice rang out. It was the voice of a boy that hadn\u2019t passed his puberty. It was a cold, frozen voice. I raised my head.</p><br/><p>[What do you think, human\u2019s Hero?]</p><br/><p>A pretty boy, who could be mistaken as a girl, was right in front of me. With a sour expression, he sometimes pulled on his shirt with his hands, as if he didn\u2019t like anything.</p><br/><p>[Well, you probably can\u2019t hear or see.]</p><br/><p>When I was about to say something, the closed door suddenly opened. Illina, who had disappeared three hours ago, was standing there.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 kill him.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You\u2026?]</p><br/><p>When the door opened, the boy became flustered and turned around. When I saw her, a relieved smile appeared on my face. I could feel her sincerity. Seeing her step up for someone who only gave her a bowl of ramen, I became certain that we didn\u2019t think wrong.</p><br/><p>I could feel the victory in the air. To make that victory more certain and to turn it into something happy, I took action.</p><br/><p>I decided to use the skill points I had been saving up.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>The answer has already been given!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

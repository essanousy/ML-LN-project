You Cannot Escape from the Saintess (5)</p><br/><p>At first, I was too shocked to say anything, but when I thought about it, her possessing Evil Eyes was natural. Right, she was possessed by a powerful curse that no advancement in science or medicine, or the highest rank healing ability could cure. It wouldn\u2019t make sense if it wasn\u2019t caused by something like Evil Eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it really you, Hero-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you multiple times. My name is Kang Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are Hero-nim\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see not listening to other people\u2019s words hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though this was the first time she spoke since she was born, the way she naturally moved her lips and tongue was a bit scary. She was really like a princess freed from a curse, the kind told in fairy tales.</p><br/><p>She undoubtedly possessed Evil Eyes since the day she was born. Evil Eyes was a terrifying authority that placed an immense burden on one\u2019s body. Back then, she should have had little to no mana in her body. Her body must have known that only death awaited her if she opened her eyes.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why she couldn\u2019t open her eyes. Because her sight wasn\u2019t enough, her hearing and voice had also been taken away. It wasn\u2019t a curse, but her desperate attempt to lessen the burden on her body. Of course, she never realized it.</p><br/><p>I thought about explaining it, but I decided against it. I felt it would only encourage her self-aggrandizing way of thinking.</p><br/><p>For some reason, however, Ciara was quiet. She could now see and speak. No matter how quiet she was before, it wouldn\u2019t be an overreaction for her to blabber on excitedly. Plus, if it was Ciara who always put an exclamation mark at the end of her sentence\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cCiara?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Yes!\u201d</p><br/><p>No, I was wrong. She had never seen the world with her own eyes. It made sense that she was spacing out.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Ciara, who was looking at me, began to cry. I had expected her to become emotional, but it was still a surprise as tears weren\u2019t something I ever associated her with.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you crying? I told you I could fix it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No. It\u2019s nothing, Hero-nim\u2026! It, it\u2019s just\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ciara didn\u2019t wipe her tears and only looked up at me. She then murmured quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven\u2026 Even more, far more beautiful than I thought\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s good to hear.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no way that the world she drew in her heart was the same as the world she saw with her own eyes. Now, she could see and judge everything herself. Even if it wasn\u2019t to my extent\u2026 I hoped that she would come to recognize the value of others.</p><br/><p>Feeling sympathy for Ciara for the first time, I reached out and stroked her hair. She didn\u2019t overreact and simply smiled. If only she could continue being this way\u2026 I felt a headache knowing that this wouldn\u2019t be the case.</p><br/><p>Ciara regained her light and voice. In addition, her eyes were Evil Eyes from birth. Her power of foresight was simply the result of her inborn power awakening.</p><br/><p>Her eyes could see the future. It was a simple ability, yet the consequences were immense. Just by opening her eyes, her ability came to surpass what it was before by far. If she put in an effort and controlled her eyes, there really might be nowhere that could escape her sight. Although she carried dangerous thoughts, as long as I was next to her, she would follow me. Revival had just gotten an irreplaceable ally.</p><br/><p>However, Ciara\u2019s situation wasn\u2019t only good. As I said before, the reason she couldn\u2019t speak and had her eyes closed was that her body couldn\u2019t withstand her Evil Eyes. That was still the case now, even as an ability user.</p><br/><p>Empowered by Enigma, the Elixir amplified the mana in her body and forced her body to its normal state. When the Elixir\u2019s effect ran out, her body would be burdened once again, perhaps even more than before. It was my mistake, as I had never considered the possibility of her possessing Evil Eyes. But since she opened her eyes, it was necessary to train her body, mind, and mana. Immediately.</p><br/><p>Hwaya answered my request with a dying expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cHateful\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, Hwaya. I\u2019ll do whatever you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know full well I can\u2019t refuse you\u2026 Huu, it\u2019s for Revival too, so fine. I\u2019ll endure it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ciara bowed to Hwaya. She had clearly gotten calmer after opening her eyes. Hwaya snorted as she retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, let\u2019s work on controlling the mana inside you. Right now, it\u2019s all tangled up inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because she can\u2019t control it consciously. Her potential shouldn\u2019t be bad\u2026 She\u2019s the distributor of all abilities after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope so, Shin. I\u2019m going to be a little rough, so give us some space. Four days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFour days!?\u201d</p><br/><p>What is she planning on doing to this child!? Don\u2019t tell me she\u2019s going to vent her anger? Hwaya snickered seeing my worrying eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m the first person on Earth to systematically train in mana. Since I accepted her as a disciple, I can\u2019t be soft even if she\u2019s a kid. I need four days, so leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Hwaya sent me a message.</p><br/><p>[I can roughly solve what you\u2019re worried about in that timeframe.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You\u2019re really an amazing woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya nodded as if it was the most obvious truth. Then, she waved her hands without even looking at me. I smiled and left as she wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood luck, Ciara. I\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Hero-nim. I\u2019ll do my best! For Hero-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, do it for yourself, not me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like that, the witch accepted the saintess as a disciple at the request of the hero. What a mess.</p><br/><p>After leaving Ciara to Hwaya, I went to find Walker. As I\u2019d already talked to Hwaya and a few others, I didn\u2019t need to hesitate to do what I planned.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Kang Shin? Your face is more unpleasant than usual.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShould I not?\u201d</p><br/><p>I messaged Walker beforehand, but it seemed he wasn\u2019t in the dungeon anyway. With what happened last time with the Event Dungeons and the demons\u2019 invasion, he was climbing the dungeon with determination, so it seemed my timing was good. When I visited him, Walker wasn\u2019t in his house but was smoking outside.</p><br/><p>It was noon. He would have been guarding Yua if it was the past. Although not much time had passed, I felt like many things had changed. I made a bitter smile. Walker flicked his cigarette and spoke curtly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to visit me, tell me beforehand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree or four hours before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Do you have another guest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 No.\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker dodged my gaze. For a moment, he eyes looked at the second-floor window. The curtains were tightly shut as if to hide what was inside. Well, it didn\u2019t matter. I told him what I came for.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really need the Soul Contract anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten bold, Kang Shin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just think I should trust who I can trust.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou? Me? I woke up too late to see it, but the sun must have risen from the west.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWalker, I need your agreement to destroy it. The Soul Contract, let\u2019s destroy it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ignoring Walker\u2019s drivel, I took out our Soul Contract and spoke with a clear voice. Walker widened his eyes and puffed a smoke. As he exhaled, he threw the cigarette away and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, let\u2019s destroy it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without me doing anything, the Soul Contract ripped to shreds. I could feel that the contractual bond between Walker and me disappeared completely. At that moment, Walker appeared behind me. His fist was enveloped in a black aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust let me hit you once\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRejected.\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how much Walker grew, he wasn\u2019t my opponent. Because of how predictable he was, I couldn\u2019t let him hit me even if I wanted. I lightly brushed his neck with my elbow. Walker fell backward and cursed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn you, you\u2019re too uptight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for the compliment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScrew off. I\u2019m going to go and let out all the curses I held back until now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re free to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>I smirked. As I was about to turn away, I realized I had something left to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who formed a Soul Contract with Sophie, right? Since the restriction is gone, you get rid of her contract too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to see her and say it myself, but since you\u2019re outside, it must be troubling for her to meet someone at her current state.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker coughed roughly. I smirked and dealt another blow.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, when can I eat my noodles? I love noodles, you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Walker gritted his teeth, while I walked out feeling better than ever before. I hummed happily.</p><br/><p>It would be nice to take this happiness straight to Beyond\u2019s 30th floor, but there was something I needed to do beforehand. It was the sparring with Peruta that came about once a month. Since sparring with him periodically let me realize how much I improved, I had no plans to take it easy.</p><br/><p>I immediately went to the Residential Area and headed to the basement training room. Sumire was the only one there, thrusting her spear into the air by herself. I was slightly surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cSumire?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Shin-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>She welcomed me with a smile. I already knew this with how close she was with Hwaya, but between a dog and a cat, she was more like a dog. If she had a tail, I suspected it would be shaking 100 times per second.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you come to train?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep, with Peruta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave, so feel free! Afterwards, can you spar with me\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. You\u2019re so hard-working, Sumire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just doing what I can. Even in the last incident, many people got hurt because I couldn\u2019t protect them. I don\u2019t want that to happen again.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was so blindingly bright that I couldn\u2019t look at her. Shouldn\u2019t Sumire be the Saintess instead of Ciara?</p><br/><p>\u201cPlus, Athena has a spear-related ability too. I just can\u2019t use it because I\u2019m not skilled enough. I have to obtain it before the next time Event Dungeons appear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Sorry for making you work so hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know Shin-nim has it the hardest. I\u2019m happy to just be of help!\u201d</p><br/><p>An angel!</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I took too much time. I\u2019m off then. Call me when you\u2019re done sparring!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Sumire. You can just watch from the side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? But\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. You might learn something. Mmm, remember this though.\u201d</p><br/><p>I added with a wry smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll look like I\u2019m dancing by myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>I stood in the center of the training hall with my eyes closed and called Peruta. He seemingly knew what I wanted, as he immediately created an Imagine World and faced me. A pleased smile was on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re heading to the next realm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to arrive as quickly as possible. I have a lot to pay them back for.\u201d</p><br/><p>I held up my spear and took a stance. Peruta waved his hand as he retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy, impatience is a warrior\u2019s taboo. Impatience leads to mistakes, and mistakes lead to losses. When a person becomes incapable of taking back what he lost, that\u2019s when he becomes a Kahar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take note. Though, I don\u2019t know what a Kahar is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoop, my bad. Kahar means disaster in my continent\u2019s language. The kind of disaster that stays hidden, appearing suddenly and devouring everything. When a person becomes a Kahar, there will be nothing left, including himself. In the end, he\u2019ll destroy even the things he wanted to protect.\u201d</p><br/><p>To be honest, it sounded cool.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen remember this too. In another language, a Kahar is called the God of Vengeance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Peruta held up his spear, pointing it towards me and shouting sharply.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, come! Throw away your impatience and thirst for revenge! For now, only think about reaching the peak of spearmanship!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ten hours afterward.</p><br/><p>My Mad Typhoon reached level 7.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

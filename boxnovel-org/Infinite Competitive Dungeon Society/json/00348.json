The End (2)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I stared at the empty Floor Shop. Though I was expecting it, I was still shocked. I worried for her safety but decided to trust her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSherafina, are you ready?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no reply. But I knew how to get one. I threw my body at the gate to Beyond.</p><br/><p>Monsters that began to appear from Beyond\u2019s 41st floor, Elang. They had a unique trait which prevented them from taking damage from non-pure aura attacks.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the way they talked suggested that they knew who I was. Though I wasn\u2019t sure until now, I became certain after obtaining the Demon Lord\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>Elangs should be puppets that use Sherafina\u2019s power. From the beginning, she wasn\u2019t trying to hide it.</p><br/><p>The 45th floor wasn\u2019t big. It was a tranquil marble room that was extremely silent. Moreover, this room was full of the dungeon\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ve been waiting.]</p><br/><p>A creature with black skin and a pair of white wings spoke.</p><br/><p>[I believed you would accomplish it one day.]</p><br/><p>The voice belonged to a man, but I knew it was Sherafina.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m not sure myself. Too much time has passed for me to remember the past. But I do know that I was once a girl.]</p><br/><p>He\u2026 She\u2026 Sherafina said that and asked back.</p><br/><p>[There\u2019s something I can\u2019t understand. How did Kain Zerahard hide his ability from me?]</p><br/><p>\u201cThe power he got was the ability to conceal himself and his comrades.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it was to hide from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>For a moment, Sherafina became lost for words. She then asked again.</p><br/><p>[How did you enter the dungeon?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI can do at least that much.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Not according to my calculation.]</p><br/><p>\u201c95floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>[So it\u2019s as I suspected. To be capable of deceiving my eyes, was it a dragon?]</p><br/><p>I nodded. From Sherafina\u2019s jet-black skin, eerily crimson eyes opened.</p><br/><p>[So there was a dragon left alive. I thought I got rid of them all.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a mistake.\u201d</p><br/><p>[It can\u2019t be described as a simple mistake. It threw off my plan that had an absolute chance of succeeding.]</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll still try?\u201d</p><br/><p>[The goal I\u2019ve been working for my entire life is now in front of me. Kang Shin, if you were in my position, would you stop just because the chances decreased?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t set such an annoying goal in the first place.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Of course, that\u2019s because you were already born with everything.]</p><br/><p>Born with everything, huh. The question I had when I first entered the dungeon remained to be answered. Now, it was time for me to find out.</p><br/><p>After taking in a deep breath, I spat out.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You\u2019re the one connecting two worlds.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes.]</p><br/><p>She acknowledged it straightforwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re also the one stealing worlds\u2019 powers and designating the attacking side and the defending side.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes. I\u2019ve been setting worlds without possibility into attackers, worlds with possibility into defenders.]</p><br/><p>\u201cPossibility?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes, the possibility of you existing.]</p><br/><p>The puppet Sherafina was controlling didn\u2019t show emotions well, but I knew that its current face portrayed joy. I asked again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been doing all of this just to find me?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou brought countless worlds to extinction, tricked powerful ability users into creating the dungeon, and shared your power with explorers as if you were generous. Everything, just for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes.]</p><br/><p>People would call a being capable of such feat this.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you a god?\u201d</p><br/><p>[What is a god?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>[On your head, there is a shining power I can\u2019t comprehend. Is that the proof of a god?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I also don\u2019t know if I am a god. But, other existences would indeed call us gods.]</p><br/><p>I chuckled at her words. God. The ones who created this word were humans and other beings with intellect. Zeus, Odin, Hermes, Shiva, Kali, Durga, Ignis, all of them! They were birthed from humans.</p><br/><p>Still, to think this is how she would respond to my question. It seemed she really didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, you\u2019re not a god. If anything, I\u2019m closer to a god than you.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s also what I think.]</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to become a god?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Not at all. You becoming a god is not part of my plan. That might be where the plan started to go awry. But that\u2019s it. I expected you to have a power or two beyond my understanding.]</p><br/><p>Sherafina sounded surprising calm. Almost as if it didn\u2019t matter how strong I was.</p><br/><p>[I have the ability to wield worlds\u2019 powers.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t be able to put worlds\u2019 powers into people\u2019s body as you like.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I can\u2019t put these powers into just anyone. They have to be a Hero.]</p><br/><p>In other words, the designation of Heroes wasn\u2019t under her control.</p><br/><p>[When the world I lived in became connected with another world, I learned of the existence of worlds\u2019 powers and became stronger from it. Soon, I realized I could freely move any world\u2019s power. That\u2019s how I came to create pathways to all worlds.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I wanted to contain all worlds\u2019 powers inside me. I thought it would be possible if I used my ability.]</p><br/><p>The way she spoke sounded as though it was the most natural thing to do. I could already feel myself getting a headache.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust because of that\u2026 you brought countless worlds to extinction?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes. The pursuit of power is a natural instinct. Is it not the same for you?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t kill everyone I know for the sake of getting stronger! Even if you got stronger, what would you have left?\u201d</p><br/><p>[An absolute power.]</p><br/><p>Speaking as though it was a matter of fact, the corner of Sherafina\u2019s mouth twisted into a smile as she stared at me.</p><br/><p>[You should know the nature of your ability, and you still say this?]</p><br/><p>\u201cKnowing the nature of my ability and destroying other worlds have nothing to do with each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I can wield worlds\u2019 powers, but I couldn\u2019t succeed in containing all of them in my body. I didn\u2019t have the ability.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 So?\u201d</p><br/><p>[But you have the ability to fuse any power, any number of powers into one. Simply put, it is the concentration of all into one.]</p><br/><p>I shut my eyes.</p><br/><p>[After so long, I finally found you. You grew up magnificently and your ability bloomed excellently. Though it might have gone a bit overboard, it is still within my control.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? The reason you connected different worlds and the reason you created the dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes.]</p><br/><p>\u201cJust for that, you made so many people suffer?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I only accelerated what was happening regardless.]</p><br/><p>She continued calmly.</p><br/><p>[In Earth years, it only took 4,200 years. Even I didn\u2019t think it would be so quick. I was prepared to have the dungeon\u2019s administrators, its form and name change several times.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat made you like this? Humans, elves, dragons, anything! You shouldn\u2019t have been alone from the start! So why?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Is a reason required to pursue power?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>[No matter what it may be, is there a need for a reason to pursue it?]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She laughed. Though it was through her puppet, it was the first time I was hearing her laugh.</p><br/><p>[Why do you seek a reason? Since when was there a reason for every act? Kang Shin, you are too na\u00efve. I do not question why I am the way I am. I simply do what I wish to do. And that is to pursue power. No matter how many worlds disappear in the process, no matter how many existences perish, that is none of my concern. Why should it matter?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Don\u2019t you have anyone you cherish? If not now, in the past?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ellos\u2019 face immediately popped up. He was a man of passion who was selected to become a First Dungeon explorer. He met his love and lost her to the world\u2019s enemy. For him, a single woman was more important than himself or his world. As a result, he sought to get revenge by pulling me in and died because of it.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t pity him. The moment he schemed against me, he was no longer my friend. He was just my enemy. But thinking that he was simply toyed by Sherafina, I was filled with nothing but pity for him.</p><br/><p>[The moment you place a value on others, you become weaker.]</p><br/><p>She said assuredly.</p><br/><p>[And in reality, you split your power to protect your family, friends, and Loretta.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I tried to secure Loretta, I felt my existence threatened and had to give up. To give Loretta so much power, you must have spent quite a bit of your own. Am I wrong?]</p><br/><p>I smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cRather than my power, it was the axe\u2019s power\u2026 but no, you\u2019re not wrong.]</p><br/><p>Where was Loretta hiding? I wondered. In any case, it was good to know that Sherafina failed to secure Loretta. As I was worried quite a bit, I was greatly relieved to hear Sherafina\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Sherafina continued talking. I didn\u2019t know whether she understood what I was thinking.</p><br/><p>[As such, no one holds any value for me. No one, except you. As such, I must have you.]</p><br/><p>With that, the puppet finally began to move.</p><br/><p>[Of course, I am only going to measure your ability for now. I wouldn\u2019t dare to think I could defeat you with a puppet.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSmart.\u201d</p><br/><p>I reached out with my hand and grabbed the empty air. Above my head, the halo let out a fierce light before the mana of Enigma obliterated the Elang.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut something like this is no longer capable of measuring my power.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026 It seemed I underestimated a god\u2019s power.]</p><br/><p>This time, the voice didn\u2019t come from the puppet. I could feel a slight trembling in her voice. When I grinned, she gave me a surprise.</p><br/><p>[It seems I really will need Ciara Kenex\u2019s power.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What? She should be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[She\u2019s in the dungeon.]</p><br/><p>Sherafina said.</p><br/><p>[It was smart to try to hide her from me, but you made one mistake.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>[The selection of explorers doesn\u2019t only occur with designations of other explorers. Ciara Kenex is working hard to climb the dungeon to be of help to you.]</p><br/><p>I began to run. Casting aside the restrictive force of the dungeon\u2019s power, I returned to the First Dungeon. Then, without hesitation, I ran up to the 96th floor.</p><br/><p>[I will be waiting for you on the 100th floor. If you do not hurry, you won\u2019t make it in time.]</p><br/><p>\u201cShut it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sherafina spoke in glee.</p><br/><p>[Her power is connected to yours. Once I obtain hers, I will get to know you more.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHuaaaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>The earth twisted and the space distorted as I charged straight through the 96th floor. However, the 100th floor was too far away. If Ciara was really in the dungeon, she was practically in Sherafina\u2019s hands!</p><br/><p>[Kang Shin, when the time comes, you will no longer have the qualification to fight me.]</p><br/><p>I ran.</p><br/><p>Towards the 100th floor!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

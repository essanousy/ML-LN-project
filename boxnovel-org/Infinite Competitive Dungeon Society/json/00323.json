With Your Own Power (3)</p><br/><p>I also replied with a grin.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak nonsense, Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you ignoring me, you little bastard?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can tell. This thing is definitely tied to me, but it\u2019s not purely my power. Not for now, at least.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, well, you\u2019re not wrong. It can\u2019t be that easy to become a god.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? A god is something more\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I stopped in the middle of my sentence. I didn\u2019t want to say something I had to clear idea about. Instead, I scratched my head, or rather, my armor. Lin then laughed and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what are you going to call it? Since you said it wasn\u2019t a part of you, shouldn\u2019t you need a name to call it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Hmm, I don\u2019t know what metal it\u2019s made of, so I\u2019ll just call it something basic. Like Steel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, you have no naming-sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than Pure Black Desire!\u201d</p><br/><p>I stuck my tongue out at Lin, but ended up licking Steel\u2019s metal. Because of how comfortable it was, I kept forgetting that I was wearing it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you find out anything else? Like its weakness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, like the increased chance of receiving a critical hit that Pure Black Desire had?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPenalties like those all disappeared. The only problem is Pure Black Desire\u2019s properties completely disappeared. As you can probably feel it, its stat boost is gone completely. Mana and demonic energy broke through their limit and condensed into a what\u2019s almost a semi-organism. Don\u2019t expect anything other than Extort.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Extort is all I have to remember?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep. To be honest, all ancient artifacts are like that. Items related to the dungeon have all sorts of random effects, but lack a unique authority. Do you know the concept of Ambience?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike aura?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin frowned, so I quickly shook my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding, I know. I\u2019m just surprised Lin knows Earth\u2019s artistic theory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, who says other worlds are different from Earth? Ambience is an unseen distinctive atmosphere or quality. An object with Ambience is the kind of thing that presents victory to a seemingly disadvantaged side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin has something like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Lin gestured at his empty back. I immediately knew what he meant. His sniper rifle. The gun that killed the leader of the Book Walkers, a world\u2019s enemy in one blow. As I thought, it wasn\u2019t a normal weapon.</p><br/><p>\u201cAncient artifacts\u2026 Right, they had a rather pure flavor. A blacksmith\u2019s ability is important, but they were mostly created from miracles. The product of coincidences, an Original. Items of the latter generation were naturally compared to items of certain elements or types that were created before, so their League and Ambience fell. Item ranks like Rare, Unique, Epic, Legend, or God are dependent on how much Ambience an item has.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m hearing about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it is. It\u2019s just a speculation I made from how Lord assigns ranks to items.\u201d</p><br/><p>I laughed. Lin pointed at Steel and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the first Original I\u2019ve seen in a long time, one that surpasses many of the others. Just thinking about how much I helped in its creation gives me joy. Of course, it was also helped by your ability as its user and a miraculous background. Like I said, rather than the ability of blacksmiths, artifacts\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014 are the products of coincidences born from miracles. I got it. I\u2019ll take good care of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShow it to Eleine too. She must be curious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will. I\u2019ll be off then. Take care of Leon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, don\u2019t come back.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin retorted half-jokingly and I gave him a glare before leaving Fairy Garden. As I couldn\u2019t ignore Lin\u2019s words, I visited Eleine too. She must have realized Steel\u2019s value at a glance as she immediately offered gold for it. I gave her a refreshing smile and left Loft Valley\u2019s guild area.</p><br/><p>In the last venture, not only did I gather an overflowing amount of death energy, I also grew stronger and evolved my armor. Now, it was time to return to the dungeon.</p><br/><p>When I entered the 87th floor, a bullet shot toward me without a moment of delay. It aimed straight for the middle of my forehead! I considered dodging it, but decided to receive it to test Steel\u2019s defense.</p><br/><p>I reached out with my hand. When the fast-traveling bullet struck the center of my palm, it changed direction and flew back the way it came from in the same speed. I stared at the bullet in a daze. A moment later, I realized that Extort could pretty much reflect all attacks.</p><br/><p>BOOM! An explosion rang out in the far distance.</p><br/><p>[\u2026 You destroyed 1% of the Eliminator\u2019s main body.]</p><br/><p>Then, Sherafina\u2019s seemingly shocked message rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, the super long range attack was coming from the main body!\u201d</p><br/><p>Though Sherafina didn\u2019t reply, I knew I was right. On the 86th floor, I had to face two types of attacks. One was constant snipes from an unknown distance away, and the other was an army of robots with all sorts of fire weapons.</p><br/><p>At first, I thought there were robots with sniper rifles, but even after getting used to the robots\u2019 mana, I couldn\u2019t detect any hints of the sniper shots. As expected, they were coming from the main body rather than robots.</p><br/><p>The only mystery now was how it was pinpointing me from such a distance, and also how it was damaged when Steel reflected it.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What happens if I kill the Eliminator now using this method?\u201d</p><br/><p>Obviously, this was one of the first things that crossed my mind! Sherafina didn\u2019t answer me for a while, but she soon came with an answer.</p><br/><p>[That won\u2019t happen.]</p><br/><p>Oh? I grinned and charged forward.</p><br/><p>At first, I planned to use death energy to corrupt the robots, then use Dortu\u2019s power to take control of them. However, now that I had Steel, it was a different story. To be frank, an enemy of a lower League could no longer do anything against me.</p><br/><p>When I reached this conclusion, I grew a bit afraid of myself. With my Evil Eyes and Dortu\u2019s power, I could petrify all SSS rank monsters, but now, I could even reflect all of their attacks. Even I didn\u2019t want to fight with myself.</p><br/><p>Of course, this attack reflection had other limitations other than the enemy\u2019s League. It was that it used my mana whenever the ability activated. But with Peruta Circuit and Absolute Soul, I could suck in mana from anything around me.</p><br/><p>In other words, if an enemy of a lower League wanted to penetrate Steel\u2019s reflection, the only option was to barrage me with highly destructive attacks and drain my mana to zero.</p><br/><p>In this way, the surest way to defeat me was the Eliminator\u2019s army of robots. Even now, they were shooting a seemingly endless amount of bullets! Although it would take a long time, they should be able to injure me. The main body\u2019s super long range snipes should help too.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately for them, Steel wasn\u2019t the only tool at my disposal.</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. Another day of arduous work ahead.]</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you stop talking like that, Dortu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Previously, Dortu needed a long time to take control of a single robot. But the robots on the 87th floor weren\u2019t too different compared to the robots on the 86th floor. With the experience he had, it only took him one hour to control a robot that fell to the floor after being hit by its own bullet.</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. Dortu\u2019s getting the hang of doing arduous work.]</p><br/><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re doing that on purpose.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other hand, I was slowly getting used to reading the trajectories of the robots\u2019 bullets. While Dortu did his thing, I constantly moved around and tried to read the trajectories of the thousands of bullets and cannon shells, which was now possible with my mana detection being incomparably stronger than before.</p><br/><p>[You destroyed 5% of the Eliminator\u2019s main body.]</p><br/><p>Even while I dodged most of the attacks, I made sure to receive the snipes that flew at me occasionally. Although I could only detect this bullet when it came close, it was still possible for me to dodge it.</p><br/><p>But why would I? I could destroy the enemy I\u2019d meet on the 90th floor beforehand! Sherafina\u2019s messages telling me of my progress was sounding more and more bitter too.</p><br/><p>Clearing the 87th floor only took half the time of the 86th floor. While passing through the 87th floor, I considered testing Extort other than its passive attack reflection aspect.</p><br/><p>But this ability wasn\u2019t something that would increase in power with more use. Since it would grow naturally with my League, I decided to save it for now. A trump card had to used only when necessary.</p><br/><p>Of course, that didn\u2019t mean I wouldn\u2019t use Extort\u2019s power at all. I was already using it to reflect attacks, and if I needed to, I would use it to full effect.</p><br/><p>I jumped into Beyond\u2019s 37th floor without resting for even a bit and faced further strengthened Vampire Lords. They poured powerful attacks the moment they met me and retired from life immediately after. As I only had to watch my mana running out, I felt a bit bad passing through Beyond like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome to think of it, this isn\u2019t that useful for training.\u201d</p><br/><p>That said, I would have Steel for the rest of my life, so I wouldn\u2019t need to get experienced in fighting enemies who couldn\u2019t break through Steel\u2019s reflection. Still, the dungeon had to have monsters that were capable of doing so! Not these fake Vampire Lords, but the real Floor Master!</p><br/><p>Just like that, I cleared Beyond\u2019s 37th floor quicker than the First Dungeon\u2019s 87th floor. Immediately afterwards, I went up to the 88th floor.</p><br/><p>As I felt many things while defeating the demons\u2019 duke, I wanted to increase my League as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>On the 88th floor, on top of the robots from the previous floors, there were robots attacking me from close range with swords made with aura-like mana essence.</p><br/><p>These robots were quicker than the robots armed with guns or cannons, but they still weren\u2019t able to overcome Extort. To clear the 88th floor as quickly as possible, I charged forward.</p><br/><p>Until Suddenly\u2026</p><br/><p>A giant missile fell down from the middle of the sky.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Team Revival (7)</p><br/><p>[Hero.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you can talk too.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was surprised, but I instinctively tightened my grip on the Gluttony Spear and aimed it towards it. To be honest, in the heavy thunderstorm, I thought even the boss of Wyvern\u2019s Nest couldn\u2019t be a match for me.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Thanks for coming, but sorry. I want to end it quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, what it said next shocked me greatly.</p><br/><p>[I know you have the ability of a Tamer, Hero. I want to become Hero\u2019s subordinate.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, what?\u201d</p><br/><p>I doubted my ears for an instant. What did this wyvern with the avian flu just say?</p><br/><p>[After the drake appeared, I thought only death awaited me.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you two on the same side?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Are you stupid, Hero? Between monsters, you either eat, share, or get eaten.]</p><br/><p>Well, that\u2019s nice to know. Share probably refers to monsters from the same family or from the same kind. Although wyverns and the Flame Drake were seemed to both be species of dragons, it seemed they weren\u2019t allies.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ve come to admire you after seeing you destroy dozens of wyverns with a single attack. Be happy. You forced the Queen of the Wyverns, Dark Wing Zirte, to surrender!]</p><br/><p>I obtained two more useful information. The first was that this wyvern felt admiration at me killing dozens of her kind, and the second was that this wyvern was female. I was wondering why her voice was slightly high! Dark Wing Zirte then continued.</p><br/><p>[Of course, what I want the most is to kill Hero and to obtain Hero\u2019s Light, but I know that is impossible. As such, I chose the second best option.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you can\u2019t kill me, you will serve under me?\u201d</p><br/><p>[And I will kill the drake.]</p><br/><p>For a monster, she sure acted like a bully\u2026 Well, it didn\u2019t matter, since it was good for me.</p><br/><p>The wyvern looked into my eyes. Meanwhile, Hwaya shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but hurry up! That guy\u2019s charging toward us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay! Alright, good. You\u2019ll probably be faster than Talaria.\u201d</p><br/><p>[From now on, I am Hero\u2019s. Now, grant me a new name.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t just call you Zirte?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I need a new name to tie myself to Hero.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go with Lotte.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Good. My name is now Lotte! As the Hero\u2019s partner, I will take after his brilliance!]</p><br/><p>Immediately afterwards, several messages rang in my ear, as if they had been prepared beforehand.</p><br/><p>[You made an achievement of taming the S+ rank boss monster, \u2018Dark Wing Wyvern.\u2019 You obtained 1 skill point. Current skill points: 4]</p><br/><p>[Taming became level 3. You can tame your target more easily, and even the targets you placated temporarily will remain so for a longer time.]</p><br/><p>[Spirit of the Tamer became level 3. You will win good first impressions, and the hostility and wariness against you decreases. Current tamable targets: 2/2]</p><br/><p>Although Wyvern\u2019s Nest was a S rank dungeon, Lotte was S+ ranked. I wondered why, and suspected it was because she originally possessed a name.</p><br/><p>Plene, for example, didn\u2019t have a name until I gave her one. On the other hand, Lotte had the name, Zirte. Just by looking at her wings and black skin, I could tell she was different than the other wyverns. She was called the Queen of the Wyverns and Dark Wing, both emphasizing that she was special.</p><br/><p>That said, their goal should have been to kill me and take the world\u2019s power. It felt a bit weird that they gave up and joined my side because they weren\u2019t strong enough. I thought the command they received was absolute, something they had to prioritize over their own lives, but it seemed that wasn\u2019t the case. After all, Plene came over to my side rather easily, and it was the same for Lotte. Was it because I was a Tamer? Or was it just because I showed how domineering I was like Lotte said? Were their own lives more important than the command? Or was there something special about Plene and Lotte? For now, I had no way of knowing.</p><br/><p>[Get on, Hero.]</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Excuse me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Mmm.]</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I let my comrades ride too?\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s unpleasant. The only one I acknowledge is Hero, my master.]</p><br/><p>She called herself my partner and Taming definitely worked, but it looked like it didn\u2019t mean she would be completely obedient. With a bitter smile, I nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, it can\u2019t be helped then. Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t fall. Gryaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>Lotte opened her jaws and let out a scream. Then, she charged straight towards the drake. I raised my spear, and the constant lightning strikes from the sky strengthened Spirit Aura.</p><br/><p>[Where did you get that!?]</p><br/><p>[If you want, you can try to entice one of the nearby wyverns!]</p><br/><p>After replying to father\u2019s message, I looked ahead. Although the connection between Lotte and me wasn\u2019t as deep as my connection with Ruyue, as expected of Queen of the Wyverns, Lotte aptly dodged the drake\u2019s flames and flew past its front paw.</p><br/><p>In that instant, I used Elemental Blade and slashed its front paw. A strong explosion of lightning occurred upon impact, bursting the drake\u2019s scales and scorching its flesh.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaa! You bitch, you dare betray us!?]</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s better than becoming your dinner!]</p><br/><p>The drake became enraged and stomped, causing the entire canyon to crack. Because of the falling boulders, people on the bottom of the canyon were busy running for their lives. Hoping that my companions were safe, I aimed my spear at it again.</p><br/><p>[I will have you!]</p><br/><p>The drake flashed its eyes and glared at me. At that moment, however, a flurry of bullets pierced through the top of its jaws. I was surprised from how accurate the shots were. From his helicopter, Pepper had accurately attacked the spot I struck earlier with my spear. I couldn\u2019t help but be amazed by his skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cT.K., you got yourself a cool mount! That spear too, how cool!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pepper flew next to Lotte, shouting with a loud voice that did not lose to the roaring monsters. With a grin, I retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood shots, Pepper!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t much!\u201d</p><br/><p>We wished each other luck and immediately separated. The drake\u2019s flame laser shot through the air between us. Meanwhile, all the rankers resting at their lodging and the rankers that were scattered throughout the Field Dungeon were gathering. There were about 70 of them. However, even if more than one third of the world\u2019s S rankers were here, I couldn\u2019t confidently say they could defeat the drake.</p><br/><p>[Come down, I\u2019ll give you a Blessing!]</p><br/><p>Ludia sent me a message. It seemed he had returned after landing the helicopter in the landing zone. I hesitated, but seeing Pepper\u2019s helicopter move like a living creature and drawing the drake\u2019s attention, I nodded. Ludia\u2019s Blessing could not be ignored. It would be best to quickly go get it while Pepper was holding back the drake.</p><br/><p>Lotte landed in the quagmire created by the heavy rain. Looking at Lotte\u2019s large body, both Ludia and Ye-Eun were startled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-It\u2019s twice as big as a wyvern!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a wyvern so big\u2026 How did you\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain later! Ludia, give me the Blessing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn! O Power vested in the earth, O Blessing! We shall fight to protect thee, lend us thy power! O Mitarus, bless and sublimate this power!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You received Mitarus\u2019 Warrior Blessing, strengthened by the power of the earth. For the duration, your health and mana recovery increases greatly, and your attack and defense increases by 20%. On defense, you have a chance to \u2018absolutely defend\u2019 your enemy\u2019s attack.]</p><br/><p>I knew coming down was a good idea! After confirming that I received Ludia\u2019s Blessing, I told Lotte to fly up again. However, before Lotte could flap her wings, Ludia took off her hoody and exposed her face to the rain. Although she was wearing a mask, it couldn\u2019t protect her face from the rain.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, don\u2019t die, okay!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. You be careful too.\u201d</p><br/><p>I lightly retorted with a grin. I wasn\u2019t sure if she could see my face clearly in the rain, but she looked like she was smiling too. Good, she was getting better.</p><br/><p>Ye-Eun was charging at the drake with a dagger in each hand, and I also made Lotte fly toward the drake. It was then. The drake lightly stomped the ground, and a large fissure began to spread out. It was an earthquake attack.</p><br/><p>[Son, let me get on too!]</p><br/><p>[She says she doesn\u2019t want other people riding her!]</p><br/><p>I descended down to the ground like an arrow as I messaged father. No matter how wide the canyon had expanded, it was still a canyon. If the ground began to fissure in the middle, it would be hard for anyone to escape. With Lotte\u2019s claws, I grabbed the people about to fall down into the abyss.</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down, I\u2019ll drop you off in a safe area soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>I put them on top of the canyon. It was probably safer, and it would be easier for me to deal with the drake. Without listening to their thanks, I went off with Lotte again. However, after I spent some time saving people, the ordinary wyverns made me unable to focus on fighting the drake. They were attacking the rankers ferociously, as if to eat a last meal before the drake killed them.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you command the other wyverns?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Between monsters, you either\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lotte flapped her wings and raised her altitude. The weather was getting worse, as the sky rumbled and lightning sparked continuously. I raised my Gluttony Spear. Hearing Peika\u2019s excited shout, I couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cLotte, we\u2019re going to use the skill that wiped out the wyverns earlier. The final target is obviously the drake.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Understood.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then\u2026 Uaaaaak! Everyone, come fight me!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You used Provoke! All enemies in this area bears deep hostility towards you!]</p><br/><p>[Kiaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>The wyverns changed their target from the ability users to me. They flapped their wings violently, as they cried. The drake also faced me and shot a laser straight toward me. The wyverns in the path was completely burned to death. As for me, Lotte dodged its attack with her quick movement.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, Lotte. Well done.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hmph. This much is nothing.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, let\u2019s go! Gale Track!\u201d</p><br/><p>Because of the drake\u2019s laser, it was hard to place twenty wyverns in the path of Gale Track. However, thinking back to the Gale Track Peruta used, I violently circulated Peruta Circuit and led Lotte.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuaaaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>First, second, third\u2026 Changing the trajectory naturally, I killed the fourth, then fifth\u2026! The drake flashed its eyes and shouted.</p><br/><p>[Volcano!]</p><br/><p>\u2018What volcano? There\u2019s no volcano here\u2026 Wait, there is!\u2019</p><br/><p>A scarlet flame erupted from the crack made from the earlier earthquake. Watching the S rankers trying their best to dodge or block it, I hurriedly called Ruyue.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you freeze it?\u201d</p><br/><p>[No problem!]</p><br/><p>When the lava shot toward Lotte and me, Ruyue instantly froze it. She could even freeze lava! We immediately broke through it. Eleventh, twelfth\u2026! Shoot, the lava killed most of the wyverns!</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll fly straight to that bastard now!]</p><br/><p>\u201cGo! Ruyue, block that guy\u2019s attack!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Got it!]</p><br/><p>Immediately after Ruyue nodded, the streaks of rain in front of us transformed into ice crystals and began to spin around Lotte\u2019s body. More and more ice crystals gathered around Lotte, and in the end, we looked like a whirlwind of ice crystals.</p><br/><p>[With your strength, you won\u2019t be able to even scratch me!]</p><br/><p>When the drake shouted, the earth tremored, and the raindrops that had fallen on his body burst out into all directions. How could a Flame Drake wield water!? I knew he had just used his boundless mana to send the water flying, but it was still enough to damage the S rankers. Furthermore, the attack continued, almost like Pepper\u2019s machine gun. Although I was fine thanks to Ruyue\u2019s ice crystal whirlwind, I urged Lotte on, thinking of the S rankers.</p><br/><p>Then, the drake suddenly stopped moving. A black stream of blood burst out of its neck. At the same time, a voice filled with ominous mana rang out throughout the entire canyon.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhaha, ahahahaha! This is fun, very fun! Uuuung, Earth is the greatest!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 Wasn\u2019t that Ye-Eun\u2019s voice!?</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note: N/A</p><br/>\n</div>"}

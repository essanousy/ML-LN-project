The Elementalist That Sealed, The Elementalist That Saves (4)</p><br/><p>\u201cPft! Did you climb the Himalayas or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as I returned, Loretta\u2019s snickering greeted me. Setting aside how Loretta knew about the Himalayas, I sullenly turned my back to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, wait! I\u2019m sorry, wait! I\u2019ll wipe your hair!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta quickly took out a towel, took off my hood, and wiped my hair that was hanging like icicles off the eaves. In the process of her wiping my hair, her body naturally grew closer to my own. In order to ignore the flowery fragrance tickling my nose, I frantically sang the national anthem in my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026 There, all done.\u201d</p><br/><p>After she finished wiping my head, Loretta backed off with a slightly flushed face. Her breathing was a bit rough too. Just how little did she move, that this much exercise made her gasp for breath\u2026? She seemed to hesitate in that state, then asked me carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You\u2019ll catch a cold\u2026 Would you like to come in? You\u2019ll feel better once you take a warm bath. I can get you a change of clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Something felt strange. Although I couldn\u2019t explain it, I felt like I shouldn\u2019t do as she suggested. Even though there couldn\u2019t be anything dangerous in her house, I felt my body was in danger. With a worrying feeling that something I had been protecting would be lost, I shook my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. I might as well take this opportunity to check out my house. I\u2019ll return to the dungeon afterwards.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped then\u2026 Tsk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta clicked her tongue. It was very scary. Putting the towel back in her bosom, she changed the subject and spoke with a brighter expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations on forming a contract with a new elemental. I didn\u2019t even imagine that the elemental would have matching wavelengths with Shin-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what happened to the Elementalist that made Ruyue go mad?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was something I wanted to confirm for certain. Even if it wasn\u2019t now, I wanted to make him pay for it somehow.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was the Elementalist who was an owner of one of the other Special Mansions. He obtained the qualification to enter Fairy Garden from a quest reward, but he was punished for making an elemental go mad, losing his qualification to be a dungeon explorer.\u201d</p><br/><p>The answer was something I didn\u2019t even consider. This was the first time I heard one could lose his qualification as a dungeon explorer. I asked again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe died. Along with him, his world completely fell to ruin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because Loretta\u2019s voice was too light, I felt fear from it. It was different than when Ellos was talking about his lost comrade. Loretta\u2019s voice was completely emotionless, as if what she described was completely normal. Something that she had seen many times, something that was happening even now, and something that would continue to happen many times. She seemed to be describing everyday happenings.</p><br/><p>Because I felt like I would come to fear Loretta if she continued, I tried to say something. But no matter what I wanted to say, I couldn\u2019t say it, because I was afraid of how Loretta would respond. In the end, this was what I chose to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf\u2026 If I couldn\u2019t see Loretta again for whatever reason, I think I\u2019d be really sad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta screamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, wait! Why do you always say important things like that when I\u2019m not ready to record you!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, say that again! Now!\u201d</p><br/><p>While hugging a strange crystal ball she took out of nowhere, Loretta requested while flapping her long ears. Could all elves move their ears freely? Or was it a special right as a Queen Elf?</p><br/><p>The answer didn\u2019t matter. Thanks to her reaction, I felt much more lighthearted. At the moment, she wasn\u2019t scary at all. It was the usual Loretta.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m off, Loretta. Thanks for everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaaaah! You have to repeat what you said before you go, Shin-nim! I\u2019ll give you 10 million gold! 10 million gold!\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside the mansion, the bath was the first place I visited.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s huge.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Huge.]</p><br/><p>[Huge.]</p><br/><p>Although only one person needed to go in, it was as big as a swimming pool. Not to mention, it was full of all sorts of decorations. Across from its large window, I could see the mansion\u2019s garden, letting me enjoy its scenery while taking a bath.</p><br/><p>When I got in the hot bath, my body that had grown cold from the Event Dungeon instantly loosened up. As I would get electrocuted if Peika went in the water, she held back for today, and only the materialized Ruyue, who was big enough for a person to ride on, had followed me into the bath.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s warm.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYep, who says an ice elemental can\u2019t take a bath? It\u2019s not like your body is made of ice.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I feel like I\u2019ll melt.]</p><br/><p>\u201cTry not to.\u201d</p><br/><p>After washing my body, I picked one of the bedrooms in the mansion and slept soundly. As even the bed was enormous, I couldn\u2019t relax. Thankfully, I was able to relax with Ruyue and Peika with me.</p><br/><p>Only then did Ruyue become stable. Perhaps because she had stayed materialized for so long, she instinctively refused to dematerialize herself. After taking ample rest and relieving the built-up tension, she dematerialized before I noticed.</p><br/><p>In truth, I was troubled, since she had been draining my mana since we left the Event Dungeon. Although it wasn\u2019t an overwhelming amount, having a materialized elemental did drain more mana. I couldn\u2019t be freely leaking mana like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stay like this for a day, Ruyue. Starting from tomorrow, we can fight together.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Okay!]</p><br/><p>Just like the dematerialized Peika, the 20 cm Ruyue was very cute. Because she was too cute, I kept patting her, and because Peika sulked, I had to pat her as well.</p><br/><p>Now that I had two elementals, fighting the Skeleton Knight became even easier. After each of us destroyed a group of skeletons, we charged at the Skeleton Knight and crushed him before he could summon more skeletons. When Ruyue materialized, I could ride her into battle, and thus was no longer jealous of the Skeleton Knight\u2019s skeleton mount.</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Aooooooo!]</p><br/><p>Ruyue answered with vigor and kicked off the ground. I felt sorry for Peika who only just learned to materialize, but when fighting the Skeleton Knight, it was better to infuse her into my spear with Spirit Aura than to materialize her. It seemed elementals liked to materialize, as Peika\u2019s dissatisfaction with the newcomer Ruyue was growing.</p><br/><p>[Die, Skull Breakeeeeeer!]</p><br/><p>\u201cRuyue, Ice Breath!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>A breath that froze everything came out of Ruyue\u2019s mouth. While the Skeleton Knight hurriedly blocked it with his sword, the skeleton mount, who was fully exposed to Ice Breath, couldn\u2019t move as the frost filled up its bones.</p><br/><p>In that instant, I struck my spear down vertically. When I pushed my spear in from the frozen skeleton mount\u2019s head to its groin, then pulled out, the skeleton mount crumbled and disappeared into particles.</p><br/><p>After falling on the ground, the Skeleton Knight held up his sword and shouted predictably.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaa, Skull Breaker!]</p><br/><p>[Skeleton Knight uses \u2018Undead Roar!\u2019 Those with living bodies are slowed to 5 percent of their maximum speed!]</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaang!]</p><br/><p>The moment he activated Undead Roar, Ruyue roared and struck down his sword from his hand. Even if materialized, elementals were spiritual! Undead Roar did not affect them. Meanwhile, I used Divine Speed and Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry to cancel the Undead Roar. Holding my spear on Ruyue\u2019s back, I grinned as I aimed it at the Skeleton Knight\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see how many blows you\u2019ll withstand today.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuk, 2 versus 1. It\u2019s unfair!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear that from you who had 200 skeletons!\u201d</p><br/><p>After eating the third Heroic Strike, the Skeleton Knight shattered. Just like always, it disappeared into particles.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou got yourself another elemental. That one isn\u2019t the elemental you usually have with you, right? Your elemental wasn\u2019t visible before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin said as he stared at Ruyue who I was riding on. After rubbing her head softly, I answered Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeika can materialize too now, but\u2026 this child came from a hidden area in Fairy Garden. Her name is Ruyue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that sealed\u2026 Amazing, really.\u201d</p><br/><p>[A draconian! I can smell Fairy Garden\u2019s scent from him!]</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Did that child say something? I can only hear barks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you can\u2019t hear her voice even if she\u2019s materialized. Lin, you\u2019re a Fairy Garden member?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m the vice-guild master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Vice-guild master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>What are you doing here!? At my inquisitive eyes, Lin answered half-heartedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, whatever position with the word \u2018vice\u2019 is always the most leisurely. Vice-chairman, vice-class president, vice-representative, vice-president\u2026 While enjoying my no-working-happy-life, I tried to take some water from the elemental spring to ferment some snake wine, when noonim caught me. So here I am.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t a draconian fermenting snake wine be considered killing one\u2019s own kind? Lin ignored my worry and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, why do you keep repeating the 30th Floor Master raid? Haven\u2019t you finished collecting the Skeleton Knight Set by now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt drops Bone Strengthening Elixirs. I\u2019ve collected them all from the 5th floor on, so I can\u2019t skimp out of them now.\u201d</p><br/><p>At my words, Lin froze.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Did you just say strengthening elixir?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, strengthening elixirs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Haa. I see. With just a single Party Member Scarecrow, of course a strengthening elixir will appear. Hahaha, hahahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin laughed wholeheartedly and left his seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going, Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm? Ah, just wait a bit. Just going to shake noonim by the throat a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go. Lin\u2019s going to get beaten up instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Thanks for stopping me.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I had personally experienced Loretta\u2019s Second Bullet of Destruction, I advised Lin against his actions. Lin simply sat back down. Poor Lin. It seemed he had been hit before. A sense of shared pain flashed between our eyes. We, who were only connected by our bets, began to feel a sense of camaraderie.</p><br/><p>Three weeks after that, I completed my Skeleton Knight grinding.</p><br/><p>[You consumed a Bone Strengthening Elixir, strengthening your bones to the peak! Your strength and constitution both increase by 3. It seems consuming more of this item will have no further effect.]</p><br/><p>[You equipped the Skeleton Knight Set. Your strength and constitution increase by 15. When the Skeleton Knight Set is equipped, you can use \u2018Undead Roar\u2019 once per day.]</p><br/><p>Of course, I instantly extracted Undead Roar and stored it in the 6 o\u2019clock position. Although I wondered if I would ever need to use this skill, I realized I could use it in urgent situations. Then, I could use Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry to get out of the status effect, or use Dragon Skin to endure hits while leaving the battle to my two elementals. As such, I decided to store the skill into the pocket watch.</p><br/><p>[Name: Kang Shin Race: Human Sex: Male</p><br/><p>Class: Elementalist (Sub \u2013 Skill Collector) Title: Skeleton Knight Slayer Rank: Silver 6</p><br/><p>Level: 31</p><br/><p>HP \u2013 12,540/12,540 MP \u2013 7,150/7,150</p><br/><p>Strength \u2013 106(+41) Dexterity \u2013 87(+22) Constitution \u2013 90(+34)</p><br/><p>Intelligence \u2013 20(+12) Magic \u2013 81(+12) Charm \u2013 58(+12) Luck \u2013 21(+12)</p><br/><p>Normal Skills \u2013 High-rank Martial Arts (Lv 3), High-rank Spear Technique (Lv 5), Low-rank Crossbow Marksmanship (Lv 5), Mid-rank Heroic Strike (Lv 5), Mid-rank Provoke (Lv 4), Divine Speed (Lv 3), Return (Lv 2), Mid-rank Dash (Lv 2), Peruta Circuit (Lv 5), Deific Manifestation, Death Counter, Riding.</p><br/><p>Class Skills \u2013 Mid-rank Spirit Mastery (Lv 4), Mid-rank Spirit Aura (Lv 2), Mid-rank Elemental Control (Lv 2), Mid-rank Elemental Contract (Lv 2), Mid-rank Elemental Tempest (Lv 1), Thunder Beast (Lv 2).</p><br/><p>Subclass Skill \u2013 Endow Skill, Spirit of the Collector.]</p><br/><p>[Equipment:</p><br/><p>Power Earrings (Strength +2)</p><br/><p>Flesh Golem\u2019s Second Finger (Strength +7, Constitution +7)</p><br/><p>Skeleton Knight Set (Strength +15, Constitution +15)</p><br/><p>Arachne\u2019s Black Earthen Spear (Strength +5, Dexterity +10, Poison damage on all basic attacks, inflicts poison status effect.)]</p><br/><p>[Collector\u2019s Pocket Watch:</p><br/><p>1 o\u2019clock: Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry</p><br/><p>2 o\u2019clock: Vengeful Spirit\u2019s Wail</p><br/><p>3 o\u2019clock: Dark Thunder Explosion</p><br/><p>4 o\u2019clock: Dragon Skin</p><br/><p>5 o\u2019clock: Diehard</p><br/><p>6 o\u2019clock: Undead Roar]</p><br/><p>[3 Event Dungeon clears, 1 Event Raid clear, accumulated bonus stats: 6]</p><br/><p>[Current skill points: 11]</p><br/><p>[Seven title-effects: (Orc Lord Slayer, Wraith Queen Slayer, Dark Ratman Slayer, Giant Ghoul Slayer, Skeleton Knight Slayer, Lizard Knight Master, Hermes).

Really.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and go to the 31st floor. Damn, there\u2019s only a bit over two months left. If you want the cape, you better hurry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin shouted as if he had already given up. I smiled lightly and answered him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf someone was watching, he\u2019d think you really wanted to give it to me. Regardless, I\u2019m not going to the 31st floor right now. I have dinner soon, so I\u2019ll come back tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm?

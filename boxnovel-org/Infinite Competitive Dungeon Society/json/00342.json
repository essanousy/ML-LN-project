Demon Lord (5)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>\u201cThe Demon Lord is indeed in there.\u201d</p><br/><p>After flying to the aerial dungeon, I immediately recognized the energy inside it.</p><br/><p>I had met the Demon Lord in the Luka continent. What I felt from him back then matched the energy I felt in the dungeon.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Shin, what are you going to do? The land transmittance isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked down on the ground. Even if everyone went a bit insane from the continued calamities, I couldn\u2019t just leave them to die.</p><br/><p>In truth, I didn\u2019t really care what other people did or what they called me. I was only annoyed because they were targeting other member of Revival.</p><br/><p>I was protecting humanity because I could. If people important to me had to get hurt or killed, I would abandon humanity without hesitation. That was one thing I never changed my mind about.</p><br/><p>So from now, we wouldn\u2019t move separately. Of course, only a few of the strongest members would enter the Demon Lord\u2019s dungeon, so I had to think of a solution for the members who would stay behind in case powerful demons remaining in the Luka continent crossed over while we were gone.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Right, I can just deal with them first.\u201d</p><br/><p>I clapped my hands at my sudden insight.</p><br/><p>\u201cHwaya, can you show me the areas that land transmittance hasn\u2019t happened in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Areas that land transmittance hasn\u2019t occurred, in other words, these were the areas that demons could come to from now. Picturing the terrain of the Luka continent in my head, I nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll need one hours and thirty minutes in the worst case. That should be quick enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, what are you thinking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, Hwaya, is Ina in Beyond?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, she should be in the First Dungeon. Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want you and Ina to support me with mana. There\u2019s something I want to do before I go into the Demon Lord\u2019s dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You need more mana on top of that absurd amount you already have?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I can\u2019t use all of my mana right now, so I need your help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya tilted her head, but realizing that I made my decision, she nodded and messaged Ina.</p><br/><p>Ina immediately ran out of the dungeon and flew up to us. Ina had grown immensely in the past month. The moment she left the dungeon, I could feel the colossal amount of mana she carried.</p><br/><p>Of course, I had called her precisely because I expected to have grown this much, but it was still surprisingly nonetheless. Solely in terms of quantity of mana, she might surpass Hwaya and Daisy. It was truly shocking, especially considering she was only 10 years old.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m back, Ina.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ina smiled sweetly and charged towards me. This charge was strong enough to injure even the Beast King, but I easily received Ina into my embrace.</p><br/><p>Ina sniffed my scent like a dog before digging her head into my chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is Daddy! Where were you? Ina wanted to see you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s the real Daddy. Sorry for being late, Ina.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Ina acting spoiled like Hwaya did, I smirked as I patted her. Hwaya looked at us with a complicated expression before asking Ina.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho do you like more, Ina? Daddy or Mommy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Well if you ask that now, of course she\u2019d say it\u2019s me\u2026</p><br/><p>After spoiling Ina a bit more, I asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIna, Daddy has something he needs to do. Can you help me with your mana?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn! I have lots of mana! I can give lots to Daddy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ina seemed happy to be of help, shouting joyfully as she flew around the sky. Seeing her so cheerful after what she must have gone through in the past month put a smile on my face.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we start now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ina and Hwaya placed their hands on my hand. As I received their hot and cold mana, I released my own mana and combined them into a single ball. In just a few seconds, close to two million points of mana agglomerated in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>I held the ball in on hand. In the next instant, a halo shot up on each of my two horns and began to spin. I held up the ball of mana and threw it at the dungeon in front of me.</p><br/><p>\u201cStay put for just two hours!\u201d</p><br/><p>My words became the trigger for a magic spell. From the ball of mana I threw, platinum colored chains shot out and coiled around the huge dungeon. Hwaya seemed to have felt something from my spell.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the next two hours, not even Sherafina will be able to undo those chains. Of course, that means the Demon Lord also won\u2019t be able to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Just where were you for the past month?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like how my enemies know about the dungeon, I simply studied for a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>I gave a light reply as I watched the chains completely encase the dungeon. At that moment, a black ripple spread across the chains and a deep voice rang out.</p><br/><p>[Huhu\u2026 Hero, you\u2014]</p><br/><p>\u201cShut it.\u201d</p><br/><p>I waved my hand and added more mana. The voice was cut off and the dungeon fell silent. Now, no one would be able to enter or leave the dungeon.</p><br/><p>The Demon Lord used the dungeon\u2019s power for himself to perform this cute trick. This is what he gets for not expecting that someone else could do the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Shin, if the Demon Lord could have come whenever he wanted\u2026 Why didn\u2019t he when you weren\u2019t here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, Kain is in Earth. Just Kain might not have deterred him, but he didn\u2019t know exactly when I would come back, so he used his subordinates to test the waters.\u201d</p><br/><p>I was certain. The Demon Lord knew that Earth had someone on the same level as my old self. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have encaged himself in a dungeon.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 You mean\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere can only be one reason that he brought over a dungeon when he could have come through a land transmittance. It\u2019s because he didn\u2019t want to fight me and Kain at the same time. The dungeon he\u2019s in right now has an entrance limit. Kain and I can never enter together. At best, only me and two other Revival members would be able to go in. The one who created this dungeon isn\u2019t Sherafina, but the Demon Lord. The Demon Lord completely discovered the dungeon\u2019s mechanism.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Then what was the point of us climbing the dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be here if we didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>I gave a simple rebuttal. Hwaya immediately acquiesced and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, I wouldn\u2019t be able to stand next to Shin if I didn\u2019t climb the dungeon. Huhu, if I think about it like that, I\u2019m quite thankful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied with a sigh. But of course, I knew Hwaya understood what I really meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, once I carry out what I\u2019m planning, the Demon Lord will notice it and try to leave the dungeon. Until now, he didn\u2019t know when I would be coming back, but now, he would know for sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI plan on going to the Luka continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya understood what I meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the demons in the Luka continent would be able to contact the Demon Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. So once the Demon Lord knows I can\u2019t come back to Earth, he\u2019ll try to kill Kain. But since I closed the dungeon, he won\u2019t be able to for the next two hours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, are you trying to do what I think you\u2019re trying to do\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>I replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to sweep the Luka continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. The Demon Lord is here, so no one in the Luka continent can be my match.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwaya became lost for words at my confident tone. Just when I thought she\u2019d stay silent, she blurted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin, you\u2019re super cocky now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut also really cool.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that too.\u201d</p><br/><p>I grinned at her and continued my words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe monster continent might move too. That\u2019s why I\u2019m leaving you on Earth. We already took a massive blow because of their tricks, we don\u2019t know what the monsters would do while we\u2019re focusing on the demons. So stay on guard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut didn\u2019t their Five Kings die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s a monster above them. We don\u2019t know if the Five Kings were the only powerful monsters, so please, I feel like they\u2019ll do something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Will you be fine on your own?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>After confirming that the dungeon was sealed tightly, I contacted Kain.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Kang Shin. Kain, I\u2019m going to leave Earth for a bit. Please be on standby.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re back. Did you get stronger?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026 I\u2019ll finish everything before the day ends.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Huhu, I like how straightforward you are. Good. I\u2019ll come soon.]</p><br/><p>Soon after Kain\u2019s reply, a tremendous energy descended above our guild house. It was Kain. Feeling his mana, I nodded in satisfaction and contacted others.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hey! You\u2019re safe!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you now?\u201d</p><br/><p>[In the First Dungeon! I\u2019m on the 91st floor!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to climb the dungeon anymore. Come back to Earth. There\u2019s something I need you to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Just say the words!]</p><br/><p>I told Leon my request.</p><br/><p>[\u2026 Is that okay?]</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the consequences and just do it. You should be able to, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I can, but\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the succubi support you.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Understood.]</p><br/><p>Leon also began to move. Good, with this, I made all the preparations I could.</p><br/><p>Before I left, I entered the dungeon for the last time and went to Resting Place of the Angels. I came to get Plene, but surprisingly, both Lotte and Licorice were there too.</p><br/><p>\u201cLotte, Licorice!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cH-Hero. I knew you were safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lotte rubbed her eyes the moment she saw me and greeted me cheerfully. I grinned and stroked her head.</p><br/><p>I then turned towards Licorice. For some reason, it didn\u2019t feel like I haven\u2019t seen her in a while even if she looked different after her awakening as the empress.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, did you come to take Plene?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Licorice, I\u2019ll leave Earth to you. Help Leon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it. I already know everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, Licorice knew everything on my mind. I didn\u2019t know exactly when it happened, but Licorice and I came to share a consciousness just like she did with the other succubi.</p><br/><p>It was around the time I finished absorbing the dragon\u2019s power. I suddenly knew that Licorice completed her awakening as an empress and realized that a new link between us was made. This link wouldn\u2019t be blocked or severed no matter what or who was interfering.</p><br/><p>Licorice had gotten stronger, and as we could transfer our thoughts to each other, she was someone I needed by my side.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle bat\u2026 How foul.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, this is the difference between our Leagues!\u201d</p><br/><p>Despite Lotte getting stronger, the two of them stayed the same. I grinned once again and patted Lotte one more time.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, Lotte. Wait with Licorice for just two hours. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go Plene. I need your help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn!\u201d</p><br/><p>I brought Plene and used my version of Dimensional Travel.</p><br/><p>When Dimensional Travel completed successfully, Plene and I found ourselves in the place where we used Return to go back to Earth in the past.</p><br/><p>And this place was surrounded by demons, as if someone had told them I would be coming. When they saw me, they seemed frightened out of their minds. It was rather funny.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, the Hero really\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRun! We need to live!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all dead, we\u2019re screwed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, please\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>They were acting like the end of the world was upon them. I couldn\u2019t blame them. There was no way they couldn\u2019t feel my magic power.</p><br/><p>I spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou might be able to kill ordinary people, but you won\u2019t be able to kill me. You could have lived peacefully in Luka continent without invading another world, but that\u2019s not what you did. I will no longer let you be.\u201d</p><br/><p>I raised my hand into the sky.</p><br/><p>[I am Dortu. Creating a mirror.]</p><br/><p>Dortu\u2019s power activated, and a giant metallic mirror appeared in the air. I looked up. The power of my eyes dyed the mirror, and in an instant, the light reflected off the mirror covered more than 10% of the entire continent.</p><br/><p>I have arrived.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

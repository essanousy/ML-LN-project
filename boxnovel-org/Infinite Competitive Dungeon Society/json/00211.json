The Third Taming (2)</p><br/><p>Although I was still positioned to stab my spear into her, the Succubus Queen let her defense down. Then, she grabbed my spear and pushed it away.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you take this crude thing away? I only want to be stabbed by Dear Husband\u2019s spear in bed\u2026 Kyak!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I smacked her head. It should have hurt.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make coarse jokes. If you want to talk, let\u2019s talk. I\u2019ll listen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu, you\u2019d be perfect if you weren\u2019t so violent. Really, humans\u2026 Fine. Let\u2019s go have a nice talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>She rubbed the place I hit then snapped her fingers. The succubus that led me here entered through the door with the other succubi and began to tidy up the place quickly. Soon, a table and two chairs had been set up with wine and two glasses. I couldn\u2019t understand what they wanted from me.</p><br/><p>Regardless, it was clear that they didn\u2019t want to fight me. Other than Ruyue, I sent the elementals back. With Ruyue\u2019s power, I cleaned myself up and put her on standby in case anything happened. Seeing me clean myself in an instant, the Succubus Queen looked at me with interest.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Surprisingly, you\u2019re a man of culture! That magic, no\u2026 elemental?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>I sat down across from her. She pushed a glass of wine toward me, but I wasn\u2019t stupid enough to drink alcohol in the middle of an enemy\u2019s territory. When I snorted, she spoke a bit depressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least say a toast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, good. So, what were we talking about\u2026? Our wedding date?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWant to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a part of it\u2026 Fine, I\u2019ll start from the beginning. From the moment I lost against them.\u201d</p><br/><p>My ears perked up. I didn\u2019t expect to hear anything important, but who lost to who?</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you heard of Elesia?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that someone\u2019s name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the name of a world. The world we were trying to invade and the world we lost against.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you be more detailed? Who\u2019s we?\u201d</p><br/><p>I pulled the chair I was sitting on closer in to the table. Her Evil Eyes flashed with joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cObviously, I\u2019m talking about the Mare Alliance. The demon continent Enesis\u2019 rulers, the Mares.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s Enesis?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA continent where the world\u2019s power disappeared. To be precise, it was stolen by Elesia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Stolen by Elesia? Didn\u2019t you say you were trying to steal it from Elesia?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? You didn\u2019t know about this? \u2026Do you not know why your world is being invaded?\u201d</p><br/><p>I froze. In my head, I struggled to make sense of what she said. First, I organized what I knew about the enemies invading my world.</p><br/><p>There was one that became greedy for more world\u2019s powers even after obtaining one, but I set that one aside for now. Normally, worlds that lost their \u2018world\u2019s power\u2019, which allowed them to continue to exist, invaded other worlds to steal their worlds\u2019 powers. Worlds that were being invaded usually had races similar to humans, while the invading side were always demons or monsters.</p><br/><p>Until now, I hadn\u2019t really thought about how the invading forces had lost their worlds\u2019 powers. Perhaps, I was avoiding thinking about it as I had never even asked Loretta.</p><br/><p>However, what the Succubus Queen just said threw a rock in a still pond. Why Earth was being invaded? The forces of Enesis should have tried to steal Elesia\u2019s power, but Elesia stole Enesis\u2019 power first?</p><br/><p>\u201cYour troubled face is so cute. I was wrong. You must be popular with women.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, explain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll tell you everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, she emptied her glass. I poured more wine in her glass, then picked up my own and gulped it down. No matter what poison was inside it, I felt like I needed to drink it. Of course, the wine had a heavenly taste.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know how a world is born?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, I don\u2019t either. But I know this. There is a definite limit to the number of worlds that can exist. At a certain point in the past, the infinitely growing number of worlds reached that limit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe number of worlds reached\u2026 a limit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you an example. Let\u2019s say you have a bookshelf that can hold up to 300 books. At first, you bought all the books you could because you wanted to fill up the bookshelf, and before you noticed, it did. But, without realizing that was the case, you bought even more books. What would you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBuy a new bookshelf?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly one bookshelf can fit in your room.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d sell or throw away the books I don\u2019t read.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>She clapped as if I\u2019d answered a difficult question.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe number of worlds became too high, so it needed be lowered. There wasn\u2019t enough worlds\u2019 powers for all worlds to have one. I don\u2019t know who, but the Lofty One came up with a solution.\u201d</p><br/><p>To pair up all worlds.</p><br/><p>With that, she filled up my glass. I immediately grabbed it, and as she wanted, I clinked glasses with the Succubus Queen.</p><br/><p>\u201cGulp\u2026 Huu. Pair up worlds?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep. It was an excellent way to halve the number of worlds. Just like that, countless number of worlds became paired. Enesis and Elesia was one of them. Between these two worlds, the one with less mana, or in other worlds, the weaker world became the focus of the world\u2019s power. In a way, it was a way of balancing them out. Everyone knows that defense is easier than offense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean\u2026 the current system of invaders and defenders was created by someone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Without the world\u2019s power, no world can continue to exist. As a result, one world was left with no choice but to invade and steal the other world\u2019s power. Regardless of whether the defender succeeds or fails, two worlds would decrease to one. With this, the number of worlds would successfully be halved.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t that mean neither side was at fault? After all, the invaders were forced into their positions.</p><br/><p>I was dumbfounded. What we were doing until now wasn\u2019t a heroic tale of defeating evil monsters nor an adventurous tale of exploring mysterious dungeons. Rather, it was a simple competition for survival.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too shaken. It\u2019s not like what you have to do changed. You just have to protect what you need to protect. A thief may have needed to steal to survive, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that a thief is a thief.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT-Thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why was she comforting me? Though I was thankful, I was also a bit confused. Now that I thought about it, wasn\u2019t she the one in the invaders\u2019 position? Why was she telling me all this?</p><br/><p>She seemed to have realized what I was thinking, as she continued her explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, so Enesis invaded Elesia. But, we lost. It lasted hundreds of years. Lord led everyone and all Mares participated. But I fought half-heartedly so that I could protect my clan members. That\u2019s why many of us are still alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you lost, how are you still alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? You don\u2019t know this either? Isn\u2019t it obvious? Look where we are, and you\u2019ll know your answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>A full smile bloomed on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn wars, it\u2019s rare that victors completely wipe out the losing side. Of course, Lord and other powerful members had to die, but my clan wasn\u2019t strong enough to catch their attention\u2026 That\u2019s when the dungeon stepped in. To give us life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLife?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere do you think all the monsters in the dungeon came from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>I remembered the Lizard Knight and Dullahan I first met. I remembered their voices of despair that I did my best to ignore. The Succubus Queen grinned as she looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey were feeling stifled\u2026 and crying in despair.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep. It\u2019s like what those losers said. Monsters, Mares, Demons, and other invaders that didn\u2019t have the courage to die with their worlds joined hands with the dungeon. Eternally dying, yet being unable to die. The cursed immortality.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t say anything, especially because I had somewhat expected it. The dungeon helped us, the defenders. In that case, it was clear how the invaders viewed the dungeon. They undoubtedly hated it to their bones, so much so that they\u2019d give their lives to get back at it. Even so, they joined the dungeon for a chance at life.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you succeed in defending your world, the ones that failed will probably join the dungeon. Of course, with their leaders killed. They will then help grow other worlds\u2019 defenders. Easy, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cObviously, I\u2019m different. Do I look like the Mares that attacked you in the dungeon? Those Succubi that fell to being mere Floor Masters?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I haven\u2019t seen the Floor Master yet anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI refused. To be more precise, I set a condition. I didn\u2019t want to live a cruel life where my clan members and I died repeatedly.\u201d</p><br/><p>She spread out her arms. The entire castle seemed to be breathing like a living creature.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will cooperate. I will help the defenders grow. But, I will only give myself to the one who has the qualification.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I set a very strict condition. This person had to be a man who was extremely strong, extremely fast, extremely charming, and extremely elegant. Oh, and he had to have extreme resistance against charming. Simply put, it\u2019s you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m speechless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dumfounded, I gulped down the glass for the third time. The Succubus Queen pouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u201cspeechless\u201d? It makes sense! I was born as a Succubus Queen, but I had to devote my life to battle without ever knowing men. Do you know how depressing that is? I didn\u2019t want to die without finding a husband, but I didn\u2019t want to become a battle machine for the dungeon. Since I was planning on accepting a husband, isn\u2019t it better if he\u2019s fabulous? Most of all, I wanted someone who would love me as I was without falling for my charm! Of course, didn\u2019t really believe a man could resist my charm, but\u2026 huhu, I was so surprised when my charm didn\u2019t work even after I amplified it with magic! That\u2019s when I felt fate!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou call that fate?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the reward I got for waiting for countless years. One time, I got frightened, thinking I\u2019d die of age in this boring castle. But look, I met you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said I\u2019d accept you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen are you going to kill me? A pitiful beautiful girl like me? You\u2019re going to kill someone connected to you by fate? Un? Are you going to massacre me and my clan members who faced extinction just by being born in Enesis?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEek\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>This girl, she revealed everything on purpose! Just in case I killed everyone! She cusped her hands on her chest, and with tear eyes, she pushed her face up against mine. Her charming face was youthful like a teen\u2019s, yet somewhat erotic\u2026 First, I flicked her forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cOw! You hit me again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you in.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said shortly. Her expression brightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally!? I love you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first thing we did was fight, love my ass! I just didn\u2019t want to kill someone who has no hostility against me, especially when I have a way for her survival.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, looks like Dear Husband is rather inexperienced with love. Love isn\u2019t something anyone can explain and comprehend. The moment someone tries to explain love, its value drops.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then what, you know love!? I wanted to throw the question back to her, but upon thinking about it, she was the Succubus Queen. As she\u2019d at least know love more than me, I stayed silent.</p><br/><p>She got up from her seat, pushed the table aside, then approached me and grabbed my hand. As it was unlikely that she\u2019d try to do something now, I let her be. She happily kissed the back of my hand and looked up to me. Her eyes shone with sparkling pink.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Husband, vest me a name that connects us together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Licorice.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment\u2026</p><br/><p>[You made an achievement of taming the SSS+ rank boss monster, \u2018Succubus Queen.\u2019 You obtained 3 skill point. Current skill points: 5]</p><br/><p>[Taming became level 5.

My clan of 214 succubi will forever serve you as our husband.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>I had instantly gotten 214 more mouths to feed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

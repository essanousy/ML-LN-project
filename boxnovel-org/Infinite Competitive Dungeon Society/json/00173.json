Do you know who that is?\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day, seeing Loretta act completely nonchalant, I decided to give up asking her about what happened with Desert Scorpion. Instead, I asked her the other question I had. If Desert Scorpion\u2019s guild master told me not to get involved with this person, I figured that Loretta knew about her as well. However, as soon as she heard what I said, she took out her axe and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, who\u2019s that woman, Shin-nim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who asked! Also, aren\u2019t you taking that axe out way too often lately!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Shin-nim is the bad one for asking about other women knowing how I feel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s bad is Loretta\u2019s head! Didn\u2019t I explain!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I\u2019ll stop joking and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were really joking, right? You won\u2019t use that axe, right!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Huhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta simply answered with a bright smile. That meant she wasn\u2019t joking, right..?</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, Shin-nim. I can\u2019t tell Shin-nim even if I want to. But I think Shin-nim already has somewhat of an idea who she is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do\u2026 yeah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know exactly who Daisy Ectradion was. However, the only thing he knew about me was that I had a god\u2019s true name and that I was Beyond\u2019s explorer. In other words, this Daisy Ectradion was likely to be Beyond\u2019s second explorer. It was the strange woman who offered to take my corpse.</p><br/><p>I was concerned about her. Just like the first explorer, it seemed she didn\u2019t want to leave her mansion. Why wasn\u2019t she exploring the dungeon? Perhaps, Desert Scorpion\u2019s guild master had something to do with it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you want to stroll through the Residential Area and asked around?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you linking your arms with mine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo make the best use of our time, huhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, Loretta dragged me off to the First Dungeon\u2019s Residential Area. However, the people that saw us together acted rather\u2026 strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, is that guy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRevival\u2019s guild master, right? The holder of Evil Eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEvil Eye holders are even rarer than holders of god\u2019s true names\u2026 There are less than ten of them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hear he has a god\u2019s true name too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, my Evil Eyes gave away my identity! They had to be talking about me since I was probably the only one who recently gained Evil Eyes. However, their following words made me drip with sweat.</p><br/><p>\u201cI only found out with this incident that administrative guilds also have ranks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at him! He looks like a natural women magnet. It\u2019s not surprising that he could even seduce the Fairy Garden\u2019s famous queen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re walking around quite publicly. Did Desert Scorpion not know about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t appear often in the Residential Area. It looks like he\u2019s trying to show off right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe sent Desert Scorpion to their death so it\u2019s understandable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDesert Scorpion simply paid the price for their deeds. They\u2019re the ones who bribed an administrative guild to try to destroy an innocent new guild. They got what they deserved.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked back at Loretta. She was happily humming as she pressed her body against me. I sang the national anthem inwardly and asked Loretta.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, tell me honestly. What\u2019s your goal for walking around this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m advertising to everyone so other women won\u2019t bother Shin-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m warning others who might bother Shin-nim or Shin-nim\u2019s guild!\u201d</p><br/><p>She was brutally honest. It seemed she wasn\u2019t really avoiding the matter with Desert Scorpion.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, I didn\u2019t think there would still be such a dirty guild remaining in the First Dungeon! I got slightly angry and ended up being a bit overzealous. The administrative guild almost became four, huhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF-Four!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Shin-nim, it was resolved peacefully. All administrative guild masters are close friends!\u201d</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a liar here! It seemed Loretta understood what I was thinking, as she put her hand on her mouth and smiled with her eyes curled to a crescent shape.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about. Everything I did was within my authority, so there won\u2019t be anyone who won\u2019t acknowledge it. Harming other guilds or explorers for the benefit of one\u2019s own guild is strictly forbidden in the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, then.\u201d</p><br/><p>All the attention we were getting was starting to get annoying. When I glanced over them, they seemed to have thought I would attack with my Evil Eyes as they all turned away scared.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, I\u2019m so happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the extremely happy expression on Loretta\u2019s face, I could only smile wryly. Since she did it for my sake, I decided to enjoy this moment as well.</p><br/><p>Soon, however, a man stood in front of us, blocking our way. It was Desert Scorpion\u2019s guild master!</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, really. You made it sound like you could do whatever you wanted with the First Dungeon, but it seems there are proper laws in this place, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t be the end of it! No, this is only the beginning!\u201d</p><br/><p>He gritted his teeth and shouted. Of course, purely in terms of strength, he was stronger than me. I could feel him already trying to overwhelm me with spirit. Trying to kill me my spirit in the middle of the Residential Area\u2026 This guy had to be nuts. I held Loretta back, who was about to step forward angrily. I made up my mind to try out the Evil Eyes.</p><br/><p>I would get in huge trouble if I accidentally turned bystanders into stone, but I suspected that the magic resistasnce of an S ranked guild\u2019s guild master wouldn\u2019t be lower than SS+ rank. Even if the petrification went through, I could always cancel it, so there was no worry. In the first place, the spirit he emitted was also threatening to people with low abilities, so we were doing the same thing.</p><br/><p>I poured mana into my eyes, and the golden Evil Eyes began to shine brilliantly. Even I could tell that a bright light was coming out of my eyes. Desert Scorpion\u2019s guild master\u2019s spirit immediately subsided. He gritted his teeth to hold his stance.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk! You\u2026 You can already wield the Evil Eyes so freely\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but I\u2019m a lot stronger than you think. I\u2019m warning you now. I\u2019m already busy with everything going on in my world, so don\u2019t bother me. If you do, I\u2019ll make you regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa\u2026! I already lost everything because of you. I have nothing left to lose!\u201d</p><br/><p>I smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of me? If someone overheard, they\u2019d think I was the guild master of a large guild that bribed an administrative guild to harass and threaten small guilds that got in our way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Mark my words. You\u2019ll regret what you did! Remember that you made an enemy of the holder of Scizarnath\u2019s true name. I\u2019ll kill you one day, Earth\u2019s Hero!\u201d</p><br/><p>He\u2019s saying that knowing that I\u2019m Earth\u2019s Hero? How can he act like he\u2019s the victim when he simply paid for the crimes he committed? I guess the dungeon has people like him too\u2026 No, perhaps, being an explorer for dozens of years is what made him change.</p><br/><p>In any case, I wasn\u2019t afraid of him whatsoever. I saw his strength during the raid. I knew that he had a god\u2019s true name and that he was currently much stronger than me. However, the time we spent was different. He said he\u2019d kill me one day? Fool, you already lost your chance when you said \u2018one day\u2019 instead of \u2018a week\u2019 or \u2018a month\u2019!</p><br/><p>I deactivated the Evil Eyes\u2019 power with a smirk. Only then did he pick himself up properly, still glaring at me intently. It was then that I remembered something. He was the best person to ask about Daisy Ectradion.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Daisy Ectradion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re Beyond\u2019s explorer, you should know that deserter wench. I already warned you. Don\u2019t get involved with her. Don\u2019t think about helping her either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDeserter\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, she\u2019s a filthy deserter! A deserter that dared to defy me\u2026! Just like you, I will kill her too.\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned around, leaving me behind. However, Loretta caught him with his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cHold on, customer. How can you just leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFairy Garden\u2019s master\u2026! You\u2019re not satisfied with taking everything from me? What else do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course there\u2019s something I want.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta tilted her head like he just asked the most obvious question.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou announced that you\u2019d kill another world\u2019s explorer. You can\u2019t be expecting me to gloss over it. Plus, you mentioned another world\u2019s name and threatened to kill its Hero\u2026 As the dungeon\u2019s administrator, I cannot let that slide.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what, you\u2019re going to kill me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta smiled brightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom this moment on, you are no longer a dungeon explorer. Moreover, you\u2019ll have to promise that you\u2019ll never do anything to hurt Shin-nim. Through a Soul Contract, of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD-Don\u2019t be ridiculous! You can\u2019t do that to me! What right do you have to\u2014\u201c</p><br/><p>At that moment, a door suddenly opened up. He tried to enter it, then screamed. The door was closing before he could pass through it. Loretta said with a slightly lowered tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can see how much Sipua is looking out for you. Threatening another explorer is a grave offense that is strictly forbidden in the dungeon. When that explorer is a Hero, the punishment becomes unimaginably heavy. Dungeon explorers are expected to help each other. Didn\u2019t Sipua teach you properly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou freely oppressed others with Sipua\u2019s backing, so you have expected that the same could happen to you. It seems you prevented explorers that went against your guild from using the Residential Area\u2019s facilities? You should be glad you aren\u2019t being punished by the Lord personally. If it wasn\u2019t for me, you wouldn\u2019t be able to keep your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou. Who are\u2026 Kuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>He knelt on the ground. I widened my eyes. I could feel that his strength disappearing. His soul\u2019s league, his powerful constitution, and boundless mana, they were all disappearing! Now, he only had the strength of a level 30 explorer. It was probably the mana and strength he built up through training outside of levels. Most of it should be from the god\u2019s true name.</p><br/><p>A sparkling piece of paper appeared in mid-air. Loretta caught it and took out a pen.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s see\u2026 What should I write to make you suffer more\u2026 Huhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, was the reason we strolled around the Residential Area today\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask me that. Just think of it as a good wife helping her husband!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta expected us to run into him. No, she baited him to come. Once he saw us, he would undoubtedly threaten me, and Loretta would then punish him thoroughly.</p><br/><p>Everything had gone as she planned.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, I can\u2019t quite understand. How can someone lose his qualification as an explorer so easily?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? Heroes receive special treatment in the dungeon too. At the very least, they shouldn\u2019t be threatened by other explorers, should they? Of course, if someone threatens to murder a Hero, he must face a grave punishment. And the one who administers that punishment is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta pointed her pen toward herself. Her calm smile gave me a chill.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad that I could catch him before Sipua got to him! I was worried that she warned him beforehand!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 bitch\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know that cursing at an administrative guild\u2019s guild master is also punishable? Regardless, I\u2019ll be adding to your list of crimes.\u201d</p><br/><p>I came to understand that making an administrative guild\u2019s guild master was disastrous.</p><br/><p>Then, a woman appeared mid-air.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoretta, you! How could you do this to my Lod\u2014 kyak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to be disciplined too, Sipua. Stay put in your guild house and wait for your punishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was instantly sent back by a wave of Loretta\u2019s hand. After taking care of her like swatting a fly, Loretta threw the contract in her hand at the man gasping for breath on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuietly read it and sign it. If you do, your punishments won\u2019t increase any further. Do it for Sipua, who cares about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKu\u2026. Kuaaaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like that, he lost his qualification as an explorer and was kicked out. Furthermore, he was forbidden from meddling in my affairs in any way. Everything happened under Loretta\u2019s leadership. Seeing me stare at her blankly, Loretta said carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim is busy with clearing the dungeon and matters back on Earth, so I can\u2019t have Shin-nim distracted by trash like him. I can only do these types of things\u2026 D-Do you think I went overboard? I simply did what was within my authority to do, don\u2019t hate me\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No, I was just surprised because Loretta sent him away so cleanly. Thank you. It\u2019s just that\u2026 I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be threatening even if I left him aloneo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, that kind of thinking is na\u00efve.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta\u2019s expression suddenly became more serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that Shin-nim is the only special person. Even after losing their power as a dungeon explorer, there are many people who can threaten Shin-nim. Not making any enemies or cleanly destroying all enemies. These are the only choices Shin-nim has. Of course, I think the former is much better. Though most explorers also think the same way, there are always outliers like that trash. So if Shin-nim makes enemies, make sure to tell me about them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta continued with a firm voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take out the trash.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 From now on, I\u2019ll take care of it, so Loretta doesn\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was right, I was na\u00efve. I had the Dimensional Travel skill. If I really wanted to harass another world\u2019s explorer, I could think of many ways to do so. Although I wouldn\u2019t do something so troublesome, there were many crazies in the world; ones that did things without thinking about the consequences, ones that only lived for revenge.</p><br/><p>It seemed I relied too much on the assumption that personality was part of the qualification to be a First Dungeon explorer. I should have known that people could change. Only after Loretta took care of the dirty work did I realize this. Really, I was wasting my intelligence stat.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf possible, don\u2019t make enemies. If I do, destroy them thoroughly. That\u2019s it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf possible, it\u2019s better to use Soul Contracts to tie their lives down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 Still, Loretta\u2019s methods were iron-blooded!</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, the wisest thing Shin-nim could have done was to not participate in the raid. Although Shin-nim\u2019s guild is strong, it\u2019s still not in a position of absolute strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen from now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine now. Fortunately, we crushed a guild and its guild master. I doubt anyone will try to be Shin-nim\u2019s enemy. It really turned out well!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta smiled as if to ask for my agreement. I didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cR-Rather than that, since I got the information I wanted, I\u2019m going to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo Daisy Ectradion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, mm\u2026 Yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta linked her arms with mine again and shouted joyfully. I had somewhat expected she would do so.</p><br/><p>With a bitter smile, I headed to Beyond\u2019s Residential Area. It was time to meet Daisy Ectradion. Of course, my arm was still linked with Loretta.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>The iron-blooded wife, Loretta. She\u2019ll destroy anyone who dares to touch her lover!</p><br/><p>PS - The popularity contest is a popularity contest! It\u2019s not how the story will go.

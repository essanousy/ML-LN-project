Avarice Devours Everything (8)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Chapter 121. Avarice Devours Everything (8)</p><br/><p>My cape\u2019s effect, ambush defense, could not be used in Ludia\u2019s appearance. Although I retained all my abilities, it did not include my equipment\u2019s effects. As such, I could only let the sword stab into me helplessly.</p><br/><p>[You have been stabbed with the legendary weapon, Soul Sucker, crafted with the Demon Lord\u2019s power. If you do not receive peak-grade treatment, you will soon be killed! All party members fall in \u2018shameful obedience\u2019 status effect. Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry attempts to resist it. Without enough resistance left, it fails!]</p><br/><p>So Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry could fail too!? The reason it didn\u2019t have enough resistance had to be because it canceled all the petrification. Since the petrification was a status effect casted by the Demon Lord, it was understandable. In fact, it would have been more surprising if Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry could have resisted the status effect again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would grit your teeth and come save me\u2026 But I\u2019m happy I got to use this sword, unni.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut still, I\u2019m surprised. I thought you\u2019d get caught before it became my turn. We planted quite a lot of spies among the knights, you see. Ah, by now, the Demon Army should have invaded the Imperial Palace too. The demons that usually only stay in the Demon Lord\u2019s territory have been sent out, knowing that this is the best opportunity. Elite forces sent to save me. Without them, what would have happened to the Imperial Palace\u2026 to father and mother? I don\u2019t think the ruler of an empire would run away to the dungeon, so do you think he got captured?\u201d</p><br/><p>I coughed up blood. Excruciating pain swept over me. It was as if my soul was being sucked in by the sword. The party members tried to approach me, but I shook my head once and gave them a glance. It was the signal to execute the plan we made for the \u2018what if\u2019 we talked about. Bellode shook his head in pain, but the magician and the summoner were different. They immediately sprung into action. Although they seemed to be in pain from the status effect, the order I gave them was extremely simple.</p><br/><p>Thinking that victory was in her grasp, Shina continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat don\u2019t you say something, unni? Like since when or why I went to the Demon Lord\u2019s side. Or if the Demon Lord brainwashed me. Don\u2019t you have a lot to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it that you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shina seemed to be surprised by my straightforward question. She curled one corner of her mouth up and responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the seat next to the Demon Lord, unni. A seat where I can obtain everything in the world\u2026 He allowed me to be beside him. Of course, with one additional condition. The power of Kang Shin, the other world\u2019s Hero. You know how greedy I am, right, unni? The Demon Lord took my offer of the power of another world\u2019s Hero. He also saw me in high regard. You see, we suit each other rather well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo... because of your avarice, you cooperated with him in destroying the Ehuir Empire, killing me, and offering Shin to the Demon Lord? Leaving his own world to end?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep. What, are you trying to contact him? Give up, unni. This sword\u2019s power is amazing. The only thing unni is allowed to do is to curse at me to make the short time you have left worth it. You probably can\u2019t open your inventory either.\u201d</p><br/><p>It really didn\u2019t open. I let her know that there were others with my eyes, but Shina was still full of leisure.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you, unni? This is a weapon imbued with the Demon Lord\u2019s power. Everyone here is no longer allowed any freedom. At the very least, everything they could do as explorers has been sealed. Plus, the ones unni saved are also\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shina talked as she turned her head, and was shocked. Other than Bellode, who was gritting his teeth and closing his eyes, the summoner and the magician\u2019s actions had shocked her.</p><br/><p>Seven explorers, who were tied so well that they couldn\u2019t even open the door to the dungeon, had fallen from the wyvern\u2019s back. Currently in free fall, they were screaming.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Your Highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since both their hands and feet were tied, they were fated to hit the ground without doing anything. Of course, they couldn\u2019t escape to the dungeon.</p><br/><p>The moment I realized Shina was hit by the Demon Lord\u2019s magic on purpose, the chances that other petrified explorers were also traitors became extremely high. The moment Shina\u2019s words confirmed it, the party members had thrown them off the wyvern. Having to kill the people we came to save\u2026 It was a truly unpleasant feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll probably die.\u201d</p><br/><p>At my short words, Shina gave a flustered look, but soon swept aside her bangs and sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026 I don\u2019t care what happens to them. They were only there to make it more believable that I was captured by the Demon Lord. What\u2019s important is that you and the others can\u2019t do anything to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>She seemed to be telling the truth. Even after dropping the seven explorers, the summoner and the magician couldn\u2019t approach me. It seemed like the sword in my stomach was preventing them somehow. If they forced themselves, they might be the ones to fall off the wyvern instead. It must be the \u2018shameful obedience\u2019 status effect they got when the sword stabbed through me. Just by attacking one person, the whole party was suppressed! I knew it was imbued with the Demon Lord\u2019s power, but what was this weapon!? At that moment, while I was feeling my vitality reaching its limit, a message rang out in ear, surprising me.</p><br/><p>[Diehard activates. All injuries have been restored and your vitality is restored to 50% of its maximum.]</p><br/><p>[Soul Sucker\u2019s power prevents healing! If you do not receive peak-grade holy recovery in the next 2 minutes, you will die!]</p><br/><p>Without even knowing that Diehard had activated, Shina smiled confidently and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu, this sword is also the proof of contract between us. It is the power that he bestowed upon me. Be glad, unni. Unni loves Kang Shin, right? He will be stabbed with the same sword. With this sword, I will rob the world of its power. How is it? Are you happy that you will die in the same way as your lover?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuu, this hurts\u2026 There\u2019s one thing I want to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>With this, I probably heard everything I could with Ludia\u2019s appearance. I immediately canceled Sky God\u2019s Play.</p><br/><p>In an instant, my height grew taller, my hair got shorter, and my voice became thicker. My two arms, which were still holding onto Shina, changed from the slender arms of a frail girl to healthy, muscled arms. Likely because of Soul Sucker, I wasn\u2019t wearing my equipment and was only wearing my underwear. Because of the sword stuck in my stomach, my underwear got dyed in red. Without joking, it was an intense pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your unni, Shina.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shina\u2019s eyes opened widely.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBellode, the request has been complete. Do you accept it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Kuuk, the request\u2026 Sorry, but even so, I can\u2019t do it\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s up to you anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I said that, a fanfare rang in my ear.</p><br/><p>[Request complete! Although the requester did not lie, the target of the request has become the world\u2019s enemy. As of this moment, all Dimensional Mercenaries that have carried out the request will be treated as if the request has been completed. It is recommended that you return to your dimension as soon as possible.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained 8 stats points as the request\u2019s reward!]</p><br/><p>8 points. It was quite a lot. However, I couldn\u2019t open my status window at the moment, so I couldn\u2019t use the points that I had obtained with difficulty.</p><br/><p>Shina was visibly surprised by the fact that I had changed from Ludia\u2019s appearance, but after realizing that the sword was still stuck in my stomach, she regained her composure.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, you already became a Dimensional Mercenary? I never even imagined it. Plus, you were disguising yourself as unni too\u2026 It\u2019s quite unfortunate that I couldn\u2019t kill unni here, but at least you made it easy for me. I can fulfill my side of the contract with the Demon Lord now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, I wasn\u2019t your fated partner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGeez, oppa. My fated partner isn\u2019t a childish rookie like you. It\u2019s the Demon Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t Ludia say her clan\u2019s eyes allowed them to find partners that would let the empire flourish? It seemed there was a mistake. For example, instead of a flourishing empire, it could be flourishing descendants. With her fated partner being the Demon Lord, it was understandable that she\u2019d be excited. Especially since she even suppressed me with such a powerful weapon.</p><br/><p>At this point, I was completely certain. I wanted to believe that the Demon Lord had brainwashed her, but all the negative status effects on her should have disappeared when I used Orc Lord\u2019s Warcry. Since she lied about her fated partner being me\u2026 she must have been conspiring with the Demon Lord for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Shina, do you hate me so much that you want to kill me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 To be honest, I thought you\u2019d be a good boyfriend. You\u2019re handsome, strong, and kind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for the compliment. By the way, Shina, I came here to save you. Although I was in Ludia\u2019s appearance, I hoped that you were fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the truth. If possible, I wanted to save Shina and go back. I wanted to complete my first mission without much problem, and I didn\u2019t want to see Shina rebelling against Ludia and the imperial family. I didn\u2019t want to see Ludia\u2019s crying face, and I didn\u2019t want her to hate me. But\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBut oppa is a Hero, right? Setting aside whether you like it or not, you have to sacrifice yourself for my future. Please just take this as your fate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, so everything is \u2018fate\u2019\u2026 In truth, Shina, our conversation until now has been insignificant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sorry, Ludia.</p><br/><p>But I have no intention of letting someone who tried to kill me live.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaduceus.\u201d</p><br/><p>The snake spiraling around my arm opened its eyes. It was scorched black, then it scattered into pieces.</p><br/><p>[As your target has a lower level than you, you reflect all injuries inflicted by the target.]</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shina grabbed her stomach and groaned. I touched my stomach, and confirmed that the sword was no longer stuck in it. My health was back to normal as well. The state of my body was so perfect that even I found it strange.</p><br/><p>Putting mana into my bracelet, I put on my armor. Then, I checked how my allies were doing. As expected, they had escaped the status effect and were making confused expressions. Seeing Shina\u2019 state, Bellode ran toward me, but the summoner smacked his head first with his bow imbued with aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy really is stupid. Even with what she did to him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKahak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shina coughed out black blood and raised her head to look at me. The sword stuck to her stomach was giving off a black aura. Just watching it made me shiver in fear, especially when I thought that it was inside of me until just now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, what did\u2026 you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShina. In my country, we call it the retribution of karma.\u201d</p><br/><p>I explained to her coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI simply returned what you did to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow? The Demon Lord\u2019s power\u2026 And Unni\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou justified murder for your avarice, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018As for me, I will kill you for my justice.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhuk\u2026 o-oppa, save me. Plea\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It went without saying that I had never killed a human being. I had killed monsters like eating rice. I had even killed demons after coming here. Right, I had even killed chimeras, who were made using humans.</p><br/><p>However, I had never killed a human being. Set aside the question of whether humans and other lives have different values. It wasn\u2019t a matter of value. There was an inherent resistance to murdering humans, who were the same existences as me. It was the resistance that humans naturally had.</p><br/><p>However, I surprisingly accepted myself trying to kill Shina naturally. She tried to kill her older sister. She wanted to betray her continent and embrace the Demon Lord. She agreed to the plan of killing her own parents.</p><br/><p>No, that wasn\u2019t the reason. I wasn\u2019t trying to kill her for such a complicated reason. It was simpler.</p><br/><p>It was because she was my enemy and she tried to kill me.</p><br/><p>To kill her, I didn\u2019t need any other reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk\u2026 Kuhuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once I had organized my thoughts, I was quick to move. I took my spear out of my inventory and brought it to the demonic sword stuck in her stomach. Although the demonic sword must have belonged to Shina, that was no longer the case as it had dealt critical damage to Shina. In fact, it was likely that it was now mine.</p><br/><p>As expected, my spear easily absorbed the demonic sword, which was happily sucking away her soul.</p><br/><p>[Crimson Gluttony Spear absorbed Soul Sucker. Growth: 87%]</p><br/><p>It had a lower grade than the holysword. How amazing was the holysword when it was at its full strength? While pondering, I stared at Shina, who was gasping for breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cO-Oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to open the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment I felt her resistance, I summoned my elementals. Peika and Ruyue appeared on my shoulders the moment I called them. With a grunt, Ruyue was holding up the egg with her small body, but I pretended not to see it and order her.</p><br/><p>\u201cTie her.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Okay!]</p><br/><p>In an instant, Shina\u2019s hands and feet were frozen. With the demonic sword gone, she was no longer my opponent. Having lost her way to resist and escape, she only looked at me with blank eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cO-Oppa. W-What did you do with the sword?\u201d</p><br/><p>Without answering her, I held my spear up. Peika and I also didn\u2019t need to exchange words. She naturally infused herself into the Gluttony Spear, giving it golden flickers of lightning. Shina put on an urgent expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, you took away the sword to save me, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without even a shred of hesitation, I struck down with my spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cI got rid of the sword, so I won\u2019t make disgraceful excuses later that I didn\u2019t personally kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>I will bear the weight of my crimes. I won\u2019t make excuses that I only returned the injuries she gave me. I labeled her as my enemy, and thus I cut her. I will continue to do so.</p><br/><p>My spear cut Shina in half and the lightning energy in my spear burned the two halve of her corpse to crisp. I destroyed Shina completely, so that she cannot be revived as undead.</p><br/><p>With my own hands, I killed Ludia\u2019s sister.</p><br/><p>The fact that it felt the same as killing a monster was sad and scary.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>You can\u2019t effectively deal with the Demon Lord with Floor Masters\u2019 powers? Then use God\u2019s powers!</p><br/><p>By taking on Ludia\u2019s appearance, Shin was able to hear everything from Shina. If he was in his own appearance, it would have been hard. Things would have gotten much more complicated.</p><br/><p>This is the highlight of this arc. Shin has killed a person for the first time. I thought a lot to write this part, but there was no reason for Shin, who was resolute and clear on distinguishing between friend and foe, to let Shina live. Shina was his acquaintance and Shin had even come for her. Because of the effort he put in, he couldn\u2019t forgive her for what she did to him.</p><br/><p>Retrieving foreshadowing and making new ones. You will see how it all ends in the next chapter.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

(3)</p><br/><p>[Congratulations! For the first time in Beyond\u2019s history, you defeated the Floor Master, Dragon Zombie, on your first try! You received 3 skill points as a reward. Current skill points: 10]</p><br/><p>[Your achievements reached a threshold, allowing you to obtain a third god\u2019s true name! All gods eyeing you begin to compete.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained the title, \u2018Zombie Dragon Master.\u2019 All stats increase by 2. The title\u2019s effect will apply even when the title is not equipped.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained the entrance ticket to the SSS+ rank 2-man Event Dungeon, \u2018Deadland\u2019!]</p><br/><p>[You cleared Beyond\u2019s 15th floor. You obtained the qualification to challenge the First Dungeon\u2019s 66th floor.]</p><br/><p>[You obtained 5 bonus stats. Your maximum HP and MP increase by 2%.]</p><br/><p>[Experience has been added to the skills you frequently used to progress through Beyond\u2019s 15th floor.]</p><br/><p>[You received the only reward left hidden for the first explorer. Congratulations! Your luck stat increases by 10.]</p><br/><p>[1. Thorn Throne (Epic)]</p><br/><p>Although messages were ringing in my ears, it was hard to hear them as I had just used Crimson Roar. I calmly waited for the flames to subside and read the message log. When I saw the line about the Event Dungeon, I coughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was Wonderland before, now it\u2019s Deadland\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Plus, this one was SSS+ rank though it was only for 2 people. Scary\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cShould I just sell it at the auction house\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, someone\u2019s face flashed across in my mind. It was the face of someone who was arguably the second strongest member of Revival and loved the undead.</p><br/><p>Unlike the Dungeon, monsters didn\u2019t scatter into particles of light in Event Dungeons. To Daisy, who loved the undead, this Deadland was probably more of a wonderland than the Wonderland.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd this is the secret reward.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Secret. Thorn Throne (Epic)]</p><br/><p>Its simple name made it even more scarier. Since it was the reward for defeating that damned Zombie Dragon, it was certainly not simple. With a firm mind, I grabbed the reward which was clearly labeled \u2018Epic\u2019. Its name didn\u2019t give any hints as to what kind of an item it was. When it materialized in my hand, I saw that it was a ring. It looked like it was made of dragon bones and glowed in a hazy black color. Its surface was spiky, as if it had thorns. If I wasn\u2019t careful, I felt that it would prick me.</p><br/><p>[Thorn Throne (Epic)</p><br/><p>Durability \u2013 Unbreakable</p><br/><p>Equipment Requirement \u2013 Kang Shin</p><br/><p>Option \u2013 Strength +50, Dexterity +50. Constitution -20, Magic -20. When using attack skills, there is a 5% chance, dozens of dragon bones spears will shoot out. When attacked, there is a 10% chance, a bone spear will shoot out and attack the enemy.</p><br/><p>Skill \u2013 Thorn Throne: Usable once per day. For 5 minutes, your body gets covered with an armor of bones. You reflect 20% of all incoming damage. At this time, the enemy becomes afflicted with the unavoidable debuff \u2018soul contamination.\u2019]</p><br/><p>\u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>This ring was deserving of its Epic grade. No, perhaps it was even worthy of the Legend grade! Though it decreased my constitution and magic stats, with its incredible strength and dexterity stat boost, it was still a 60 point net gain! The decrease in constitution and magic could be easily made up by distributing bonus stat points into them.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the chances of its option activating was high! It was incomparable to the Deathblood Ring. Though, I did find it a bit perverted that the chance of the effect proccing was higher when I was attacked than when I attacked.</p><br/><p>Regardless, the real kicker was the skill the ring contained.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s here! It\u2019s finally here!\u201d</p><br/><p>The skill I was hoping for was a transformation skill, one that would let me display even greater strength for a limited period of time, just like the Powered Form I received from the 60th floor. Thorn Throne was precisely the type of skill I was hoping for. Although its offensive nature somewhat worried me, I hoped it would be fine.</p><br/><p>I immediately extracted Thorn Throne from the ring and stored it in the pocket watch. Then, without hesitation, I activated Skill Synthesis. I then placed Thorn Throne in the base skill slot and placed Powered Form in the supplemental skill slot.</p><br/><p>Of course, there were more. I placed \u2018Electric Guardian Form\u2019 skill, extracted from the armor given by Beyond\u2019s 10th floor boss, Powered Lizard Knight. As for the reason I wasn\u2019t wearing it, as it was a Unique grade armor, it paled in comparison to Pure Black Desire. The reason I wanted a transformation type skill in the first place was because I had obtained Electric Guardian Form on top of Powered Form.</p><br/><p>[Electric Guardian Form: For 5 minutes, an armor of lightning covers your body. All incoming magic damage decreases by 30%, and your speed and attack power increases by 20%.]</p><br/><p>Although it was a bit lacking compared to the Powered Form or the Thorn Throne, it was still a transformation skill with excellent effects. It would only help, not hurt, as a supplemental skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cA man should be daring!\u201d</p><br/><p>I still had two skills left. One was Dragon Skin, the other was Gigant Time. While Dragon Skin greatly boosted my defense, it decreased my speed significantly, making me reluctant to use it in most situations. Since I generally didn\u2019t need Dragon Skin more than once per day, I decided to include it in the Skill Synthesis to amplify its effect.</p><br/><p>It was the same for Gigant Time. By combining multiple skills together, they could help to lessen each other\u2019s weaknesses. In truth, I had too many skills. It was best to lower the count whenever possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cSkill Synthesis!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the circular stone slab rotating, I let out a small sigh. I had a good feeling about it, just like the time I created Absolute Soul. Considering all the skills that went into it, it was only obvious. If I didn\u2019t like the resulting skill, I planned on synthesizing it away immediately!</p><br/><p>Soon, just like when Absolute Soul was created, the stone slab let out a brilliant light. I watched without breathing until the stone slab stopped spinning. At that moment, something unexpected happened. The stone slab, which was continuously shooting out brilliant light, suddenly crackled with lightning.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What? I thought this skill couldn\u2019t fail!\u201d</p><br/><p>The stone slab continued to crackle with lightning. Every time the lightning flashed, the golden brilliance the stone slab was letting out became a bit darker. It also began to spin, fluctuating in speed as strange symbols flashed above it.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, please, no! Dear God, Buddha, Allah, the dungeon\u2019s Lord, please let it succeed!\u201d</p><br/><p>This skill can\u2019t even fail! Stop making me all nervous!</p><br/><p>As if to answer my prayer, the stone slab finally came to a stop. On top of the cracked stone slab crackling with lightning was a strange symbol that did not shine with even a hint of its original brilliance, instead letting out an eerie black light.</p><br/><p>[Scary. Master, are you learning that?]</p><br/><p>[Uuu, that\u2019s dangerous, Shin.]</p><br/><p>[Master, I think that mana both accepts and rejects everything. It\u2019s\u2026 a very powerful and dangerous power.]</p><br/><p>Hey, why are you guys making me worry more!? I was already feeling uneasy, but now that the elementals gathered and trembled, I felt even more uneasy. However, I couldn\u2019t just reject the skill and return it to its previous form. I had spent my precious skills for this.</p><br/><p>I strengthened my heart and put my hand on the symbol. At that moment, electricity flowed through my body. A shock incomparable to when I obtained Absolute Soul roared inside me.</p><br/><p>A skill that raised my league just by obtaining it! What the hell did I make!?</p><br/><p>[You obtained the Transcendent skill, Overlord.]</p><br/><p>[A supreme being whose existence suppresses all. Once per day, for 5 minutes, you equip an armor made of the black amorphous mana \u2018Enigma\u2019. Your mana also becomes unionized with Enigma, transforming you into a 5 meter tall giant. \u2018Enigma\u2019 is a mana that reigns over all mana. Being so rare that not even a proper name could be given, this ultimate mana is said to stand on the opposite side of divine power. Enigma affects even your weapons, granting you the ability to enlarge them up to 20 times by will and dying them with black mana.]</p><br/><p>[As no being can completely analyze this mana, your attacks become unpredictable and no attacks can display their full potential against you. While this skill is active, your HP and MP triples, and your stats double. When attacking the enemy, you have a 10% chance to afflict a random highest rank status effect. When attacked by an enemy, you have 20% chance to afflict a random highest rank status effect.]</p><br/><p>[Learning Overlord increases all of your stats by 30 points. Overwhelm and Absolute Soul becomes level 5. Even while Overlord is not active, you are affected by a part of its effect. Your HP and MP increases by 20%, and with a 1% chance when attacking an enemy and a 2% chance when being attacked by an enemy, you afflict a random highest rank status effect.]</p><br/><p>[This skill has transcended the control of the dungeon. It cannot be further synthesized. To create a skill above this skill, you must reach a realm higher than your current realm.]</p><br/><p>[You created a Transcendent skill! Transcendent skills are skills born under the dungeon\u2019s system, yet transcending the dungeon\u2019s system. Even existences capable of ignoring the dungeon\u2019s influence cannot look down on this skill. Just by possessing this skill, all worlds\u2019 enemies will be on guard against you. The Lord sends his highest praise at this amazing achievement. You obtained 10 skill points. Current skill points: 20]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Aaa.\u201d</p><br/><p>I exclaimed dumbfounded. As I carefully went over the flurry of messages, I interpreted what this skill, Overlord, meant. The conclusion I reached was simple.</p><br/><p>I finally obtained it.</p><br/><p>\u201cA way to defeat the world\u2019s enemy!\u201d</p><br/><p>I had finally done it! A way to fight against them! A power not weaker than a god\u2019s power, the greatest power I could wield! Perhaps it was the time limit, perhaps it was because I had incorporated all the skills I could, or perhaps it was my unnaturally high luck stat. I had no way of knowing. However, I knew one thing for sure.</p><br/><p>By obtaining Overlord, I had taken a step forward towards the future I had to protect!</p><br/><p>When I left Beyond\u2019s 15th floor, Loretta received me with a blank expression. Now that I learned Overlord, I could just barely begin to understand the tip of the power within Loretta\u2019s body. She was so powerful that I could only barely wound her after using Overlord.</p><br/><p>In other words, she was already a Transcendent that could wield Enigma as if it was her own. That was why I couldn\u2019t see through the power all this time. After all, there was no way for me to estimate the strength of someone who wielded a power on a completely different dimension.</p><br/><p>\u201cShin-nim, recently, you\u2019ve been changing every time I see you. It\u2019s making me very flustered. Um, you\u2026 defeated it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Loretta\u2019s question that simplified what happened, I gave a quick reply as I struggled to estimate the total amount of Loretta\u2019s unfathomable power. After thinking for a bit, Loretta asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe power inside you\u2026 Do you know what it is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Loretta\u2019s question, which implied that she already saw through my new skill and power, I once again answered briefly. Loretta then sighed, seemingly from relief. Then, she asked as she stole a glance.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Should I congratulate you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Loretta\u2019s tone had gotten brighter, I gave up trying to estimate Loretta\u2019s power and answered. Immediately, she continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, tonight, together in my cabin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even finish! Shin-nim, stupid! Stupid, stupid!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta flapped her ears endlessly as she shouted. I replied with a grin.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, I can\u2019t until I defeat the world\u2019s enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut! But! When you reject me so cold-heartedly, my heart tears up into a thousand pieces!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t ask when you know you\u2019re going to get rejected.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d go with the flow and go for it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope you realize it\u2019s not working because you\u2019re too scheming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHiing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Loretta drooped her ears as she made a tearful face. I grinned and patted her.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut as promised, we can play for today. I\u2019m feeling a lot more relaxed now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Should we start with strip poker?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBye, Loretta!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaah! I\u2019m kidding! Play with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Loretta hanging onto my legs, I announced my surrender. I then really ended up spending the whole day with her. Of course, we didn\u2019t play strip poker.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Really!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Only one old rascal who had slept with him for decades knew that this child was in a stupid state.</p><br/><p>He looked at Xie Xi with a smile of pleasure.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had adapted to his gaze and didn\u2019t feel too much but the disabled group of four were about to be blinded!</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t help thinking in their hearts,</p><br/><p>\u2018We haven\u2019t seen each other for a day and these two big bosses secretly got married and shared love?\u2019</p><br/><p>Well, to a certain extent, they were correct.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi and Jiang Xie spent a lot of time in the dream but actually slept for 20 hours. It was no wonder why Xie Xi felt hungry and thirsty. Jiang Xie probably put qualification points into hunger and didn\u2019t feel much.</p><br/><p>During these 20 hours, the outside was very lively.</p><br/><p>In the third project, Zhu Li and Zhuo Liu only took one hour to clear it. Cao Yan and Zhuang Yi took 1.5 hours and they arrived at the maze at the same time as a large number of people.</p><br/><p>It was hard for everyone to escape from the game field and they were happy. They wanted to work together to get through the last level and leave the world.</p><br/><p>Who would\u2019ve expected this underground labyrinth to be worse than the game field? They had no idea and were tragically abused.</p><br/><p>Cao Yan\u2019s mouth moved very quickly. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for my favourite arm that Boss gave me, I would\u2019ve died\u2026\u201d He described in great detail the type of danger he encountered and how witty he was to use his favourite arm\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhu Li punched him. \u201cGet to the point!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cao Yan removed his personal show and told them what happened.</p><br/><p>The group of four tried to explore the maze many times but unfortunately, they couldn\u2019t even pass the first corner. Their missing arms and legs were caused by the maze, not the third project.</p><br/><p>Later, more and more people came to the underground labyrinth. Some were in a robust state but were tormented terribly by the game field.</p><br/><p>Everyone was scared after making a preliminary attempt and didn\u2019t dare act rashly.</p><br/><p>It was hard alone so act together!</p><br/><p>The first person who thought of this method wasn\u2019t the group of four half zombies but a rookie of Yunge called Zhang Ruizhen.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned when he heard the word Yunge and he was physiologically disgusted.</p><br/><p>As early as his initial confrontation with Yun Die, Xie Xi thought that Yunge must\u2019ve sent others to this open world. If there wasn\u2019t anyone else, how could Yun Die gain information on the chicken mobilization game?</p><br/><p>This Zhang Ruizhen wasn\u2019t a good person and was generally the same as Yun Die.</p><br/><p>After coming to the underground labyrinth, he found the difficulty and started to gather people to explore together.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t refuse anyone, regardless of whether they were physically fit or disabled, and discussed how to move through the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>Since the final task was labyrinth related, everyone had to enter. Thus, they were very grateful when they heard this and came together to give suggestions.</p><br/><p>Zhang Ruizhen put on a kind face and his grand words convinced everyone to go together.</p><br/><p>Most people took into account Yunge\u2019s reputation, were convinced by Zhang Ruizhen and listened to him.</p><br/><p>Who knew that his cruel nature would be exposed inside the labyrinth?</p><br/><p>The reason he organized the disabled people wasn\u2019t because he was willing to take them through the instance but to use them as cannon fodder to explore the path!</p><br/><p>Dozens of people died and they had only passed the first corner before having to retreat. Zhang Ruizhen finally tore off his cover. \u201cIf you want to pass, listen to me or I will kill you now!\u201d</p><br/><p>After a round of exploration, the original disabled people had serious injuries while some healthy people were also injured. Only Zhang Ruizhen\u2019s group received zero damage while also collecting a lot of resources and information, allowing them to guess things about the second corner.</p><br/><p>Many people didn\u2019t like his style but in the face of life or death, many people who still had the ability to fight chose to follow him. Even if they were being used, it was better than doing nothing and dying.</p><br/><p>Zhang Ruizhen still wasn\u2019t willing and urged those who lacked arms and legs to \u2018pave the way.\u2019</p><br/><p>They were just missing arms or legs, not brains. How could they willingly be used as cannon fodder?</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t go and the ruthless Zhang Ruizhen actually started killing people.</p><br/><p>At this time, the Zhu Li group of four came out and stopped him, rescuing their disabled siblings.</p><br/><p>Zhang Ruizhen was very shocked when seeing their skills and wanted to pull them into his group. However, the group of four had seen Yun Die\u2019s cruelty and how could they fall for the same rubbish?</p><br/><p>They refused and gathered all the wounded.</p><br/><p>Zhang Ruizhen still coveted their strength and didn\u2019t try to kill them. He planned to wait until the group of four were crushed by reality and willingly surrendered to him.</p><br/><p>The miserable players were like frightened birds. They saw Zhu Li and the others and became nervous. They were afraid this group would want to use them like Zhang Ruizhen.</p><br/><p>Then Zhu Li and the others started brainwashing them. As four competent kings of boasting, their words weren\u2019t repetitive.</p><br/><p>Cao Yan said, \u201cBrothers and sisters, don\u2019t panic. Wait for our boss to arrive and we will kill that piece of scum!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Liu told them, \u201cBe mentally prepared. Once our boss comes out, you might not be able to bear the thrill of coming back from the dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Li spoke deeply, \u201cI used to think I was the best in the world and no one could compare. Since meeting Boss, I understood my shortsightedness and ignorance\u2026\u201d The glib talk of Old Zhu\u2019s entire life was used up in this moment!</p><br/><p>Zhuang Yi\u2019s beautiful female eyes fluttered as she said, \u201cI thought I was beautiful enough but once I saw Boss, I realized what it meant to be a beauty descended from the world of immortals.\u201d Why did she have a different focus? In addition, great beauty, why do you have a thicker voice than a man?!</p><br/><p>Thanks to their confident boasting, in the hearts of the disabled people, Xie Xi instantly became\u2026 a god!</p><br/><p>Someone asked Zhu Li, \u201cIs the god so strong that he doesn\u2019t care about those of us lacking arms and legs?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Li replied quickly, \u201cBoss likes those lacking arms and legs!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man, \u201c???\u201d The taste of this adult was quite special.</p><br/><p>Another person asked, \u201cI can\u2019t even stand stably and will die if I enter the maze. God really doesn\u2019t hate it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Liu spoke mysteriously, \u201cTrust me, wait until you see Boss and you can run a few kilometres!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man, \u201c???\u201d The big boss was so scary? He would be so scared that he ran away on his two arms?</p><br/><p>There was also a man with only one arm left who was dying. \u201cNo one can save me, I have no hope.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cao Yan patted him on the shoulder. \u201cBrother, be steady! You will be the strongest pioneer of our team!\u201d There were three different parts that could be exchanged freely. What was the difference with an undead?</p><br/><p>The brother with one arm, \u2018Hey, can you stop patting my shoulder? My arm is also crumbling QAQ.\u2019</p><br/><p>Thanks to the boasting of the \u2018brainless fans\u2019, Xie Xi became the faith in everyone\u2019s hearts when he hadn\u2019t even left the game field.</p><br/><p>The quartet chanted, \u201cZhang Ruizhen is a chicken and the maze is a paper tiger. As long as Boss is present, everything can be broken!\u201d</p><br/><p>At first, the disabled people felt ashamed but as Zhang Ruizhen\u2019s group grew smaller and the number of people missing a limb increased, their momentum also rose higher.</p><br/><p>They shouted slogans while waiting for their savior to come\u2026</p><br/><p>Now Xie Xi had arrived.</p><br/><p>If they weren\u2019t afraid of the \u2018god\u2019, they would\u2019ve swarmed and surrounded him!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard the story from the beginning and lost all strength.</p><br/><p>He shouldn\u2019t have saved these four idiots in the beginning. If he hadn\u2019t saved them, he wouldn\u2019t become an idiot now!</p><br/><p>General Zhu gazed at him. \u201cBoss, it is time for us to fight back!\u201d Xie Xi hit him on the forehead. \u201cGet lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Zhu spoke cautiously, \u201cYou can rest assured that Zhang Ruizhen only has a dozen people left. There are hundreds of people on this side and we can directly step on him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t play against these big idiots or he would become even stupider.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie gave a low laugh and Xie Xi stared at him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart was tickled and he couldn\u2019t help holding Xie Xi\u2019s hand. \u201cIn the next open world, the Zone will probably isolate you.\u201d</p><br/><p>His hand was held and Xie Xi couldn\u2019t adapt. It felt cozy but every since returning to reality, they had been too close. Um\u2026</p><br/><p>Their souls knew each other!</p><br/><p>After half a second, Xie Xi was unwilling to pull his hand away and sneered, \u201cI don\u2019t want to come to such an idiotic world!\u201d</p><br/><p>The repair skill was simply a bug. It was no wonder why the group of four went crazy since experiencing the chicken mobilization game. After that, they saw the zombie limbs like dragons looking at gems and wanted to hide the limbs in a cave.</p><br/><p>Then they saw the people lacking arms and legs. They emphasized with those who had a strong body and felt jealous of those missing two or more limbs!</p><br/><p>The mentality of the other disabled people could also be understood.</p><br/><p>Zhang Ruizhen gave them tremendous psychological pressure and their physical disability caused them to fall into a desperate situation. At this time, forget the four idiots, if there were four pigs who talked well then they would be regarded as a spiritual belief!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s personality meant he wasn\u2019t happy about being so high-profile.</p><br/><p>But this time\u2026</p><br/><p>There was the side task and it didn\u2019t matter if he had a reputation. At this time, Zhang Ruizhen came out after being abused by the maze.</p><br/><p>He suffered heavy losses and failed to pass the second corner. Thus, he already lost his head.</p><br/><p>He saw the disabled group of people after coming up and ridiculed, \u201cDamn, a group of dead ghosts!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuang Yi was a logistics person. He had been organizing the disabled people who could still move to collect zombie arms and legs from the maze. As long as they had enough resources, they would be invincible!</p><br/><p>Zhang Ruizhen saw Zhuang Yi come out and mocked, \u201cThe dead men and women actually like these stinky zombie limbs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuang Yi\u2019s phoenix eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>Zhang Ruizhen was angry, \u201cWhat are you looking at? You crazy bastard! If you had listened to me earlier then we would\u2019ve broken through the maze! Now everyone here will die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuang Yi declared, \u201cApologize.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Ruizhen froze before reacting angrily to the words. \u201cI said you are paralyzed\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His words hadn\u2019t finished when Zhuang Yi brought a whip to his mouth.</p><br/><p>Zhang Ruizhen became even crazier, \u201cFuck, I will kill all your wastes today!\u201d</p><br/><p>If there was no Xie Xi, Zhang Ruizhen\u2019s fighting power meant the survivors present might be slaughtered without being able to fight back.</p><br/><p>Zhang Ruizhen was unable to make it through the maze and accumulated resentment and despair towards all the seriously injured players.</p><br/><p>If these damn wastes paved the way, would he have such a hard time?</p><br/><p>They were waiting to die anyway. So what if they helped him before dying?</p><br/><p>Fuck these wastes!</p><br/><p>Zhang Ruizhen stabbed at the nearest injured person. It was a slender woman whose leg had been bitten off below the knee and she was sitting there miserably.</p><br/><p>He stabbed like this and she had nowhere to hide. She could only wait to die. Then Zhuang Yi\u2019s whip danced over and smashed Zhang Renzhui\u2019s knife. The woman\u2019s face drained of blood and she lost half her life from fright.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw this scene from a distance so how could he wait?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cI will help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned after receiving all the roses. He almost forgot about Jiang Xie\u2019s skill to turn objects he touched into roses.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi no longer delayed the time. The roses fell on the joints and instantly, \u2018new\u2019 limbs emerged.</p><br/><p>This image was so shocking that some people held their breaths. Their heads were full of the beautiful white roses and the young man who looked better than the roses.</p><br/><p>It turned out that he was really\u2014</p><br/><p>A god.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

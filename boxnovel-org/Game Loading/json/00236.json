They arrived just in time for this celebration.</p><br/><p>September 9th was known as the god\u2019s birthday. The god here was naturally the Demon God.</p><br/><p>In order for Xie Xi to be a qualified demon, he carefully studied the history of the Demon World.</p><br/><p>In general, it was different from the angels and demons in the Bible that Xie Xi knew. They were basically Jiang Xie\u2019s secondary creations.</p><br/><p>The ruler of Heaven and the Demon World were basically equal. In the early years, they fought a lot. Later, they discovered this didn\u2019t help anyway and made peace with each other.</p><br/><p>Not fighting meant they developed. Ordinary angels and demons even married each other. It was very comfortable. Of course, the higher ranked angels and demons still feared and mutually restrained each other.</p><br/><p>This was also very good. Restraint meant competition and this caused the two worlds to develop further and more rapidly.</p><br/><p>The god on this side was the Demon God and this festival was to celebrate his birthday.</p><br/><p>Of course, it wasn\u2019t the day when the Demon God was born. The so-called birthday was the day he created the Demon World.</p><br/><p>In any case, this festival was similar to New Year\u2019s Eve. Not only was it a festival, it was also a holiday. Jiang Xie and Xie Xi got a whole half a month of leave.</p><br/><p>It was so long that they could return to Heaven. However, it was hard to catch the centennial celebration and it was a pity to leave. Thus, Jiang Xie stayed in the Demon World and wanted to spend the holiday with Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Taking into consideration that this was a world created by Jiang Xie, Xie Xi was very concerned about the two gods and carefully checked.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the information on them was very thin. There were only myths and legends and basically no details.</p><br/><p>He would probably have to go to the Sixth or Seventh Domain to learn more information. However, Xie Xi couldn\u2019t go with Jiang Xie next to him. Still, he wasn\u2019t in a hurry. This Demon God might just be a background setting.</p><br/><p>After all, Gemini was an angel.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi checked the information and put on an act of knowing everything. \u201cTomorrow, there will be fireworks and we shouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will go early and grab a clean place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Xie Xi\u2019s resources were lost, there were no more demons around him and Jiang Xie\u2019s recent mood could be described as beautiful as Heaven. Naturally, he was very compliant with Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi added, \u201cThe fireworks of the Demon World are very beautiful. You definitely haven\u2019t seen it before!\u201d Heaven admired white and gold and weren\u2019t interested in other colours. The occasional fireworks were also monotonous and were like a light in the evening, making a person feel sleepy and safe.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cHave you seen it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m 105 years old. I\u2019ve naturally seen it.\u201d After returning to the Demon World, Xie Xi finally knew his age.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s lips curved. \u201cA five year old little succubus.\u201d The festival occurred once every 100 years. The last time it happened, Xie Xi was five years old.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him. \u201cYou are one year older than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was in a good mood. \u201cOlder is still older. Call me Brother Jiang in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>If the lonely male gods group was here, they would shout, \u201cCan this old cow have any dignity? You can be Little Rose\u2019s great, great, great grandfather!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t call him Brother. This name was called too much in bed and was no longer simple!</p><br/><p>The two people laughed and talked as they waited for the fireworks display.</p><br/><p>They took their place with high spirits. They found a legendary couple\u2019s holy place and had a good view.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was well prepared, with all types of delicious foods and drinks\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw the tent and was stunned. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cIf it is too late then we can sleep here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help thinking about the lesson they attended a few days ago. \u201cA wilderness battle?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi blinked and the smelly Jiang Xie had no face. \u201cIf you want\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What damn thing? Xie Xi bit him and said, \u201cWatch the fireworks!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll listen to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fireworks of the Demon World were truly beautiful. It was estimated there was magic in them as beautiful patterns filled the night sky like a curtain, staging a colourful light show.</p><br/><p>The fireworks show was divided into seven themes, which was the seven majors of the Demon World. The envy demons were competitive and it unknown how long they had been preparing this.</p><br/><p>The most boring one was the gluttony department and Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help looking down at the ground.</p><br/><p>The strangest one was the sloth department. There were 10 fireworks but these slowly people drew it out for an hour before finishing. It was said they prepared 10 but the rhythm was so bad they were ordered to stop!</p><br/><p>The penultimate one was the lust department. Xie Xi rushed to Jiang Xie and cried out, \u201cIt is ours!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying this, he couldn\u2019t wait to change majors.</p><br/><p>It was really about sex and the fireworks showed this!</p><br/><p>The males and females weren\u2019t tempted to be vegetarians and ate\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie held Xie Xi\u2019s hand and Xie Xi glanced over at him. As for watching the fireworks\u2026 oh\u2026</p><br/><p>He was kissed.</p><br/><p>The finale was the pride department. Not much was known about this department because there were almost no students in it at school. Most demons wouldn\u2019t choose it. It was said that graduation was extremely difficult but as long as they graduated, the mark was very high and they could directly stay in the Seventh Domain.</p><br/><p>This was a major with few people but monopolized power.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi urged Jiang Xie, \u201cLook at the fireworks. This is the best one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie kissed Xie Xi\u2019s neck. \u201cLooking at you is the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi listened to the words of love and his lips curved. \u201cLook, it is said that the Demon God is part of the pride\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished speaking when fireworks exploded in the sky. The purple fireworks exploded and became layers that stacked on top of each other, becoming\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie whispered, \u201cA rose?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also recognized it and his heart was stunned.</p><br/><p>It stood to reason that purple shouldn\u2019t be obvious against the black sky but these fireworks seemed to have a magical halo. Every single one blossomed and withered like waves, an inexplicable and magnificent gesture that touched everyone\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Once the fireworks dissipated, Xie Xi saw the last \u2018rose\u2019, which was pure white. It shone like a twinkling star in the dark night sky.</p><br/><p>Then the star fell, dragging its white tail like a meteor falling in Xie Xi\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart thumped violently.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie also noticed and protected Xie Xi. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was impossible to dodge. The strong white light fell on Jiang Xie\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cJiang Xie!\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect there to be such a change. It was just normal fireworks. Why did it suddenly become a white meteor and what was going on with it?</p><br/><p>Was it okay for Jiang Xie to be hit by it?</p><br/><p>There should be nothing wrong. If an accident occurred with Jiang Xie then the world wouldn\u2019t be as stable as it was now.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed and leaned down towards the unconscious Jiang Xie, anxiously calling out to him, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>He resisted the urge to draw a healing device with the god\u2019s wisdom.</p><br/><p>He had simple medical knowledge and there was no problem in the general inspection. The white light was like an illusion, going as quickly as it came and leaving no trace.</p><br/><p>It was just that Jiang Xie was sleeping. He didn\u2019t seem hurt, he had just fallen asleep.</p><br/><p>What was going on?</p><br/><p>The fireworks party was over and no one was here. It was now silent.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t afraid. He was just worried about Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>If Jiang Xie didn\u2019t wake up, should they sleep here?</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter since there was a tent.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi moved Jiang Xie to the tent and wanted to lie down beside him.</p><br/><p>At this time, the sleeping Jiang Xie suddenly opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled by him. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>The tent was very wide and there was a double mattress. It also had some small lights and the yellow light shone brightly.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie squinted. Then he turned to see Xie Xi and his dark pupils sharply shrank.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xie Xi saw a cluster of purple flames in the eyes.</p><br/><p>Gemini\u2019s eyes were black. How could there be a purple halo?</p><br/><p>As Xie Xi was puzzled, Jiang Xie pulled him over and pressed him under Jiang Xie\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished his words when Jiang Xie leaned over and kiss him.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Xie Xi was caught off guard. \u201cW\u2026What\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He really hadn\u2019t wanted to do anything in public but Jiang Xie was like a gust of wind and even got Xie Xi\u2019s succubus magic to move.</p><br/><p>The confused Xie Xi heard Jiang Xie\u2019s hoarse voice. \u201cDo you like him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Who was him? Xie Xi couldn\u2019t think and struggling to maintain his spirit. \u201cI like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The usual Jiang Xie would be happy but his voice sounded more lost. \u201cIs Heaven so good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh? What did this mean?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cAs long as you are there, anywhere is good.\u201d This wasn\u2019t empty words. He always thought this way.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled and gave him an infinitely sweet kiss after what could be called rough sex. \u201cThat\u2019s good. Then I don\u2019t need to exist.\u201d</p><br/><p>This shocked Xie Xi and he tried hard to open his eyes. However, his body seemed exhausted to the extreme and he couldn\u2019t control it. He wanted to say something but he found that even the strength to talk was gone.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie kissed him, carefully pulled Xie Xi into his arms and fell asleep.</p><br/><p>By the time Xie Xi opened his eyes again, he was back in the bedroom. He sat up and called out, \u201cJiang Xie!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi got out of bed and wanted to find him. At this time, the dormitory door open and Jiang Xie stood outside with breakfast.</p><br/><p>He closed the door and lowered the bag in his hand. \u201cHow can you get out of bed with bare feet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was led back to bed by him. Then Jiang Xie bent over and put on shoes for him. \u201cYou should wear shoes even if you don\u2019t want to wear clothes. The floor is very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wrapped himself tightly in the quilt. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d He found that his voice was hoarse the moment he spoke.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had a hint of chagrin in his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened last night\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The confused Xie Xi\u2026</p><br/><p>He remembered last night\u2019s business and quickly asked, \u201cYou, last night\u2026\u201d He suddenly didn\u2019t know how to ask.</p><br/><p>Rather, Jiang Xie asked him, \u201cIs there any discomfort?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was fine so he questioned Jiang Xie, \u201cWhat about you? I saw the light hit you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Just\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The things he did yesterday were too much.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t describe what happened. The complicated emotions still lingered in his heart, as if he had lost Xie Xi forever and last night was the last embrace. He woke up and Xie Xi no longer belonged to him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on and his heart was a bit uneasy.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cI brought breakfast. Eat it since you didn\u2019t eat anything last night.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi absent-mindedly got up and was still thinking about what happened last night as he got dressed.</p><br/><p>Was it an illusion?</p><br/><p>But why would there be such an illusion?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi drank soy milk and stared into Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes. They were black but last night, they were purple.</p><br/><p>What was going on?</p><br/><p>After breakfast, Jiang Xie suggested, \u201cDon\u2019t go to the garden today. If you are tired then take a break.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had a succubus\u2019 body and really wasn\u2019t tired. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. The garden is interesting so let\u2019s go and see it together.\u201d</p><br/><p>They just packed up and went out when they heard an enormous noise.</p><br/><p>This was followed by a university professor flying out with black wings.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll students, take refuge in the first auditorium!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d The students glanced at each other and didn\u2019t know what happened.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was also baffled. He vaguely felt it was related to what he heard last night.</p><br/><p>At this time, he heard a whisper between the professors where fear couldn\u2019t be suppressed. \u201c\u2026The Demon God fell.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

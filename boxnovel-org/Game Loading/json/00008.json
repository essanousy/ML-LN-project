What was the result? He was more ruthless than the housekeeper Randy and vampire Aix-en.</p><br/><p>Killing everyone in the mansion because they would hurt Sein Hall. However, what was actually the truth? How could Randy leave behind those who wanted to assassinate Sein Hall?</p><br/><p>If there were no killers, who could Gars have an opportunity to show himself off?</p><br/><p>Gars seemed to have left in a desperate manner but he actually did a series of things to make Xie Xi need him.</p><br/><p>Rather than killing Xie Xi, he blocked all other options so that Xie Xi could only choose him.</p><br/><p>What could Xie Xi do?</p><br/><p>He bent over and pulled Gars Delin up. \u201cDon\u2019t you hate me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s exquisite features were full of infatuation. \u201cHow could I? There is no Gars without Young Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi touched his white face that was as cold as ice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I made you like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Gars anxiously took his hand. \u201cI am willing to do so. I wanted to become a vampire and Young Master had no knowledge of it. Why apologize?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sein Hall didn\u2019t know? Xie Xi laughed at himself.</p><br/><p>Gars watched him greedily. \u201cYou are so gentle and beautiful, giving my lowly self your supreme love. I just wanted to be worthy of you and strong enough to live up to your expectations.\u201d</p><br/><p>So he became a vampire?</p><br/><p>According to the information currently available, he could basically guess Gars\u2019 plot.</p><br/><p>The lowly servant receive the attention of his master. Due to his inferior status, he didn\u2019t dare respond and could only suppress it silently. The feelings became deeper and the love heavier. Eventually, the young man could no longer suppress it and sought strength in the path of a vampire.</p><br/><p>It was clear that the boy who died in the newspaper was Gars himself. Yet he didn\u2019t die and became a vampire.</p><br/><p>Everything made sense. The thing that Xie Xi wondered about was why would he show love to a teenager?</p><br/><p>The reason why Sein Hall got mixed up with the vampire Aix-en was to survive and to use the power of the vampire. The motives for the housekeeper Randy were similar.</p><br/><p>Then what about Gars? This teenager was an ordinary person before he became a vampire. What made him worthy to be used by Sein Hall?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t figure it out.</p><br/><p>The thing that Xie Xi was most unable to understand was the original owner of this body!</p><br/><p>How many people did Sein Hall provoke?</p><br/><p>He had to take it one step at a time. Now he could only accept Gars. If he didn\u2019t accept Gars, he would be killed by the assassins and could only load the file again.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sincerely hoped that the vampire and housekeeper didn\u2019t come back half-way!</p><br/><p>If the three of them confronted each other then his legs will be really unstable.</p><br/><p>After Gars calmed down, the day finally passed. The two of them were the only ones in the mansion but it was strangely safe.</p><br/><p>Gars treated him very well, as if he was literally treasure. Gars was cautious and didn\u2019t show any other behavior, as if he really was satisfied to be Sein\u2019s dog.</p><br/><p>As a normal person living in modern society, Xie Xi\u2019s mood was very complicated!</p><br/><p>The mission finally reached the fifth day.</p><br/><p>There was still no news about the housekeeper and vampire but Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare relax. Who knew what would happen in the last two days?</p><br/><p>At dawn, Xie Xi found that the mansion was lively again and the dead servants were alive.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi doubted his eyes and Gars softly explained as he helped Xie Xi change into a stylish tuxedo. \u201cYoung Master, please rest assured that they are obedient puppets.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gars observed him all this time. After seeing that he was slightly unhappy, Gars immediately said, \u201cIf Young Master doesn\u2019t like it, I will.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to feel tired again. In any case, they were all game NPCs.</p><br/><p>Gars looked down but his words could frighten an individual to death. \u201cI hope that this mansion can only be you and me. I want to take care of everything. It\u2019s just\u2026 I can\u2019t leave your sight. Thus, some trivial things will inevitably be handed over to others.\u201d</p><br/><p>His mouth said he couldn\u2019t leave Xie Xi\u2019s sight but it was actually Xie Xi who couldn\u2019t leave his sight!</p><br/><p>Forget it\u2026</p><br/><p>There were only two days left and Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to worry about the details.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can arrange it.\u201d Xie Xi replied. \u201cI believe in you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gars\u2019 eyes lit up and his mouth was full of sweetness. \u201cAt noon, Master Greenton will come to visit. Shall I arrange a luncheon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had a headache when he head the name. He wanted to refuse when the bottom right corner unexpectedly gave him a hint:</p><br/><p>[Greenton Casa, your cousin.]</p><br/><p>It turned out that this Master Greenton was Sein Hall\u2019s cousin? Then what? There was just a line of words? There was no special significance?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought for a moment before deciding to see this person, just in case he was an important plot character and missing him might be a mistake.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xie Xi answered. \u201cPrepare some things that my cousin loves for noon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>At 10 o\u2019clock, Master Greenton\u2019s carriage arrived. Due to the \u2018resurrection\u2019 as puppets by Gars, the mansion looked orderly and no different from usual.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi went out to greet Master Greenton.</p><br/><p>The blond youth descended from the carriage with a bright smile. He was dressed in a double-breasted coat with a white shirt underneath that was tucked into his belt. He also wore handsome leather boots over his white breeches.</p><br/><p>\u201cSein.\u201d Greenton stepped forward and took Xie Xi\u2019s hand. \u201cHow many days has it been since I\u2019ve seen you. Why are you so thin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi exclaimed, \u2018I have died so many times, how can I not be thin?\u2019</p><br/><p>Greenton was very different from the other people. He was handsome and vibrant. He seemed to be three or four years older than Sein, which was the best age for a man.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t think much. He just felt this person\u2019s smile was very bright and warm.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin, you also look thinner.\u201d Xie Xi greeted him appropriately.</p><br/><p>Greenton replied, \u201cIs that right? I have been actively exercising actively. No wonder why I am thinner!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t take the initiative to find a topic but Greenton was very talkative. The atmosphere was livened up by him with a few words.</p><br/><p>He saw Gars and asked, \u201cWhat about Randy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied quietly, \u201cHe went out to take care of some things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Greenton didn\u2019t ask much and talked about idle things.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt good about him. He thought this might be the only normal NPC in the game.</p><br/><p>After a lengthy lunch, the two of them went to the garden to have afternoon tea and digest.</p><br/><p>Greenton seemed to think of something. He said to Gars, \u201cI have a good tea set in my carriage. Can you help me get it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gars glanced at Xie Xi and Xie Xi sent him a soothing look. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gars looked down and felt there should be no danger. He bowed and left.</p><br/><p>After Gars left, Xie Xi felt that something might happen. He never imagined that his cousin, who looked normal and sunny, would suddenly grab his hand in a heated manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about anything else. I don\u2019t care about the family or the world. Sein\u2026 let\u2019s run away!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

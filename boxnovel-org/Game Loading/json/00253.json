Even the sky was no different.</p><br/><p>The only difference between the two was that there were no sleeping souls and light groups in Jiang Xie\u2019s garden.</p><br/><p>There was no one here.</p><br/><p>Then\u2026 he entered the black fog and returned back to Central?</p><br/><p>How was that possible? Was his repair task completed? The task of finding the true spirit was inexplicably over?</p><br/><p>What exactly was the spirit of the world? If it was Jiang Xie\u2019s soul then there were still eight that hadn\u2019t been repaired.</p><br/><p>Even Cancer Jiang\u2026</p><br/><p>Was the key point that Cancer bravely faced the collapsing world and resisted it.</p><br/><p>Did this make sense? After all, from the point of view of intentions, the black fog meant collapse. Jiang Xie wanting to enter meant leaving the feeling of being abandoned and wanting to save the world.</p><br/><p>However, this still wasn\u2019t quite right. He shouldn\u2019t return to Central all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at the system panel and found that it was restored to its original state. He could view various information and props.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi realized that it had been a long time since he saw Roast Pork Bun.</p><br/><p>After being a kitten, he was feeling quite kindly towards the kitten.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun pounced on Xie Xi the moment he was released. \u201cDaddy!\u201d</p><br/><p>The furry white cat was much more beautiful than the black and white Cat Xie in Aries\u2019 world.</p><br/><p>After all, this variety was more expensive.</p><br/><p>The uneasiness in Xie Xi\u2019s heart was scattered because of Roast Pork Bun\u2019s appearance. If he wasn\u2019t back in Central then how could he see Roast Pork Bun?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi rubbed the soft little head. \u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was good but I especially missed Daddy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The pet box and the outside world were relatively still. It wasn\u2019t possible for the cat to miss Xie Xi even if he wanted to!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi poked the small head. \u201cYour tongue is slippery.\u201d</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun didn\u2019t understand and rolled around in this person\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi teased the cat while walking to the pavilion. As he approached, he saw Jiang Xie in a black uniform.</p><br/><p>In Central, the uniform of a beginner player was white, the intermediate was blue, advanced was purple and the god players were black.</p><br/><p>This colour not only represented their identity because also distinguished the ability of the uniform.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had been in the collapsed world for so long that he was in a bit of a trance when he saw Jiang Xie in a uniform.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie poured the hot tea and greeted him. \u201cMy repairer worked hard. Come and rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>This tone that wasn\u2019t serious\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi quickly walked forward, ignored the tea and kissed this person.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi only now discovered how much he had been thinking of this person.</p><br/><p>In fact, they had never been separated. They were together in each world but Xie Xi still wanted the complete Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>After seeing that someone\u2019s hands were becoming messier, Xie Xi pushed the squished Roast Pork Bun at the other person. \u201cDon\u2019t make trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun was very skilled and treated Jiang Xie as a father.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stated, \u201cIf we want to have a child then perhaps it will really be a kitten.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had actually been a cat.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glared at him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told Roast Pork Bun seriously, \u201cYour father is a black and white cat, bigger than you\u2026 but still beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun\u2019s exotic eyes widened. \u201cDaddy is really my father!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun immediately looked disappointed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke again, \u201cIf you are his child, he must be your mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He grabbed Roast Pork Bun and told him, \u201cDon\u2019t listen to his nonsense!\u201d</p><br/><p>In order to prevent the kitten from being taught bad things, Xie Xi returned Roast Pork Bun to the pet bar.</p><br/><p>The little light bulb was gone and Jiang Xie was even more unscrupulous.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had many things in his heart and didn\u2019t give Jiang Xie a chance to act in a messy manner. He asked, \u201cHow come I suddenly came out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mission was completed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were still eight more light groups.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stated, \u201cYou can\u2019t eat a fat person in one breath. Take your time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi still didn\u2019t understand. \u201cThen what the hell is the world? It is called the 12 Boundaries but it is over with only four souls?\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t sure if he had even brought Cancer back.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wondered, \u201cOther people are very pleased to return to Central. Are you still not happy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, being able to return to Central was a big hurdle for players and they wouldn\u2019t question it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at this person. \u201cHowever, there are still eight souls.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to capture them all in one go?\u201d</p><br/><p>This deficient person was aware of it!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi muttered, \u201cI always feel it isn\u2019t quite right. The end is too sudden and what is the true spirit of the world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained to him, \u201c12 Boundaries is my quasi-world and the spirit is naturally me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi answered, \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be over. I haven\u2019t recovered all 12 of your souls yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cRead the task carefully. It didn\u2019t write that you had to find all the souls of the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi carefully recalled it.</p><br/><p>General Task: Find the true spirit and repair him.</p><br/><p>It really wasn\u2019t about getting back all the souls\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was still unsure. \u201cThen why did it end with Cancer?\u201d</p><br/><p>If there was no stipulation to find all the souls, why didn\u2019t he return to Central when Aries, Taurus or Gemini were over?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie answered, \u201cMaybe you prefer Cancer?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi yelled at him. \u201cTalk seriously!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie became serious. \u201cMaybe you missed me too much?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d His itchy hands wanted domestic violence!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie hugged him. \u201cOnce you experience more worlds, you will understand that anything can happen but no matter what happens in the quasi-worlds, it is a good thing to return to the Central Government.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was that so? Xie Xi still felt strange but it was hard to pinpoint where it was strange.</p><br/><p>He suddenly said, \u201cThere are eight souls that haven\u2019t been recovered.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was what he couldn\u2019t rest assured about. His heart always felt disturbed if Jiang Xie\u2019s souls weren\u2019t fully recovered.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, they will come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi still felt strange in his heart but he had to admit that he had indeed returned to Central.</p><br/><p>Since he was back then he shouldn\u2019t think too much. Just as Jiang Xie mentioned, there were thousands of quasi-worlds and who knew what type of situation would happen. He might just have too little experience.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll see what the next quasi-world is.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were still eight souls, leading to many long nights and reams. He wanted to repair them as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie interrupted him. \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy for you to come back. Why so urgent?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if someone gets the task of erasing them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, as long as there is a soul, the world is easy to repair. The Central Government won\u2019t release an erasing task.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was it like this?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also felt that he was making a fuss. Jiang Xie knew much more than he did. Jiang Xie might have a poor mouth but he was reliable and definitely wouldn\u2019t joke about this type of thing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi leaned into Jiang Xie\u2019s arms and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cI always feel a bit uneasy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned down to kiss his forehead. \u201cWhat is wrong when you\u2019re in my arms?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hit this person\u2019s dishonest hand. \u201cYou are the most uncomfortable thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you feel too much pressure then I will help you release it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He held Xie Xi down as he spoke.</p><br/><p>The usual Xie Xi pushed this person away with words but his body was cooperative.</p><br/><p>However, today he wasn\u2019t in the mood. He lay in the flowers and told Jiang Xie, \u201cWas the Yan Zhe in Cancer\u2019s world really the God Yan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie kissed him on the collarbone and looked up at him. \u201cDon\u2019t mention other men at this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie could only stop, sitting up and telling him, \u201cOkay my curious kitten, ask me whatever you want to ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>His \u2018kitten\u2019 bit him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sorted his clothes and seriously asked, \u201cThe world of Cancer, is that what God Yan really encountered?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cAlmost.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was surprised, \u201cThat world is your past?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t the complete past, but it is basically the same thing, apart from the fact that you weren\u2019t present.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was similar to Xie Xi\u2019s guess and he asked, \u201cIs that God Yan\u2019s original world?\u201d</p><br/><p>It shouldn\u2019t be, right? Central players could only enter quasi-worlds and players were selected from independent worlds that had already been cleared. Thus, Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t enter God Yan\u2019s original world as a player.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cI met Yan Zhe in an assembly task. The quasi-world was similar to Cancer\u2019s world but it was more ferocious\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke slowly, helped Xie Xi sketch out the real past.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t sure about Yan Zhe\u2019s original world. This involved the privacy of each player and was the last thing to be touched.</p><br/><p>In addition, Jiang Xie and Yan Zhe met each other after they reached Central.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe got such a physique after entering a quasi-world similar to Cancer. He was just a new person and didn\u2019t have the ability to protect himself.</p><br/><p>In fact, his experience was worse than it was in Cancer\u2019s world.</p><br/><p>His physique was targeted by the residents of the world and he also had to beware of players from Central.</p><br/><p>Combined with the immunity to fatal injuries, he died and revived several times, causing his spirit to collapse.</p><br/><p>By the time Jiang Xie saved him, he was a frightened bird and it took him half a month to speak.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cGod Yan really didn\u2019t have it easy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Thanks to this experience, he returned to the Central Government and triggered the occupation change task of the healer. It took him a long time to qualify for the promotion but it was a blessing in disguise.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a bit like the process of Xie Xi getting the Repairer class. He got Beginner Repair in the open world, upgraded it and slowly triggered the Repairer\u2019s occupation mission.</p><br/><p>However, compared to Yan Zhe, he was really lucky to get the special class.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed and asked Jiang Xie, \u201cWhat about you? You were a newcomer as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t possible to get the same assembly task if he wasn\u2019t a beginner player.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t really new\u2026\u201d Jiang Xie continued with a wry smile. \u201cI should\u2019ve been through nearly 100 quasi-worlds, despite being a beginner player.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy luck was too bad and I lost experience several times.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d He knew this person was unlucky but he didn\u2019t expect it to be this bad!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a bad thing. It was common and I could deal with everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Cancer\u2019s rich combat experience was gained from the real Jiang Xie going through nearly 100 worlds!</p><br/><p>For a time, Xie Xi didn\u2019t know if he should feel distress or admiration.</p><br/><p>He asked again, \u201cHow did you clear it at the beginning?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cI\u2019m glad that you value me so much but I can\u2019t remember the things that happened a long time ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>Also\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie walked through so many worlds as a beginner player. After that\u2026 Xie Xi couldn\u2019t imagine.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t bear to ask again and changed the topic. \u201cAre God Yan and the others back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before they went to Collapsing 12 Boundaries, Yan Zhe and the others had gone to the quasi-world Xie Xi designed with Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cOf course, they are back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Time in Central was relative. There was no need to care about how long a player spent in the quasi-worlds. Once they came out of the quasi-world, they would see other players.</p><br/><p>Something flashed in Xie Xi\u2019s head and he felt it wasn\u2019t quite right\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie suggested, \u201cDo you want to see their recording?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suddenly remembered. He looked at Jiang Xie and his blood was cold.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was aware of his anomaly. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s lips trembled and he said, \u201cThe recording is too long\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can quickly go in and see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cIt is very troublesome. It is better to let God Yan come over and ask him directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>He seemed to send a message to Yan Zhe.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him without blinking.</p><br/><p>He remembered\u2026</p><br/><p>In the 12 Boundaries, Jiang Xie opened the white space. Then why wasn\u2019t the current Jiang Xie injured?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The big movement caused the two people below to look up.</p><br/><p>Big Jiang was surprised when he saw the same face as himself while Little Jiang greeted the other person. \u201cMr. J.\u201d</p><br/><p>They knew each other previously and Xie Xi got the clue about J from Little Jiang.</p><br/><p>Big Jiang watched J in an alert manner but his expression naturally didn\u2019t change. He also got up and greeted this person. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was sandwiched in the middle and wanted to hold the mother universe tightly. He shrank back from these \u2018sinister evils.\u2019</p><br/><p>J bent over to pick up the iron box and walked down the stairs. There was an unexpected incident that caused him to have a taut face. After greeting the two people, he glanced over at Little Jiang. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to meet you here.\u201d The implication was how could the rebel leader currently be in the presidential palace?</p><br/><p>Little Jiang was clever but he didn\u2019t think that Mr. J\u2019s unforgettable lover was Xie Xi! After all, according to conventional brain circuits, an emotional could only fall in love with an emotional. How could J\u2019s lover be a rational? Therefore, Little Jiang didn\u2019t have any doubts.</p><br/><p>He said, \u201cIn the face of a disaster, nothing else matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi inwardly thought, \u2018Yet you still care about confessing!\u2019</p><br/><p>J wasn\u2019t too surprised and asked another question, \u201cAre you an emotional?\u201d He heard it all and there was nothing to hide.</p><br/><p>Little Jiang was young and felt a bit embarrassed about his confession being heard by an acquaintance. He nodded. \u201cSorry, I lied to you before.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was speaking to both J and Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>J and Xie Xi both had complicated expressions! He didn\u2019t confess early or late, he did it right at the critical point of the universe rescue operation. What if Jiang Xie went on strike?</p><br/><p>Fortunately, J was calmer than Xie Xi\u2019s imagination. After all, this was Jiang Xie. Apart from the young and slightly immature Little Jiang, the other two were old foxes!</p><br/><p>J kindly cautioned, \u201cThe president is a rational. If you confess to a ration, it is impossible to get a response.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words cleared a path for Xie Xi. Who knew that Little Jiang would be fearless and seriously reply, \u201cI know but I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned to look at Xie Xi. \u201cI just want to tell you that I like you.\u201d The pair of indigo eyes wrapped around Xie Xi like the sea.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s fake rational heart trembled.</p><br/><p>After all, the person he loved confessed in such a straightforward and blunt manner. How could he stand it?</p><br/><p>On the side, Big Jiang chuckled. His voice was very low and contained a hint of coolness, but it was surprisingly good. It was like beautiful snow falling lightly on the tip of the ear.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suddenly came to his senses. Why was Big Jiang so calm, confident and not taking it seriously? It was because\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mouth was dry. \u201cYou are still young.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, the Little Jiang in front of him was taller than President Xie but he was only 15 or 16 years old, a minor.</p><br/><p>This was without mentioning Xie Xi\u2019s gender. Even if he was emotional, it would be impossible for him to fall in love with a minor. It was thanks to this age problem that Big Jiang was so indifferent.</p><br/><p>Little Jiang was young but clever. His next sentence was, \u201cOnce I am an adult, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart jumped and he was afraid of the next words. Fortunately, someone else was more afraid than him.</p><br/><p>Big Jiang frowned and interrupted. \u201cDon\u2019t embarrass him. Or do you want to threaten him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help praising in his heart, \u2018Good Big Jiang!\u2019</p><br/><p>Little Jiang immediately cried out, \u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d</p><br/><p>Big Jiang wondered, \u201cThen why do you want to confess now? We are going on a mission soon and how do you want him to reply to you? If he refuses, will you be angry and refuse to do the mission? If he doesn\u2019t refuse, how can he like a child like you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood. It was no wonder why Big Jiang had Little Jiang look at the movie. He expected that Little Jiang would \u2018absorb\u2019 the movie experience and directly confess. Unfortunately, the timing, age of Little Jiang and Xie Xi\u2019s gender meant this confession wouldn\u2019t have any results.</p><br/><p>His move not only made Little Jiang frustrated but also dismissed the trick of sleepwalking while letting Xie Xi know Little Jiang\u2019s gender. According to the rules of rational and emotional people, Xie Xi would definitely stay away from Little Jiang.</p><br/><p>The point was that if Xie Xi had the idea of going to bed previously, he wouldn\u2019t have it now!</p><br/><p>Such an arrow made Xie Xi feel admiration\u2026 too sly! Was this person so happy to calculate against himself?</p><br/><p>Who wanted to see them dig their own pits, jump into it themselves and then gloat!</p><br/><p>In contrast, the calm J didn\u2019t expose anything and stayed out of it.</p><br/><p>Even if Big Jiang was like Holmes, it was impossible to guess that J and Xie Xi had such a relationship.</p><br/><p>If Big Jiang knew, he would probably change his strategy and join forces with Little Jiang to deal with J first. After all, in every way, the threat of J was greater. The \u2018old and weak\u2019 group of Big Jiang and Little Jiang should be consistent outwardly while slowly fighting inwardly.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought this and couldn\u2019t help rolling his eyes at himself. He was now really experienced and could guess 10 moves ahead in the chess game!</p><br/><p>Thanks to Big Jiang, things barely calmed down.</p><br/><p>Little Jiang opened his mouth, \u201cMr. President, rest assured that I will finish the task well.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t mention anything else about the confession.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was relieved. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare say anything else because he was afraid of causing a terrible chain reaction.</p><br/><p>Big Jiang told them, \u201cDinner is ready. We should go eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was like the head of the household. There was no other way. He had been president and was more familiar with the presidential palace than Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t forget about J. \u201cLet\u2019s go eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>J glanced at Big Jiang with obvious doubts in his heart.</p><br/><p>Young man, there was no need to look or doubt. This person was indeed an emotional.</p><br/><p>J couldn\u2019t help smiling when he entered the dining room and saw the beautiful landscape painting.</p><br/><p>This was his work. He remembered that when he created this painting, Xie Xi had accompanied him to stay in the forest for one month. They had lived in the tree house for a while.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had fast-forwarded through that sweet and greasy memory but his brain could keep up with a speed of light computer. He clearly saw the fast-forward and knew what J was thinking.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was afraid of him exposing something and smashing this barely steady thin ice.</p><br/><p>He distracted J by saying, \u201cSit down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Xie Xi became aware of a more serious problem. How should he allocate seats for such a long table?</p><br/><p>It would be fine if there were three people. Xie Xi sat at the head of the table while Jiang Xie sat on both sides of him. Now there were four people and one person was bound to be far away from Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought with no expression,</p><br/><p>\u2018Why is it a long table? We need a square table! After dinner, I can arrange a great wall on one of the three vacant places, hehe!\u2019</p><br/><p>Big Jiang was still aiming at Little Jiang. \u201cAn emotional shouldn\u2019t sit with a rational. It is safer to stay far away.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was directly placing Little Jiang and J diagonally, leaving him and Xie Xi to sit on one side. The abacus was noisy but\u2026</p><br/><p>Little Jiang broke it. \u201cAren\u2019t you an emotional?\u201d</p><br/><p>At these words, J jerked and his composure somewhat collapsed. Was Jiang Xie emotional? Then Xie Xi\u2019s ex-partner was actually emotional?</p><br/><p>This thing\u2026 too complicated!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had long known this and his expression didn\u2019t change. Big Jiang didn\u2019t panic and only sarcastically smiled. He felt that Little Jiang was a fool who killed 1,000 people while losing 800 allies, so that no one could benefit.</p><br/><p>J continued to be tense as he smiled reluctantly. \u201cHow can Mr. Jiang be emotional?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Jiang sneered. \u201cHe has been disguised for all his life and probably doesn\u2019t remember that he is emotional.\u201d</p><br/><p>Big Jiang was more ruthless. His voice was gentle but his words were astonishing. \u201cI pretended to be rational in order to get together with Xie Xi.\u201d</p><br/><p>J, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi broke the jar that casually fell and got up. \u201cYou are all emotional and should sit together to eat. I will go to that end.\u201d It was reasonable and logical. He would go to the far end of the table to eat alone. It was also quieter.</p><br/><p>How could the trio stand to let him go? They spoke in unison, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Big Jiang told them, \u201cWe have to be together every day for the mission. We should adapt sooner or later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Jiang and J both nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cHow are you going to sit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Big Jiang suggested, \u201cYou sit and I\u2019ll go over there.\u201d He saw on the left side of Little Jiang, separating Xie Xi from Little Jiang.</p><br/><p>This was the smartest way to retreat while still monitoring the \u2018love enemy.\u2019 As expected of the person who had been president. It was amazing\u2026</p><br/><p>What damn thing? Shouldn\u2019t their brains be focused on saving the universe instead of such messy things?</p><br/><p>They monitored each other during dinner and miraculously, once it finished they said they were tired and went back to their rooms to rest.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi still felt somewhat awkward. He went to the study to deal with the work he had pushed to the side today. An hour later, there was a knock on the door.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi put down the work at hand and cried out, \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person who came was J. Xie Xi wasn\u2019t surprised. He guessed this person would have something to say.</p><br/><p>The two people sat down and J got straight to the point. \u201cWhat is going on with them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke the truth. Not one word was a lie and he made the ins and outs clear.</p><br/><p>J slightly frowned. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect them to be emotional.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI didn\u2019t know either.\u201d</p><br/><p>J gazed at him. \u201cWhy did you choose Jiang Xie as a partner?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe looks exactly the same as me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare say, \u2018I saw you in him.\u2019 He was afraid he couldn\u2019t coax this person and things would blow up. He could only reply vaguely, \u201c\u2026We just met.\u201d</p><br/><p>J didn\u2019t force him and spoke warmly, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I know you have forgotten.\u201d Then he took Xie Xi\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t pull away, even if he was a bit dismayed at the moment and he got goosebumps.</p><br/><p>Sure enough\u2026 they had gone back to their rooms early for a so-called rest in order to avoid each other and find Xie Xi for a private chat.</p><br/><p>J was first and second was Big Jiang.</p><br/><p>Big Jiang was the deadliest one because he did a lot of Xie Xi\u2019s work and he had permission to enter the study. He came directly in while saying, \u201cXiao Xie, take a break and drink some\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished his words when he saw the two people sitting on the sofa while holding hands.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt that it was now too late to pull away and in any case, it was just a pair of hands.</p><br/><p>Big Jiang was really stable. He saw such a scene yet he could still be calm. \u201cI thought there was no one else here and came in. Sorry to bother you.\u201d</p><br/><p>J held the other person\u2019s hand more tightly and wondered, \u201cMr. Jiang, weren\u2019t you resting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. J doesn\u2019t seem to be resting either.\u201d</p><br/><p>J smiled. \u201cXiao Xie didn\u2019t sleep so I couldn\u2019t feel reassured.\u201d</p><br/><p>This intimate term was tantamount to a declaration of war!</p><br/><p>Big Jiang raised his eyebrows. \u201cHe followed me since the age of 13. I never knew he was friendly with an emotional painter.\u201d</p><br/><p>The smell of gunpowder couldn\u2019t be hidden anymore! The miraculous thing was that Xie Xi was in the centre of the storm and was safe.</p><br/><p>J gazed gently at Xie Xi. \u201cWe aren\u2019t very familiar in this cycle but in our first reincarnation, we were partners for a lifetime.\u201d</p><br/><p>Big Jiang\u2019s eyes sunk as the colour deepened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d J added like he remembered something. \u201cMany of the works in the presidential palace were created when Xiao Xie was by my side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Big Jiang\u2019s lips slightly raised. \u201cGoing into reincarnation is starting a new life. Mr. J, why use the long forgotten past to disturb his new life?\u201d</p><br/><p>J smiled and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Big Jiang didn\u2019t think a rational could know love and added, \u201cNot to mention that you are an emotional. How can you stay together with a rational?\u201d It was just living together, who hadn\u2019t done that?\u201d</p><br/><p>J had been waiting for this sentence and slowly spoke, \u201cIf two people are in love, aren\u2019t they together?\u201d</p><br/><p>Big Jiang\u2019s pupils shrank when he heard this.</p><br/><p>J stared at Big Jiang in a certain manner. \u201cIn the first round, Xie Xi loved me.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

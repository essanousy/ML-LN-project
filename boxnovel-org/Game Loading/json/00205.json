Besides, it was a collapsed small world and everything was directed at him.</p><br/><p>As long as Xie Xi draw a money bill, it could pass through layers of testing and it was cheaper than real money.</p><br/><p>However, he couldn\u2019t create too much. It wasn\u2019t a matter of worrying about inflation since it wasn\u2019t easy for ordinary people to use all of it. It just wasn\u2019t easy to explain.</p><br/><p>One or two could be said to be blown over by the wind\u2026 a pile like this was like a tornado sweeping through a bank vault!</p><br/><p>Young Aries would be frightened to death!</p><br/><p>What should he do? Cat Xie stood on the \u2018mountain of money\u2019 and worried about it.</p><br/><p>It was only two in the morning. Little Jiang hadn\u2019t woken up yet. Xie Xi had to use this time to destroy the bulk of the money.</p><br/><p>It was unrealistic to throw it out. He had to find ways to make them more fragmented.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could draw a shredder using the god\u2019s wisdom but what if the sound woke up Jiang Xie?</p><br/><p>Besides, after breaking up these \u2018pieces of paper\u2019, how could he dispose of the shredder? Based on Cat Xie\u2019s small body he would be crushed to death by the large amount of money, let alone the machine.</p><br/><p>In addition, there was so much money that Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t finish by dawn if he did it one by one.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about it and finally came up with a strange trick. Now it wasn\u2019t the beginner version of the god\u2019s wisdom and he could draw anything.</p><br/><p>His mindset was confined to Earth but he had experienced many worlds. Why didn\u2019t he try drawing something from one of those worlds?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi remembered that there were many high-tech gadgets in the last world, such as the washing ball that allowed him to take a bath and wash clothes. Another example was something the size of a rice grain that could turn into a vehicle\u2026</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right! Xie Xi remembered there was an environmental ball dedicated to dealing with garbage.</p><br/><p>Just point it at something and the target would take into molecular free objects in the air!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t sure if he could draw it but it was worth a try. The kitten picked up the sketch pen and drew an image on the god\u2019s wisdom.</p><br/><p>The environmental ball was green, the size was almost this big and there were small spots\u2026</p><br/><p>That\u2019s it! The sketch pen drew out Xie Xi\u2019s imaginary environmental ball. Let\u2019s check if the god\u2019s wisdom could create a real environmental ball! Xie Xi held his breath and watched quietly\u2026</p><br/><p>In fact, the process of creation was very fast and didn\u2019t delay for even 0.1 seconds. It was just that his expectations were so high that it felt like a very long time.</p><br/><p>A tennis ball sized green ball rolled towards the paper money. Xie Xi jumped down and grabbed the environmental ball.</p><br/><p>The way this thing opened was very simple. He just needed to pull this ring out. Xie Xi stretched out his claws and hooked them hard against the ring\u2026</p><br/><p>It was ready! Next, he just had to hold down the button and align the decomposition end with the paper money.</p><br/><p>This thing was risk-free for people. He just needed to touch it to the right place and avoid the place that was similar to a \u2018blade.\u2019 This was a bit dangerous for a kitten but Xie Xi wasn\u2019t a real cat. He would be careful and nothing would happen.</p><br/><p>He tried it and was relieved when the banknotes disappeared into thin air. Fortunately, the creation of the god\u2019s wisdom had no limitations. It seemed that Xie Xi could create anything.</p><br/><p>Was this actually creation? It was a bit like copying. After all, creation should mean something that never existed. On the other hand, this environmental ball didn\u2019t exist in this world.</p><br/><p>The environmental ball had a limit to its uses and it was an empty shell after all the banknotes were disposed of. Just throw such a thing into the trash can!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at the banknotes remaining and was greatly relieved. Next time, he just had to think about making less money.</p><br/><p>After acting for so long, Xie Xi was tired and climbed back into Jiang Xie\u2019s bed, yawning in his arms.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie seemed to open his eyes a bit as he gazed at the kitten lying in his arms, cautiously hugging the kitten. He dreamt that he had a companion, a kitten. It turned out that it wasn\u2019t a dream.</p><br/><p>After a good night\u2019s sleep, Xie Xi was full of energy and woke up once Jiang Xie opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wondered, \u201cYou woke up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cGo and collect the money.\u201d Meow meow meow.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cYou are really coquettish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c????\u201d Teenager, do you have a misunderstanding of the word coquettish?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie got out of bed while chugging Xie Xi. \u201cAre you hungry? I don\u2019t know what you like to eat so I bought a few trial flavours.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was talking about the cat food. Xie Xi scoffed at why he had to eat cat good. Then Jiang Xie opened the packet and poured out the cat food\u2026</p><br/><p>Cat Xie\u2019s eyes widened. How could it be so fragrant?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie placed the cat food bowl in front of him. \u201cTry it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told himself, \u201cNo, I\u2019m a person. I\u2019m really a person.\u201d</p><br/><p>He took a bite. Jiang Xie asked, \u201cIs it delicious?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cat Xie eating the delicious food. \u201cIt isn\u2019t delicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is good if you like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shouted, \u201cI don\u2019t like it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNext time, I will buy this for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Forget it, he didn\u2019t make any sense at all.</p><br/><p>After eating and drinking enough, Xie Xi waited for the teenager to pick up the money.</p><br/><p>Last night, Xie Xi thought for a while before finding a suitable position and placed the money by a half-open window.</p><br/><p>It might seem fantastical that the wind would blow this type of thing but it was more believable than a domestic cat drawing money in the middle of the night!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie came here and was stunned. \u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cTeenager, you have enough for today\u2019s meal. Go eat something good.\u201d</p><br/><p>His meowed and listened to Jiang Xie mutter, \u201cThis is the fourth floor. Is there still paper flying over here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi froze. \u201cPaper? Are you mistaking money as paper?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie picked up a 100 yuan bill and wondered, \u201cIs this a banknote?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard these words and his heart thumped. Was the currency of this world different from his? The background environment might be similar and Jiang Xie said their words were similar but\u2026</p><br/><p>No, Xie Xi was surprised. Why did he think this was Jiang Xie\u2019s original world? Wasn\u2019t this a collapsed quasi-world?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie looked at the banknote and laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it came from but it is quite delicate.\u201d</p><br/><p>He seemed to be afraid the kitten would eat something unclean and threw the paper money into the trash.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He started from two in the morning and worked hard for three hours to get so little money. He threw it at this person and\u2026</p><br/><p>The breadwinner was really tired and Cat Xie lay down.</p><br/><p>After eating breakfast, Jiang Xie needed to go and it was reasonable to say that Xie Xi should stay at home. However, he wasn\u2019t reassured.</p><br/><p>He had to learn more about the world. It wasn\u2019t just money but also Jiang Xie\u2019s current life. He didn\u2019t come here to be a cat. He had to find the true spirit, even if he didn\u2019t know what that meant.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie put on the school uniform and hung a black bag from one shoulder. He seemed to be going to school? Xie Xi jumped onto his uniform pants and tried to climb up.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned down and picked him up. \u201cBe good at home. I\u2019ll come back after school.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBring me with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>One person and one cat were connected at this time. Jiang Xie shook his head. \u201cNo, the outside world is too dangerous. I can\u2019t bring you with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be dangerous because I won\u2019t leave you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie tried to coax him. \u201cBe good and I\u2019ll bring a new toy when I come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi remembered the stick from last night and wanted to glare at this person. Jiang Xie thought Xie Xi was coaxed, put down Xie Xi and changed his shoes. Xie Xi hugged his calf again.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or cry. \u201cI really can\u2019t take you with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t say anything. After all, he couldn\u2019t be understood. He just tried to climb up and drill under this person\u2019s uniform.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was probably afraid Xie Xi would scratch his pants and held Xie Xi in his arms. \u201cBe obedient.\u201d Jiang Xie was trying to coax the cat again.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi climbed into his clothes. Fortunately, the kitten was really small and the uniform was big. Xie Xi didn\u2019t show up at all.</p><br/><p>In any case, this was a teenager and it was the first time the teenager had a companion. Jiang Xie was hesitant.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi proved with actions that he could be very good and quiet. Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes flashed and he had the illusion that this kitten could understand the human language.</p><br/><p>How could it be? This was just a kitten.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sighed. \u201cIf you are discovered then I will send you home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t say anything since he wouldn\u2019t be discovered. Jiang Xie felt his clothes move and found the kitten wrapped around his waist, a small ball that wouldn\u2019t fall off.</p><br/><p>He smiled and fished Xie Xi out. Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened as he thought he would be left behind again. Jiang Xie told him, \u201cGo into my bag and don\u2019t run around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>He finally managed to follow Jiang Xie out the door and had two goals for this trip. One was to look at the appearance of currency and the other was to look at Jiang Xie\u2019s living environment.</p><br/><p>The former wasn\u2019t urgent but the latter made Xie Xi completely distressed.</p><br/><p>On the way, Jiang Xie didn\u2019t speak to anyone. After arriving at school, Xie Xi heard the noise of students but none of them greeted Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie quietly walked alone and Xie Xi could imagine the coldness, even if he couldn\u2019t see the teenager.</p><br/><p>They arrived at the classroom and Jiang Xie sat in the last row. He had a double table to himself. The only benefit was that Xie Xi didn\u2019t need to worry about being discovered. As long as he didn\u2019t make a sound, no one would look this way.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was afraid that it would be stuffy for Xie Xi and pulled him out of the bag, fingers pressed against the cat out of fear of him running around.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi honestly lay in the open drawer of the table and licked this person\u2019s fingertips.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie grinned and patted his little head. Xie Xi\u2019s heart was pained. Why was such a good teenager isolated?</p><br/><p>Soon, Xie Xi found that it wasn\u2019t just the students who didn\u2019t talk to Jiang Xie. The teachers didn\u2019t even look at him.</p><br/><p>There were three lectures in two classrooms in the morning. Not a single teacher asked Jiang Xie a question all morning.</p><br/><p>In the large classroom filled with many people, Jiang Xie seemed invisible. It wasn\u2019t until the last class in the morning that there was some turmoil.</p><br/><p>He heard the class teacher say, \u201cKang Hong is from the province and transferred here due to his parent\u2019s work. In the future, he will be our classmate!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then a teenager introduced himself. Xie Xi looked through the table gaps but unfortunately couldn\u2019t see anything.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s situation didn\u2019t change because of the transfer student. After school, he placed the kitten in his bag. Before going home, he went to the bathroom first. As he was washing his hands, voices were heard outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cKang Hong, you must stay far away from Jiang Xie. He is very dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>The transfer student wondered, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s classmate explained, \u201cHis eyes are ghost eyes and anyone he stares at will die.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

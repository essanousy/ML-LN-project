He was almost smashed and fed to the fishes by six! Then what about 12? Don\u2019t talk about falling in love, he couldn\u2019t even remember their names! It was beyond the scope of the syllabus, it was really beyond the scope.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s complexion was white. \u201cSurely there can\u2019t be 12 souls, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t say anything. Xie Xi felt awkward. Jiang Xie told him, \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could breathe a bit. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is possible. The six souls in Atlantis was already SS-grade. Your highest quasi-world is also SS-grade so there should be seven souls at most.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could there be 12? What level would this be? In addition, could Jiang Xie really cut himself into so many pieces? This was cutting himself to death! Although, he wasn\u2019t far from cutting himself\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie also said, \u201cIf this is a collapsed world, it must\u2019ve collapsed because the souls were pulled away.\u201d Thus, even if there were originally 12 souls, there should be fewer now.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened again. \u201cYou mean, there might really be 12 souls?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have bad luck and think about the worst result. You aren\u2019t the same. You are lucky so it shouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>It all depended on luck? Xie Xi felt this was strongly unreliable. It was hard to tell if this luck was good or bad.</p><br/><p>Was it good or bad for Xie Xi to recover 12 souls in one breath? It was good to be able to recover it so wasn\u2019t this lucky? It was just that people needed to be brave enough to bear this good luck.</p><br/><p>After seeing that Xie Xi was too nervous, Jiang Xie comforted him. \u201cIt should be impossible. 12 souls won\u2019t make it an SS-grade difficulty.\u201d The highest difficulty quasi-world he designed was SS.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also thought this and couldn\u2019t help relaxing. \u201cIt should be representative of something else. There shouldn\u2019t be 12 of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie laughed. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi relaxed before unexpectedly saying, \u201cActually, it would be nice if I could help you discover 12 souls at a time.\u201d</p><br/><p>He might be exhausted but the gains would be great. There was a limit to how many soul pieces could be cut off. If it was really possible to take back 12 souls, Jiang Xie might not be in danger.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart was sweet. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Central\u2019s release of erasure tasks is regular. It will be a priority to erase the difficult to repair worlds.\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew Xie Xi must be scared by Yunge\u2019s announcement just now. In the event that someone received Jiang Xie\u2019s quasi-world and successfully erased it, Jiang Xie\u2019s soul wouldn\u2019t come back. If the souls died then Jiang Xie\u2026</p><br/><p>There was always knife hanging over Jiang Xie\u2019s head and Xie Xi was nervous. He felt he couldn\u2019t delay the time and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. If we enter then we\u2019ll know what is going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, he had an idea in his mind but it was too incredible. There had never been such a situation before and the possibility was extremely low. Thus, Jiang didn\u2019t say it to cause trouble to Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>After entering the quasi-world, he would have to play as the souls. This meant Xie Xi would have to explore things himself.</p><br/><p>He should avoid giving untrustworthy information to Xie Xi so that Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t embark on the wrong path.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mood was quite complicated. He felt that there couldn\u2019t be 12 souls. He also felt that if true or not, he should recover the souls as soon as possible to feel reassured.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was filled with this determination as he started off. He glanced at Jiang Xie and confirmed again. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was unknown how many worlds Jiang Xie went through but he had a bit of tension. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. After a short dizziness, he saw the information panel that appeared in front of him.</p><br/><p>[Welcome to the Collapsing 12 Boundaries. Please read the following information board carefully.]</p><br/><p>Name: Collapsing 12 Boundaries.</p><br/><p>Summary:</p><br/><p>Remember, things aren\u2019t real because you believe in them. It is because you believe in them that they are real.</p><br/><p>There is no eternal truth in this world because what you think is nothing more than a \u2018hypothesis.\u2019</p><br/><p>The world is hypothetical.</p><br/><p>General Task: Find the true spirit and repair him.</p><br/><p>Carried Items: God\u2019s Wisdom, Sketch Pen.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at this information panel and froze for a long time. He had a good memory and remembered the contents with almost a glance. There were too many differences compared to the previous information panel.</p><br/><p>First, there was the first sentence. It used to be \u2018welcome to the quasi-world\u2019. This time, it was \u2018welcome to the Collapsing 12 Boundaries.\u2019</p><br/><p>The next parts were missing and then the contents of the summary made his scalp feel numb.</p><br/><p>This was like a reminder to Xie Xi but it was hard to understand the reminder.</p><br/><p>The things he believed in were real? Then what did it mean by the last sentence about the world being hypothetical?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi continued to look down and pondered over these words.</p><br/><p>Every time he entered the quasi-world, the prompt would give the main task and the side task. What did this general task mean?</p><br/><p>The contents of the task were also quite subtle.</p><br/><p>Look for the real spirit? Did this mean there were fakes?</p><br/><p>Repairing it was normal. However, the word \u2018He\u2019 made Xie Xi think about it. This pronoun was generally used to describe a god. Was the spirit a god? Or an existence similar to a god?</p><br/><p>Even the last part about the items carried made Xie Xi puzzled.</p><br/><p>He had the golden items box. Due to becoming a designer and his suitability being enhanced, Jiang Xie gave him two pills to bring with this. Yet they disappeared and the only thing left was the god\u2019s wisdom and sketch pen.</p><br/><p>It was too strange. This world was surprising from the moment he entered.</p><br/><p>The information panel had disappeared. Xie Xi squinted at the lower right corner and saw the words of the complete task. This gave him some peace of mind and he became determined to do the mission.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed and calmed down after thinking about the seniors who became five balls.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie said that anything could happen in the quasi-world. Perhaps the change in the information panel was due to becoming a designer?</p><br/><p>However, if there really was going to be a change, why didn\u2019t Jiang Xie remind him in advance?</p><br/><p>Of course, this change wasn\u2019t big and Jiang Xie had been a designer for many years. It was normal to forget. Jiang Xie who was so careful\u2026</p><br/><p>Stop, Xie Xi refused to think about it. Since he had entered, he had to act calmly. Nothing had started yet and thinking too much would only make himself timid.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked around. Not surprisingly, Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t present\u2026</p><br/><p>His heart was prepared but he still felt empty when he didn\u2019t see Jiang Xie. Perhaps it was due to the different information panel.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stepped forward and sank. It felt like a falling dream, as if he had fallen down a cliff. After a violent sense of weightlessness, Xie Xi stood firm.</p><br/><p>There was darkness around him where he couldn\u2019t see his fingers and it was as if he couldn\u2019t be sure of his own existence.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t determine if he had really fallen just now. The only certain thing was that he wasn\u2019t injured. There was no pain in his body and no discomfort at all.</p><br/><p>Where the hell was this? Xie Xi wasn\u2019t afraid of darkness but he was somewhat uneasy. He couldn\u2019t help whispering, \u201cJiang Xie?\u201d</p><br/><p>An empty echo returned to his ears.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2026 Jiang Xie\u2026 Jiang Xie\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart thumped and the echo caused by his own voice increased his tension. He stopped speaking and didn\u2019t move any more. He tried to release Roast Pork Bun but\u2026</p><br/><p>The pet bar was gone. His system panel was empty. There were only the god\u2019s wisdom and sketch pen.</p><br/><p>What exactly was going on? Why was even the kitten gone? Xie Xi\u2019s thin lips unconsciously trembled.</p><br/><p>He took out the god\u2019s wisdom and sketch pen, thought about it and drew a flashlight. Thanks to the sketch pen, he could draw whatever he wanted.</p><br/><p>After drawing, the god\u2019s wisdom flashed and Xie Xi found there was a flashlight in his items bar. He sighed with relief and took it out. He turned it on and there was a straight line in the darkness.</p><br/><p>This didn\u2019t give Xie Xi any pace of mind. The light shone like a white line drawn on a huge black cloth. It didn\u2019t illuminate the surroundings but became a solitary existence crowded by darkness.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took a breath and turned off the flashlight. He didn\u2019t know why but having it on was even more terrible. It was because nothing could be seen and the darkness was a thick fog that constantly devoured the light.</p><br/><p>Where was this? What should he do next? Xie Xi didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>He walked straight ahead. He felt like a long time had passed but he wasn\u2019t tired at all.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t the real world and he wasn\u2019t himself. Fear spread like the high tide. Xie Xi controlled his mind and thought about what to do. A dark world with nothing, what should he do?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mind moved and he grabbed the god\u2019s wisdom. If there was nothing then he could create\u2026</p><br/><p>Could he do this? What should he draw? In Xie Xi\u2019s mind, Jiang Xie\u2019s garden emerged\u2026</p><br/><p>He knew that god\u2019s wisdom had creative limitations. It wasn\u2019t just limited in size but it could only create inanimate objects. Even so, his hand slowly moved.</p><br/><p>He drew Jiang Xie\u2019s garden. In the darkness where nothing could be seen, only the sea of roses in the god\u2019s wisdom could be seen.</p><br/><p>He knew that it was what he drew but his mood relaxed because of the familiar scene. He didn\u2019t know when but Xie Xi had made this garden his home. The place that symbolized Jiang Xie\u2019s spiritual world was already his safe haven.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi recovered his calm and was thinking about what to draw. Suddenly, the surrounding area brightened and Xie Xi found himself standing in a sea of roses. It was a familiar sight, a familiar garden and even the exact same pavilion.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned. He took a few steps and found that outside the garden was dark, but the garden was bright.</p><br/><p>He\u2026 he drew out the garden? What was going on? The beginner god\u2019s wisdom couldn\u2019t\u2026</p><br/><p>At this time, Xie Xi discovered that the word \u2018beginner\u2019 wasn\u2019t before the god\u2019s wisdom. It was just a plain god\u2019s wisdom. What was going on?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mind was full of fog when he saw twelve groups of light in the centre of the garden. Xie Xi headed over and saw the different colours of the light group, as well as the symbols above.</p><br/><p>Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer\u2026</p><br/><p>The 12 zodiac constellations?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Jiang Xie held the cat tightly and felt unprecedented warmth in the damp and heavy rain.</p><br/><p>They went home and this time, Cat Xie pricked his ears and stared around with round eyes, ready to recognize the road.</p><br/><p>If he lost this boy again, he would be able to run back by himself! Unfortunately, the rain was fierce and Jiang Xie didn\u2019t have an umbrella. He was afraid the kitten would be cold and pressed the cat deeply into his arms.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tried to move out but Jiang Xie pressed him back, telling him, \u201cWe\u2019ll be home soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi scolded him. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t messed around, would we have run so far?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a pity that the kitten\u2019s voice was drowned out in the heavy rain. He said this but Xie Xi felt distressed. What had Jiang Xie experienced that he wouldn\u2019t even dare take in a kitten?</p><br/><p>He said he didn\u2019t like cats. If he didn\u2019t like cats, would he wash Xie Xi so carefully as well as prepare food for him?</p><br/><p>This was clearly a gentle and careful teenager yet he showed indifference and alienation. What had he gone through?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t clear about the specific situation but he could guess based on the sixth prince\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie returned to the community at the fastest speed. He just entered the door when he saw the elevator parked on the first floor.</p><br/><p>He never took the elevator but he wanted to enter the house quickly with the kitten. Thus, he walked into the elevator.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi muttered, \u201cRunning all that way is tiring\u2026\u201d He thought Jiang Xie was tired and didn\u2019t want to climb four flights of stairs.</p><br/><p>As it happened, the elevator stopped on the second floor. Xie Xi immediately felt the tenseness of the person holding him.</p><br/><p>What happened? He looked up at Jiang Xie and found that the teenager\u2019s lips had thinned and he was suppressing his tension after calmness.</p><br/><p>The elevator door opened and a woman in her 30s with a small child was standing there. The woman was picking up the child and didn\u2019t see the person in the elevator.</p><br/><p>The child was happy. \u201cMummy, the kitten in that brother\u2019s arms is so cute!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt himself being hugged tightly and blinked. \u2018Jiang Xie, can you not give me away to another person? Just kidding, this is your community. How can I not find your door? If you send me away, I will run back!\u2019</p><br/><p>At this time, the woman looked up and her face changed slightly when she saw Jiang Xie. The child had already entered the elevator but she pulled the child out. Jiang Xie didn\u2019t say anything and stood there in a wet manner.</p><br/><p>The woman smiled and said, \u201cYou\u2026 go ahead. We are going downstairs and didn\u2019t realize the elevator had stopped.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Then Jiang Xie pressed the button to close the elevator.</p><br/><p>The elevator was closing but there was still a gap. Cat Xie\u2019s ears were good and he heard the woman on the second floor speaking to the child. \u201cStay away from him and don\u2019t look at him. How many people has he killed with those eyes!\u201d</p><br/><p>The child didn\u2019t understand and just cried because she couldn\u2019t see the kitten. The woman continued, \u201cI really want to move. How can I live downstairs from such a cursed person?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced up and saw Jiang Xie\u2019 eyelashes trembling. The teenager lowered his eyes in an attempt to cover his eyes.</p><br/><p>After becoming used to the difference, Xie Xi forgot that such eyes were extremely rare and weird in ordinary society.</p><br/><p>In fact, the colours of Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes weren\u2019t that bright. Under normal circumstances, the background colour was just a dark red and dark blue. It wasn\u2019t exaggerated to the extent of attracting people\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>Unless the person became emotional and then it would be obvious\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood why Jiang Xie had such a cold personality. It was because his mood would fluctuate less and the colour of his eyes would become more normal.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi remembered Jiang Xie\u2019s words in the rain and combined with what the woman said, he felt awkward.</p><br/><p>In Lost Atlantis, the sixth prince\u2019s mother died because of him and all those who approached him suffered misfortune.</p><br/><p>Was Jiang Xie here the same? All types of accidents happened and due to these different eyes, people placed blame on Jiang Xie that didn\u2019t belong to him.</p><br/><p>The elevator reached the fourth floor and Jiang Xie entered the house with the kitten. He carefully prepared warm water and help Xie Xi wash his dirty fur before drying it carefully.</p><br/><p>He dried Xie Xi but his clothes were still wet and his hair was drenched.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi cried out, \u201cGo take a shower and change clothes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, only meows emerged from his mouth.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie held down the moving cat. \u201cIf I don\u2019t dry you then you will catch a cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the one who will cat a cold!\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps his thoughts were too strong, making Jiang Xie sigh. \u201cAre you worried about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop talking nonsense and change clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie laughed and talked to himself. \u201cI am crazy.\u201d He felt that the kitten could understand him and was caring about him.</p><br/><p>How come\u2026 This was just a kitten and it was unknown how long the little guy could stay with him.</p><br/><p>He had been puffed up and angry for a while and now Cat Xie was too tired.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Jiang Xie still had some care regarding his body. After blowdrying the cat, he went to take a bath and change his clothes in order to not catch a cold.</p><br/><p>The weather in March and April was very cold and Jiang Xie had been running in the rain for so long. It was close to half an hour. If he didn\u2019t get sick then his physique was really excellent.</p><br/><p>Cat Xie sighed. He was now a kitten and couldn\u2019t take care of such a big Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie finished washing and his mood was very subtle when he saw the kitten lying on the sofa.</p><br/><p>He wanted to send this kitten away but couldn\u2019t. Yet if the cat stayed with him\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie touched the kitten\u2019s chin and whispered, \u201cI will kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his eyes and yelled at this person. \u201cI\u2019m not old and what is this superstitious nonsense!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t understand the meowing and thought he was hungry. \u201cI will prepare food for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Young man, am I your own pig?</p><br/><p>He said this but once Jiang Xie prepared the meal, he really ate a lot. Perhaps it was because he was a growing kitten, making him eat more. Jiang Xie didn\u2019t do anything and just watched him eat.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finished eating and glanced at this youth. \u201cYou aren\u2019t eating?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Jiang Xie got up and said, \u201cI will also find something to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>He grabbed some instant noodles and cooked them for himself. Xie Xi discovered it before but Jiang XIe\u2019s life was a bit miserable. He lived well and had good furnishings but it obviously wasn\u2019t a plentiful life.</p><br/><p>Look at the instant noodles that were eaten very sparingly, it was estimated that his life was no better than Xie Xi\u2019s past.</p><br/><p>An age of 16 or 17 wasn\u2019t too young or too old. High school was very hard and there was also the anxiety of facing the university entrance examination. Jiang Xie\u2019s specific situation also wasn\u2019t known.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew this taste. He had to work while going to school and it was so hard he didn\u2019t even have time to drink water.</p><br/><p>He thought about Jiang Xie\u2019s situation and knew it would be really stressful to raise a cat.</p><br/><p>Still, Xie Xi wasn\u2019t a real cat. How could he be raised be Jiang Xie? He was going to raise Jiang Xie!</p><br/><p>It was just that this body was too inconvenient. If he became a person, he would protect Aries and make this person smile brighter than the sun.</p><br/><p>After one person and one cat had enough to eat and drink, Jiang Xie went out. Xie Xi wanted to go out as well but was afraid he would get lost again. Thus, he stayed at home.</p><br/><p>Half an hour later, Jiang Xie came back while carrying a pile of things. Xie Xi saw the pet logo on the convenience bag and knew what this person was doing. He was so poor he had to eat instant noodles yet he bought cat food? Besides, Xie Xi wasn\u2019t a real cat and wouldn\u2019t eat these things.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie also bought a litter box that was pink and girlish.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou act so coquettishly that you should be a little female cat.\u201d Jiang Xie told him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d Young man, you have bad eyes and should hurry to get them checked!</p><br/><p>However, Cat Xie was too small and Jiang Xie had no experience with distinguishing gender. That\u2019s why he didn\u2019t discover Xie Xi\u2019s sex under the thick fur while bathing and chose the cute one.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie also took out a colourful cat toy stick. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>This shaking was as if summoning a teammate to play against monsters\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shivered and didn\u2019t want to look at it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie shook it for a while and felt some regret after finding that Xie Xi wasn\u2019t interested. \u201cWhat a waste of more than 10 yuan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>How could this person buy such luxuries when he was so poor? He was unwilling to waste this poor boy\u2019s hard-earned money and Xie Xi jumped up to bite at the stick.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes brightened and a hint of childishness filled his eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s play like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>He shook the stick again while talking. What could Xie Xi do? He had to play with this childish Aries and the stick! They played too much and eventually, it was time to sleep.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie picked up the kitten. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll play with you tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was dissatisfied. \u201cKid, I was playing with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart became soft by the meowing and he rubbed the small head. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was really tired and after a yawn, he fell asleep in Jiang Xie\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the night, Xie Xi woke up. A cat\u2019s body was very convenient at this time. He slipped out of Jiang Xie\u2019s arms and the cat\u2019s paws were also very quiet on the ground, not waking up the sleeping teenager.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi woke up at this time because he had something to do. He might be a young cat but he could also help Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>He moved quietly to the next room, found a corner where he wouldn\u2019t be discovered and took out the god\u2019s wisdom and sketch pen.</p><br/><p>The cat paws were unable to hold the pen but the mouth should be okay. Xie Xi bit the sketch pen and felt pain from his mouth before he even started drawing. This kitten was too small and it was so hard to pick up a pen!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi held the pen in his mouth and swept it crazily over the god\u2019s wisdom. Drawing was very easy with this sketch pen. The outline might not look like anything but as long as he constantly thought about it, he could draw it.</p><br/><p>What did Xie Xi want to draw? It was naturally money.</p><br/><p>The penniless hero had to live a good life. How could he be so generous despite the pain of buying a cat stick toy?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stopped the pen and looked forward to the hundreds of bills to land. Then\u2026 hundreds of bills appeared\u2026 one, two, three\u2026 100.</p><br/><p>Hold on! The kitten Xie Xi was almost crushed by the surging tide of bills. It was broken. He created a bit too much money.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He couldn\u2019t stand it when the child was soft.</p><br/><p>Due to his own experience with his mother, he didn\u2019t want to deceive the little sun.</p><br/><p>A child\u2019s dependence on their mother was something that people who had never lost their mother\u2019s love couldn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t felt very good when he needed to coax the child for the task.</p><br/><p>Now he could say it bluntly and felt quite calm. So what if Xie Xi wasn\u2019t his mother?</p><br/><p>What about a mother? So what if there was no kinship or blood relationship?</p><br/><p>The connection between people was more than that. Xie Xi had lived for more than 60 years and was incredibly aware of this.</p><br/><p>The silver-haired teenager stared at them. \u201cYou are eloquent. I would like to see what your relationships are worth!\u201d</p><br/><p>He raised his hand and the silver light rushed again. Everyone was prepared and how could they be easily tricked again? They moved quickly enough to rush to the silver-haired teenager!</p><br/><p>If they couldn\u2019t get rid of the silver light, they could control the original owner!</p><br/><p>The silver-haired teenager sneered and raised a silver wall in front of him, easily stopping everyone\u2019s attacks.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi calmed down and stared intently, his mind moving fast.</p><br/><p>The moon looked strong and seemed to be able to crush them easily. However, based on the setting of the open world, Xie Xi felt the moon couldn\u2019t be that strong.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, how could a group of ordinary players who had no skills or items beat a full level boss?</p><br/><p>It was illogical.</p><br/><p>The key to suppressing the moon should be the sun but the child was too young to understand his abilities. In addition, he seemed dependent on the moon and it was unlikely he would do anything.</p><br/><p>It was estimated that they would have to find an opportunity to suppress the moon.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s sharp eyes found that the silver light on the ground was split into groups. He was happy to find out that the moon\u2019s power was limited but he soon realized\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWatch out, everybody! Don\u2019t get hit by the silver light!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a precise attack but Xie Xi\u2019s reminder was too late. The silver light hit a lot of people and the only ones who dodged were Xie Xi and Jiang Xie. The others including Kong Rongliang, Chen Qing and the group of four were hit.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know the effect of the silver light but he didn\u2019t feel good.</p><br/><p>The small sun reacted quickly and released a golden light. Then the moon\u2019s cold voice was heard. \u201cAre you sure you want to be my enemy?\u201d</p><br/><p>The words caused the sun to deflate and he stared at the moon, pleading, \u201cBrother, don\u2019t hurt other people anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moon suddenly smiled. \u201cI just want you to see how fragile human feelings are.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little sun was startled.</p><br/><p>The moon told him, \u201cObediently come to Brother\u2019s side and wait for me to kill them. Then I will accompany you every day.\u201d</p><br/><p>He smiled softly while speaking and his silver eyes trembled, a beautiful smile on his face.</p><br/><p>The little sun was captivated, like he had been bewitched.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned as he listened and wanted to make a noise when the surroundings changed.</p><br/><p>The people hit by the silver light didn\u2019t become zombies. Instead, they were stunned for a moment and touched their chests.</p><br/><p>Then something more surprising was born. Something detached from their chest and formed an illusory shadow. The shadow soon condensed into a human appearance\u2026</p><br/><p>Screams rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Feng!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Tian, you\u2026 aren\u2019t you dead?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They called out as incredibly real people appeared in front of them. Xie Xi\u2019s heart tensed and he shouted, \u201cIt is an illusion!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, no one could hear it. They stared blindly at the people in front of them like their souls had been stolen.</p><br/><p>The moon came over. He held the sun\u2019s hand and whispered to him, \u201cYou see, this is their beloved people\u2026\u201d He stared at Xie Xi and continued, \u201cSoon they will kill their loved ones for their own survival.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi cried out, \u201cIt\u2019s all fake!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFake?\u201d The moon said, \u201cIt is the people they are thinking of. As long as they don\u2019t kill the people, they will live forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said this and Xie Xi thought of the game \u2018dream come true.\u2019</p><br/><p>The moon asked, \u201cDid you play dream come true? Do you think it is fake?\u201d</p><br/><p>That game was really designed by the moon! If there was such a degree of truth, there might be an incident. It would be too hard for them to get out.</p><br/><p>If they realized it was fake, there would be a great emptiness and they weren\u2019t willing to wake up. It was too difficult to resist. The human heart was very strong but also extremely fragile. This illusion was shown to the fullest.</p><br/><p>In the hall, only Xie Xi and Jiang Xie were sober but the moon wasn\u2019t going to let them go.</p><br/><p>His empty eyes flashed and he whispered in the sun\u2019s ears. \u201cLook at your so-called father and mother killing their loved ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sun\u2019s eyes narrowed and he pulled his hand away. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moon stared at him. \u201cYou won\u2019t listen to Brother\u2019s words?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sun\u2019s hand was released but he still bit his lower lip. \u201cBrother, this isn\u2019t right. It shouldn\u2019t be like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d The moon set him aside and looked ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I will teach you how dirty humans are.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moon was extremely fast and his slender hands almost touched Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was also very fast and he blocked in front of Xie Xi. The moon\u2019s offensive was undiminished and one palm shot towards Jiang Xie\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi cried anxiously, \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by his illusion!\u201d</p><br/><p>This teenager was best at turning people into zombies or making illusions. Jiang Xie told him, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. This illusion doesn\u2019t work on me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned. Was resistance to illusions part of his basic qualifications?</p><br/><p>No, if he could resist then Jiang Xie would\u2019ve have lost his life in dream come true.</p><br/><p>The moon frowned and retreated. \u201cThe one you love is in this hall?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s lips curved slightly. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>He continued, \u201cIf you want to let me see my loved one then I\u2019m sorry. He\u2019s right in front of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Light shone in the eyes of the sun again. \u201cBrother, you see, Daddy\u2019s favourite is Mummy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moon was stunned and his graceful eyebrows drew close together. It took a long time for Xie Xi\u2019s spirit to return. His heart was hot and there was an unknown taste.</p><br/><p>In dream come true, they had been together for over 60 years and were truly each other\u2019s loved one.</p><br/><p>They had nothing and after meeting, they were not only each other\u2019s lover but also a teacher, friend and family.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie actually still cared about these 60 years, leaving Xie Xi somewhat surprised and very\u2026 moved.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d The moon asked, \u201cDoes this guy love him back?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little sun instantly replied, \u201cMummy naturally loves Daddy!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moon smiled at Jiang Xie. \u201cDo you think he loves you too?\u201d</p><br/><p>If there hadn\u2019t been the 60 years, Jiang Xie would look at the -365 goodwill and naturally have no confidence. Now he felt that the goodwill was more like 520 instead of -365.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me try?\u201d The moon suggested. \u201cIf he loves you, my illusion won\u2019t take effect. If it works\u2026\u201d The smile on his face was very cold. \u201cYou will also know the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie shook his head. \u201cNo need, feelings aren\u2019t for testing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it seems you don\u2019t believe in him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is something between two people and there is no need for others to interfere.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moon wondered, \u201cIf your hearts are clear, how can you be afraid of my illusion?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took the initiative. \u201cUse it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moon smiled. \u201cAre you so confident?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie raised his eyebrows and told Xie Xi, \u201cHe might be able to tamper with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at the moon. \u201cI think he is more eager than us to see the truth.\u201d This seemed to sting the moon and his smile disappeared. \u201cI won\u2019t tamper with it because there is no need. I will let you understand how disgusting the human heart is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t say anything else because he wasn\u2019t afraid of the illusion. Xie Xi was perturbed and uneasy after coming out of the dream but there were no doubts.</p><br/><p>The man who gave him true love and a home was Jiang Xie. He loved Jiang Xie. Even if he couldn\u2019t accept it after waking up, this wasn\u2019t a mistake. Jiang Xie was beside him and this illusion was useless.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was still hesitant so Xie Xi looked at him and mouthed, \u2018This might be the key to clearing this.\u2019</p><br/><p>The moon obviously had a knot in his heart and it was difficult to complete the task without prying this open.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie eventually nodded. In fact, he should be happy. Xie Xi calmly confronting the illusion showed his heart. The dream was over but the sweetness of 60 years was printed on the child\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi made a request. \u201cIf the illusion is invalid, can you let everyone go?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moon\u2019s lips curved. \u201cOkay, as long as it doesn\u2019t work, I will let everyone go as well as close the moon tide and let the sun rise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes lit up and he glanced at Jiang Xie. Was it this simple? As long as he survived this illusion, he could suppress the moon?</p><br/><p>There was no doubt that the sun rising and the moon going down was the so-called suppression!</p><br/><p>The moon sneered. \u201cDon\u2019t be too happy.\u201d HIs white, glowing hand touched Xie Xi\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt his heart tremble and then it seemed like something was pouring out.</p><br/><p>A silky strand appeared from the moon\u2019s palm. This silver thread ran along the ground and slowly took a human form.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened. How could this be? He couldn\u2019t see who it was but the illusion had taken effect!</p><br/><p>The moon smiled but it was more ugly than happy. \u201cThis is your loved one. This is your heart and your mouth full of lies!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned and Jiang Xie\u2019s smiling lips straightened. Xie Xi panicked and opened his mouth. \u201cThis isn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cHe is using the same type of illusion.\u201d He might not be able to use his skills but his eyes weren\u2019t blind and he could clearly see it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shocked. He had never heard Jiang Xie sound so distant and alienated.</p><br/><p>It was strange.</p><br/><p>At this time, the silver shadow became clearer and a tall and slender man appeared.</p><br/><p>He had handsome facial features and different-coloured eyes that were eye-catching and exactly the same as Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned. He didn\u2019t expect the illusion to be Sixth Prince Sirius!</p><br/><p>The moon smiled but his eyes were full of sarcasm. \u201cThe same eyes on different people, can you tell who you truly love?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

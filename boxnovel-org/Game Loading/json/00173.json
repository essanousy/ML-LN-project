The second reason was that this was a life or death situation. One more power was useful.</p><br/><p>They all knew that Jiang Xie had an SSS-grade physique but they didn\u2019t dare entrust such an important task to him.</p><br/><p>After all, this was the leader of a rebel army. Even if he reincarnated and lost his former memories, he was still a rebel.</p><br/><p>The Secretary of Defense directly ignored his words and wondered, \u201cAn SS-grade physique isn\u2019t good?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Third Institute\u2019s president answered, \u201cThe SS-grade physique will take at least half a year. The timeliness of the data is difficult to guarantee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUse the maximum speed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe SS-grade physique will explode and die! Even if the soldiers are willing to sacrifice themselves, the person is dead and the accuracy of the data can\u2019t be guaranteed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt doubtful hearing this. It was reasonable to say that machines were better than people. Why was it the opposite here and the data collected by people was more accurate and efficient than a machine?</p><br/><p>Of course, now wasn\u2019t the time to consider this. Xie Xi made a decision. \u201cLet him go.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was naturally referring to Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>The Intelligence Minister immediately opened his mouth. \u201cMr. President, his identity\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi interrupted him. \u201cI believe in him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is too important. If he returns false news, our entire United States\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi refuted it. \u201cTheir ideal is to survive, not to destroy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The rebels opposed the US government but the fundamental reason why they hadn\u2019t been completely annihilated was because their ideas were positive.</p><br/><p>They advocated a purer freedom, a more humane rule and a more harmonious social system, rather than torching all of civilization.</p><br/><p>In the face of a common disaster, they were on the same side. They all wanted to live, to survive and to protect the United States.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi persuaded the cabinet. In fact, he didn\u2019t need to say too much because they had no choice.</p><br/><p>An SSS-grade physique was too rare and only appeared once or twice every few decades. Then after reincarnation, the physique would change.</p><br/><p>There was only Mr. Jiang, the former president, Mr. Xie Xi, the current president and the boy in front of them.</p><br/><p>Mr. Jiang was difficult to contact, Mr. Xie Xi couldn\u2019t leave the Capital Star and the only remaining choice was X.</p><br/><p>The head of the rebels, a teenager who had just turned 16 and was childish and sharp. The hope of all civilization was entrusted to him? Unfortunately, there was no choice.</p><br/><p>Things were finalized. In order to save time, Jiang Xie would depart tomorrow.</p><br/><p>His physical fitness was up to standards but other aspects had to be carefully taught to him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was taken away by the president of the Third Institute and Xie Xi handled some matters that occurred afterwards.</p><br/><p>The Third Institute\u2019s president was still in a state of high excitement and spoke very fast. Regardless of whether the person understood or not, he personally explained how to use the collector and what data to collect. Xie Xi had a headache just hearing it.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan he remember it?\u201d Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help asking.</p><br/><p>The Third Institute\u2019s president was startled to see the president and hurriedly greeted Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cThere is no problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Okay, the young man\u2019s brain was good.</p><br/><p>After teaching and practicing a few times, Jiang Xie only got a few things wrong and the Third Institute\u2019s president sighed. \u201cWorthy of an SSS-grade physique, truly worthy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was afraid of this big brother and led Jiang Xie away from the research institute.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked him, \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cGo home for dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words were simple but Jiang Xie\u2019s heart jumped when he heard \u2018go home.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was still very nervous. Letting Jiang Xie explore the pole might be an important part of the repair task and it was Jiang Xie, so there was a high probability there would be no problem. Still, this so-called concern was chaotic. Once separated, Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help worrying.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart rejected the worlds of the Third Institute\u2019s presidents and he said, \u201cPay attention to safety first. The data collection failure doesn\u2019t matter. It is important to save fuel to return. You can\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished nagging when Jiang Xie asked him, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Paying attention to safety is the most important thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so good to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned. He gazed at Jiang Xie and saw the teenager\u2019s indigo eyes.</p><br/><p>Such deep and cold eyes were filled with expectations, tension and fire. Jiang Xie had mustered up his courage to ask this.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled, his voice gentle and tender. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when you come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes brightened.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took his hand and spoke warmly, \u201cBe well and pay attention to safety.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was very stiff as he held Xie Xi\u2019s hands. His grip was very tight, as if there were invisible handcuffs. \u201cI will definitely come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Xie Xi\u2019s lips curved. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>After bidding farewell to Little Jiang, Xie Xi\u2019s heart unexpectedly felt empty. Habits were really terrible. He had adapted to the life of the two people and once separated, it felt like he lost half of himself.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, this didn\u2019t affect his handling of presidential matters. After a long time, Xie Xi found a chance to look up the enigmatic former president.</p><br/><p>The former president surnamed Jiang\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi searched and screened 10 people. The surname of Jiang was very common and there were inevitably many presidents who had the same surname.</p><br/><p>He took a long time to eliminate names and finally had three candidates left.</p><br/><p>The so-called former president wasn\u2019t the one before Xie Xi. Rather, it was someone who had been a president.</p><br/><p>In the end, Xie Xi had to sort through the surnames one by one.</p><br/><p>He was still thinking about how to lock onto the target when he saw the name and facial features. There was no mistaking it.</p><br/><p>Name: Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Age: 6 rounds, 46 years old.</p><br/><p>Gender: Rational</p><br/><p>The corners of Xie Xi\u2019s mouth tensed tightened. He didn\u2019t expect the souls in this world to be so ingenious. They were exactly the same as Jiang Xie and didn\u2019t even change their names!</p><br/><p>Was it a new friend or an old friend? Xie Xi was uncertain. He could only be sure that this was a pitiful soul left in the collapsed world.</p><br/><p>It was probably because Little Jiang was too cute that the pity in Xie Xi\u2019s heart wasn\u2019t extinguished. Thus, he felt distressed even before meeting the new soul.</p><br/><p>Other souls got to do what they wanted in their own worlds. This was a miserable soul who couldn\u2019t control the world and was driven out of office.</p><br/><p>President Xie wanted to abdicate and let him work\u2026 no, let him lead the United States to a new future!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi checked for a while. Jiang Xie was a citizen of the United States so the information on him was excellent. His resume was long.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes became wider the more he looked.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t taking advantage of their soul or doing their best to cheat in an online game. This was simply a Daoist immortal descending to the world!</p><br/><p>From the first round to the sixth round, Jiang Xie was a complete life winner. Several important cabinet positions had his name and the even more exaggerated was that every round, he was re-elected for three consecutive presidential terms\u2026 he was the president with the longest office term.</p><br/><p>The rule of the United States was to remove all past after reincarnation. Thus, he could be re-elected after his term expired as long as there were enough votes.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had lived for six rounds and served a total of 72 years as president\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suspected this soul was the collapsed god!</p><br/><p>Of course, this task wouldn\u2019t be so simple. Xie Xi was just venting his frustrations.</p><br/><p>After reading everything, Xie Xi thought about how to contact this great god.</p><br/><p>Then the communicator on his earring activated, followed by a magnetic voice. \u201cLi Su contacted me using your frequency band. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>The low voice ringing in his ears unexpectedly made Xie Xi\u2019s eyes ache. He took off the communicator and took deep breaths.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s the matter\u2026</p><br/><p>This voice\u2026</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the first day meeting Jiang Xie and Xie Xi admitted that Jiang Xie\u2019s voice was very nice. But this\u2026</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to describe it like an electric current that made Xie Xi\u2019s legs soft. Xie Xi took a while to calm down before he could think of the words.</p><br/><p>Li Su was Secretary Li. He had used Xie Xi\u2019s frequency band to contact Jiang Xie?</p><br/><p>This was normal. After all, a former president with an SSS-grade physique showing up at the critical moment gave the United States more hope.</p><br/><p>Yet the person no one could reach actually contacted him? Listening to the tone, they seemed to know each other?</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t blame Xie Xi, he thought that even as president, this wasn\u2019t a worthy soul. There was a nine out of ten chance that Jiang Xie took the opportunity to pre-engage in something.</p><br/><p>Was it an old friend? It was reasonable to say that the second and third prince had designed three worlds and were almost full. If it was an old friend, it was likely to be the fifth or sixth prince but he felt their temperaments didn\u2019t match.</p><br/><p>Old Five was sentimental and Old Six was gloomy. They weren\u2019t the same as this person.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finally replied, \u201cCan you meet me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man laughed softly, his clear voice making Xie Xi feel numb. \u201cDid you miss me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a former love but his voice was simply a cheat! Xie Xi\u2019s face heated up and he tried to remain calm as he sent his position. It didn\u2019t take Xie Xi long to see this person.</p><br/><p>The 46 year old Jiang Xie was strange and familiar. A man of this age had a unique charm. Time had settled on his brow and experience gave him an edge. If he had to descript the temperament, it was a temperament that showed maturity to its fullest.</p><br/><p>Looking at the young and tender Jiang Xie and the mature and stable former president was a great shock. They obviously looked exactly the same but were different because of their temperaments.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help thinking of Professor Jiang and the good times they had in their old age.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie opened his mouth, his voice heavy. \u201cMr. President, good afternoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi jerked and greeted the other person. \u201cGood afternoon, Mr. Jiang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled and sat opposite him. He took off the dark grey trench coat and revealed a shirt that suited his body perfect. Age only added a mature charm and hadn\u2019t damaged this perfect body.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt an indescribable sense of oppression that was invisible. The man opposite him wasn\u2019t deliberately pressuring him. It was a natural sense of oppression.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed, stabilized himself and prepared his mind to deal with this unusual Mr. Jiang.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe difficulties of the United States must be clear to you.\u201d Xie Xi subconsciously didn\u2019t use any honorifics. \u201cWe need citizens with an SSS-grade physique to perform tasks. I could only think of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked, \u201cDId you find the pole?\u201d</p><br/><p>Many of the policies implemented today were set by Jiang Xie and it was normal for him to know.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cA field trip is required for some data and an SSS-grade physique is needed for the fastest jump.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie raised his lower lip. \u201cHaven\u2019t you already found a suitable candidate?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Jiang was completing the task but\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cOnce the data comes back, there will definitely be more problems. If you can come back\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He stopped. It wasn\u2019t because he was interrupted but because of Jiang Xie\u2019s stare.</p><br/><p>The pair of dark grey eyes were calm but deep, as if looking into the deepest part of his soul.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart beat faster and he couldn\u2019t remember what he was going to say. Jiang Xie walked towards him and Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help standing up.</p><br/><p>The two of them didn\u2019t have a large difference in height but this person was so imposing that Xie Xi had the illusion of looking up.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s lips curved but it wasn\u2019t like a smile. His finger pointed at Xie Xi\u2019s heart as he slowly declared, \u201cOnce you know how to love, I will come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened and he couldn\u2019t help exclaiming, \u201cThe United States is facing a huge crisis. All civilization in the universe will disappear!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Jiang Xie replied lightly. \u201cThat isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

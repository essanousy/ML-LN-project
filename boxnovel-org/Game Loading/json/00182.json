People entered reincarnation and the first things to disappear were the social and emotional memories.</p><br/><p>As president, Xie Xi had more understanding of this aspect than ordinary people. The reincarnation centre had a secret provision. When a person reincarnated, the centre would give priority to removing social and emotional aspects while striving to preserve academic memories and skills.</p><br/><p>Thus, few people retained emotional memories of their previous rounds. The probability was as low as one in a billion.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cWhat is it that made him want to forget?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Jiang remembered he was a fake rational and tried to put on an indifferent attitude. \u201cIt is his lover from his first round. This person\u2019s memories are intermittent but it is very torturous. He is an emotional and you know that an emotional person\u2019s fragile nerves can\u2019t withstand such emotions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help asking another question. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he go find his lover?\u201d There were records for reincarnation. It wasn\u2019t public but a person could find it if they searched hard enough.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe looked for his lover but unfortunately, he was rejected. There was no way. After all, his lover forgot everything and had long begun a new cycle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, who was 100% sure this was his former lover, inwardly exclaimed, \u2018I hadn\u2019t come yet, I definitely hadn\u2019t come here!\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course, the souls didn\u2019t know when Xie Xi entered the world. He said that Xie Xi rejected him then it must be a rejected.</p><br/><p>Who made this the world of the souls? These people wanted to abuse themselves and he couldn\u2019t stop the bullets.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stated, \u201cI see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie nodded. \u201cHe was very miserable. He took the initiative to find his lover only to be rejected. Then he entered reincarnation at the age of 20 in order to forget these things. Unfortunately, 10 years passed after the reincarnation and he remembered. He found the lover and was once again rejected\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Jiang was young and unskilled at acting as a rational. Combined with these feelings for Xie Xi, he couldn\u2019t help feeling sympathy and pity, causing him to add a few more words.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the time I met him, this person had already reincarnated nine times. Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t forget his lover of the first reincarnation. This time, his lover also reincarnated and he learnt from experience. He no longer mentioned the pre-reincarnation matters and only wanted to meet and restart their relationship. Unfortunately, his lover had someone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>According to the time difference, J saw Xie Xi and Big Jiang together. Then he became disheartened and wanted to destroy himself.</p><br/><p>Little Jiang said, \u201cHe is so pitiful. He always wanted to forget but couldn\u2019t. It is better to die than to live.\u201d</p><br/><p>What damned death! If it was normal not to forget. His brain couldn\u2019t get rid of it! Why couldn\u2019t he get it?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was going to find him now. Then Xie Xi thought about how there was Big Jiang in the house, Little Jiang next to him and J who was so miserable he wanted to destroy himself.</p><br/><p>Well\u2026 it wasn\u2019t easy to be a slag. Please cherish life and stay away from slags!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi declared, \u201cI\u2019m going to find him.\u201d Based on Little Jiang\u2019s description, J met all of the self-destruction criteria. Even if the United States was resistant, they would process the application for him.</p><br/><p>An emotional person being unable to forget his lover for nine rounds of reincarnation was too cruel.</p><br/><p>In Xie Xi was his lover then they met in the first round. Xie Xi was currently 28 years old in his second round yet J had already reincarnated nine rounds. This was enough to see how short his life was in each round. He constantly died and it was estimated that his accumulated academics and skills had long declined. Living was indeed just torture.</p><br/><p>Little Jiang suggested, \u201cI\u2019ll go with you. I know him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was inwardly a slag. How could he let this person follow?</p><br/><p>He was going to save someone. If he ended up killing two people then he would cry!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cI can do it myself. You need to submit your physical fitness for self-destruction but an SSS-grade physique won\u2019t be approved so quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stubborn. \u201cI might be able to help you persuade him if I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>No, child. If you went then the universe really would be destroyed. Let the universe have a way to live!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi insisted, \u201cIt will be more complicated if he sees an acquaintance. I will try to convince him using the perspective of national righteousness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Jiang was still very easy to coax. If it was big Jiang, he would definitely become suspicious and 100% follow. Then there would be two corpses.</p><br/><p>This cold joke\u2026 it was so cold that Xie Xi couldn\u2019t laugh!</p><br/><p>He arranged things with Little Jiang and then sent a message to Big Jiang. \u201cI have something to do. I will go back later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Big Jiang replied quickly but his tone was light. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The light voice showed his exhaustion and helplessness. Xie Xi\u2019s heart was tugged.</p><br/><p>Both the palm and the back of the hand were made of flesh (both had equal importance) and any piece of skin he lifted would hurt!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI\u2019ll be back early.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help adding, \u201cOnce I come back, I\u2019ll find you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Big Jiang replied. \u201cI am sleepy and will sleep early.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He always felt this person was sincere. After all, Big Jiang stayed a few nights outside Little Jiang\u2019s door and it would be strange if he wasn\u2019t sleepy.</p><br/><p>Then Xie Xi thought about how the presidential palace might add a new person and\u2026</p><br/><p>He had to quickly complete this task, return to Central and let the souls know the truth!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi went to Capital Star\u2019s reincarnation centre. Those who applied for self-destruction would also go here. Thanks to Secretary LI, the director of the reincarnation centre fearfully started preparing for the visit.</p><br/><p>In the Earth era, this was like the nation\u2019s leader coming to a family planning office. How could the director not be nervous?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t arrived yet and read J\u2019s application that Li Su had passed to him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi got a general summary.</p><br/><p>The contents were very simple and recorded the situation of J\u2019s reincarnations. Apart from the first round, the other eight rounds could only be described as miserable.</p><br/><p>After reincarnation, he was a child and didn\u2019t understand love. Then once he entered the young and inexperienced period and started to yearn for love, the memories of the first round were like falling snow, burying him in romantic and beautiful images.</p><br/><p>The memories were beautiful but reality was cruel.</p><br/><p>Stuck in this grave where snow was piled up, he felt only a biting chill and the weight made him gradually unable to breathe.</p><br/><p>In the second round, he confessed to his lover who was also in the second round and was brutally rejected.</p><br/><p>In the third round, he confessed to his lover who was still in the second round and was rejected.</p><br/><p>The fourth round, fifth round\u2026 until the ninth round.</p><br/><p>These few words made people feel his pain and despair. The memories that couldn\u2019t be escaped and the new life that couldn\u2019t start. He sank into his past and faced only an endless abyss.</p><br/><p>The director of the reincarnation centre carefully reported, \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for his rare physique, we would\u2019ve already approved it.\u201d</p><br/><p>In humanitarian terms, J should be given the right to end his life. Fortunately, Xie Xi felt thankful that J had an SSS-grade physique or it would be too unlucky!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi arrived at the reincarnation centre and the director greeted him from a special passage.</p><br/><p>The president had come to such a small place. There was no good reason to arouse people\u2019s speculations so they tried to avoid suspicion.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi questioned, \u201cIs there a detailed record?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Wang explained, \u201cWith his consent, we have already extracted his memories. This is necessary for self-destruction. If words or the evidence isn\u2019t enough, the extracted memories can be used as verification. Of course, this is also authorized by me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI will take a look.\u201d He could only prescribe the correct medicine if he understood the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. President, please come this away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi paused and asked him, \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Wang was surprised but didn\u2019t dare think too much. He hurriedly said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t wake up so he is sleeping. Once the application is approved, he will be directly euthanized.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>How could he listen to such a thing?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi held back the idea of going to see this person and first investigated the extracted memories.</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s high-tech society had long mastered the technology to reproduce memories.</p><br/><p>Of course, this technology wasn\u2019t useful to everyone. As long as the mental strength was higher than C-grade and the subject\u2019s consciousness didn\u2019t agree, the extraction would be difficult.</p><br/><p>Seriously ill and dying people couldn\u2019t have their memories extracted because their will wasn\u2019t strong enough for a normal recollection.</p><br/><p>Not to mention that it was even more difficult to extract when dead.</p><br/><p>Therefore, it could only be extracted if there was complete agreement and no conflicts.</p><br/><p>This was better than Roast Pork Bun\u2019s dream.</p><br/><p>Dreaming allowed him to enter the person\u2019s dreams and change some thoughts, but it was difficult to find accurate memories of the past.</p><br/><p>For example, in Atlantis, Xie Xi entered several dreams and only saw messy plots.</p><br/><p>There was Old Three fighting a dragon and Old Two taking his brother\u2019s divorced husband home\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t bear to look!</p><br/><p>Moreover, Xie Xi had some concerns. This world was relatively developed and a mental strength of SSS sounded very uncomfortable. The effect of Dreaming might not be good enough and Xie Xi chose to directly watch the memories.</p><br/><p>Director Wang said, \u201cIn view of the confidentiality agreement, these memories\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI can look at them myself. Li Su, wait for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Secretary Li replied, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Wang was relieved and gave the holographic mirror to Xie Xi. Xie Xi took it and was instantly immersed\u2026</p><br/><p>There was little doubt that this was about what happened with him and Jiang Xie in the first round.</p><br/><p>Of course, this is the brain of a soul and already required a patch in the past.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was distressed but also thought a lot.</p><br/><p>Little Jiang was Azure Dragon, being played by Jiang Xie. Thus, he didn\u2019t have an opportunity to make a previous outline and was a simple youth.</p><br/><p>Big Jiang was a new soul facing the collapse of the world and the loss of abandonment. He sketched out a previous outline that was full of abuse.</p><br/><p>He pretended to be rational and fell in love with a rational. They finally broke up but he couldn\u2019t let go. At the end of 50, he wanted to enter reincarnation\u2026</p><br/><p>Compared to the souls of other worlds, the idea of suicide was obvious.</p><br/><p>Then middle Jiang\u2026 Cough, Xie Xi always thought this was a weird way of calling Jiang Xie but it seemed to be correct? According to age, this young man under the age of 30 could be considered Middle Jiang.</p><br/><p>In short, this Middle Jiang was even more miserable and didn\u2019t let go of his own meaning. The abyss pit was set from beginning to end.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was just watching and his heart and organs were full of pain.</p><br/><p>The two souls left in this collapsed world apparently felt the collapse of the world and thought they had been abandoned. They knew from the main soul that any collapsed world would be erased.</p><br/><p>The world was erased then they would no longer exist.</p><br/><p>This was why the pre-existing background was so desperate and pessimistic and the two souls considered life so lightly.</p><br/><p>The more he figured out, the more pained Xie Xi was. Fortunately, he could repair it. If he didn\u2019t repair it then Jiang Xie\u2026</p><br/><p>Okay, okay, it was really okay.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi concentrated his mind on J\u2019s memories.</p><br/><p>In the first round of reincarnation, Jiang Xie was five years older than Xie Xi and an alumnus who graduated from the same school.</p><br/><p>They were \u2018new students\u2019 and hadn\u2019t inherited previous skills or experience. Thus, they were blank paper and were in the stage of hard work.</p><br/><p>Both of them were highly qualified and were famous figures in school.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the school had a five year system. Jiang Xie graduated before Xie Xi entered and the two people hadn\u2019t met.</p><br/><p>However, Jiang Xie\u2019s legend had always circulated around the school.</p><br/><p>Later, they met at an alumni gathering.</p><br/><p>This time, Jiang Xie didn\u2019t conceal his gender. He was a thorough and very good emotional.</p><br/><p>However, Xie Xi concealed his gender. He was a rational person but when asked about his gender, he replied, \u201cI am emotional.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

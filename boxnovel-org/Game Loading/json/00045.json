His pupils contained the passion of fire, as well as some uneasiness and tension.</p><br/><p>This was fascinating.</p><br/><p>It was purely charming.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled and whispered, \u201cAren\u2019t you Randall? If so, my mind will never change.\u201d</p><br/><p>Randall held his upper arm in an excited manner. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded.</p><br/><p>Randall hugged him hard, as if holding a world famous treasure. He was filled with joy and a desire to take care of something precious.</p><br/><p>This fervent emotion infected Xie Xi, so that he couldn\u2019t help smiling.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t hate Randall.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie continued to take care of the dry roses, thinking of Xie Xi\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u2014Aren\u2019t you Randall?</p><br/><p>No.</p><br/><p>\u2014If so, my mind will never change.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, he wasn\u2019t Randall or he would never be liked by Xie Xi? Jiang Xie felt more comfortable after hearing these words and looked at the water curtain. He touched Xie Xi\u2019s forehead and said, \u201cIt is a bit clever.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought the dream was almost over. Who would\u2019ve expected it to continue? The task progress had risen to 16.5% and there was only a short distance left to the full amount.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt that if he directly said \u2018I love you\u2019, it would probably be full already.</p><br/><p>However, he couldn\u2019t say this. It wasn\u2019t just because of himself. He just felt that it would be too cruel to the fifth prince.</p><br/><p>Randall released him and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. Leave the palace, leave the capital!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked him, \u201cWhat about the queen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Randall showed toughness during his confrontation with the queen, but Xie Xi felt that Randall cared about his mother.</p><br/><p>Randall shook his head. Mother will be fine. Once I leave, she will close off her heart and no longer think about the person who had nothing.</p><br/><p>His mother loved the prince Randall, not the independent Randall. He was destined to be unable to fulfill her wish so it was easy to break it off now.</p><br/><p>This was good for everyone.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him. \u201cYour Highness, won\u2019t you regret it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Randall was startled but he soon smiled. His smile was as pure as golden sand flowing down. \u201cNo regrets. If you and I can be together, I absolutely won\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled and linked their fingers. \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll go wherever Randall goes!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was really sweet. The fifth prince smiled, his handsome face looking like a landscape painting that was so dazzling that people couldn\u2019t open their eyes.</p><br/><p>He whispered softly, \u201cI\u2019m so happy. Sein, am I really not dreaming?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tensed up.</p><br/><p>He had to say some roundabout words, \u201cIf it is a dream, we would\u2019ve received everyone\u2019s blessing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Randall smiled. \u201cYes, if it is a dream then I would have Mother accept you and make all the sea mermaids sing for us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi only hoped that Randall wouldn\u2019t remember these words when he woke up.</p><br/><p>Otherwise\u2026 it was too ironic.</p><br/><p>He just said it wasn\u2019t a dream when there was a scene change that only appeared in a dream.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Randall didn\u2019t feel that something was wrong. He thought that he left the kingdom with Xie Xi, left the centre of power and headed to the beautiful countryside.</p><br/><p>They settled down in a remote down.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince still had some savings. He bought a small house and told Xie Xi, \u201cI have temporarily wronged you. Later, I will personally design our love nest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could design it. After all, a big designer\u2026 In any case, he didn\u2019t believe the dream would last that long so he replied, \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince was spoiled. Even if he was the favourite among the princes and princesses, his mother was strong and the old king didn\u2019t want to give him the position of this. This was psychologically good for him.</p><br/><p>The prince was born with a golden spoon yet he did all types of rough work in the dream.</p><br/><p>He cleaned the house, washed the clothes and even cooked.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was surprised. \u201cYour Highness\u2026 this is amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince glanced at him. \u201cI told you, don\u2019t call me that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi corrected himself. \u201cRandall, how do you know all this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince\u2019s smugness was cute. \u201cI\u2019m not impulsive. Since I wanted to elope with you, I naturally had to be prepared!\u201d</p><br/><p>E-Elopement.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt it funny, strange and distressing.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince really wasn\u2019t joking. He seriously considered the future and prepared for it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi rolled up his sleeves. \u201cI\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince pushed him out. \u201cGive me a chance to perform. I have to let you know that you didn\u2019t choose the wrong person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was forced to retreat to the door. \u201cOkay, I will watch from here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince was quite skilled and his knife movements were excellent.</p><br/><p>The food in the underwater world had a wide variety. Of course, there was no fire and the undersea creatures didn\u2019t like to eat cooked food. It was basically sashimi as well as edible coral and fruits that were unique to the sea.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi initially wasn\u2019t used to it. After a while, he found that he kinda liked the food.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince told him, \u201cThere are fruit sacs outside. Go and pick a few.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was similar to a drink. There was a special straw at the top that they could use to drink delicious fruit pulp.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>He went outside and felt a different atmosphere as soon as he reached the fruit sac tree.</p><br/><p>A wave of killing intent brushed against his cheeks.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tensed up and a hint appeared in the lower right corner.</p><br/><p>[The dream is coming to an end. Please feel free to leave.] This was followed by a countdown.</p><br/><p>Randall\u2019s dream was over?</p><br/><p>This thought had just flashed through Xie Xi\u2019s mind when Randall\u2019s scream was heard, \u201cSein!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw the uniform of the underwater army.</p><br/><p>Randall hugged him and screamed at the soldiers holding the weapons, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi vaguely guessed what would happen next.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect the fifth prince\u2019s dream to end in such tragedy.</p><br/><p>He felt sorry but it couldn\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at the countdown and chose to leave the dream towards the end. The moment his mind was being pulled away, he heard the fifth prince\u2019s angry voice, \u201cSein, no!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi returned to reality.</p><br/><p>He quickly left the bed and hid behind a screen.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince suddenly woke up. The movement of sitting up was too big and the whole bed trembled.</p><br/><p>Most undersea people were suspended on the bed. The fact that he made such a big movement was enough to show how shocked the prince was.</p><br/><p>After a long time, the fifth prince whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s a dream\u2026 it is just a dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t seen the last scene but guessed what had happened. It was a dream where he had been killed.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know who sent the soldiers but their goal was clear: Kill Sein Hall.</p><br/><p>The orange bar stopped at 16.66% and didn\u2019t turn green. It indicated it wasn\u2019t full but the difference of 0.0066..% was very small.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Sein Hall was dead.</p><br/><p>Once the fifth prince learnt about this\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare think about it.</p><br/><p>It was still the early hours of the morning and there was some time left until dawn.</p><br/><p>However, Randall wasn\u2019t sleepy. He got out of bed and put on a coat.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t sleep and Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare go out. He could only hide behind the screen, fearing that he would be discovered.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what Randall was thinking but there was the rustling sound of him dressing.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun reported, \u201cThe fifth prince is wearing fur\u2026 ah, he is wearing clothes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t make any noise and Roast Pork Bun guessed, \u201cIt looks like he is going out.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the middle of the night. Where was he going?</p><br/><p>Randall got dressed and went out of the room. Xie Xi waited a while before following.</p><br/><p>He had a faint guess but he really felt complicated when he saw Randall go to the guards\u2019 quarters.</p><br/><p>Randall had this dream and his heart wasn\u2019t stable. He wanted to see Sein Hall.</p><br/><p>It was a pity\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hid around the corner and secretly watched.</p><br/><p>Randall stood outside the guards\u2019 quarters, hesitating for a while before eventually deciding not to go in. It was as if he didn\u2019t want to disturb Xie Xi\u2019s sleep.</p><br/><p>Still, he didn\u2019t leave. He stood there, as if waiting for dawn.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was like a bitter gourd cut into pieces.</p><br/><p>Half an hour passed and a figure staggered from the darkness. Xie Xi saw it instantly from the outline. This was the sixth prince.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun spoke on behalf of his father. \u201cA cold heart!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could barely handle staying any longer.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince saw the sixth prince and felt a sense of crisis. \u201cSixth Brother, what are you doing here so early?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince was in a trance and didn\u2019t hear the fifth prince\u2019s voice at all.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince saw him go straight to Sein Hall\u2019s bedroom and spoke in a disgruntled manner, \u201cHe is sleeping. Don\u2019t wake up him!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince didn\u2019t react. He was pale and his different-coloured eyes were lost. There was no light in them.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince\u2019s heart beat faster as he asked, \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince didn\u2019t look at him and went to open the door.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince grasped his wrist. \u201cSein is still sleeping. Why are you coming to bother him so early?\u201d</p><br/><p>The name was like a blunt knife that grinded at Sirius\u2019 heart. His hands trembled and his voice was hoarse, \u201cSein\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Randall frowned. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you? What happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sirius turned in a dazed manner towards Randall. \u201cSein\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Randall\u2019s five viscera and six bowels (from traditional Chinese medicine) seized up, the fear from his dream growing wings and flying into reality. \u201cWhat happened to Sein?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is dead.\u201d Sirius spoke in a soulless voice.</p><br/><p>Randall\u2019s pupils shrank, the veins in the hand holding Sirius\u2019s wrist bulging violently. \u201cWhat are you talking about?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sirius\u2019 eyes were wide, his lips pale enough to be transparent. \u201cSein is dead, Sein Hall\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Randall was furious. \u201cSein is kind and showed care towards you. How can you curse him like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sirius heard these words and stiffened as he thought about the warmth he received from Sein Hall.</p><br/><p>Randall said this but there was a great uneasiness in his heart. His voice trembled, \u201cHe must be sleeping\u2026\u201d Then he opened the door and saw the empty sleeping quarters.</p><br/><p>Sirius stood motionless and didn\u2019t look.</p><br/><p>Randall\u2019s face was white as he kept denying it. \u201cHe\u2026 he must be on night shift and isn\u2019t back yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sirius whispered, \u201cHe isn\u2019t coming back. He will never come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The angry and anxious Randall punched Sirius.</p><br/><p>Sirius didn\u2019t move and received the punch, blood overflowing from the corners of his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an alarmist! Sein, how can Sein\u2026 impossible!\u201d Randall couldn\u2019t believe it. Yesterday it was still good and he planned to invite Sein to a concert. He also dreamt about their wedding. How, how could\u2026</p><br/><p>Sirius spoke in a voice that didn\u2019t fluctuate. \u201cHe went to the shore with me and went to the back warehouse to find something\u2026 the ship exploded and he died.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was talking to Randall but also telling himself.</p><br/><p>Randall was stunned and stared straight ahead, his mind in chaos.</p><br/><p>Sirius\u2019 eyes were hollow. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Randall grabbed him by the collar. \u201cWhat are you talking about? He went to the shore with you? Why did you take him ashore? He is just a little mermaid. How can he stand the air on the shore?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sirius was lifeless and let himself be grabbed.</p><br/><p>Randall released him. \u201cNo, it is impossible. You\u2019re lying to me. Sein isn\u2019t dead. He can never die, I\u2026 I didn\u2019t have time to tell him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Randall staggered away. Sirius was frozen for a long time before finally walking towards Sein Hall\u2019s bed.</p><br/><p>He sat on the bed, quietly looking at everything in front of him.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun cried like a silly cat as he flew around the sixth prince. \u201cHe is so pitiful, really pitiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also felt pained.</p><br/><p>Whether it was the sixth prince or fifth prince, he was very distressed when looking at them.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that type of feeling. He just saw a friend in pain and his heart felt uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help feeling angry towards X. If X hadn\u2019t designed such a broken world, how could these two people suffer so much?</p><br/><p>Then again, they were wisps of X\u2019s consciousness. He didn\u2019t know if he should be sad about this stupid Fork.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was seeing what could be described as red and green. One moment it was +1 and the next moment it was -1. They rose and fell, like the ups and downs of life.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt guilty and accompanied the sixth prince for a while.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince had come back at night and swam all that way. He must be extremely tired.</p><br/><p>He slowly fell onto Sein Hall\u2019s bed and closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>There were no tears at the bottom of the sea but the trembling eyelashes were more distressing than any crying.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed and used Dreaming.</p><br/><p>The task progress was already full. He just wanted to comfort Sirius.</p><br/><p>[You have successfully used Dreaming and entered the dream of Sirius Atlantis.]</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his eyes and felt a heat wave.</p><br/><p>Sirius dreamt about what happened on the shore.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mood was complicated. He didn\u2019t want Sirius to fall into this unresolved nightmare forever.</p><br/><p>\u201cSirius.\u201d He called out the sixth prince\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>In the dream, Sirius didn\u2019t smile. He just looked at Xie Xi with a calm that was frightening.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi came forward to hold him. \u201cDon\u2019t be like this. I hope that you can live happily.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words were the last straw that crushed the camel.</p><br/><p>Sirius\u2019 tears flowed down and he hugged Xie Xi tightly, as if trying to pull Xie Xi into his bone marrow.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed. \u201cPromise me. Live well\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Sirius\u2019 voice was hoarse and difficult to hear.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned.</p><br/><p>Sirius\u2019 tears that fell on his neck were as piercing as ice, his voice like the cold wind of winter. \u201cIt was my incompetence that killed you. I failed to protect you and I don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSein.\u201d Sirius\u2019 cold lips touched Xie Xi\u2019s ears, his voice extremely gentle. \u201cI will make them pay the price they deserve.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

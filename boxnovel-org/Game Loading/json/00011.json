The two men stared at Xie Xi, whom they hadn\u2019t seen for a while.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was choked up and felt desperate.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t the scum man and didn\u2019t talk about love. He wasn\u2019t the one stepping on two boats but he had to face this deadly torture!</p><br/><p>How should he answer? What should he choose? Sein Hall, hurry back and clean up your mess!</p><br/><p>Sein didn\u2019t come back and his cousin Greenton strode forward fearlessly to protect Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>The vampire Aix-en\u2019s eyes filled with a dangerous and bloodthirsty light. \u201cGet out of the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Greenton didn\u2019t move. \u201cVampire, I won\u2019t let you hurt him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Gars emerged from the shadow, showing a pale and delicate countenance.</p><br/><p>Aix-en glanced at him and the red eyes narrowed. \u201cYou are still alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough, he turned Gars into a vampire!</p><br/><p>Gars wasn\u2019t afraid of this \u2018predecessor\u2019 and even raised an eyebrow in a provoking manner. \u201cYoung Master is mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence was like an explosion in the deep sea, causing waves to surge.</p><br/><p>The housekeeper Randy looked cold. \u201cGars, do you think you can replace me by wearing my clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ginger was spicier as it got older (TL: The older the wiser).</p><br/><p>The old housekeeper provoked the new housekeeper with a single sentence.</p><br/><p>Gars\u2019 fists clenched. \u201cI am me. Young Master is clear about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Randy sneered. \u201cHow did I never see how arrogant you are?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gars exclaimed, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make things difficult for Young Master!\u201d</p><br/><p>The smell of gunpowder grew heavier and the vampire Aix-en added to the fire. \u201cTwo lowly servants, how can you fight for my Small Sein?\u201d</p><br/><p>Randy turned his head. \u201cYou are evil and unworthy of the Young Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gars was even more miserable. He was a lowly servant and also an evil vampire. The arrows shot through his heart. However, he said he would fight. The young man pulled out a sword and directly stabbed it at the nearby vampire.</p><br/><p>Aix-en didn\u2019t stay still. His fingers caught the sword and he said sarcastically, \u201cHairy boy, you actually dare play in front of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gars was anxious and his eyes turned red. The housekeeper Randy couldn\u2019t miss such a good opportunity. He and Aix-en had been fighting for five days and six nights. They were exhausted. Now Gars was distracting Aix-en and Randy could take the opportunity to kill this evil!</p><br/><p>Aix-en was sensitive and instantly became aware of Randy\u2019s intentions. He sneered and stabbed back towards Randy.</p><br/><p>Randy snapped, \u201cGars, hold him down!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gars used to be a lowly maid and had to listen to Randy. Now he had strength and had been alone with the young master for so long. How could he listen to Randy? He thought about how Randy served the young master for so longer and wanted to kill him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t order me around!\u201d Gars didn\u2019t contain Aix-en but turned back to attack Randy.</p><br/><p>Randy quickly retreated and shouted, \u201cI forgot, you are also a ghostly evil!\u201d</p><br/><p>The three men fought together.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He suddenly realized the true meaning of stepping on N-boats. He had to wait for them to tear out one, two, three, four?</p><br/><p>Oh, he hadn\u2019t even talked about love before and didn\u2019t want to know this bullshit!</p><br/><p>Aix-en and Randy were strong enough to crush Gars but they consumed too much energy before. Now they were exhausted and it was hard to win.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt complicated. He prayed for them to fight for 30 hours and let him complete the mission.</p><br/><p>Greenton had no fighting power and suddenly made a mistake. He took Xie Xi\u2019s hand and said anxiously, \u201cLet\u2019s run!\u201d</p><br/><p>At almost the same time, the trio stopped and three pairs of eyes stared coldly at the hands holding each other.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d This cousin had no skills but his ability to find death was big.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch him.\u201d Aix-en ordered angrily and pulled out a bow, firing an arrow.</p><br/><p>Greenton was an ordinary person and couldn\u2019t escape. Despite this, he didn\u2019t release Xie Xi\u2019s hand. He just held it tighter.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t save him and thought one of the four boats were eliminated. He didn\u2019t expect Gars to use his sword to block the arrow, saving Greenton.</p><br/><p>Aix-en\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gars explained, \u201cHe is a sacrifice. You can\u2019t kill him.\u201d Then his eyes fell on Greenton\u2019s hand holding Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took advantage of this to break free and move away from his cousin.</p><br/><p>Greenton was full of sorrow and his thin lips moved. Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare say anything in case his words killed Greenton.</p><br/><p>Aix-en raised an eyebrow. \u201cSacrifice?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was interested. The vampire was clueless. Perhaps he could use this opportunity to get a clue.</p><br/><p>Gars sneered. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en\u2019s head jerked and he glanced at Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was speechless. \u2018If I say I don\u2019t know, will you believe it?\u2019</p><br/><p>The housekeeper Randy smashed Gars again. \u201cYou are just a failed sacrifice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gars was furious.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi listened in a daze but didn\u2019t dare ask anything. In this situation, he could only stay as quiet as a chicken since anything he said could tip him over the edge of the boat.</p><br/><p>Aix-en wanted to ask Xie Xi but then his expression changed.</p><br/><p>The door was originally smashed and the torchlight coming from outside was particularly glaring, as if it wanted to burn this own castle.</p><br/><p>There was no time for chatting.</p><br/><p>Louds sounds and the clacking of horseshoes were heard. Then people pushed through the door.</p><br/><p>They rode horses and were dressed in the clothes of the church. The old man in the lead was pale and holding an old book in his hand. He stared at the few people in the hall and ordered. \u201cQuickly hand over the devil Sein Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>Greenton stepped forward. \u201cBishop! Sein has already stopped and he won\u2019t hurt any more innocents. Please spare his life!\u201d</p><br/><p>The knight on the side of te old man felt it was easy to clean up these few people. Thus, he was arrogant and his long spear stabbed at Greenton.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t have to say anything as Gars and Randy saved Greenton.</p><br/><p>The old man solemnly placed a hand on the book. \u201cSein Hall is obsessed with the wrong path and killed innocents!\u201d</p><br/><p>The people outside held up their torches and shouted. There were more than a thousand people present.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood that this was probably the final level. Whether he could survive tonight or not was the key to the mission.</p><br/><p>Aix-en, Randy and Gars, the three people who wanted to kill each other had an unprecedented moment of unity. They stood in front of Xie Xi and said the same words. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. No one can hurt you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d His mood was even more complicated!</p><br/><p>The next one or two hours was extremely impactful for Xie Xi, who had lived in modern society.</p><br/><p>The three people challenged the entire army and created a sea of blood. Both Aix-en and Gars had amazing strength and a powerful self-healing ability. Randy had subtle swordsmanship and a body that didn\u2019t seem like a human. They stormed into the army and cut through the human warriors in armour as easily as cutting tofu.</p><br/><p>The screams and blood turned the castle into human purgatory.</p><br/><p>This scene was so real that Xie Xi was pale.</p><br/><p>At this time, Greenton asked safely, \u201cIt is irreversible?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him, speechless due to the surging in his stomach.</p><br/><p>Greenton stared at him, eyes full of guilt. \u201cIt is my fault. If I had taken you away earlier, you wouldn\u2019t\u2026 however, this is all I can do for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He picked up Xie Xi\u2019s hand and placed it against his heart.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s pupils became smaller.</p><br/><p>Greenton closed his eyes. \u201cI love you and will give everything to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>As his words finished, the blood that soaked the ground moved and drew a sinful circle.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stood in the centre of the circle, his hand piercing Greenton\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>In an instant, a red light surged up to the sky and an indescribable force surged in Xie Xi\u2019s body.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

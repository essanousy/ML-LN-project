This truly wasn\u2019t long for a sacred beast.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails cried out, \u201cDo you want to deceive him for a lifetime?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing whispered, \u201cIsn\u2019t it good? Deceiving him for a lifetime means he won\u2019t be deceived.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you are really cruel.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails\u2019 voice became fiercer. \u201cYou are letting him live a lie for the rest of his life. HIs life is a tragedy and will be meaningless!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, how could Xie Xi not understand?</p><br/><p>This was truly full of dog blood. The identity was unknown but there must be white moonlight in Houqing\u2019s heart who couldn\u2019t be obtained or died early.</p><br/><p>His little rose looked like this person and Houqing loved him as the white moonlight.</p><br/><p>As Houqing\u2019s brother, Nine Tails naturally saw this with one glance, He felt that his brother was obsessed and was kind enough to come forward. Unfortunately, his younger brother was stubborn.</p><br/><p>The rose family had a life span of two or three hundred years. Houqing saying that he could deceive the little rose for a lifetime was truly gentle and cruel.</p><br/><p>Letting a person be a substitute for someone else and not even knowing after death. Living a life that was a lie really caused people\u2019s scalps to tingle.</p><br/><p>If Xie Xi was really just a small rose flower, he would probably be filled with despair after hearing this.</p><br/><p>How good was Houqing to him, how sweet were the two of them and how desperate would the rose be after hearing such a \u2018truth.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was because Houqing\u2019s goodness was false. All his words were meant for others and this sweetness would only be for 200 years.</p><br/><p>Houqing indulged in his own fantasy, treating Xie Xi as someone else and even planned to lie to him for a lifetime\u2026</p><br/><p>It was really too cruel!</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Xie Xi wasn\u2019t the small rose. He saw Nine Tails\u2019 trick instantly.</p><br/><p>All the things in front of him should be illusion magic, not reality.</p><br/><p>The reason for his doubts was because the low cultivation Xie Xi could see Nine Tails\u2019 illusion but his mind discovered the logic flaws.</p><br/><p>How high was Houqing\u2019s cultivation? What was his cultivation path?</p><br/><p>If Xie Xi could hear the conversation between Houqing and Nine Tails, shouldn\u2019t Houqing feel Xie Xi\u2019s breath? Houqing felt his breath yet still exchanged such words with Nine Tails?</p><br/><p>Lying to Xie Xi for the rest of his life, this was deliberately being spoken to him! The logic was so unreasonable that Xie Xi suspected it was Nine Tails\u2019 illusion.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was possible that Nine Tails hid Xie Xi\u2019s breath so that Houqing didn\u2019t notice he came back. After the next set of primers, Houqing told the \u2018truth.\u2019</p><br/><p>The reason why Xie Xi was more inclined to it being an illusion was because in the last world, the sixth prince was a real angel while the second prince (Nine Tails) was a demonic little master. This contrast meant that Xie Xi naturally believed in the angel!</p><br/><p>Still, no matter what, the little rose who saw this scene would be unable to think.</p><br/><p>He just sweetly sipped the jade bottle and now he heard such a truth. If he could stand still then he must be a strong flower!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t rush inside and had to brew his mood.</p><br/><p>A substitute\u2026 maintaining his calm while revealing subtle sadness and despair. Not daring to speak because speaking would case his heart pain\u2026</p><br/><p>Ah\u2026 it was so hard\u2026</p><br/><p>Director Jiang, you can act yourself!</p><br/><p>By the time Xie Xi entered the room, the conversation between the two of them had turned to different things.</p><br/><p>After seeing him come in, Houqing got up and asked, \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Xie Xi was paled and lowered his eyes. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houwing was upset and held his hand. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t feeling well, we will go back first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook and attempted to pull away before stopping, \u201cYour Excellency\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHrmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi moved his lips and spoke in a low voice. \u201cI want to go home.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice pulled at both their hearts and Nine Tails even felt a pang of regret\u2026</p><br/><p>Houqing frowned. \u201cAre you uncomfortable? I\u2019ll take you back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Xie Xi bit his lower lip and shook his head.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails knew that the home he said was Rose Mountain. This small rose knew the truth and how could he want to go back with Houqing?</p><br/><p>Houqing became aware that something was wrong. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi barely managed to smile. \u201cSure enough\u2026I shouldn\u2019t be greedy.\u201d It seemed that he was talking about his greed in drinking too much.</p><br/><p>NIne Tails understood clearly and regretted it so much that he wanted to turn back the clock, so that everything he did before would disappear, so that Xiao Wei would still be sweet with Houqing. Even if\u2026 even if\u2026</p><br/><p>No, it wasn\u2019t really sweet. After all, Houqing didn\u2019t deserve him.</p><br/><p>Houqing was even more distressed. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault. I shouldn\u2019t have taken out two bottles. Are you very uncomfortable? I\u2019ll take you back to rest.\u201d He got up and told Nine Tails, \u201cBrother, let\u2019s go back first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d No more words were needed. He was afraid that he would rush over and grab at a certain person.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi lost his soul and was listless as he let Houqing hold his hand.</p><br/><p>In general, Xie Xi wasn\u2019t satisfied with this play. She felt that he only acted out 30~40%. However, to deal with a soul, he could only come up with half achievements\u2026</p><br/><p>No matter what the souls imagined, Nine Tails\u2019 plan seemed to work.</p><br/><p>The record in the god\u2019s wisdom was about Nine Tails. Thus, the moment he walked out of the palace to leave with Houqing, he felt a pull, like he popped out of the picture and then entered again.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt a bit stupid. The moment he opened his eyes, he felt a freezing cold. It was too cold and his petals trembled.</p><br/><p>Wait\u2026 what petals? Oh, he had turned back into a rose and would soon be frozen in this world of ice and snow.</p><br/><p>At this moment, he heard Nine Tails shouting anxiously, \u201cLittle Rose, where are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to speak but he was too cold. He couldn\u2019t even maintain his human form, let alone open his mouth.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails\u2019 voice was hoarse. \u201cHe isn\u2019t worthy of your love, he isn\u2019t worth it. If you want to go to him, I will send you back. You will\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, he finally felt the faint breath of the rose flower that was about to disappear. Nine Tails rushed through the depths of the ice and snow and carefully held the white rose in the palm of his hand.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

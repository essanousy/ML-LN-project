In any case, he had the ruby earring and would know the truth sooner or later.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t believe that the national teacher\u2019s confession could bring the relationship between the two people to an irretrievable point.</p><br/><p>Even if the beast king had no love for the national teacher, friendship and affection must be present. He wouldn\u2019t leave everything to hide in a cave just because of a love confession.</p><br/><p>There was also the chest injury and it might be related to this fight.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi slowly remembered the little lion and it was impossible to sleep here the entire time.</p><br/><p>At breakfast, the little lion sat next to Xie Xi because of his estrus privilege.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi relied on him and indulged him.</p><br/><p>Leo\u2019s heart was as sweet as honey and he ate more meat for breakfast.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled at him. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be doing martial arts activities later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stated, \u201cI\u2019ll accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leo was even happier and added, \u201cI\u2019m practicing using the pike today.\u201d He knew that Xie Xi liked to watch this.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really liked it and was looking forward to it. \u201cGood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Their words were quite ordinary but the atmosphere was very sticky The two people were wrapped in the same bubble and other people could only watch with envy, unable to interject.</p><br/><p>The national teacher sat on the other side of the table and had no appetite.</p><br/><p>The person who had been closest to Xie Xi was him. Every time Xie Xi learnt a new move, he would show him first and even teach him.</p><br/><p>Now\u2026</p><br/><p>Houqing suppressed his thoughts but he couldn\u2019t get rid of the bitterness in his heart.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t think any more, he couldn\u2019t make any more mistakes. He had no chances.</p><br/><p>Houqing gripped the knife and fork with great force.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was still very attentive. He considered his actions when talking to the lion and there was no thing intimate.</p><br/><p>He was afraid of poking at the heart of the national teacher. He valued both equally and was afraid of them suffering discomfort.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, his affinity for Jiang Xie went soul deep. No matter how careful, he treated the souls completely differently.</p><br/><p>After breakfast, the national teacher went to work while Xie Xi and the little lion went to the training field.</p><br/><p>The guards were shocked when they saw the little lion.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t normal to be so calm during the estrus period!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t anything. Just like in the dream last night, if the little lion couldn\u2019t extinguish the fire then he would strike!</p><br/><p>Of course, the guards didn\u2019t ask anything, especially since they knew this was the king\u2019s man. They just treated him more carefully than before.</p><br/><p>Leo was young and full of enthusiasm. He was eager to show off in front of his sweetheart.</p><br/><p>He played with the pike, forcing the defender who confronted him to retreat.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi watched with a smile and inexplicably remembered Zhao Zilong of Changshan who dared to walk alone!</p><br/><p>Of course, ZIlong didn\u2019t have the round lion ears and long lion tail.</p><br/><p>They left the training field and the lion went to take a bath. He pulled Xie Xi into the bath and the two people were intimate in the bedroom.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was most afraid of this dog-like sniffing. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t do this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The lion wrapped his tail around Xie Xi\u2019s thin waist. \u201cYou are so fragrant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He always felt that he was a piece of meat and was one step from being eaten by the lion.</p><br/><p>In a way, he really was a \u2018step\u2019 away.</p><br/><p>The two people were tired at noon and ended up sleeping.</p><br/><p>The lion understood how to control himself and didn\u2019t dare hurt Xie Xi. The more restrained he was, the happier he became and his heart was full with love.</p><br/><p>He hugged Xie Xi and whispered, \u201cSir, I really\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to say that he liked this person but then thought of a more beautiful word. \u201cI really love you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s small heart was like a swing blown by the wind. It wanted to rush out and fly away, but it was held back by the ropes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi kissed this person on the lips.</p><br/><p>The lion stared at him with sun-like golden eyes. \u201cAren\u2019t we so good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought, \u2018We have been like this for a long time.\u2019</p><br/><p>Leo spoke again. \u201cLet me stay with you and always love you, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Who would refuse?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had to think of the miserable white-haired man to calm himself down.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked the lion, \u201cWhat\u2019s good about me? I can\u2019t do anything with such a bad body.\u201d</p><br/><p>The simple little lion\u2019s thoughts were immediately shifted. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything. You\u2019re so good, particularly good. I will take care of you in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi found it somewhat funny. \u201cWhat do you like about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, he was quite puzzled about this. He never knew why Jiang Xie liked him.</p><br/><p>The difference between them was very big. One was a top designer and one was a beginner player. How did that guy\u2026 did he fall in love at first sight?</p><br/><p>With Jiang Xie\u2019s experience, what was there that he hadn\u2019t encountered?</p><br/><p>Of course, Xie Xi felt that this question couldn\u2019t be answered by Leo. Leo didn\u2019t have as much life experience.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Leo replied, \u201cI like you because I like you. When I see you, I think of you. I can\u2019t suppress my heart. It is like you are engraved in my soul.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned and spoke in his heart, \u2018Stupid lion.\u2019</p><br/><p>Expressing such thoughts, how could the other person not cherish it?</p><br/><p>Leo stated, \u201cMaybe we knew each other a long time ago and just forgot each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help kissing him. \u201cMaybe that is the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before dinner, the national teacher came to find Xie Xi. \u201cYour Majesty, I have something to tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told the lion, \u201cI\u2019ll see you at dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leo stared at the national teacher but didn\u2019t say anything. This was regarding the affairs of the Tiger Country and as a foreigner, he was naturally unable to listen.</p><br/><p>He replied to Xie Xi, \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\u2019</p><br/><p>Leo left and Xie Xi glanced at the national teacher. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve found the details of Jiang Xie. Please take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had commanded the national teacher to check the little lion.</p><br/><p>This was a precaution. The experience of the little lion\u2019s family was so bad that Xie Xi needed to know more details in order to prevent any troubles.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took the information and looked it over while listening to the national teacher\u2019s brief summary. \u201cHe is from the lion\u2019s royal family. He is the sixth child of the former lion king who died because of a coup.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough, the souls knew how to set themselves up.</p><br/><p>The little lion being part of the Lion Country\u2019s royal family was similar to Xie Xi\u2019s guess.</p><br/><p>He looked carefully and asked, \u201cWho was the former lion king?\u201d</p><br/><p>The national teacher explained, \u201cThe Lion Country always had a war faction and a pace faction. The dead former lion king was part of the war faction. You remember Jiang Yuan, who once sent someone to assassinate you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t remember!</p><br/><p>He replied, \u201cHow could I forget?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter you unified the eight countries, the Lion Country\u2019s royal family stayed dormant and waited for you\u2026\u201d He paused before vaguely saying, \u201cThe eight countries split up and the Lion Country\u2019s royal family regained power. Jiang Yuan was re-elected as king.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded.</p><br/><p>The national teacher continued, \u201cThe Lion Country has always had good relations with the Tiger Country. The leader of the peace faction, Song Wei, fought side by side with you. They might\u2019ve been conquered by the royal family but they saved enough strength and caught Jiang Yuan by surprise when he had forgotten them.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was basically like this.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi unified the eight countries and the leader of the Lion COuntry was Song Wei of the peace faction. The Rose Empire collapsed and the Lion Country\u2019s Jiang Yuan regained power, pushing Song Wei and his faction out of the political arena. How could they be willing to accept this? They launched a coup and Jiang Yuan was killed.</p><br/><p>The role played by Jiang Xie was very innocent. He was just a little lion who was one month old. He wasn\u2019t even clear about the details of his family.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi clearly remembered that the little lion said his father and sister were dead but\u2026</p><br/><p>He was obviously the sixth child. It seemed that one sister often took care of him so he only remembered her.</p><br/><p>The national teacher spoke again, \u201cThe situation of Jiang Xie means that him staying here will cause endless troubles.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words might sound selfless but how could Xie Xi believe it?</p><br/><p>Besides, no matter Leo\u2019s setting, Xie Xi couldn\u2019t leave him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi answered, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, he was too young to remember anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>The national teacher frowned and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWhy do you value him so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Xie Xi answer?</p><br/><p>The truth couldn\u2019t be spoken and it was inevitable that the national teacher would misunderstand.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his mouth. \u201cThe matter of the Lion Country\u2019s royal family really has nothing to do with him. A one month old child wouldn\u2019t know anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said this and the national teacher no longer asked.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gazed at the other person, his heart a bit empty.</p><br/><p>It shouldn\u2019t matter\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt that his nerves were over-stressed.</p><br/><p>After eating, it was time for the medicinal bath.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t taken painkillers recently but his body didn\u2019t hurt. This medicinal bath did work but his injury was too serious and it was difficult to recover quickly.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi deliberately let himself fall asleep in the medicinal bath because he wanted to continue dreaming.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, as long as the national teacher was present then the dreams were related to him.</p><br/><p>This dream was in the tiger king\u2019s palace.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wore a grand outfit as he stood on a high platform and was admired by thousands of people.</p><br/><p>Houqing was kneeling at his right hand, white cloak against the ground and his posture of one knee on the ground as beautiful as a blooming white flower.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi watched them for a moment before raising his hand. \u201cGet up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of people cheered, the waves of sound echoing in the magnificent hall and making people dizzy.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi ascended the throne to be emperor and the Rose Empire was born!</p><br/><p>Regarding the title of emperor, it was handed to him by Houqing. \u201cThe eight countries are led by you. If everyone thinks you don\u2019t have the highest power, many decrees will be difficult to carry out.\u201d</p><br/><p>At first, Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to be called emperor. \u201cAn imperial rule has many drawbacks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing replied, \u201cHowever, this is undoubtedly the fastest way to spread your wishes through the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if I die?\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing whispered, \u201cPerhaps you would\u2019ve already created a complete policy to suppress imperial power.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie XI was persuaded by him.</p><br/><p>Everything that Houqing did perfectly fit with Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to return the world to peace and prosperity and he also wanted. Xie Xi wanted the beastmen to live a prosperous and healthy life and he was the same. Xie Xi\u2019s heart was full of ambition and Houqing put all his energy into implementing the decrees, wanting to make this country better.</p><br/><p>Other people sang the praises of the benevolent beast king, stating that the national teacher was the beast king\u2019s right arm and they were truly wise men.</p><br/><p>Houqing liked to listen to these things and worked harder.</p><br/><p>This lasted until Xie Xi went out on patrol and was almost assassinated by rebels.</p><br/><p>The moment the poison arrow struck Xie Xi\u2019s lower abdomen, Houqing felt the pain of his heart being pierced. At this moment, he recognized his heart.</p><br/><p>Everything he did was only for Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>In his narrow heart, he only had this person.</p><br/><p>The so-called peace and prosperity, the so-called healthy beastmen, the so-called heart full of ambition, all of this was because they were Xie Xi\u2019s wishes.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

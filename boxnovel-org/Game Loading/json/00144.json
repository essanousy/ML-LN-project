Even so, Xie Xi was falling apart and was half-dead.</p><br/><p>The difference in strength was too big. The little aftermath alone quickly turned the fragile rose into a dead flower.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails panicked. He trembled uncontrollably as he held Xie Xi\u2019s hand. \u201cHow are you, 99\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was still able to speak. \u201cIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing\u2019s body shook when he heard these words. The sharp colours of his eyes were amazing, showing his obvious emotional fluctuations.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails\u2019 heart was stabbed. \u201cYou\u2026 aren\u2019t afraid of death. Thanks to the enchantment, he was post-Houqing in Xie Xi\u2019s eyes. How much did Xie Xi love Houqing that he was willing to die without fear?</p><br/><p>Houqing staggered forward in order to say something to Xie Xi. Xie Xi grasped Nine Tails\u2019 clothes, eyes full of wariness. Houqing stood still, his bleakness blending in with the world of ice and snow.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails held Xie Xi and whispered, \u201cit\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>He picked up the little rose and walked towards Houqing. He was staggering past when Houqing stated, \u201c\u2026Give him to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails\u2019 hoarse voice was no better than Houqing. \u201cWhat qualifications do you have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing grabbed Nine Tails\u2019 arm, his hand red with rage as he sounded like a dying lion, \u201cTake him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish, Xie Xi spoke weakly, \u201cAncestor Houqing\u2026 please let us go?\u201d</p><br/><p>The words completely swept away all of Houqing\u2019s strength. He stared at Xie Xi with blood eyes. \u201cLet you\u2026 you told me to let you go\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi closed his eyes in a tired manner. He was still holding onto Nine Tails\u2019 clothes, clinging to him tightly like he was afraid Nine Tails would disappear.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails realized what it meant to self-inflict a wound. He was obviously holding Xie Xi but his identity was replaced. He was post-Houqing and Houqing was him. Well, his identity wasn\u2019t actually replaced.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi only deeply loved Houqing. Nine Tails was the one with nothing. Nine Tails lost his soul as he left with Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Houqing stayed in place, staring after them in a stunned manner as his thin lips moved. \u201cXie Xi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails heard this name and his back stiffened. He absolutely couldn\u2019t hand over the little rose to Houqing. That man\u2019s heart only had the dead flower god!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard it too and froze\u2026</p><br/><p>He guessed that Houqing\u2019s white moonlight might be the flower god but\u2026 well\u2026 wasn\u2019t he the flower god in this setting? He became his own substitute\u2026 he must\u2019ve been infected by Jiang Xie!</p><br/><p>By the time Nine Tails took Xie Xi back to the palace, Xie Xi had passed out. It was a miracle that he could still breathe with such a heavy injury.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know how long he had been sleeping. Once Xie Xi woke up again, he heard the conversation outside.</p><br/><p>The red fox who was Nine Tails\u2019 personal attendant cried out, \u201cYour Excellency, this is absolutely impossible!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>A green fox doctor added, \u201cYou only have two tails remaining. If you tear one of them off on your own\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails opened his mouth. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a real tail. I can restore it later after cultivating.\u201d</p><br/><p>The red fox protested, \u201cYou are a pure-blooded nine-tails, how can\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He seemed to be glared at and the red fox shut up.</p><br/><p>The fox family did have such a practice. Ordinary foxes devoted themselves to cultivation. The higher their cultivation, the more tails they had. However, looking at all of Demon Sea, there was never a fox who had cultivated to nine tails.</p><br/><p>Their Ancestor Nine Tails was unique in the world. He was born with nine tails and didn\u2019t obtain them through cultivation!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t surprised when hearing this.</p><br/><p>Before entering the painting, he knew that Nine Tails had sacrificed his eighth tail to save Xie Xi\u2019s life. Now he knew the original story.</p><br/><p>Another fox said, \u201cIf you cut off the eighth tail, I\u2019m afraid the enchantment\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails\u2019 enchantment would be released if he was seriously injured. Losing his eighth tail, wasn\u2019t this a serious injury? It was having only one breath left!</p><br/><p>Nine Tails replied, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore. He will live and live well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt distressed and helplessly. Fortunately, Jiang Xie never experienced this in reality. Xie Xi wasn\u2019t weak enough for Jiang Xie to give up his life to save Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>He would work harder to understand Jiang Xie and make real connections on the basis of mutual affection.</p><br/><p>The next time Xie Xi woke up, he opened his eyes to see Nine Tails.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails didn\u2019t look strange apart from being slightly pale. His silver eyes were gentle as he softly asked, \u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt that his body was a bit heavy but it shouldn\u2019t be anything serious. \u201cI\u2019m much better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails kissed him on the forehead. \u201cDon\u2019t do this in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. If Lord Houqing died, I will also\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t finish talking and stopped.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails clearly heard it and the blood in his face disappeared without a trace. Xie Xi was startled. He clearly wanted to say Nine Tails but it ended up as Houqing. Nine Tails\u2019 injury was too heavy and he was barely holding onto the enchantment.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails acted like he didn\u2019t hear and changed the topic. \u201cYou are too badly injured and your meridians were almost completely broken. You have basically recovered but the strength of the medicine means your body might reject it. It will take time to merge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails couldn\u2019t stay and reluctantly smiled. \u201cYou rest. Call me if you need anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi avoided mentioning a name again and asked, \u201cYour Excellency, how did you cure me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tail\u2019s body stiffened. \u201cI have many treasures here that managed to cure a small rose.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t say it and Xie Xi couldn\u2019t bear to ask. Xie Xi knew how much Jiang Xie loved saving face.</p><br/><p>From that day onwards, Xie Xi didn\u2019t see Nine Tails when he was awake. Nine Tails hid from him in the daytime and only guarded his side at night.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew he was there but couldn\u2019t open his eyes. He wanted to say words to comfort Nine Tails but didn\u2019t dare open his mouth, afraid his words would make Nine Tails sadder.</p><br/><p>After seven or eight days, Xie Xi suddenly felt a pain in his chest. This was followed by a numbness in his lower body and he lost consciousness.</p><br/><p>He heard someone come in and Nine Tails asked hoarsely, \u201cWhat the hell is going on? Didn\u2019t you say that the rejection period has passed?\u201d</p><br/><p>The green fox replied nervously, \u201cHe is a stranger after all. Your Excellency, your strength is too strong and he can\u2019t adapt so quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there any way for him to adapt?\u201d</p><br/><p>After a series of exchanges, a black fox suggested, \u201cYou should send him back to Rose Mountain. Rose Mountain is his birthplace and the soil elements there are homologous to him. It will definitely help his origin adapt to your strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails was stunned.</p><br/><p>The green fox added, \u201cYour Excellency, you absolutely can\u2019t go to Rose Mountain. Your current body\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Xie Xi was basically clear about what happened.</p><br/><p>The white rose and Houqing fell in love. The rose found out that he was a substitute and fled Houqing before Nine Tails found him in the ice and snow.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails used the enchantment on him to let him forget Houqing and the white rose fell in love with him.</p><br/><p>Later, this was discovered by Houqing and the two men had a big fight. In order to save Nine Tails, the white rose almost died.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails sacrificed his eighth tail to save the white rose, becoming extremely weak. However, the strength of the holy beast was too strong and the body of the white rose couldn\u2019t stand it. There was a rejection and Nine Tails had to send him back to Rose Mountain.</p><br/><p>There was probably no rejection after returning to Rose Mountain but Nine Tails couldn\u2019t stay by his side.</p><br/><p>The gradual decline of the Enchantment led to the white rose remembering Houqing. He left Rose Mountain to attend the Hundred Flowers event, suffering from the rejection of Nine Tails\u2019 strength again, was seriously injured and then rescued by Azure Dragon\u2026</p><br/><p>In order to save him, Azure Dragon used a medicine and the side effect gave him amnesia. Thus, the white rose forgot the past and went to the Holy Mountain.</p><br/><p>This script\u2026 there were no problems. Xie Xi felt that the souls didn\u2019t have it easy. They also had to work hard to rationalize Xie Xi\u2019s slag behaviour.</p><br/><p>What should Xie Xi do now? Just leave the god\u2019s wisdom? At this time, a prompt appeared in Xie Xi\u2019s lower right corner.</p><br/><p>[The first puppet is completed and is ready to be used.]</p><br/>\n</div>"}

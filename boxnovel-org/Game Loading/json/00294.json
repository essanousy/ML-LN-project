He wondered, \u201cOld Jiang is outside? Why doesn\u2019t he come in? Is he on guard duty? Is this being self-conscious?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had to say that brothers who shared pants were confidants and knew each other well.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe spat out, \u201cYou have done tens of thousands of missions with him? When has he ever let you be the sentry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi stood up. \u201cIs he looking for the boss, Fuck, the black wings are mind. I really want to cut them off and fix them on me. Really cool!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi reflected for a while before understanding which pair of black wings.</p><br/><p>Was it Capricorn\u2019s black wings?</p><br/><p>\u2026They were very handsome\u2026 but\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked them, \u201cHow were you locked up in here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi explained, \u201cOur mission is to kill the fallen six star signs. Old N did a scan and found that this is the destination.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Yan Zhe continued, \u201cWe were ready to come in when we encountered a winged person with huge black wings. He seemed to be able to manipulate the castle and used the technique to split us up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi exclaimed, \u201cI was only deliberately caught in order to protect Ah Zhe!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Rui said, \u201cYour third leg was broken and you didn\u2019t dare to leave Ah Zhe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi scolded him, \u201cIt is better than you, single-handed waste!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Rui wasn\u2019t angry. He just turned over and continued to do nothing.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe added, \u201cGeneral Qin and Zong Xia escaped. Old N has many patterns and it is said that he injured one of the lichs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t happy. It turned out that Scorpio was hit by N.</p><br/><p>Nan Yi opened his mouth. \u201cThe six fallen star signs are very powerful. Old Qin and Zong Xia are being pursued very badly.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were a team and could communicate with each other.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cWhat are the races of the two star signs chasing General Qin and Mr Zong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi answered, \u201cOld Qin\u2019s side seemed to be a dark elf. He is very abnormal and has the elf\u2019s powerful magic ability and exaggerated agility. If Old Qin didn\u2019t have thick skin, he would be dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe added, \u201cZong Xia\u2019s opponent is every stranger. I heard that he is a long extinct sea demon and uses illusions after illusions. If Zong Xia wasn\u2019t promoted to a god viewer, he would\u2019ve long been caught and brought back.</p><br/><p>A god viewer was also a sacred occupation in Central. It wasn\u2019t as rare as a godly healer but it was still rare.</p><br/><p>A dark elf and a sea demon\u2026</p><br/><p>In the end, which one was Aquarius and which one was Pisces?</p><br/><p>Based on the name, Pisces was more like the sea demon? However, Aquarius also had an association with water and might be a water species.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t in a hurry since he knew the basic situation of the last two Jiang Xies.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe asked Xie Xi, \u201cWhat is going on here? Have you also sneaked into this castle?</p><br/><p>Nan Yu cried out, \u201cI heard there is an evil god living in the castle and his power is about the six fallen star signs. He is an all-rounder and Old Jiang isn\u2019t a match for him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The truth was that he was the legendary evil god.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe asked again, \u201cWhat is the situation outside? Are you injured and need my healing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi confessed. \u201cIn fact\u2026 I\u2019m the master here.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words dropped and the gods in the dungeon were stunned. They understood each word but they looked like they didn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi faced the three people and could only continue to rip off the bandage. \u201cI am the evil god you mentioned. As for Jiang Xie,\u201d he glanced at Nan Yi and continued. \u201cHe is the one who caught you.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was nothing wrong with this. Jiang Xie was the six star signs. Not only was he the people who caught them, but he was also the ones still chasing\u2026</p><br/><p>The three people were shocked for a long time before Nan Yi swore, \u201cThat old animal. He tricked me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe frowned. \u201cThe winged person is Jiang Xie?\u201d Why did he feel strange?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hastily explained, \u201cHe is integrated into the soul and has no memory of Central.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi wondered, \u201cHe has full-level mental strength yet he lost his memory?\u201d</p><br/><p>Losing memories was very common when entering quasi-worlds. Thus, Central had a special ability to enhance mental strength. Generally, the mental pollution of the quasi-world would be isolated.</p><br/><p>Mental power was a talent that senior players could open and was extremely difficult to repair. Gold coins and mission points were needed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew some of this so he understood why Nan Yi was so surprised.</p><br/><p>He explained, \u201cThere isn\u2019t much relationship with the mind. The soul itself is him. Integration with the soul doesn\u2019t mean his mind is polluted because the soul belongs to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>This explanation was well understood.</p><br/><p>Mental power was to prevent interference in a small world but if it was their own soul, how could it interfere?</p><br/><p>Nan Yi also understood and became more comfortable. It wasn\u2019t because he was pitted by Jiang Xie\u2014he was used to being pitted\u2014but because he lost nothing.</p><br/><p>After all, this was Old Jiang. Losing to a person he never won against was nothing to be depressed about!</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe was still frowning. \u201cOur mission is to kill the six fallen star signs. This seems to include Jiang Xie?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi whispered, \u201cIt isn\u2019t including\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe sighed with relief. \u201cThen the winged person isn\u2019t one of the six star signs?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi rushed forward. \u201cThen it\u2019s easy. Let Old Jiang go kill the six of them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi completely told the truth. \u201cThe winged person is Capricorn and he is one of the six star signs. My previous words mean that it isn\u2019t just including. All the targets you want to kill are Jiang Xie.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three people, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Rui, who was too lazy to speak, couldn\u2019t help blinking. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe six fallen star signs are all Jiang Xie\u2019s souls.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe, Nan Yi and Gong Rui, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe muttered, \u201cThey are all Jiang Xie?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi also said, \u201cNo wonder why Old Qin and Zong Xia are being chased so badly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Rui analyzed the true matter. \u201cThen the erasure task is to kill Jiang Xie\u2019s souls?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know much. I might\u2019ve come in later than you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was because he came in when the erasure mission was released. Central time and the quasi-world time was relatively static and was equivalent to when God Yan received the task and entered the world.</p><br/><p>At the time, they hadn\u2019t thought too much. Old Jiang was enough to make them lost quickly. It would be six times faster with six Old Jiangs. The thought made their scalps numb.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe asked again, \u201cWhat is the progress of repairing the quasi-world? Do you need us to help?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought, \u2018My progress is like Schrodinger\u2019s cat. One minute it is 100% and the next minute it is 0%. If I don\u2019t open the lid then I won\u2019t know the result.\u2019</p><br/><p>Nan Yi also asked, \u201cYou are the evil god. Is your mission to conquer the mainland? I can do this! Let me go out and I\u2019ll help you handle the winged species!\u201d He never forgot the big wings. Although the wings of the winged species were white but hair dye was invented for a reason. He could artificially dye the wings black and also become a cool tyrant!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled reluctantly. \u201cIt isn\u2019t conquering the mainland\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe reassured him. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. No matter the task, we will help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, Litel Rose had less experience. They hadn\u2019t experienced anything positive but after swimming through a river of knives, what hadn\u2019t they seen?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi received Yan Zhe\u2019s heart but unfortunately, the task was only for him. The others could only watch the fun.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi confessed, \u201cBased on my previous experience, as long as the souls are appeased, I can take them away from this quasi-world and the repair is successful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe wondered, \u201cIt is so simple?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi asked, \u201cHow do you appease him? Is it to make him happy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cAlmost\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The lazy Gong Rui was a sharp player. He coldly spoke, \u201cIs it necessary for you to fall in love with him so he can be happy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi exclaimed, \u201cThat\u2019s better. The two of you already\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe found the main point. \u201cThere are six Jiang Xies\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at Yan Zhe, his eyes showing hardship.</p><br/><p>Nan Yi also reacted. \u201cFuck! Six Old Jiang\u2019s must fall in love with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Rui finally sat up straight, his entire body filled with energy. \u201cWhat are we waiting for? Hurry up and\u2026 do the repair task.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi and Yan Zhe stared at their teammate with amazement.</p><br/><p>If the lazy god Gong Rui could be so diligent then the Central Government was afraid that a major disaster was imminent.</p><br/><p>Just then, Capricorn\u2019s low voice was heard from outside. \u201cMaster, Aquarius and Pisces have returned.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this voice say master and then thinking that it was Old Jiang, the three people in the prison suddenly felt strange, as if they were hearing a strange play.</p><br/><p>Nan Yi couldn\u2019t help glancing at Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was normally only ashamed at \u2018home\u2019 and now it was thrown in front of a friend. Um\u2026</p><br/><p>Go back and commit domestic violence!</p><br/><p>His heart was embarrassed but his face had long been used to it. He still acted like the evil god.</p><br/><p>He removed the sound barrier and asked, \u201cHave they caught the people?\u201d</p><br/><p>Capricorn replied, \u201cFortunately, you weren\u2019t insulted.\u201d</p><br/><p>In this way, Old Qin and Zong Xia were also captured.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was afraid that Jiang Xie would accidentally put his friends to death and immediately ordered, Bring them over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Capricorn bowed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told Yan Zhe, \u201cI have to temporarily wrong you and have you stay here. I will find a way to steady them and then use a reasonable excuse to release you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Rui said, \u201cIf we become your believers then it will give you an excuse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi added, \u201cyes, we are five people. One person can watch each Jiang Xie\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cI will look for a chance to try it.\u201d</p><br/><p>It would indeed be easier with helpers but\u2026</p><br/><p>He thought of Jiang Xie. Xie Xi, who hadn\u2019t yet begun to lose his face, felt a bit hot.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi lowered the enchantment on the dungeon and saw the last two Jiang Xies.</p><br/><p>The first one to appear was the dark elf. He was dressed well with long black hair tied behind his head. His ears were pointed and an ink-coloured earring hung from his left ear like a flower.</p><br/><p>He was tall and handsome, bronze eyes staring at people with a deep suffocation.</p><br/><p>Then from the darkness emerged the only surviving sea demon.</p><br/><p>His slightly dark blue hair hung to the ground, like the deep and cold sea bottom, making his skin whiter.</p><br/><p>Once the blue eyes fell on Xie Xi, they filled with a demonic charm.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

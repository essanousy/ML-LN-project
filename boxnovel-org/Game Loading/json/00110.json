After more than 10 hours of exploration from previous groups, some roads were found and they cleared to at least the third corner.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t care about anybody else and walked forward with Zhu Li\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>The roads had been explored but the hardships could be seen.</p><br/><p>The roads in the labyrinth weren\u2019t narrow. It could accommodate four or five people walking next to each other. It was just that the walls were high, as if connected to the sky. It gave a huge sense of oppression and compressed the world.</p><br/><p>Many of the people who entered for the first time looked around with vigilance and surprise.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was also seriously scrutinizing the walls. There were clear traces of fighting and zombie corpses everywhere. It was probably Zhuang Yi\u2019s credit that these zombie corpses weren\u2019t complete and now only had a head and body.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie could turn them all into roses but this would affect Xie Xi\u2019s judgment.</p><br/><p>He might not be able to bear it but he couldn\u2019t block the child\u2019s sunny growth.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him softly, \u201cThe first corner seems to be a zombie blockade.\u201d Based on the number of bodies, it could be seen that they were basically concentrated in this place.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie nodded.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi and Jiang Xie had slept together, cultivating a high level of understanding. For example, as a student, Xie Xi liked to discuss his thoughts with Teacher Jiang.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter the first corner, Zhang Ruizhen suffered a chase from behind only to touch the wall at the second corner.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t the real wall. The second corner had a trap which was a moving iron thorns wall. In this enclosed space, the rapidly advancing wall made people hide.</p><br/><p>Cao Yan interjected, \u201cThat trash Zhang Ruizhen, he unexpectedly used his group members to block the wall!\u201d</p><br/><p>The second corner was very disgusting. As long as they made it through the first corner, there would be a large number of zombies attacking from behind while in front was a wall with iron thorns. This made it very hard to understand the situation.</p><br/><p>Zhang Ruizhen probably accidentally found that manpower could slow down the speed of the iron thorns wall. Thus, he deliberately placed people in front to slow it down and used this opportunity to handle the zombies behind. After cleaning up the zombies, he used the flesh and blood on the wall to find the mechanism to turn it off.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he used the zombies to slow down the advancement of the iron wall?\u201d</p><br/><p>This is the real way to break the game, seemingly back and forth, in fact, as long as they fought and retreated, they could use the zombies to block the wall. This was killing two birds with one stone. They could clean up both the zombies and slow down the wall, thus finding the mechanism and opening the exit.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s lips curved. \u201cYou are really clever.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi refused to fall for this and asked, \u201cDoes Teacher have other methods?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Jiang Xie pondered for a moment before sighing. \u201cThere is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was quite curious. \u201cPlease tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke seriously but he couldn\u2019t help thinking in his heart, \u2018You are still flirty!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can pass as long as you break the iron wall.\u201d Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help muttering. \u201cBrute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s face showed no shame. \u201cI have strength while you have the brains. This is called a perfect pair.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was speechless since Jiang Xie was saying that he had no brains! Although he really didn\u2019t have brains this time\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie continued, \u201cIn fact, I always used this method to make it through labyrinths.\u201d</p><br/><p>The four half zombies looked at the wall beside them with frightened faces and wondered, \u201cThis can be punched through?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cShall I show you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The quartet immediately made adoring faces. \u201cBigshot, please!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie rolled up his sleeves\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at the five people silently. One loved demonstrating and four loved watching.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie rolled down his sleeves. \u201cYour boss won\u2019t let me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The stupidest Zhu Li spoke excitedly, \u201cBoss, please approve it. We want to see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d What did it have to do with him?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke helpless, \u201cI am a henpecked man. He is frowning and I don\u2019t dare move.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled and blushed. That\u2026 Jiang Xie often said this in bed in the dream. Say yes and he would do it\u2026 H-He dared to stop moving!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s voice was angry, \u201cYou aren\u2019t going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie gave a salute. \u201cGo!\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned towards the group of four and indicated, \u2018There is no way, I am like this. My wife is the sky.\u2019</p><br/><p>The group of four, \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Apart from the incomprehensible Old Zhu, the other three empathized with each other.</p><br/><p>The wall didn\u2019t break but their stomachs were almost broken by the dog food. They reached the third corner and encountered a multiple choice question.</p><br/><p>This corner looked safe with only two towering doors. One door looked cold and had a curved moon on it while the other door looked like red-hot iron with a round sun on it.</p><br/><p>Cao Yan wondered, \u201cA moon door and sun door?\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned towards Xie Xi. \u201cBoss, which door are you going through?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at the two doors and his heart already had an idea. His main task was related to the sun and he would surely walk through the sun door. This didn\u2019t mean that the sun door was the right path.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told them, \u201cI\u2019m going to the sun door\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished when Zhu Li said, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll go to the sun door.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finished his words. \u2018It is because my task is related to the sun door. However, this door isn\u2019t necessarily correct. You should think clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Most of their main tasks were to explore the labyrinth or to kill Xifu. None of them had a task to appreciate the newborn sun like Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will follow Boss,\u201d Cao Yan replied as the representative of the group of four.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told them, \u201cIt could be a waste of effort.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe would already be dead if it wasn\u2019t for Boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Yi said, \u201cIf it is dangerous, we can find a way to help.\u201d</p><br/><p>The words made Xie Xi\u2019s heart feel warm.</p><br/><p>The four of them weren\u2019t weak. With their zombie arms and legs, they weren\u2019t much worse than Jiang Xie when combined together.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi might be able to casually change limbs but the prerequisite was that there were limbs to change with. This sun door gave off the feeling of fire. Would there really be zombie limbs?</p><br/><p>It was hard to say. Nevertheless, they didn\u2019t hesitate to follow Xie Xi because they wanted to help with Xie Xi\u2019s task.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke up. \u201cGoing together isn\u2019t wrong.\u201d In this multiple choice question, it wasn\u2019t wrong to follow the emperor of luck.</p><br/><p>For example, if Yan Zhe encountered this situation, he would always ask for Old Jiang\u2019s opinion.</p><br/><p>If Old Jiang picked the sun door, they would go straight to the moon door!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie recognized Xie Xi\u2019s good luck but the quartet didn\u2019t know about it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at him. \u2018Such luck\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s lips curved. \u2018You are a person with God\u2019s favour.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi blinked.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned close to him and whispered, \u201cMy luck is probably that of a man abandoned by God. We are really the perfect\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was mentioning the same thing again! He could never be serious!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glared at him. \u201cWait for this world to be over\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at the blood red -365 and calmed down, but he still stubbornly said, \u201cOnce we leave the world, we will naturally\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi raised his eyebrows.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie guiltily changed his words, \u201cIt might not be a natural pair but we are still a pair!\u201d</p><br/><p>If they weren\u2019t a pair, he was going to pull Xie Xi to be a pair!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

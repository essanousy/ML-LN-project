Jiang Xie kissed him and he actually became a human?</p><br/><p>What was this fairytale setting? It wasn\u2019t right. Previously, Jiang Xie had kissed him and he hadn\u2019t become a person. Was it because it was the middle of the night? Or perhaps\u2026</p><br/><p>A name! Today, Jiang Xie finally decided to give him a name and wanted to be with him. Was this the point?</p><br/><p>There was a name and they kissed. Thus, he turned into a human? Maybe it also needed to be at night?</p><br/><p>Compared to Xie Xi calmly analyzing the situation, Jiang Xie was stunned stupid.</p><br/><p>Through the bright moonlight, he could clearly see the young boy in his arms.</p><br/><p>The boy had skin that was whiter and smoother than jade. His face was beautiful and his eyes were as bright as the night sky. The thing that made Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t think was that this boy was attached to his chest. He could feel the outline of the youth\u2019s body through his thin t-shirt. In addition, Jiang Xie\u2019s hand was on his waist and he was holding this person in his arms.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie realized his terrible position and removed his hands. Xie Xi\u2019s senses returned and he gazed up at Jiang Xie. A slightly calmer Jiang Xie saw the cat ears between the black hair\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart thumped.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle\u2026 Rose?\u201d Jiang Xies\u2019 voice was hoarse.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s ears moved. \u201cYes.\u201d Hey, he could finally speak.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was unable to stay on this bed. He got up and covered Xie Xi with the quilt. \u201cYou..\u201d He didn\u2019t know what to ask. It was like a dream. The kitten he adopted became a human in his arms\u2026</p><br/><p>In fact, Xie Xi didn\u2019t know how to explain it. After all, he didn\u2019t know himself what this quasi-world was like.</p><br/><p>He thought about it and decided not to scare Jiang Xie. This youth was too superstitious. What if he drove Xie Xi away as a demon? In order to make fewer mistakes, he would continue to pretend to be a cat.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was a cat for a week and was already familiar with how to act. He yawned and lay down under the blanket to continue sleeping.</p><br/><p>This trick really worked. Jiang Xie saw him like this and let go of his worries. This might be a person but it was truly Little Rose.</p><br/><p>How could a kitten become a human being? This little fellow didn\u2019t know it himself. Seeing him like this, it was obvious this person still didn\u2019t know his own changes.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie calmed down and finally knew what he should do\u2014find clothes for Little Rose.</p><br/><p>Never mind how the cat became a human, he couldn\u2019t dress too lightly or he would catch a cold. Yes, Little Rose would catch a cold without clothes.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie searched through his clothes for a while to find the right ones. He had worn them but they were washed clean and it shouldn\u2019t matter. Jiang Xie came back with the clothes and Xie Xi was still pretending to sleep.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s warm voice called out to him. \u201cLittle Rose.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s ears moved and he sat up. The blanket slipped and Jiang Xie didn\u2019t know where to look. Xie Xi muffled a smile and had to pretend not to know anything.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie cleared his throat and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to you but you have to dress in this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie put down the clothes. \u201cWear my clothes first, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at it for a moment before his eyes curved. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi lay back down to sleep, obviously very unhappy about being woken up.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie gazed at the smooth back and his Adam\u2019s apple moved before he whispered, \u201cYou will catch a cold if you don\u2019t wear clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned to look at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t wear it before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour body is different from before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi bowed his head and pretended to be surprised.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart was soft. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, this is nothing. Just put on clothes.\u201d It was best to hide the cat ears as well.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at the other person and wondered, \u201cWhat happened to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie also wanted to know what was going on but if both people were confused, it would make the other party uneasy.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie reassured him, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. You just changed your appearance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s controlled his heart and he no longer teased this person. He obediently put on the clothes.</p><br/><p>After wearing it, Xie Xi remembered that he shouldn\u2019t know how to put the clothes on as a cat.</p><br/><p>Still, if he let Jiang Xie help then he was afraid this young man would steam himself.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wore the t-shirt and he found a problem at the same time as Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi not only had cat ears, but he also had a cat tail. The ears were fine but how could he wear pants with the tail?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This teenager who wanted to be a rogue, did he expect Xie Xi to not wear pants? Jiang Xie\u2019s head was buzzing and his ears were red.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could only ask him, \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will help you modify it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie went to find scissors and cut a hole in the pants. Xie Xi looked at the airy pants and dressed cautiously.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare to tease Jiang Xie because he was afraid of being teased when he returned to Central.</p><br/><p>The young boy in front of him was a simple child who couldn\u2019t do anything. If this was changed to Old Jiang of Central\u2026</p><br/><p>Stop, Xie Xi was too afraid to think about it!</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help thinking about it. Jiang Xie might be only 17 or 18 years old but he was very tall, at least 1.85 metres. Xie Xi was only 1.7 metres and Jiang Xie\u2019s clothes were loose on him. In addition, there were the cat ears and tail.</p><br/><p>It was foreseeable that the teenager wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep tonight! Xie Xi didn\u2019t want this but since this was the situation, he couldn\u2019t control it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie seemed to be trying to ease the awkward atmosphere and desperately searched for a topic. \u201cYou are a boy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking of which, what was Jiang Xie\u2019s sexual orientation? Jiang Xie was stunned before opening his mouth. \u201cI like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d The atmosphere was once again awkward.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie realized his words were ambiguous and changed them. \u201cI mean, I like you no matter what you look like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d This was more like a confession.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wanted to dig a three metres large hole and bury himself. \u201cI\u2026 um, you sleep here. I\u2019ll go outside to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suggested, \u201cLet\u2019s sleep here together.\u201d Outside was a small sofa. How could such a tall man squeeze onto it?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie worked hard to find a reason. \u201cThe bed is small and can\u2019t fit both of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cIs it okay if I change back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was surprised and stared at him. \u201cCan you change back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also didn\u2019t know but he could try. \u201cYou kissed me and I became like this. Perhaps I will change back if you kiss me again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi honestly wasn\u2019t thinking much when he said this.</p><br/><p>He was objectively considering the sleeping problem. Jiang Xie was too poor and only had one bed. Jiang Xie might not need to go to school on weekends but this was the age when he was growing. It was bad to stay up all night.</p><br/><p>It would be much more convenient if Xie Xi could change forms at will. Jiang Xie\u2019s mind was full of: kiss me\u2026 kiss me\u2026 kiss me\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, who hadn\u2019t thought much, was taken askew. Jiang Xie\u2019s voice was tense. \u201cIt is because of a kiss?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suggested, \u201cShall we\u2026 try it?\u201d He had already done everything. Why was he embarrassed now?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie unexpectedly agreed. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was surprised but took the initiative to go up and kiss the young man. The moment their lips touched, a fire seemed to burn in Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes. Xie Xi\u2019s heart was hot and it felt like countless kisses touched him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s brain buzzed and by the time his senses returned, he was holding this person in his arms and kissing the other person hotly and eagerly.</p><br/><p>By the time the two of them separated, they were both panting. Xie Xi desperately reminded himself: underage, underage, underage.</p><br/><p>He finally suppressed his fire and said, \u201cIt didn\u2019t work. I\u2019m not changing back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie felt that he was going crazy. He unexpectedly\u2026 did such a thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep outside!\u201d Jiang Xie turned and walked away. Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare stop the youth since he was afraid of committing a crime.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that both of them slept unsteadily this night.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie opened his eyes to a bright sky. He felt as if he had been dreaming. How could Little Rose become a person? How could he kiss Little Rose?</p><br/><p>His heart filled with indescribable emotions when he thought of the kiss.</p><br/><p>It felt like he had found something that had been missing for a long time, as if he waited countless days and his cursed life was for this moment.</p><br/><p>Both of them fell asleep at dawn and ended up oversleeping. They were both a bit stunned when the doorbell rang and Kang Hong\u2019s voice was heard.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong called out, \u201cJiang Xie, aren\u2019t you taking the cat for a check up? Why aren\u2019t you awake yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him not to help but Kang Hong still wanted to go together. The kitten had never been to the hospital. What if he was afraid?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

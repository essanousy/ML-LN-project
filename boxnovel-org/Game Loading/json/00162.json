If Xie Xi wasn\u2019t promoted, he wouldn\u2019t be able to go to the new world within 20 hours and then he would be crushed by the Central Government.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn theory, there are only four general occupations in the Central Government but there are some specific occupations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pulled his thoughts back and listened to the serious lecture of Professor Jiang.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie continued, \u201cSpecific occupations have harsh trigger conditions. It is based on the timing of the situation as well as your personal strength and thoughts. The probability is about one in a billion.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t easy for Xie Xi to trigger the Repairer\u2019s occupation. First, he had to enter the open world, trigger the guidance tasks and choose the right answers among countless multiple choice questions. If he chose to kill the half zombie and the big fool then he wouldn\u2019t have received Beginner Repair and the events in the future wouldn\u2019t have happened.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pondered on it. \u201cOne in a billion?\u201d He didn\u2019t seem to feel it because everything was logical.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cIt is 100% for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it didn\u2019t happen then it was one in a billion. If it happened then it was 100%. This was true.</p><br/><p>Luck had nothing to do with this. Xie Xi asked him, \u201cAre there any other specific occupations?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is one close to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cAren\u2019t you a designer?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie coughed. \u201cI\u2019m not worthy of that one in a billion chance. I am talking about Yan Zhe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was curious. \u201cGod Yan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, his occupation is a divine healer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t surprised at all. Such a powerful healing skill was justified if he had a specific occupation.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie continued, \u201cYunge\u2019s N also has a specific occupation. He is sneaky and didn\u2019t publicize it but I guess he has some type of buff occupation.\u201d That\u2019s why he worked hard to build such a large organization.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded and asked, \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was a showman. \u201cWhat else? Please respect the one in a billion chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was surprised. \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMost specific occupations have a prominent specialty and it is difficult for them to not be famous. Thus\u2026 that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d There were three people in all of Central. The probability was truly low.</p><br/><p>Unlucky Chief Jiang couldn\u2019t help putting gold on his face. \u201cI have good luck. I knew two out of three people with specific occupations.\u201d</p><br/><p>This words would cause anyone listening to feel sour.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi coaxed him. \u201cYou don\u2019t need any luck. You are the greatest designer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wouldn\u2019t be saddened by this type of thing but he felt Xie Xi\u2019s heart and couldn\u2019t help pretending to be pitiful. \u201cYes, I\u2019m just a designer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are better than everyone else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I better than God Yan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This guy was still petty! He still remembered Xie Xi praising Yan Zhe!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie hugged the other person and kissed his neck. \u201cI have to leave a way for others. I had so much bad luck in my life and now I will be taken care of by the goddess of luck. How can other people live?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pushed this big dog away with a blank face. \u201cThe goddess of luck definitely won\u2019t like a man as arrogant as you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRegardless of the goddess, you like me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie lowered his gaze to Xie Xi. \u201cHow is it? You don\u2019t like me?\u201d He deliberately lowered his voice like a rascal.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t like it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie let out an \u2018oh\u2019 before slowly saying, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like me, is it love?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was really putting gold on his face! Xie Xi was blushing but he couldn\u2019t say that he didn\u2019t love this person. It might be a joke but he didn\u2019t want to say it because he really loved Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart was sweet. How could there be such a cute baby under the sun?</p><br/><p>In addition, this big baby was his.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie felt that he could continue to be unlucky in his next life as long as he met Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi used a lot of effort to return the topic to the main point. \u201cWhat exactly is a Repairer?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cMaybe you can repair my broken worlds.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also thought it should be like this. After all, the new world required an occupation change and he had the new occupation of a Repairer.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie mentioned that he forcibly pulled away the souls, causing the quasi-worlds to collapse. Could Xie X go in and repair them?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stated, \u201cIt should be like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s demeanour was significantly more relaxed than before. \u201cI break it down and you fix it. We are really a couple.\u201d</p><br/><p>These were his usual words of love and there seemed to be nothing wrong. However, Xie Xi was too keen. In particular, he would be cheated to death if he wasn\u2019t sharp when it came to matters regarding Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi held the other person\u2019s hand and stared at him. \u201cThe quasi-worlds collapsing really has no effect on you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was tricked by him before. Indeed, the souls returning to Jiang Xie was a good thing but what about the souls that didn\u2019t come back?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pressed him. \u201c\u2026Does this mean the souls trapped in the collapsed worlds won\u2019t come back!\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought it through and started sweating.</p><br/><p>For example, if Jiang Xie entered Love to the Left or Right then he would take away Randy, Aix-en and Gars when leaving. The three of them were involved in Lost Atlantis and Atlantis would become a broken world.</p><br/><p>It was true that the eldest, second and third children had returned but what about the fourth, fifth and sixth princes of Atlantis? What should they do? Would they be stuck in the collapsed world?</p><br/><p>As long as he was missing a soul, Jiang Xie would always be in an unstable state. No one could say what would happen in the end!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled at him. \u201cWell, you can fix it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if I didn\u2019t get the Repairer occupation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t the collapsed worlds be abandoned and the souls forever trapped?</p><br/><p>It was impossible for Jiang Xie to not realize this but he didn\u2019t mention anything. He also deliberately misled Xie Xi so that Xie Xi didn\u2019t think too much.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finally understood why Jiang Xie reacted so strongly when hearing about the Repairer occupation.</p><br/><p>He thought that Jiang Xie was too surprised by his luck but he was actually feeling thankful!</p><br/><p>The quasi-worlds were broken and the souls were trapped, but he was forced to pretend to be fine\u2026</p><br/><p>Then he learnt about the Repairer occupation and kissed Xie Xi out of excitement.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was really angry and pained. He wanted to kill his person but also couldn\u2019t bear to scold him. \u201cYou are looking down on me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was anxious. \u201cHow can I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am younger than you, weaker than you and have less experience than you. Is that why you\u2019re looking down on me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was really panicked and scrambled to explain, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that. I just\u2026\u201d He paused before finally saying, \u201cI\u2019m just not used to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was used to solving all problems by himself. He was used to bearing things alone because he had come all this way alone.</p><br/><p>For many things, there were no benefits when talking about them. Apart from causing worry, morale to plummet and doubling the danger, there was no other meaning.</p><br/><p>Thus, he didn\u2019t say it out of habit.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shocked by the words.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, this prideful guy, saying these words was equivalent to exposing himself in front of Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart ached and he took Jiang Xie\u2019s hand. \u201cYou have to get used to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie interlocked their fingers.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI will always be with you in the future. You won\u2019t be alone again so please believe in me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart was hit by a huge wave and the light in his eyes was amazing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was embarrassed by saying so much and wanted to pull his hand back.</p><br/><p>Then Jiang Xie held him tightly. \u201cSay it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s hoarse voice seemed to be suppressing some shaking. \u201cSay it again, please?\u201d Only one word was added but it seemed to bring out some pleading.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was affected and whispered, \u201cI will always be with you in the future. You won\u2019t be alone again so please believe in me\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie kissed him, pouring out his passionate emotions through the hot kiss.</p><br/><p>There were words echoing in his mind. He didn\u2019t know who said it but it was engraved in his mind like a mark.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t be afraid to be lonely. Wait and you will eventually find the best person.\u2019</p><br/><p>Some people\u2019s tenderness only lasted for three seconds. In particular, Jiang Xie saw Xie Xi\u2019s red eyes and couldn\u2019t help wanting to amuse this person to make him happy.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie opened his mouth. \u201cI have something to tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d He was ready to listen because he thought it was a big deal\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie flicked his fingers and a water curtain appeared in the air.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at it with a very serious expression. He was focused and attached great importance to the first secret Professor Jiang would share.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie opened the friends bar. Among the few friends, Xie Xi\u2019s name was particularly eye-catching.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw the number behind his name and was stunned. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie calmly explained, \u201cOne of my trash skills allows me to see the goodwill of beginner players.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi who didn\u2019t react at first. After his reaction, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at the green 999 and there was no need to mention how happy he was. \u201c999 is the highest value and it is impossible for it to go higher.\u201d</p><br/><p>He just finished speaking when he saw the 999 become 998, 997, 996, 995\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEh!\u201d Jiang Xie cried out. \u201cDon\u2019t fall, don\u2019t fall anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone was like a poor stockholder who saw the stocks plummet.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him blankly. \u201cThen you have always seen my feelings towards you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie honestly admitted it. \u201cYes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s lips curved downwards. \u201cHow much was the initial number?\u201d</p><br/><p>0 points? 0 was the limit and it was impossible to go lower. He didn\u2019t expect that\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie truthfully confessed. \u201cIt was initially -99.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shocked. \u201cIt can be a negative number?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. The lowest number recorded was -777 and now it has risen to 999, oh, 988. It is really as beautiful as a dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke softly, \u201cBaby, don\u2019t be angry. Once you are promoted to an intermediate player, I won\u2019t be able to see your goodwill anymore. Isn\u2019t it good to let it stay at the most beautiful 999?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi laughed. \u201c-999 is also beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was shocked.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very surprised by this goodwill skill but his heart was warm.</p><br/><p>Thanks to Love to the Left or Right, Xie Xi hated X to death. At that time, Jiang Xie saw the -99 goodwill yet he still showed so much care and favour towards Xie Xi\u2026</p><br/><p>This fool!</p><br/><p>He was soft-hearted and the goodwill immediately jumped to 999. It was like Jiang Xie read his mind as Jiang Xie whispered, \u201cAt that time, you were so interesting. You clearly hated you but you smiled and called me God X. So cute\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had no expression and wanted to add a negative sign to this goodwill!</p><br/><p>Changing to a Repairer had a level requirement. Xie Xi must first be promoted to an intermediate player.</p><br/><p>Beginner players needed full experience to be promoted and they also needed to do a promotion test.</p><br/><p>This test was released by the Central Government and the time between tests was relatively static. They could give it up and if they didn\u2019t pass, they just needed to consume a few gold coins and they could try again next time.</p><br/><p>However, every player wanted to be promoted the first time once their experience was full. It was because if they weren\u2019t promoted, they would have to go to a quasi-world. The degree of completion might be higher but their experience wouldn\u2019t increase, which was tantamount to a waste.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had nothing to worry about. He directly signed up for the next test and waited for Central\u2019s notification.</p><br/><p>The little rose who had been through a battle wasn\u2019t afraid of a promotion test.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at the people online and sent a voice message. \u201cDo you want to come for an activity?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi immediately replied, \u201cOld Jiang, are you finally leaving the mountain?\u201d This person with a love brain, he hadn\u2019t done any business since his relationship began.</p><br/><p>Qin Ge was next. \u201cAh Zhe told me to ask what type of activity it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe was angry. \u201cI told you to ask. Why are you asking like this?\u201d This dead wood!</p><br/><p>Qin Ge, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled mysteriously. \u201cIt is an activity you have never participated in. If you want to come, enter the team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi was most excited and entered the team with great enthusiasm. Yan Zhe was unmoved and Qin Ge coaxed him, \u201cIf you don\u2019t go, what will they do if they are injured?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe scoffed. Under the persuasion of Nan Yi and the other three, Yan Zhe barely joined the team.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie gathered all the fooled people in place and started the registration.</p><br/><p>These powerful gods thought they were blind.</p><br/><p>Then Yan Zhe screamed, \u201cOld Jiang, what the hell are you doing? What do we have to go to an intermediate test as examiners?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s face was very thick. \u201cYou should try everything in life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi was also shocked. \u201cThis is the activity we have never participated in?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked him, \u201cHave you participated in it before?\u201d</p><br/><p>He\u2026 he\u2026 he really hadn\u2019t participated!</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe reacted. \u201cIs it because Little Rose is being promoted to an intermediate player?\u201d Too fast!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t reply.</p><br/><p>The other members also reacted. Nan Yi said, \u201cIt turned out to be like this. You should\u2019ve said it earlier. We must do our best to help our sister-in-law cheat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Old God Jiang told them, \u201cI am giving you a chance to appreciate how good he is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie added another knife. \u201cOf course, such a good child has been bound to me for life.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

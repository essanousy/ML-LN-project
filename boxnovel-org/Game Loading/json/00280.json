In any normal situation, he would be a sinful person.</p><br/><p>But right now\u2026</p><br/><p>This was the most promising thing to do. If he didn\u2019t separate the two people, there might be an irreparable disaster.</p><br/><p>Houqing\u2019s state of mind was extremely bad. Once stimulated, his behaviour would become aggressive and the little lion was in danger.</p><br/><p>Now he used a robot to \u2018escort\u2019 the lion to the Lion Country and then the robot would change the appearance to help Leo ascend to the throne. After one or two years of training, he would be fine.</p><br/><p>Hatred and love coexisted, meaning Leo wouldn\u2019t let go. He would work harder and become stronger in order to \u2018get revenge.\u2019</p><br/><p>Once that time came\u2026 Xie Xi would make a gamble!</p><br/><p>He firmly believed that these were two worlds. They might be mixed together but there was a possibility of repairing their one by one.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t like the Collapsed God where he had to hold three people steady at the same time!</p><br/><p>If so, it was necessary to take Leo away. Rather than forcing two fish to die in the net, it was better to separate them and take things slowly.</p><br/><p>Apparently, Xie Xi\u2019s words had stunned Houqing. He allowed Xie Xi to help him up, his head in disarray as the words echoed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi missed him? He said he missed Houqing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw him like this and felt distressed. Houqing might\u2019ve done too much and he was neurotic and fearful, but in these collapsed worlds, the souls were the most innocent ones.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that they wanted to collapse. Anyone who faced abandonment and death would be desperate.</p><br/><p>It was like waking up to find their homes destroyed and their lives lost. Who would be able to bear it?</p><br/><p>The souls represented Jiang Xie. At first,they were sleeping and then they awakened to find they could no longer support the world. They were banished and would ultimately be erased. How else could such a strong man be forced to feel such pain and despair?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at Houqing and spoke hoarsely, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I ignored you too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing was even more baffled. He couldn\u2019t understand these words. How could Xie Xi apologize to him? What was Xie Xi sorry for? Everything was his fault, he was the one who hurt Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pulled him over and spoke slowly, \u201cI used this time to think a lot. I was still thinking when I came back.\u2019</p><br/><p>Houqing was taken by the words and asked, \u201cWhat were you thinking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up at him. \u201cI wondered why you became like this?\u201d He reached out to caress the thin face, giving the cold cheeks some warmth.</p><br/><p>Houqing grabbed his hand, thin lips trembling fiercely.</p><br/><p>The tip of Xie Xi\u2019s nose was sour and his eyes were red. Anyone who saw the person in the heart show such an expression wouldn\u2019t be able to hold it. He absolutely wasn\u2019t a man!</p><br/><p>Houqing muttered, \u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi enduring the sourness that came up. \u201cI was very angry when I left the palace. I felt that I was betrayed. I didn\u2019t understand why the little white tiger I cared for would do something like that to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing lowered his eyes and was embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was the one who wasn\u2019t right. I had been making you afraid the entire time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing\u2019s body froze.</p><br/><p>After seeing the previous summary, how could Xie Xi not understand?</p><br/><p>Beat King Rose had truly fought through hundreds of battles and created unprecedented achievements, but he always placed himself on the tip of the knife.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just Houqing. Every family member of the soldiers on the battlefield were just as scared.</p><br/><p>If Jiang Xie almost died then Xie Xi would also be in a state of panic.</p><br/><p>He continued speaking to Houqing, \u201cThe war was clearly over but I was still in danger. This scared you, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing hugged him, the breath touching his neck hot. Houqing gasped like a child who had been crying for a long time.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes were moist. \u201cI didn\u2019t notice your feelings and also became suspicious of you. I thought you were interested in my high position\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was too incompetent,\u201d the national teacher stated. \u201cI couldn\u2019t protect you.\u201d There was no way to let Xie Xi reach his ideals while protecting him, no way to protect him from the sea of swords and fire\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi naturally wouldn\u2019t speak such extreme statements and his voice was warm. \u201cIt\u2019s fine now. I won\u2019t be in danger anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing didn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed. \u201cAfter returning to the palace, I thought a lot. It is difficult for the Rose Empire to make people happy. The lion beastmen and tiger beastmen are closest to each other yet their lifestyles are very different, not to mention the distant beastmen. There were too many rebels in the Rose Empire. It is true that some moved due to their ambition but the number proved that this method was indeed inappropriate.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was just like Earth where Xie Xi came from. There were ambitious people who aged worlds but there were still countless countries coexisting in peace.</p><br/><p>Centralization of power was the easiest to produce while democracy was from top down. Checks and balances were most needed in politics.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s words were the right medicine to treat the patient.</p><br/><p>The more that Houqing listened, the more sober he became. His black heart showed signs of easing.</p><br/><p>His heart disease was very complicated. On the one hand, he didn\u2019t wish to violate Xie Xi\u2019s wishes. He wanted to work with Xie Xi to achieve their common dream. On the other hand, he was nervous about Xie Xi\u2019s safety. He knew this was the most dangerous way and he couldn\u2019t help Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>He had to give Xie Xi the most perfect world but he couldn\u2019t do it. The contradictory mood intertwined with each other and became a knot that couldn\u2019t be resolved.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Xie Xi knew how to untie it.</p><br/><p>Houqing\u2019s mood gradually stabilized and he asked the thing he wanted to know most. \u201cYou really don\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew without him finishing and directly replied, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t love you, why would I give you only clean clothes to wear, give you the softest bed to sleep in and leave the best things for you? If I didn\u2019t love you, would I be willing to share the world with you, directly give you the emperor\u2019s throne and be with you day and night? If I didn\u2019t love you, would I feel heartache because of your behaviour, desperate because of your abnormality and feel enough despair to not want to live?\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing was afraid of the last picture and hugged him again. \u201cI\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what to say. He had thought they were in love but\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s warm voice entered his ears. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Just as you love me I love you to the bone.\u2019</p><br/><p>Houqing became more speechless. He was afraid that he would awaken from the dream if he opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t in a hurry. Leo had been settled in a secret place deep in the forest. Xie Xi had a lot of time with Houqing.</p><br/><p>Even if the knot was untied, the rope was still awkward. It would only be straightened completely by time.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also needed time to patch his actions.</p><br/><p>Leaving the palace and returning home with the lion were things that needed to be treated with caution.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also needed to patch \u2018turning against\u2019 Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>The thing that made Xie Xi helpless was that Houqing didn\u2019t ask.</p><br/><p>They spent a full month together. Houqing was normal and the feelings between the two people were more harmonious. However, he never mentioned anything related to Leo.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t mention it but Xie Xi had to talk about it.</p><br/><p>There were so many lessons from the past. How could he ignore them?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s mouth was full but he was actually stuffy to his bones. He could say a basket of improper words but once he was poked in the heart, he didn\u2019t mention it. Look at when he stated that Equivalent Exchange wasn\u2019t a problem or when he said the white space was nothing when it actually dealt a serious injury.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought up to here and couldn\u2019t help recalling Jiang Xie\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>He said that it was hard for people to get the task of erasing his worlds. Was this true?</p><br/><p>Previously, Xie Xi was convinced but today worry filled his heart.</p><br/><p>No, he had to be warier of this guy\u2019s nonsense in the future!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi picked the time of the medicinal bath to bring up Leo.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe little lion\u2026 is he really dead?\u201d He couldn\u2019t hide the sadness in his voice. Of course, his heart was as still as a mirror. Lep was holding the \u2018secret technique book\u2019 Xie Xi prepared for him and was in closed-off training.</p><br/><p>Houqing explained, \u201cHe fled into the forest and his chances of survival aren\u2019t great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi leaned back in the bathtub and said, \u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t know when I took him back to the palace. I just wanted to come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing finally confessed. \u201cI was afraid he would take you away so I told him his life story and spoke those words to guide him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took the initiative to shoulder the blame. \u201cAs long as he returns home, he will know the truth sooner or later. At that time, it would be troublesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing was silent again.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed softly and held his hand. \u201cShall we not be suspicious of each other in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing stared at him with eyes as clean as a cloud. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi added, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything and trust in you. Trust in me, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Houqing kissed him on the forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll keep nothing from you and tell you everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pulled him over and kissed him on the lips.</p><br/><p>A year later, the terrible wound on Xie Xi\u2019s chest disappeared. His body was fully recovered and there was no further discomfort.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finally knew his own beast state\u2026</p><br/><p>He had guessed he was a tiger but he didn\u2019t think he was such a small tiger! That\u2019s right\u2026</p><br/><p>Small, too fucking small, just like a black cat!</p><br/><p>Houqing held him up, eyes curved in a smile. \u201cIt is hard to imagine that such a small body contains so much power.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very angry. \u201cYou also become a beast. I want to know what you look like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing told him, \u201cNo, you look good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He would scratch this person!</p><br/><p>More than a year passed and Houqing had warmed up. There was no longer the cold and cruel appearance as before.</p><br/><p>Houqing kissed him on the nose. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen my beast form in a long time. right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him. \u201cHurry up.\u201d As he spoke, he turned back into a human.</p><br/><p>Then there was a white mist and the white cloak landed on the ground. A beautiful white tiger appeared in front of Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes lit up and he praised, \u201cGood-looking!\u201d</p><br/><p>Handsome, arrogant and powerful. This should be the beast king!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi touched the soft hair and was thrown down by the white tiger.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi laughed loudly. \u201cDon\u2019t do that, your big tongue is too\u2026 too much\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The white tiger became a man and took his \u2018black cat\u2019 king back to bed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at his chest for a while. Then Houqing rose from the bed and put on his coat.</p><br/><p>He looked into the mirror at Xie Xi. Black silk covered his white body and the symmetrical beauty was amazing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s beautiful body finally had no scars and the scary scar on the chest could no longer be found.</p><br/><p>Houqing reached out from behind and touched Xie Xi\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing stared at the other person\u2019s smile and whispered, \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart wasn\u2019t in pain and Houqing\u2019s heart wasn\u2019t painful either.</p><br/><p>For the first time, Xie Xi saw the scene where he and Jiang Xie were drawn from the world.</p><br/><p>He saw the scene in the mirror distort. Houqing kissed him on the neck and there was a swirling in their bodies. After feeling the familiar pulling sensation, Xie Xi popped out from the small world.</p><br/><p>He saw the sleeping white-haired Virgo\u2026</p><br/><p>Sure enough, he hadn\u2019t made a mistake. The two small worlds could be repaired separately!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gently sighed and looked at the still shining Leo.</p><br/><p>This time it was the little lion.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi prayed silently before entering. The little lion should be merciful!</p><br/><p>He went in and saw a tall man in armour, holding a long spear and standing in the light of the fire.</p><br/><p>What was the little lion? This was a strong and domineering mature man.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

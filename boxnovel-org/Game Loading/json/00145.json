Xie Xi and the other roses had to be thankful! Then\u2026 he soon became aware of a problem.</p><br/><p>He was in a painting. Why did the system still give him the prompt? Could this puppet still be used in the painting?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hesitated for a moment and didn\u2019t use it for the time being.</p><br/><p>There should still be another arc in the memory of the god\u2019s wisdom, which was when Nine Tails came to Rose Mountain to find Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>After all, the point of time that matched with reality had almost arrived.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t use the Puppet Technique because he was afraid that Nine Tails would suddenly appear and see two Xie Xis, raising his suspicions.</p><br/><p>According to the previous line of thought, he should now go out for a stroll and meet the small silver fox among the fireflies. However, Xie Xi didn\u2019t go. He didn\u2019t follow the direction of the god\u2019s wisdom and found himself a place to hide.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to leave the god\u2019s wisdom because he hadn\u2019t found a name for Nine Tails yet.</p><br/><p>In the god\u2019s wisdom of Azure Dragon, Xie Xi had no experience and was only afraid he would be trapped inside. He followed every scene and was finally bounced out.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t follow it step by step this time, could he make some changes? What would happen?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hid in an empty house, locked the door, closed the window and used the Puppet Technique.</p><br/><p>A person who looked exactly the same as him appeared in front of him. This was much more bizarre than looking in the mirror. After all, it was three-dimensional.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi poked the puppet and the puppet was motionless. It didn\u2019t even blink. That\u2019s it? What was the use?</p><br/><p>At this time, he found a prompt in the lower right corner.</p><br/><p>[A low-level puppet can only perform simple commands and communicate with less than three words.</p><br/><p>It is an independently re-shaped puppet and your body won\u2019t be damaged after its death.</p><br/><p>If the original body suffers an injury, the puppet can act as a substitute (ignores distance but must be in the same quasi-world).]</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw the prompt and felt very disgusted.</p><br/><p>Less than three words, was there a need for any command? Just order it to go and sleep! Siri was much better than it!</p><br/><p>Then he saw the second part and didn\u2019t react much. If his puppet died and his body was actually damaged, this privilege would be too bad!</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until he saw that third part that Xie Xi remembered he seemed to be the emperor of luck.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know if it was his illusion but he always felt that after being together with Jiang Xie, his luck had run away towards the abyss and hadn\u2019t come back.</p><br/><p>The puppet could be used as a substitute. This was much more powerful.</p><br/><p>He might have Roast Pork Bun which allowed him to be painlessly immune to three fatal injuries but he had no way with ordinary injuries. Like before when Houqing had hit him. If there had been the puppet, Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t have needed to grit his teeth in pain.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi left the puppet in this room and ordered it to be on standby.</p><br/><p>This god\u2019s wisdom belonged to Nine Tails and there was no need to coax other souls for the moment. Thus, the puppet\u2019s greatest use was bearing injuries.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t sure if there would be any danger but he didn\u2019t need to worry with a talisman.</p><br/><p>As he left, Xie Xi started to make the next puppet.</p><br/><p>To his surprise, the second puppet was much faster than the first one. Perhaps it was faster because there was a mould? Of course, this speed still required a few days of hard work.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t in a hurry since he needed to find a way to discover Nine Tails\u2019 name.</p><br/><p>According to the progress of the god\u2019s wisdom, Nine Tails finding him on Rose Mountain would force him out. If he didn\u2019t want to go out, he had to change the \u2018past.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi decided to take the initiative and go to Demon Sea to find Nine Tails!</p><br/><p>At this time, Nine Tails hadn\u2019t sent the betrothal gift yet. Going to the Demon Sea wasn\u2019t easy but Xie Xi wasn\u2019t afraid to delay time in the god\u2019s wisdom and walked on foot.</p><br/><p>After walking for three days, he experienced the rejection and his whole lower body was stiff with pain.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, there was the puppet. Xie Xi directly transferred the damage and stiffly continued.</p><br/><p>He used Roast Pork Bun to explore the way and tenaciously walked for 20 days before arriving in the Demon Sea.</p><br/><p>He arrived at the Demon Sea but was still far away from Nine Tailed Fox Palace. Fortunately, Xie Xi wasn\u2019t in a hurry. Presumably, Nine Tails was looking everywhere for him.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, he was discovered by the fox family as soon as he stepped into the Demon Sea.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d a green fox exclaimed. \u201cDid you come from Rose Mountain?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had long shifted the damage but he still pretended to be in pain. \u201cCan I see Lord Nine Tails?\u201d</p><br/><p>The green fox replied, \u201cLord Nine Tails sent you back to Rose Mountain to let you heal. You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t finish when Nine Tails appeared. He held Xie Xi in his arms and gasped out in distress, \u201cWhy did you do something so nonsensical?\u201d</p><br/><p>The \u2018weak and powerless\u2019 Xie Xi leaned in his arms and whispered, \u201cI wanted to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>The green fox hurriedly said, \u201cYour Excellency, let\u2019s go back to Nine Tailed Fox Palace. You can\u2019t stay here for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>They headed back. Then Nine Tails\u2019 voice was hoarse as he spoke to Xie Xi. \u201cYou should\u2019ve remembered it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was getting weaker these days and the enchantment was releasing. The little rose should\u2019ve remembered the past.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi paused before nodded lightly. Nine Tails stiffened and barely smiled. \u201cThen you came to the Demon Sea to find Houqing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cNo, I came to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails avoided his gaze. \u201cDo you need my help? Just say it and if it within my power, I will definitely help you.\u201d Even if it was helping him return to Houqing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cOf course you can do it. Only you can do it in this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails\u2019 eyes lowered. \u201cDo you want me to use the enchantment on Houqing? In fact, as long as you return, he will definitely\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this fox thinking? Xie Xi was here to feed him sugar. Who would think that this guy would shove arsenic into his mouth first?</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to Houqing.\u201d Xie Xi directly cut off his thoughts.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails froze.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him and told him seriously, \u201cI have remembered it and won\u2019t confuse you with Lord Houqing. You are you and Lord Houqing is Lord Houqing. I just want to be with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails stared at him with disbelief.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew this wasn\u2019t the direction of the god\u2019s wisdom. It was a very different ending but he was going to try it! Who said that the finished ending must be the real ending?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cLord Nine Tails, I want to be with you. It might only be two or three hundred years but it is my life!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails\u2019 thin lips trembled. It seemed that he had many words in his mouth but in the end, he only said, \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know how many times he had heard this sentence.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t lie to me.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t lie to me.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t lie to me.</p><br/><p>What exactly did Jiang Xie doubt?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wrapped his arms around Nine Tails\u2019 neck and kissed him. Nine Tails was stunned and took a long time to recover. Then he took back the initiative and crazily kissed Xie Xi. By the time the two of them separated, they were already panting.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your body?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails paused.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pressed him. \u201cWas it to save me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails\u2019 really had the masochistic brain circuit. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to blame yourself. There is no need to compensate for anything. I saved you because\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Xie Xi shouted. \u201cDo you think I will give up my whole life for compensation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails was stunned.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi added, \u201cCan you show me your body?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails nodded and turned into a silver fox. Nine Tails\u2019 silver fox was very large and it was said that his nine tails spread out could cover the sky. Now he was very small, like a real fox. He was so small that Xie Xi could easily pick him up.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails\u2019 voice was muffled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will recover after I spend some time cultivating.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was pained. \u201cHow long will it take?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t push and changed the topic. \u201cYour Excellency, do you still have your tails?\u201d</p><br/><p>It might be internal alchemy but it was only the power released from the tail. Presumably, the tails were still there.</p><br/><p>The silver fox wilted. \u201cI threw them aside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen they still exist!\u201d Xie Xi\u2019s eyes brightened.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails told him, \u201cIt\u2019s useless. They have left me and it won\u2019t be too long before they disappear.\u201d He didn\u2019t want these ugly things to be seen by the little rose.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cI heard you were heart before. Was it repaired by the flower god?\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought it was a sure thing but Nine Tails actually told him, \u201cThat is just a rumour among the flower family. I have never seen the flower god so how can I be repaired by him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi never thought it would be like this. \u201cYou have never seen the flower god?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled. \u201cBut they all said\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe flower god is very prestigious but things weren\u2019t so exaggerated. He didn\u2019t show grace to White Tiger and Houqing but later, White Tiger and Houqing broke apart and the Holy Mountain and Demon Sea separated. The things related to the flower god are just rumours.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He cried and screamed at a man who he only knew for one day. It was also his teacher\u2026</p><br/><p>How could he be so stupid?! It was just a cold but the heat made his brain silly! Xie Xi was annoyed to death and hoped it was a dream!</p><br/><p>In fact, last night wasn\u2019t exactly as Jiang Xie said. Xie Xi didn\u2019t cry but he cried silently. He closed his eyes and silently shed tears.</p><br/><p>That appearance was so painful that Jiang Xie only looked once and never wanted to see it again.</p><br/><p>What type of life had this half-child lived?</p><br/><p>The tears that flowed down were like hot magma, making an indelible mark on Jiang Xie\u2019s heart. He didn\u2019t want Xie Xi to cry or recall those hard memories. Thus, Jiang Xie said these words to help him unload some of the strong determination and also to be closer to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on, drink some porridge to supplement your strength.\u201d Jiang Xie gently stirred the porridge with a spoon and waited for the temperature to cool before sending it to Xie Xi\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi still doubted life and couldn\u2019t understand what this person said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Jiang Xie really treated him as a child. He brought the spoon to Xie Xi\u2019s mouth and had him open his mouth.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s spirit returned and he stared at Jiang Xie with an open mouth, very speechless.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie blinked, not embarrassed at all. \u201cIt seems that you have really woken up.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Xie Xi let Jiang Xie feed him? He saw the porridge which had obviously been cooking for a while and his heart was hot. He took the bowl and said, \u201cI\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t tease him and handed him the bowl. \u201cEat it, the temperature is just right and it\u2019s going to become cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi bowed his head and stared at the porridge. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy so polite?\u201d Being serious for one second was probably the limit for Jiang Xie. He added, \u201cA teacher for one day is a father for life. It is natural for an old father to take care of the children.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough, this teacher wasn\u2019t normal!</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly eat the porridge.\u201d The old father said earnestly, \u201cI have been boiling it for two hours. Don\u2019t waste it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was warm again. He was confused while burning up and must\u2019ve said a lot of things to Jiang\u2026 this person\u2019s mouth was shameless but he was a good man.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded as he scooped up a spoonful of porridge and placed it in his mouth\u2026</p><br/><p>He almost spat it out!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was very confident. \u201cIs it good? I put in sea cucumber, abalone and lobster. The nutrition is absolutely enough and the taste shouldn\u2019t be much worse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at the bowl of expensive seafood porridge and couldn\u2019t hold back, \u201cTeacher, have you tasted it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t estimate the weight and didn\u2019t cook that much. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t try it.\u201d The child needed a big meal and he was afraid there wasn\u2019t enough.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s lips curved as he asked, \u201cHow many spoonfuls of salt did you put in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA spoonful, the recipe\u2026 cough, I mean, you have a cold and it is better to have a lighter meal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t miss the word \u2018recipe.\u2019 This person looked up a recipe to make the porridge. Did he check the recipe and put in half a pound of salt?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw his expression and asked, \u201cIs the porridge salty?\u201d</p><br/><p>He picked up the spoon that Xie Xi had used, tasted it and rushed to the sink to vomit. This saltiness was enough to kill people!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie returned and gracefully collapsed. \u201cDon\u2019t eat it. I\u2019ll call for takeaway.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the first time he cooked but he countered such a thing, Teacher Jiang felt very humiliated.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help smiling and asked, \u201cTeacher, how big is your spoon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie pointed to the spoon in Xie Xi\u2019s bowl. \u201cThe same as that one.\u201d</p><br/><p>The spoon in Xie Xi\u2019s hand was big enough to hold an egg. This big spoonful of salt, um\u2026</p><br/><p>He laughed loudly. \u201cThe recipe isn\u2019t good. It didn\u2019t tell you how big a spoon to use.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It might be humiliating but he felt it was worth it to see the child laughing comfortably.</p><br/><p>This seemed to be the first time he saw Xie Xi laugh. They didn\u2019t know each other for a long time but Jiang Xie was certain that this child must rarely laugh.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt that his body was much better. A fever was deadly but once it burned out, it was easy to recover.</p><br/><p>He got out of bed and said, \u201cDon\u2019t call for takeaway. It would be wasteful to pour out such good porridge.\u201d The thought of not being able to eat sea cucumber, abalone and lobster simply pained Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie protested, \u201cIt is too salty. You can\u2019t eat it.\u201d It was so hard to endure the embarrassment but this turned out to be a bonus point, not a point deduction.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI\u2019ll cook it again and it can be eaten.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are still sick.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is just a little cold. It isn\u2019t that serious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw Xie Xi\u2019s feet and immediately said, \u201cWait, I\u2019ll go get you some slippers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had already left and soon returned with a pair of cotton slippers. \u201cThere is underfloor heating in my house but the kitchen doesn\u2019t have it. You just had a fever and need to be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he naturally bent down and placed the slippers on Xie Xi\u2019s feet. Xie Xi stared at the wide back and his heart was hot. A thank you filled his throat but he unexpectedly couldn\u2019t release it. He only knew that thanks weren\u2019t enough.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cTeacher, have you eaten?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t have the habit of eating breakfast but he was afraid to teach the child bad things, so he said, \u201cI\u2019ll eat later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen wait a while. We\u2019ll eat together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Xie Xi left the room and became stunned. It wasn\u2019t because of the spacious apartment, the elegant decorations or the expensive murals. He was stunned because\u2026</p><br/><p>It was messy! There were piles of clothes on the leather sofa, magazines on the carpet, a few empty cans on the coffee table and there was even an ashtray on the projector!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie cleared his throat. \u201cI live alone and I\u2019m not too particular\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Was this a matter of being particular? Xie Xi lived alone in the cheapest old building but his place wasn\u2019t like this.</p><br/><p>It was obvious from the bowl of porridge that this elite scholar didn\u2019t have much life experience but Xie Xi hadn\u2019t expected it to be so serious! He didn\u2019t say anything and headed straight to the kitchen.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t follow and quietly cleaned up the living room. He could at least hide his\u2026 um\u2026 his possessions\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi entered the kitchen and understood instantly. This kitchen was very beautiful and could be used in an advertisement but unfortunately, there were no signs of it being taken care of by its owner.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could imagine that since the kitchen\u2019s birth, it had probably only produced a salty bowl of seafood porridge. Jiang Xie had probably run to the supermarket in the early morning and bought everything according to the recipe. Even the can of salt was just opened.</p><br/><p>The spoon that was the \u2018cause\u2019 was also left in the salt can. It was funny but it also warmed up people\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie hadn\u2019t slept all night. He took care of Xie Xi\u2019s fever and then bought so many things in the early morning.</p><br/><p>This seafood porridge couldn\u2019t be eaten but the person\u2019s heart was clear. He wanted Xie Xi to eat something nutritious and digestible. He couldn\u2019t buy it at the time and simply had to cook it himself.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Jiang Xie cooked in his life. Xie Xi felt this was highly likely to be the truth, so the messy scene became clumsy and lovely. Jiang Xie was a very good teacher, very good.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi rolled up his sleeves and prepared to remake the seafood porridge. A bit of salt was okay. It was better to boil the porridge more so the taste would mix evenly.</p><br/><p>Porridge was generally slow to cook but it had a faster method. The fast taste might have a relatively poorer taste but it saved time.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take long for the real seafood porridge to emerge fresh from the pot.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was quite surprised. \u201cChild, you are very powerful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was too lazy to correct his name and said, \u201cEat it together. The ingredients are good and it would be a waste to throw them out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie tried a mouthful. \u201cWhat is this? So delicious!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi blinked and teased him, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it is delicious but it is edible.\u201d</p><br/><p>The porridge made by Old Jiang couldn\u2019t be eaten at all.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke quietly, \u201cI\u2019m not omnipotent. It is never too old to learn.\u201d</p><br/><p>This person could really speak!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cTeacher is right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he seriously ate the porridge. Xie Xi hadn\u2019t eaten last night and became sick. The fact that he could eat a bowl of porridge in the morning was extremely comfortable.</p><br/><p>The two people were satiated and Jiang Xie suggested, \u201cLeave the dishes here. I will have my housekeeper clean it up later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cThere are only two bowls, what\u2019s the point?\u201d He washed it by hand and then tidied up the kitchen.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie watched on with a strange heart. What type of circumstances did he experience for an 18 year old boy to be so skillful in housework? This child was really too painful.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had classes during the day. Before leaving, he said, \u201cHave a good rest. I already took the day off for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was in a rush. \u201cI can still go!\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t delay his classes. The freshman course was particularly full and missing one day of classes\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cRest assured, I will take the time to give you makeup lessons. Do more with less.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hesitated.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke again, \u201cI am already said you are sick and can\u2019t get out of bed. If you go to classes, won\u2019t I be lying?\u201d</p><br/><p>His words made Xie Xi dismiss the idea of going to school. \u201cThen I\u2019ll go home and rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no rush. I have no one else living here and you can sleep peacefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to say something but was interrupted by Jiang Xie. \u201cYou can see that there is still half a lobster left. If you don\u2019t eat it at noon, I can only throw it away when I get back.\u201d</p><br/><p>He casually talked about throwing away something that cost so much money! Xie Xi was in pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you\u2026\u201d He asked Jiang Xie, \u201cAre you coming back at noon to eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wanted to come back but he had an appointment with someone at noon. \u201cIt is because I can\u2019t come back at noon that I hope you stay and eat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s how Xie Xi was caught. Knowing Jiang Xie\u2019s style, he had no doubt that the fate of this half lobster was the bin.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie left and Xie Xi took medicine again. This medicine was also bought by Jiang Xie. The price was unknown but based on the packaging, it probably wasn\u2019t cheap.</p><br/><p>The money couldn\u2019t be paid back but there wasn\u2019t a problem. Jiang Xie didn\u2019t care about money. If Xie Xi tried to pay him back, he would probably refuse. The situation was clear when it came to money.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at the messy house, rolled up his sleeves and started to clean. He couldn\u2019t do much but he could help Jiang Xie a little bit!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie came back at night and thought he saw wrongly. Was this his house?</p><br/><p>His family is hiding a snail girl? (TL: Based on the Chinese folktale. One link: http://www.best4future.com/blog/chinese-folktale-the-snail-girl/)</p><br/><p>The next day, Jiang Xie went to class and wasn\u2019t surprised to see the child sitting unobtrusively. He sat in one corner and listened seriously to the lecture.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie found him after school. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was very teacher-like. Xie Xi followed him to his office. As soon as they entered the room, the teacher\u2019s illusion fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s lips curved. \u201cLast night, I came home and thought there was a snail girl at home\u2026um\u2026 should it be a snail boy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had cleaned his house too well. Jiang Xie said he had a housekeeper but in fact, he didn\u2019t want outsiders in his house and preferred to do things himself.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was a bit used to his non-serious manner and replied, \u201cTeacher took care of me yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nothing.\u201d Jiang Xie asked him seriously, \u201cAre you going to keep working at the bar?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t say anything. Jiang Xie\u2019s eyebrows twisted and he wondered, \u201cCan\u2019t you find another job? What about tutoring?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have two tutoring jobs on the weekends.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned. \u201cIt still isn\u2019t enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had never told this to anyone. \u201cJust tutoring isn\u2019t enough. I have to pay next semester\u2019s tuition fees and there will be many practical classes in the sophomore year. I have to\u2026 buy a computer. The freshman course is very full and there are classes all day. I can only go to work at night and the bar is the most suitable.\u201d</p><br/><p>It took a lot of courage for Xie Xi to say these things. He was accustomed to being alone and swallowing down all his sufferings. He wasn\u2019t used to relying on anyone or talking to people.</p><br/><p>It was useless to say it and sympathy would only make him embarrassed. Xie Xi was grateful to Jiang Xie and didn\u2019t say this to seek his help. Xie Xi simply didn\u2019t want to deceive him or for him to misunderstand.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was surprised.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi reluctantly smiled. \u201cJust\u2026 wait a while. It will become much better. A senior I know has a project and I will take time to help him. If it goes well, I should be able to quit working at the bar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s spirit returned. He was distressed but he couldn\u2019t show it. This child\u2019s pride was too strong and his heartache would just be a sharp injury to the child.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie adjusted his tone. \u201cHow about working for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shocked.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s lips curved as he teased, \u201cHow about being my snail boy?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

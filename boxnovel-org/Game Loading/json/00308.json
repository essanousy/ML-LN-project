What about the girl\u2019s father?\u201d</p><br/><p>The important task clue was wiped out like this. How was he going to repair the collapsed girl?</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t called repair, this was definitely aggravating the girl\u2019s collapse!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie held him and flew away from the sea.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t ask much. Jiang Xie was in a state of full qualifications and flying was a small matter.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take long for them to reach the shore and Jiang Xie found a very remote place to settle.</p><br/><p>He said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Once I control this body, we will go to the girl\u2019s house first to check.\u201d</p><br/><p>If the girl\u2019s father was in prison then there was no doubt that he had disappeared.</p><br/><p>However, the news wouldn\u2019t spread so quickly and they could take advantage of this opportunity to act.</p><br/><p>It could only be like this\u2026 Xie Xi looked at Jiang Xie and asked, \u201cCan you control it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The setting of his role was so terrible.</p><br/><p>A madman who couldn\u2019t control his power. If it was the original prisoner then at most, he would smash the walls of the iron cage and not deal too much damage.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the same for Prisoner Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>He tried to suppress his strength but unfortunately, his body\u2019s self-protection mechanism was triggered after being attacked. So\u2026 the island was gone.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cIt is a type of mental pollution and will take some time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew that Jiang Xie would be fine but he still felt a bit worried. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished when Jiang Xie smiled and kissed him. \u201cThe elephant was stung by an ant. Would something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this metaphor\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stated, \u201cLook at where the sting is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elephant Jiang replied, \u201cYes, if you were stung then I\u2019ll die of pain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took a moment to understand before he reacted. \u201cWho wants to be an elephant with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, you\u2019re not an elephant. You are my heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He had been poor all his life but this fellow was shameless!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s sharp eyes saw the red eyes and he quickly kissed the other person with a beautiful heart.</p><br/><p>After chatting a bit more, Jiang Xie cleared the madness of his character.</p><br/><p>He had a general talk with Xie Xi about the mission.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stated, \u201cThere are no souls here so the repair task is like straightening a pile of wool.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi silently thought, \u2018The head was easy to find but you burned it.\u2019</p><br/><p>The prison was definitely an important clue and now\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie continued, \u201cWell, it isn\u2019t a big deal to change it to an erasure task. After all, N\u2019s collapsed worlds are countless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt quite distressed for N. Such a good man of Central, how did he meet an \u2018opponent\u2019 like Jiang Xie!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suggested, \u201cCome, let\u2019s go to the girl\u2019s house to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had already set the position and reached out to carry Xie Xi. \u201cI\u2019m offending you, my prison warden.\u201d</p><br/><p>The tip of Xie Xi\u2019s ears was red again. He closed his eyes and knew what this bastard was thinking! Especially after the 12\u2026 after\u2026</p><br/><p>The girl lived in a remote village with her grandmother.</p><br/><p>The world might be collapsed but the structure was very large. It was obvious that N\u2019s ambition wasn\u2019t small and he really wanted to build a complete quasi-world.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt that N wasn\u2019t completely talentless. If he just designed a partial quasi0world then it would be at least C or even B grade.</p><br/><p>However, N first thought of a S-grade quasi-world, a comprehensive, complete and independent quasi-world.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he frequently failed and his only success had a major defect, making it F-grade.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi and Jiang Xie arrived at the small village and instantly discovered the anomaly.</p><br/><p>It was daytime but there was dead silence here and no smoke at all.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked Jiang Xie, \u201cThey live here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jiang Xie had a mission target detection item that could accurately pinpoint the location.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cThis village doesn\u2019t look normal.\u201d</p><br/><p>They walked in and found that every house had closed doors and windows while no one came out.</p><br/><p>It was broad daylight but they seemed to be walking in a graveyard. It was very gloomy.</p><br/><p>Then a teenager ran out of an alley with a bag.</p><br/><p>He was surprised when he saw Xie Xia and Jiang Xie but just bowed his head and kept running.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie held him back like he was a chick.</p><br/><p>The teenager was frightened and pale. His mouth trembled fiercely as he shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know anything. You don\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t\u2026 ask me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at Jiang Xie, eyes wondering: How does he know what we are asking?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied to him in the team channel: I\u2019ll ask him to tell us.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw Jiang Xie point to the teenager\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>The next moment, the boy stopped struggling and he stood in place, as if hypnotized.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shocked. He knew that god level players had many means but he was really surprised to see it directly.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the village? Why do you want to escape? What don\u2019t you want to tell us?\u201d</p><br/><p>The hypnotized teenager was free of his fear. He looked in front and spoke like a robot.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe witch\u2026 it is a witch. She is crazy\u2026 too crazy. The mad witch eats a fresh heart every day. I don\u2019t want to\u2026 be eaten. I\u2019m going to\u2026 I\u2019m going to leave here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke intermittently. His tone was rigid but his fear and despair could still be read from the lines.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked again, \u201cWhere is the witch?\u201d</p><br/><p>The teenager paled and told a place.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie continued to ask. \u201cDo you know Nalene?\u201d This was the name of the collapsed girl.</p><br/><p>The teenager immediately replied, \u201cNo, no.. she\u2026 her grandmother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked again, \u201cWhat happened to her grandmother?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Killed a lot of people, a lot of hearts, good\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished his last sentence when he passed out.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained to Xie Xi, \u201cThe skill has a time duration and his mental strength can\u2019t withstand a second hypnosis.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s go to Nalene\u2019s house to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie placed the teenager in a corner and went forward with Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>The situation in this village was worse than expected.</p><br/><p>There were many empty houses, blood and traces of a miserable struggle.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie held Xie Xi\u2019s hand and Xie Xi glanced over. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled but didn\u2019t release his hand.</p><br/><p>Now Xie Xi had more knowledge and such a scene wouldn\u2019t scare him. He could hold hands with Jiang Xie and his heart was still comfortable.</p><br/><p>When it came to security, no one was more reliable than the person around him.</p><br/><p>It seemed a bit contradictory but anyone who knew Jiang Xie could understand the truth.</p><br/><p>They came to Nalene\u2019s house.</p><br/><p>To Xie Xi\u2019s surprise, the girl who depended on her grandmother lived in a very big house.</p><br/><p>The large mansion had obviously once been lively but now it was very depressing and there was a cold, unclear atmosphere about it.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun whispered, \u201cA haunted house!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi poked his head. \u201cYou know a lot.\u201d\u2019</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun\u2019s eyes that were the same colours as Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes flashed as he wondered, \u201cDoesn\u2019t a witch eat cats?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie rubbed the kitten\u2019s head. \u201cYou should grow up a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>The kitten\u2019s fur raised as he cried out, \u201cFather, give me another skill and make it a fighting one!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie paused.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun didn\u2019t realize it had leaked the secret.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was sharp and looked over. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun reflected on himself. \u201c\u2026\u201d This little broken kitten hid back in the pets bar!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie cleared his throat. \u201cGo and see the girl and witch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t move as he asked, \u201cRoast Pork Bun\u2019s Dreaming skill is something you gave him?\u201d</p><br/><p>It couldn\u2019t be hidden anymore and Jiang Xie touched his nose. \u201cYou were in Atlantis and I was afraid you wouldn\u2019t be able to pass.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was afraid that Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t be able to complete the task of collecting the love of the six princes.</p><br/><p>In that world, the kitten\u2019s Dreaming skill really did give Xie Xi a great help.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for Dreaming then he would find it hard to collect the love of the six princes.</p><br/><p>Xie XI thought of another matter and frowned. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d If it was easy to kill the kitten skills then Jiang Xie would\u2019ve stuffed Roast Pork Bun full of skills!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also knew he was fine but when he thought that Jiang Xie was always paying attention to him with a good heart\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie opened his mouth again. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you would receive the mission of the six princes at that time.\u201d He was really afraid that Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t finish.</p><br/><p>If he was unable to complete the task then Xie Xi would stay in the world forever and Jiang Xie would only be able to watch him on the live broadcast.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could hear these unspoken words and looked up. \u201cNo more unauthorized actions in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie laughed. \u201cI will listen to the warden\u2019s orders.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d This person was never serious!</p><br/><p>They entered the house and immediately smelt blood.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw a thin girl holding a huge broom and shrinking back in the corner.</p><br/><p>She looked up when she heard the footsteps. Panic flashed through her dark eyes before she stood up and said, \u201cGo\u2026 leave\u2026 don\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t come over\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no doubt that this was Nalene, the main character of the repair task.</p><br/><p>The girl who collapsed.</p><br/><p>In the team channel, Xie Xi asked Jiang Xie: Is it necessary to save the girl to complete the repair task?</p><br/><p>Her mother died, her father was imprisoned and her grandmother became a \u2018witch.\u2019 The girl was really pitiful.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at the girl and stated, \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He ate a few more crescent fruits.</p><br/><p>This was a special product of the sea. It grew on a type of coral and because the coral was a crescent moon shape, people called them crescent coral.</p><br/><p>Big white fruits that looked like coconuts regularly fell from the crescent coral. Once broken open, the insides were really soft and tasted like bread.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was still a land person at heart and really liked this fruit. It was as if he was eating steamed bread.</p><br/><p>The third prince glanced at him. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m cheap like Aix-en?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi froze for a while before reacting. Aix-en was the second prince, the finance minister and Gars\u2019 brother.</p><br/><p>He knew they had a bad relationship and replied, \u201cYour Highness is very generous.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince pointed to the table full of dishes. \u201cThere are so many good things to eat. Don\u2019t just chew on the crescent fruits. Are you trying to save my money?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d It turned out to be because of this. As far as these brain circuits were concerned, how could an average person keep up?</p><br/><p>The third prince broke open a big lobster with his bare hands and placed the most delicate meat on Xie Xi\u2019s plate.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hurriedly said, \u201cI can do it myself.\u201d The third prince glanced at his tender fingers and said, \u201cEat, you are as thin as a flagpole.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi protested, \u201cI\u2019m not thin.\u201d He wasn\u2019t fat either. He was just a normal size.</p><br/><p>Who would\u2019ve expected the third prince to put down the king crab in his hand and squint at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not thin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sat upright. He was very good. He wasn\u2019t thin!</p><br/><p>The third prince picked up a towel and wiped his hand with blank face. Xie Xi didn\u2019t know what he was going to do. The next moment, the third prince picked up Xie Xi with one hand.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince looked at him with childish eyes. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t thin, how can I pick you up with a finger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe laughed wildly from in front of the water fountain. \u201cOld Jiang\u2026 hahaha, you\u2019re a poisonous ghost!\u201d</p><br/><p>With this EQ, remain a single fish for the rest of your life! Jiang Xie also couldn\u2019t bear to look.</p><br/><p>The third prince quickly released Xie Xi, placing his hands around Xie Xi\u2019s waist and putting him down on the chair. \u201cEat well and exercise. Once I can\u2019t carry you anymore then you\u2019re not thin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sat at the top. This was a position arranged for guests. Originally, he should be sitting below.</p><br/><p>He looked at the 14% red progress bar and was too lazy to care about this little boy. \u201cThe strength of Your Highness is infinite. I can\u2019t do anything, even if I\u2019m the weight of hundreds of gold bars.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince said, \u201cThen try to carry me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d The third prince gave him a crab leg and said, \u201cYou will be qualified the day you can pick me up like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>What damned qualification? Who wanted to pick him up?</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe hit the table while laughing. \u201cPoisonous, really poisonous, Old Jiang, you really rely on strength!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Jiang Xie was upset and turned off the water curtain.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe\u2019s eyes became big. \u201cWhy? I was watching that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cTime is up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe looked up and say that he wasn\u2019t messing around. He said, \u201cHurry and go. I will send the fee for the bone setting.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The next day, Xie Xi headed towards the third prince\u2019s palace and just saw him going out.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought he was going to beat up the \u2018fat\u2019 sixth prince. Who would\u2019ve expected him to say, \u201cOld five has been at home for a few days. I\u2019m going to check on him.\u201d</p><br/><p>In a way, the third prince loved his younger brothers. He might not get along with the second prince but he cared for the fifth and sixth prince. It was just that his way of caring was too unique and most people couldn\u2019t accept it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi naturally knew the situation of the fifth prince and found it unbearable.</p><br/><p>The third prince took him to the sixth prince\u2019s palace. The palace that used to be filled with songs and dances was very quiet. The mermaid maid looked nervous when she saw the third prince had come.</p><br/><p>It was just that the third prince\u2019s reputation was too bad. It was highly likely the mermaid maid thought he was here to beat up the fifth prince.</p><br/><p>The third prince frowned and asked, \u201cWhat about Fifth Brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>The mermaid bowed and replied, \u201cThe fifth prince is locking himself inside the house. No one is allowed to approach.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince walked straight ahead and the maid stopped him. \u201cThird Prince, please stay. His Highness doesn\u2019t want to see any guests. You entering like this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince frowned and raised an eyebrow. \u201cGet out of the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mermaid used all her courage to say the above sentence. Now all her courage was gone.</p><br/><p>The third prince arrived at Randall\u2019s bedroom and directly banged on the door. \u201cRandall?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no sound.</p><br/><p>The third prince cried out, \u201cNo one cares about your creative work. Don\u2019t starve to death in your room!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough\u2026 the third prince was always full of poison when he opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>There was still no sound in the room. Xie Xi\u2019s heart was beating quickly and he was uncertain what state the fifth prince would be in.</p><br/><p>The third prince raised an eyebrow and was about to kick the door when it opened.</p><br/><p>Randall only wore a black coat and his chest was exposed to the outside. His state wasn\u2019t bad but his eyes were cold. \u201cThird Brother came so early in the morning. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d His voice was steady but it made people feel uneasy.</p><br/><p>The third prince stared at him for a moment. \u201cYou, these days\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince interrupted him and asked, \u201cWhat does Third Brother think I can do?\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince raised one eyebrow.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince said, \u201cI\u2019m fine. Third Brother, please go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince didn\u2019t have a good temper. Once he saw this, he didn\u2019t bother wasting any more time and nearly turned away.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at the fifth prince, his heart filled with worry. Randall\u2019s eyes were dark. Has he been sleeping?</p><br/><p>The third prince fought Sirius in the training hall and the two men didn\u2019t go outside all day.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at Sirius and thought about Randall. He couldn\u2019t let it go. These two good people, their lives had changed with Sein Hall\u2019s death.</p><br/><p>This made him very uncomfortable. It might be for the task but he was actually bringing them pain.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t make any progress on the side of the third prince at the moment. Xie Xi calculated the time and the next night, he sneaked into the fifth prince\u2019s palace.</p><br/><p>Dreaming was available to be used on the same person once every three days. It should be available now.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi used a reserve face to become the fifth prince\u2019s maid and slipped into his sleeping quarters.</p><br/><p>It was already the middle of the night but the fifth prince wasn\u2019t sleeping. He sat on the bed and stared at the empty space in front of them.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi waited for three or four hours, until it became cold and the prince fell asleep on the bed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at his pale complexion and dark circles and felt heartache.</p><br/><p>Why\u2026</p><br/><p>Looking at Randall, Xie Xi didn\u2019t understand why people were so passionate about love.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi activated Dreaming. He found himself standing in front of the fifth prince\u2019s bed. Did it fail? Dreaming didn\u2019t work?</p><br/><p>However, there was a hint in the lower right corner. [Congratulations on the successful use of Dreaming. You have entered the dream of Randall Atlantis.]</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned before understanding that the fifth prince\u2019s dream was in his bedroom.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince sat up and saw Xie Xi, but he didn\u2019t show any surprise.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun excitedly said, \u201cDaddy, you seem to be a ghost!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi bowed his head and found that he was translucent, with a faint light emitting from his hand. It turned out that in Randall\u2019s dream, he was a ghost!</p><br/><p>Randall looked at him before slowly spoke. \u201cI am a coward.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to open his mouth but found that he was unable to speak in this dream!</p><br/><p>It was impossible for a ghost to speak in the fifth prince\u2019s heart?</p><br/><p>Randall stood up and walked to him. Xie Xi floated high in the air and could just look at Randall.</p><br/><p>Randall moved his fingers but didn\u2019t touch. He seemed to know that he couldn\u2019t touch Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother was right. I\u2019m a coward, a deserter and doomed to be defeated by the storm!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very familiar with these words. He remembered that in the last dream, the queen shouted these words to the fifth prince who gave up everything. The fifth price bravely went out and pursued the life he wanted. Now\u2026</p><br/><p>Randall\u2019s eyes were red. It was said that he wanted to hug Xie Xi while knowing he couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been useless\u2026 I was born in the royal family and became a prince, but I was still delusional about my life. How can I have my own life? Where is real freedom? How could the shackles flowing through my blood let me go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI flattered myself by thinking I was brave and that I could guard everything I love. In fact, I am just escaping, escaping from sorrow, escaping from suffering and escaping from all the disappointment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m such a deserter and a coward. So what if met you? I can\u2019t protect you, I can\u2019t hug you and I can\u2019t even show my heart to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t so incompetent and had enough strength, if I had known more, I would\u2019ve never let you die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shocked and understood the fifth prince\u2019s pain.</p><br/><p>He felt remorseful, blamed himself and was deeply immersed in doubts. He saw the conspiracy behind the sixth prince and determined that Sein Hall was a casualty.</p><br/><p>He thought he was too far away from the centre of power and didn\u2019t know anything. He didn\u2019t know that his beloved was discarded and sent to the guillotine.</p><br/><p>If he knew these things, if he hadn\u2019t been deaf, if he didn\u2019t shrink back in his ivory tower, he would\u2019ve definitely stopped Sein Hall and saved him.</p><br/><p>This knot became a poisonous snake, licking at Randall\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t open his mouth. Even if he could speak, what could he say? A dead person couldn\u2019t say anything to comfort a living person.</p><br/><p>Randall slowly raised his hand, slender fingers touching Xie Xi\u2019s cheeks. He couldn\u2019t touch but he could look.</p><br/><p>\u201cSein.\u201d Randall whispered. \u201cIf there is an afterlife, will you please give me a chance to fall in love with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Jiang Xie wanted to slap his own soul. Stupid guy, he asked such a question so why didn\u2019t he let Xie Xi speak?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s soft heart meant he might\u2019ve said yes.</p><br/><p>Once the quasi-world was cleared, Randall\u2019s \u2018afterlife\u2019 would be Jiang\u2026</p><br/><p>Good, because of this idiot, he missed a once in 100 million chance.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t say anything. Once he left the dream of the fifth prince, he whispered, \u201cIf I leave the quasi-world, what will happen to these souls?\u201d</p><br/><p>Did Randy, Aix-en and Gars come from the first world or did they just have the same name and appearance?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes slightly lit up at Xie Xi\u2019s murmur.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

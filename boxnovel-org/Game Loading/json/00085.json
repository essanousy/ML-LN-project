If you break up, Love Love will curse you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled while Xie Xi was in shock.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the zombie girl didn\u2019t say anything else. She waved her small hand and all the pink things disappeared. The players participating in the ground instantly fell straight down.</p><br/><p>Both the injured Lan Lingling and Peng Chi sucked in a breath. Fortunately, the height was height but there was buoyancy and they weren\u2019t injured from the fall.</p><br/><p>After finally landing, Xie Xi met a pair of bloody eyes. Xie Xi was startled and screamed. Jiang Xie held his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, they\u2019re all dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Them being dead didn\u2019t make it okay!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi slowly discovered that the place where they landed was like a mass grave. They were surrounded by messy corpses. Some had no arms or no legs. The even more terrible thing was that all their limbs were gone and they became a column of bodies\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cDon\u2019t look if you are disgusted.\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew that this child was strong and wouldn\u2019t say he was afraid.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought this was useful. He closed his eyes and asked, \u201cDid they all die in the game?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned. \u201cIn fact, this game wasn\u2019t difficult.\u201d Even so, many people died.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cMany times, the difficulty of the game isn\u2019t related to the death rate.\u201d A hard game didn\u2019t necessarily mean death and a simple game didn\u2019t necessarily mean survival. It was because people were very strange creatures.</p><br/><p>Their bodies were fine but Lan Lingling and Peng Chi were ashen as they lay on the ground.</p><br/><p>They survived but didn\u2019t have one arm and one leg. They couldn\u2019t walk anymore. Then what about the next two projects? If they couldn\u2019t finish then they would be stuck here forever. These dead people were stuck forever!</p><br/><p>Many bodies were missing one arm and one leg. They had probably lived to the end of the game but due to physical reasons and no one helping them, they could only die here desperately.</p><br/><p>Lan Lingling and Peng Chi saw that they would soon become like this.</p><br/><p>The young woman got up, glanced at them indifferently and walked towards the exit. No one would save a stranger, not to mention the two people were so badly injured that saving them was only dragging her to death.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi watched Lan Lingling and Peng Chi. \u201cThis game seems to rely entirely on luck but there are actually fixed rules. The first person selected depends on luck but everyone will become the first person once. The card also seems to be luck but there were a total of three cards and the cards we received every time were different. If you didn\u2019t resent each other, we could\u2019ve ended the game in three rounds.\u201d</p><br/><p>At best, they would\u2019ve lost an arm and still be able to act. Unlike now, when they could only wait for death.</p><br/><p>In fact, this was the trap of the game. No one was willing to be the first person or sacrifice themselves. As long as their heart was unwilling, there would be various situations.</p><br/><p>A Forbidden Card appeared at the end of the first round, which was tantamount to a lifesaver for the first person to be punished.</p><br/><p>This card seemed to randomly land in Lan Lingling\u2019s hand but Xie Xi was certain that Peng Chi absolutely wouldn\u2019t have received it.</p><br/><p>The game deliberately gave it to the other five people, waiting for them to make a choice.</p><br/><p>The choice was difficult and determined who they would offend. This was doomed to be a disaster.</p><br/><p>In fact, Lan Lingling\u2019s choice to discard it was correct. If Peng Chi was sensible, he would\u2019ve understood Lan Lingling\u2019s helplessness. She didn\u2019t favour or bully anyone, she just maintained the original state. All he had to do was pretend the fire of hope hadn\u2019t appeared.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Peng Chi fell into the trap and directed his disappointment and resentment towards Lan Lingling.</p><br/><p>Even so, if Lan Lingling had held steady, not been suspicious and didn\u2019t act to trick Peng Chi then when Peng Chi got the Exchange Card, he might\u2019ve hesitated to change Lan Lingling and Xie Xi\u2019s positions. Then Lan Lingling wouldn\u2019t have lost an arm.</p><br/><p>Due to the gradually accumulated resentment and unwillingness, the two of them struggled and Lan Lingling made a mistake, causing her to lose her leg.</p><br/><p>Lan Lingling and Peng Chi also understood these things but what was the point?</p><br/><p>It was already too late.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie glanced at Jiang Xie and asked him, \u201cDid you realize the key to the game early on and set up the foundations in the trial?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to admit it but Jiang Xie\u2019s nonsense was indeed the key to the game.</p><br/><p>He caught the message revealed by the zombie girl and used the two chances in the trial to pave the way for \u2018love at first sight.\u2019 Thus, the confession of the Opposite Card took effect and the illusion of finding love in the game was created.</p><br/><p>The thing that Xie Xi couldn\u2019t understand was that there were certainly no other \u2018old hands\u2019 like Jiang Xie in other games. If they didn\u2019t lay the foundation in advance, how could they create the illusion of finding love? Xie Xi didn\u2019t believe that anyone could find love in such a shocking game.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cThere is no need to pave the way. The key is to invest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInvest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLove naturally needs an investment. The key is to use the Opposite Card under the premise that the position isn\u2019t swapped.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood. Normal people wouldn\u2019t say so many words in the trial. The game was set on the premise that all players were strangers. Then how could they find love?</p><br/><p>The location was crucial. The zombie girl had told Lan Lingling, \u201cYou have two good men around you. How can you go and talk to others?\u201d In other words, only the two people who were originally adjacent would have an effect if they confessed to each other. At the same time, they needed to use the Opposite Card on themselves.</p><br/><p>The rule of the Opposite Card was that it must be used by one of the five other people or the person who had the card. It couldn\u2019t be discarded. It was only when the person used it on themselves that something would be invested in the love.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t understand something. He asked Jiang Xie, \u201cSince it was useless, why did you pave the way in the trial?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi watched him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was worthy of being Old Jiang. He smiled and shamelessly said, \u201cI didn\u2019t pave the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cI just told the truth. It is ordinary love at first sight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Okay! To be honest, love at first sight was still normal!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi believed that he would be the one losing if he tried to refute it.</p><br/><p>A chuckle was heard. It was from the man in the suit who hadn\u2019t left yet. The suited man said, \u201cYou are really interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at him and opened his mouth. \u201cDo we know each other?\u201d This sense of familiarity couldn\u2019t fool people. Xie Xi should\u2019ve seen this person somewhere before.</p><br/><p>The man in the suit kept smiling.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s voice was cold. \u201cThe mask is quite good.\u201d</p><br/><p>His gentle tone that contained a hint of cold caused the suited man to hurriedly wave his hand. \u201cI mean no help. I just wanted to help Xie Xi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled. The man in the suit reached for his neck and pulled. Something fell off and revealed his original face.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin! The man who tricked Xie Xi into the Fairytale Town had chased him all the way here. Where did he come from and why say that he helped Xie Xi!</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin blinked and told them, \u201cI wish you a happy game. I will leave first.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked as if he was running away but the smile on his face revealed that he wasn\u2019t really afraid.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect to meet Zhong Jin here. There were so many players in the Central World. How could there be such a coincidence?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie reminded him, \u201cHis face is fake.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t surprised at all!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wondered, \u201cIs he the man you met in Fairytale Town?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had talked about Fairytale Town with him so he nodded and explained briefly.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie warned, \u201cThat person isn\u2019t simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also felt it. \u201cI will be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin had obviously seen through this game early on. He probably understood it better than Xie Xi. However, Xie Xi had some doubts. Why did he show a regretful expression when he used the Exchange Card?</p><br/><p>What did he regret? Did he not want to end the game? He wanted to keep watching the fun?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought it was likely. After all, this man\u2019s character was really bad.</p><br/><p>The reason why Xie Xi spent so long in this pile of dead people wasn\u2019t to comment on the game.</p><br/><p>He had been waiting for the suited man to leave. Now that no one was here\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke to Lan Lingling and Peng Chi. \u201cI have a way to help you stand up. Do you want to try it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Lingling and Peng Chi looked up with bright eyes.</p><br/><p>Peng Chi cried out, \u201cAs long as I can stand up, I will work extremely hard for you in this life!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Lingling was also excited. \u201cPlease help me. I don\u2019t want to die here. As long as I can return to the Central World, I will give you all my things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with them. \u201cIt might not succeed but I can try it if you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people replied in unison, \u201cWe want!\u201d</p><br/><p>Who wouldn\u2019t want to try it? As long as they could stand up and move, they had hope to live and return to Central. Once they returned to Central, there were unlimited possibilities for them!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cI can only casually find you arms and legs. They might not look good but you can use them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Lingling and Peng Chi seemed confused.</p><br/><p>Old Jiang was more aware and how could he let Xie Xi do this? He had long gone to pick two arms and two legs. He also divided them between male and female limbs.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi still felt nauseous when he saw these limbs but he could only use his blank expression to stabilize himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hold too much hope.\u201d Xie Xi told them. \u201cIt relies on luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have much confidence in this repair. Previously it succeeded because he used zombie legs. Now he used dead objects and the targets were living\u2026 oh, these arms and legs weren\u2019t alive.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi helped set them up and used Beginner Repair. The arms and legs connected together. As for whether they could be used\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t care. \u201cYou can try it for yourself later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Both Lan Lingling and Peng Chi were still stunned\u2026</p><br/><p>What was this skill? Other people\u2019s arms and legs were casually placed on them! This\u2026 if the limbs could be used then it was too much! Also, wasn\u2019t it impossible to use skills in this world? This person\u2026</p><br/><p>By the time they recovered, Xie Xi had left. After walking away, Jiang Xie wondered with a smile, \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of them telling others about your skill?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if they say it. Other people knowing about my skill won\u2019t hurt me. It is only troublesome..\u201d His Beginning Repair skill made him equivalent to a milk dad (healer)in the open world. Even if someone knew about him, they wouldn\u2019t be stupid enough to kill a healer.</p><br/><p>It might be a bit troublesome but he couldn\u2019t let people die because he was afraid of trouble.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

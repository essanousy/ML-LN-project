How about killing him, this unfilial son!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you know me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird was still young when Xie Xi fell asleep but Xie Xi didn\u2019t believe that his \u2018brothers\u2019 wouldn\u2019t take the small bird to see him. Vermillion Bird saw the sleeping flower god so why didn\u2019t he recognize Xie Xi?</p><br/><p>It was really Vermilion Bird\u2019s mistake but it wasn\u2019t because Vermilion Bird was blind. It was that Xie Xi with closed eyes was very different from Xie Xi with open eyes.</p><br/><p>It was said that the eyes were the windows to the sou. In this mysterious world, the meaning became even more realistic.</p><br/><p>In the strange body, there was only one pair of eyes that really touched the heart.</p><br/><p>The appearance and body were beautiful but there wasn\u2019t much difference in the bird\u2019s eyes. It was the eyes that connected all species, allowing them to look into the heart.</p><br/><p>It was like the current Vermilion Bird as well as Azure Dragon and Nine Tails. They all had a very shallow impression of the flower god, only remembering that he was very gentle and sounded good. As they grew up, they only saw the beautiful shell sleeping and didn\u2019t miss him like White Tiger and Houqing.</p><br/><p>Then once Xie Xi woke up, their eyes met and the love that touched the soul flowed through their body like hot magma. This was the so-called love at first sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo we know each other?\u201d The teenage Vermilion Bird laughed. \u201cNo wonder why I think you\u2019re familiar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mouth twitched as he asked, \u201cDo you really not remember me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d Someone\u2019s poor mouth was ingrained deep into his bones. \u201cMy lover of a past life should be recorded on my heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The teenage Vermilion Bird watched him closely and couldn\u2019t help rejoicing. \u201cI think you aren\u2019t the lover of my past life\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard a familiar routine. Sure enough, the teenager smiled and revealed little tiger teeth. \u201cYou should be the lover of my dreams!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had listened to these words a lot. Apart from some sweetness in his heart, there were no fluctuations on the surface. \u201cOh.\u201d They were indeed dream lovers. In Atlantis, he married the fifth prince (Vermilion Bird) in his dream.</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird continued, \u201cDon\u2019t think that I\u2019m casually speaking. Us birds are faithful and we only propose to one person in our lives. If you don\u2019t like me, I will never marry anyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>So scary. Xie Xi was frightened by him and replied, \u201cThen don\u2019t marry anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>A thick skin was also engraved into the soul. The teenage Vermilion Bird cried out happily, \u201cYes, I\u2019ll only marry you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this terrible listening comprehension?</p><br/><p>At this time, White Tiger and Azure Dragon came back. They followed people and arranged supplies for the party not far away. Once they saw Vermilion Bird, they put the things down and walked over.</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird saw his two brothers and smiled even wide. \u201cI will introduce you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger and Azure Dragon were stunned. What was this introduction? Shouldn\u2019t they be introducing him to Xie Xi?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to save the little bird\u2019s life. Then he thought about it and realized that this naughty child should suffer a bit. Thus, he gave up.</p><br/><p>He only listened as the teenage Vermilion Bird spoke with enthusiasm. \u201cThis is my sweetheart. I\u2019m ready to marry him in a few days. Oh yes\u2026\u201d He glanced at Xie Xi and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wanting to marry someone without even knowing their name? Little chicken, were you crazy or stupid?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to talk. White Tiger instantly blew up and picked up Vermilion Bird by the clothes. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird was startled by him and glanced at Azure Dragon to ask for help. However, Azure Dragon\u2019s demeanour was scarier than White Tiger. His indigo eyes were ice cold.</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird was worthy of being X\u2019s soul and couldn\u2019t be scared to death. He raised his head and declared, \u201cHe is my sweetheart. I proposed to him and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger unceremoniously punched his lower abdomen.</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird caught on fire. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger had a temper and dared to beat anyone apart from Xie Xi. \u201cI\u2019m beating you up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird wasn\u2019t still. After taking the punch, he opened the distance and raised a fighting posture.</p><br/><p>White Tiger had high fighting power and a lot of experience. He wasn\u2019t afraid of this chicken with no hair.</p><br/><p>The tiger and bird smashed together in a ball and Xie Xi started his daily appreciation of Old Jiang hitting himself.</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird was beaten up by White Tiger and after his defeat, he started to ask for help. \u201cAzure Dragon, you are just watching him bully me! Are you my brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon\u2019s lips slightly curved. \u201cI\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird was happy at the thought of being rescued. Unexpected, Azure Dragon came up to him and punched him.</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird, \u201c???\u201d He was really at a loss. If he was a child, he would be overwhelmed.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon did help but it wasn\u2019t helping Vermilion Bird. Instead, he helped White Tiger clean up the small and broken bird.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt it was almost too much and was about to stop them when there was a yell in the distance. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing and Nine Tails had come back. Houqing was worthy of being the boss. The moment he frowned and spoke in a reprimanding voice, Azure Dragon and White Tiger stopped.</p><br/><p>The poor beaten up Vermilion Bird was lying on the ground.</p><br/><p>White Tiger was still angry. He thought about what this bastard said and wanted to kill the bird! Azure Dragon also looked sullen. His fire had been suppressed but he was in the mood for roast chicken.</p><br/><p>Houqing came over and examined Xie Xi first. After seeing that Xie Xi was fine, he asked Azure Dragon and White Tiger, \u201cWhat happened? You\u2019re not children anymore and shouldn\u2019t mess around.\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger turned his head and snorted. Azure Dragon glared at Vermilion Bird.</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird was wronged and quickly complained to his big brother. \u201cThey inexplicably hit me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing knew White Tiger\u2019s temper and glanced at Azure Dragon instead. Azure Dragon glanced at Vermilion Bird and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird mentioned it himself. \u201cI introduced my sweetheart to them and they started to hit me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought\u2026 \u2018Little bird, I\u2019m afraid you will be hit again by your brothers.\u2019</p><br/><p>Houqing frowned slightly and asked, \u201cWhat sweetheart?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young and eager Vermilion Bird wasn\u2019t afraid of White Tiger and introduced Xie Xi as his future husband.</p><br/><p>In an instant, the entire sea of flowers solidified. The swaying petals and blowing breeze all stopped!</p><br/><p>Houqing\u2019s voice was as cold as the abyss of hell. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird repeated it. \u201cI want to marry him. None of you can stop me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails shouted, \u201cI should\u2019ve eaten you that year!\u201d</p><br/><p>They hadn\u2019t played against), each other in the past few years. One loved poultry and the other was poultry (not). It would be strange if they could get along with each other.</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird ignored up and stood up for Xie Xi. \u201cI will\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing interrupted him. \u201cDo you know who he is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who he is, I will\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger growled, \u201cHe is the flower god!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment these words were spoken, everyone stared at Vermilion Bird. If it wasn\u2019t for the more than 10 years of sentiment, they would tear him to pieces and use him as fertilizer!</p><br/><p>He dared to insult the flower god. Dying once wasn\u2019t enough!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very sorry that the good show was over.</p><br/><p>Who would expect that Vermilion Bird wouldn\u2019t act according to common sense? Once he knew Xie Xi\u2019s identity, he was only surprised for a moment before acting tough. \u201cWhat about it? He is the flower god but I still want to marry him. I just like him and my life partner can only be him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Xie Xi was stunned by this.</p><br/><p>The 15 or 16 year old teenager had a childish voice but his words were touching.</p><br/><p>It was a rough straightforwardness but it was also sincere and heartwarming. Liking a person was an extremely complicated and simple thing.</p><br/><p>It could be complicated because of a trepidation to move forward or it could be simple as having infinite courage just because they liked someone.</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird\u2019s bold declaration was a boulder that smashed into the hearts of the other four, evoking the feelings that they desperately hid and blocked.</p><br/><p>What type of feelings did they have for Xie Xi? It was no different from Vermilion Bird.</p><br/><p>It was just because of the aura of the flower god and the identity of their adopter\u2026 these tedious and mundane things made them suppress it.</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird\u2019s nonsense awakened the flames in their hearts, letting long-rooted emotions grow wildly and become a tree that supported their souls.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart thumped and he had a bad feeling.</p><br/><p>Outside of the god\u2019s wisdom, he was pedalling on five boats. Please let go of this dying man inside the god\u2019s wisdom!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told them, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, he is still young.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t care who you are. I like you and will marry you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyebrows gathered together. \u201cYou are only 15 or 16 years old? What do you know about liking someone. Think about these issues when you grow up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cThen will you marry me when I\u2019m an adult?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d This bird, if he continued then he really would be killed by his brothers!</p><br/><p>Houqing made a rough transition. \u201cWe are all together and the table is set up. Let\u2019s go eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded.</p><br/><p>The five people all shared the same mood. The flower god\u2026 couldn\u2019t be taken away by anyone.</p><br/><p>There were no disputes over the seating. Xie Xi had the first seat, Houqing was on his left and White Tiger on his right, then they were arranged according to age.</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird was the youngest and was furthest away from Xie Xi. He was very unhappy but he couldn\u2019t do anything lest he be turned into firewood.</p><br/><p>A good party became a wake-up meeting. The souls were obsessed and Xie Xi could easily guess what they were thinking about.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s hands itched and he wanted to smash the small bird. It was this little bastard who disturbed the \u2018spring water\u2019 of the four lakes!</p><br/><p>From this day on, Xie Xi\u2019s days started to heat up. The brothers who were supposed to get along with each other wanted to get rid of each other to be alone with Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Early in the morning, Xie Xi had just gotten up Azure Dragon arrived and told Houqing, \u201cSomething is going on in the Demon Sea. Shouldn\u2019t you go and see?\u201d Since discovering that the Holy Mountain and Demon Sea were created by Xie Xi, they started to guard it.</p><br/><p>Houqing and Nine Tails were responsible for the Demon Sea and White Tiger and Azure Dragon were responsible for the Holy Mountain. Vermilion Bird wasn\u2019t in harmony with Nine Tails so he was inclined to run to the Holy Mountain.</p><br/><p>At this time, Houqing didn\u2019t think too much and thought something really happened to the Demon Sea. Thus, he left after saying goodbye to Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon had just sat down and the jade dew hadn\u2019t been poured yet when Nine Tails entered. \u201cYou have to quickly go to the Holy Mountain. White Tiger has lost his temper again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon had used this trick to send people away and hesitated.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails added, \u201cWhite Tiger is really angry. The black teeth monsters on the Holy Mountain have already been wiped out by him. How can ordinary beasts stand it?\u201d</p><br/><p>His words were reasonable and Azure Dragon had to put down the jade dew and tell Xie Xi, \u201cI will go and see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded.</p><br/><p>After a while\u2026 White Tiger who supposedly lost his temper on the Holy Mountain appeared. The panicked Nine Tails was quickly exposed. Xie Xi glanced at him and wanted to ask\u2026</p><br/><p>Nine Tails apologized. \u201cI made a mistake. I will go and call Azure Dragon back.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a smug smile on White Tiger\u2019s face. Xie Xi understood and knew that White Tiger must\u2019ve been hiding outside since the morning, waiting for Nine Tails to send Azure Dragon away before coming in to break down Nine Tails\u2019 lie.</p><br/><p>They acted out such a scheming play that the emperor expressed his desire to dissolve the harem!</p><br/><p>For half a year, Xie Xi lived leisurely. Unlike the fighting in the Ming Dynasty, these five only acted in the dark. They were afraid to let Xie Xi know their feelings and could only secretly act. You calculate me, I calculate you, no one dared to overturn the table.</p><br/><p>Oh, except for Vermilion Bird\u2026 Vermilion Bird shouted every day that he would marry Xie Xi when he grew up.</p><br/><p>At first, the other four were nervous. Once they saw Xie Xi\u2019s calm face and his indication that he didn\u2019t take the child seriously, they felt relieved and thought Vermilion Bird was too childish. He wasn\u2019t competition and the other three were more difficult.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi lazily accompanied them for more than three years until Vermilion Bird came of age.</p><br/><p>Once Xie Xi wrote down the names of these five people, his mood was very complicated.</p><br/><p>Who would\u2019ve thought? The disappearance of the flower god was to escape marriage!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After all, this was the boss and they had to hold it in.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to curse at him because X really had too many skills.</p><br/><p>This time Jiang Xie didn\u2019t say anything bad. He was stating facts but not everyone believed it!</p><br/><p>There was also a countdown for the skill selection. Jiang Xie stared at the goodwill skill before eventually giving it up.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t use this because it was too hard to explain. What if later the child asked him, \u201cWhat skill did you open?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cI can see how much you like me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The child, \u201cOh, you can see how much I like you!</p><br/><p>The hard work to increase it to 365 would return to minus on one second.</p><br/><p>Um\u2026 Jiang Xie thought calmly, \u2018A mature man doesn\u2019t need to see goodwill.\u2019 Thus, he changed it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi curiously asked him, \u201cWhat did you choose?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t reply and reached out to grab the air.</p><br/><p>His fingers were straight and slender and his hands were good-looking. The movements were handsome enough. The group had seen his strength and wanted to know what type of heaven defying skill he had chosen. In particular, the four people had stars in their eyes.</p><br/><p>The next moment, Jiang Xie spread open his hand and a white rose appeared out of thin air.</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was actually quite calm. Jiang Xie handed the rose to him. \u201cThis skill can turn any object and even the air into a rose. However, it only lasts for one minute.\u201d</p><br/><p>The disabled group of four screamed in their hearts, \u2018You took so long to pick yet you chose such a trash skill!\u2019</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked Xie Xi, \u201cIs it good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had no expression on his face while he inwardly wanted to beat up his master!</p><br/><p>It was lucky that Old Jiang hadn\u2019t chosen the goodwill skill or he would\u2019ve seen a red wave fill his view.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>He drew a circle in the air and countless white roses burst out, falling to the ground like rain. This empty room was instantly covered with roses. The glittering treasure chest was a backdrop and made it look as dreamy as a fairy tale.</p><br/><p>Zhu Li, Cao Yan and Zhuo Liu were shocked by the fancy show of love and silently walked away.</p><br/><p>The only one different was Zhuang Yi who turned into a beautiful woman. He held his face and cried out, \u201cAh, so romantic!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even have the strength to vomit. He couldn\u2019t beat them so what could he do? He could only turn around and walk away.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie immediately followed and whispered an explanation, \u201cI might have a lot of skills but many of them are trash. This one is useful.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, Xie Xi didn\u2019t care what skill Jiang Xie chose. His appearance in this open world was already the biggest bug. Still, the skill of changing to rose flowers was\u2026 really\u2026 really hard to say!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke again, \u201cThere are many zombies here and you feel disgusted when you see them. I can turn them all into roses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can even use it when you gave people arms and legs. This skill just blinds the eye. The nature of the item remains the same and it will change back after one minute.\u201d</p><br/><p>The nauseous feeling in Xie Xi\u2019s stomach turned to warmth at Jiang Xie\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>His chest seemed to have never been so warm and even his voice changed. \u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t feel disgusted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled, \u201cYou just don\u2019t like to look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This throat seemed blocked and he didn\u2019t know what to say. Jiang Xie reached out again and a pale blue rose appeared in his hand.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at it and took it with trembling fingers. He carefully looked at the beautiful flower and asked softly, \u201cWhy do you like roses?\u201d His garden was also full of this flower.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I just feel comfortable when I see them. It seems that a long time ago, I was in a place full of roses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him. \u201cYour garden?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie cocked his head. \u201cThe garden in Central is a reflection of my spirit. It isn\u2019t real.\u201d Thus, the roses would wither when he was injured.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at the rose for a while before whispering, \u201cVery good.\u201d</p><br/><p>This voice was too low but Jiang Xie heard it. He deliberately asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d A god level player was pretending to be deaf.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s ears were red as he cried out, \u201cNothing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie pretended to be deaf. \u201cThe rooster was too loud before and I have some tinnitus. My hearing might not be as good as before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really believed it and stared at his ears. \u201cIs it serious?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is okay as long as you speak louder.\u201d</p><br/><p>Did he really not hear it? Xie Xi felt uncertain.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spared no effort to gain some sugar. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sighed. \u201cFine, if you don\u2019t want to say it then forget it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi still wanted him to hear it. He paused before raising the volume slightly. \u201cI said\u2026 it looks good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie pushed him. \u201cWhat looks good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe rose\u2026\u201d Xie Xi\u2019s voice was low before he remembered Jiang Xie\u2019s hearing loss and raised the volume. \u201cThe roses look good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was very happy to hear it again. \u201cI thought you meant that I look good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had never seen such a brazen man!</p><br/><p>Speaking of which, they came out of the project. The chicken mobilization and I love you VS shameless games were very different. It was hard to say which one was stronger.</p><br/><p>Those with high strength felt more inclined towards the chicken mobilization while those with ordinary strength might say I love you VS shameless. After all, the latter didn\u2019t definitely mean death while the former was really deadly. All the group members were good and received the last treasure chest.</p><br/><p>The disabled four person team started their exaggerated performance as soon as they came out.</p><br/><p>Cao Yan was most like a busker. He strode steadily forward and yelled into the air, \u201cHah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shocked by him.</p><br/><p>There was a loud roar and flames spurted from Cao Yans mouth. The lethality was unknown but the effect was really big!</p><br/><p>His actions caused everyone to look over. Their eyes widened at the fire and some people gave a low cry, \u201cThis is the privilege from opening the game!\u201d</p><br/><p>The second one to appear was Zhu Li. He picked up a stone, threw it and exploded it like a small bomb. This skill was more than the fire breathing technique!</p><br/><p>The onlookers were stunned. \u201cDid the two of them open the game?\u201d</p><br/><p>Surely the privilege didn\u2019t look like this? It wasn\u2019t very good and was shabby!</p><br/><p>At this time, Zhuo Liu launched his floating skill. He flew too low so it couldn\u2019t be clearly seen.</p><br/><p>Cao Yan was forced to explain for him. \u201cBrother, this floating is very good. It will be useful for a cliff without a bridge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Liu fell down and gasped. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t go if the cliff is more than one metre away.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was easy to jump towards a cliff one metre away. What was this floating technique?</p><br/><p>Zhuang Yi was also ready and his visual impact was the biggest. After all, a man becoming a beautiful woman who was sexy and charming was too eye-catching.</p><br/><p>Zhu Li also came to help him. \u201cBrother, you\u2026 this\u2026\u201d He thought for a long time before finally saying, \u201cYour chest is really big!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuang Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He raised his high heels and kicked Zhu Li in the butt.</p><br/><p>\u201cStinky rascal!\u201d The appearance was a beautiful woman but it was still Zhuang Yi\u2019s rough male voice!</p><br/><p>Their performance shocked the people around them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why do all four people have privileges?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is impossible. The announcement said that only two people have a privilege.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are silly. How could the privilege be such low level skills?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the world has disabled skills. How can they\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone reacted with shock. \u201cIs it from opening the treasure chest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god, impossible! There was such a thing in the treasure chest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only obtained a pistol.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe had all our injuries healed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe only got one meat bun\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This man succeeded in gaining everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cAn ordinary meat bun?\u201d</p><br/><p>The person took out the steamed bun and took a bit before saying with no expression, \u201cThe taste isn\u2019t as good as ordinary meat buns. I always feel there is a zombie flavour.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone instantly balanced their hearts. This unlucky person was too miserable!</p><br/><p>The disabled group of four didn\u2019t have to expose their skills. They did it all for Xie Xi. Xie Xi\u2019s heart was hot as he whispered, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>They replied softly, \u201cBoss, what are you talking about? We would be dead if it wasn\u2019t for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled and didn\u2019t say anything more. The purpose of his rescue wasn\u2019t so noble. It was more for him to clear the game. Still, he felt comfortable that he could save four people.</p><br/><p>At this time, Xie Xi hadn\u2019t made progress on his follow-up side task.</p><br/><p>(10). Repair 100 people.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shared the new side task with Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie whispered in his ear, \u201cIt is fortunate that you were the one to open the treasure chest.\u201d</p><br/><p>If they hadn\u2019t managed to open one skill from the treasure chest, Xie Xi\u2019s side task would be really bad. Repairing 100 people wasn\u2019t difficult but so many people meant it was hard to make sure there wasn\u2019t anyone as greedy and ruthless as Yun Die. Saving people would become a shackle.</p><br/><p>Now he wasn\u2019t afraid. The four people had put on a show and they came out together. Everyone would think that this Repair skill came from the treasure chest.</p><br/><p>As long as there was the premise that killing wouldn\u2019t give the skill, no one would hurt Xie Xi. Such a unique nanny, who would be stupid enough to break their own survival path?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cWait for me.\u201d He had a strong nose and could smell everything, including corpses.</p><br/><p>After a while, Jiang Xie came back with a bouquet of roses. Xie Xi knew what it was and the corners of his lips raised. \u201cI\u2019m not that delicate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cIf I have the skill, why not use it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes curved. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no need to say thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart had just warmed when Jiang Xie deducted points from himself. \u201cYou can just kiss me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s smile froze. Then he took the white roses and went to repair people. There were many who were disabled from the chicken mobilization game. After all, it was a game that required fighting the whole time.</p><br/><p>They were wary of Xie Xi but became stunned once Xie Xi explained his intentions. They had seen the performance of Zhu Li\u2019s group but they couldn\u2019t fathom growing back arms and legs.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gave a bit of an explanation and they couldn\u2019t help becoming excited. \u201cThank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head and replied, \u201cNo need.\u201d He was just clearing his task and didn\u2019t need their gratitude.</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t many people missing a limb and he only repaired 12 people.</p><br/><p>Zhu Li was moved. \u201cBoss is such a good person!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cao Yan cried out, \u201cNo wonder why your luck is so good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Liu added, \u201cA living good deeds!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuang Yi\u2019s angle was more unique. \u201cThe people are so beautiful\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The people who were repaired were about to go down on their knees and shout. If they really lost their arms or legs, they would\u2019ve had to find a master to fix them.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi still had 88 people remaining for his task. He wanted to cut off their arms and replace it with a fresh one\u2026</p><br/><p>Cough, he was just thinking.</p><br/><p>There was no one else to fix here but there was no need to worry. After passing the third project, they would enter the underground labyrinth. The number of people with missing limbs would definitely be much higher and he could casually do his task.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of four were very sad about being separated. \u201cBoss\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told them, \u201cClear the last project and we\u2019ll see each other in the underground labyrinth.\u201d</p><br/><p>This made the four people cheer up. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll see you in the underground labyrinth!\u201d</p><br/><p>They went to draw the last project and Jiang Xie honestly said, \u201cYou do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also didn\u2019t dare use him and drew a card. The name of the project still wasn\u2019t an ordinary game.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi muttered, \u201cDreams come true?\u201d</p><br/><p>What type of game was this?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie came over to look. \u201cIt sounds very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then the zombie teenager in charge of the cards declared, \u201cThis is a two person project. The team is allowed and you are about to enter the game.\u201d</p><br/><p>A two person project?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was a bit nervous and glanced at Jiang Xie. \u201cWill it be a fighting match?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie reassured him, \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. We have the privilege.\u201d</p><br/><p>The real privilege for opening the game field was a one-time immunity to fatal injuries. In other words, they both had one extra life. It didn\u2019t matter if this was fighting game since Jiang Xie could directly give Xie Xi a life.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cYes, if it is combat then kill me and I will clear another project.\u201d Jiang Xie was stunned before his lips curved. \u201cImpossible, you can only kill me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi disagreed. \u201cYou have bad luck. If I leave you, what if you draw the hardest game?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart softened. \u201cBefore I met you, the hardest option would appear every time I had to draw something.\u201d It was still like this.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was pained and he didn\u2019t dare think about what this person had experienced\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cWe are thinking too much. I don\u2019t think the game you drew will be so bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was still worried. After all, the first two games weren\u2019t good.</p><br/><p>The transfer began and they entered the game. An announcement was heard. \u201cThe game is about to begin. Please enter the sleeping cabin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw two sleeping cabins that were placed next to each other.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie opened his mouth, \u201cIt is unreasonable. Shouldn\u2019t we be lying on beds if we are sleeping?\u201d</p><br/><p>A double bed would be good.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He got into the sleeping cabin first.</p><br/><p>The hatch closed and the game started. Xie Xi felt a thick drowsiness overcome him.</p><br/><p>Dreams come true\u2026</p><br/><p>Was this making him dream? If it was his dream, why was it a two person project?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi closed his eyes and fell into a deep dream. He was stunned when he opened his eyes again.</p><br/><p>He sat in a spacious classroom and his head was a mess. He always felt that something was wrong but he couldn\u2019t figure it out. He was in his university classroom? But he wasn\u2019t\u2026</p><br/><p>What happened to him? There didn\u2019t seem to be anything wrong.</p><br/><p>Yes, he managed to save enough tuition and entered his favourite course. He had been enrolled for half a year. What could be wrong?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pressed a hand to his temple and calmed down. Then the bell rang and the class became agitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that the new teacher is too handsome!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe got the title of professor at such a young age. Really amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the title of professor? The research projects he presided over can change the world!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he really handsome? Really handsome?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know when you see him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was speechless. He pushed up his glasses and looked down at the textbook.</p><br/><p>Then the door opened and someone came in. The noisy classroom became quiet, so quiet that a needle could be heard falling.</p><br/><p>What happened?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up curiously\u2026</p><br/><p>A young man was standing at the podium. He wore a dark grey shirt, his cuffs were raised to his elbows and the hands on the podium were slender and powerful. His low voice rang through the quiet classroom like a cello solo at a concert.</p><br/><p>\u201cStudents, I am your Professional Software Technology teacher this semester, Jiang Xie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up into a pair of different coloured eyes.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

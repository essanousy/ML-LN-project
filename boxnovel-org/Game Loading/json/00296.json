If Jiang Xie dares to split his soul again, I will\u2026 just\u2026 kill him!\u2019</p><br/><p>Aquarius and Pisces were gone and only Capricorn was left.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi raised his spirits and continued, \u201cYou also go\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Capricorn immediately suggested, \u201cThey are gone so let me stay. How can I leave you alone in this filthy place?\u201d</p><br/><p>How was Xie Xi alone? Jiang Xie\u2019s good brothers were all here!</p><br/><p>Of course, his good brothers couldn\u2019t take a nope and their eyes and ears were too lively!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi squeezed out an excuse. \u201cI am hungry and you should go prepare dinner first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Capricorn hesitated.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gritted his teeth. \u201cOnly the dinner you prepare is the best. I don\u2019t like anyone else\u2019s cooking.\u201d</p><br/><p>They only needed to look into Capricorn\u2019s eyes to see the effectiveness.</p><br/><p>He leaned over, the chain of his monocle flowing down as he obediently replied, \u201cServing you is my great honour.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cGo, I am looking forward to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, Capricorn was coaxed away.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned around and saw Gong Rui with the corners of his mouth raised while Zong Xia still had some calmness. General Qin, who always felt powerful, had a mouth wide enough to shove an egg into and Yan Zhe\u2019s grey eyes were full of distress.</p><br/><p>It was current silent but sometimes expressions could convey the meaning richer than language!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi broke the silence. \u201cMr Zong and General Qin aren\u2019t injured?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ge immediately replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was Captain so\u2026\u201d He hurt Aquarius.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t remember Central and would\u2019ve certainly pushed you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was more concerned about Qin Ge\u2019s injuries. The souls might be limited by the quasi-worlds and didn\u2019t have Jiang Xie\u2019s peak power but they still couldn\u2019t be underestimated.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe reassured him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will heal them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Light surrounded his hands as he placed them on Qin Ge\u2019s lower abdomen.</p><br/><p>He was indeed injured or he wouldn\u2019t have been captured.</p><br/><p>Fortunately,there was Yan Zhe who could revive a person from the brink of death, let alone a small injury like this.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at Zong Xia.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, it was just the last illusion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pieces used illusion magic while Zong Xia\u2019s god viewer occupation was special but it was inferior compared to Yan Zhe and Xie Xi\u2019s special occupations. At most, it was a sub-god level.</p><br/><p>At first, the illusions were easily seen through. As Pisces continued the chase, Zong Xia was exhausted and captured.</p><br/><p>Pisces consumed mental energy and Zong Xia was the same. Both of them were physically unharmed and mentally exhausted.</p><br/><p>In this respect, Yan Zhe couldn\u2019t help. Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t too dangerous and only rest was needed.</p><br/><p>After this interruption, the previous awkward atmosphere finally dissipated.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked them, \u201cCan you contact N?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill he give up the task?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the main point.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe would surely give up the erasure task. The main reason they came here was for Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>The worlds were erased meant the souls would die. Once a soul died, it meant that Jiang Xie was dying.</p><br/><p>How could they ignore it when Jiang Xie was in such a dangerous situation?</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t think about it after receiving an invitation from N and instantly entered.</p><br/><p>However, N wasn\u2019t them. The master of Yunge was at odds with Jiang Xie and why would he give up a task for Jiang Xie?</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe answered, \u201cOld N is a person I never understood very well. It is said he is ambitious and Yunge is truly huge. It is the \u2018empire\u2019 of Central but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He paused and Zong Xia continued for him. \u201cYunge is chaotic internally. He built such an organization yet he didn\u2019t bother to manage it. The players are a mess and can do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t have a good impression of Yunge. As early as the open world, he met the members of Yunge and saw that the big organization had no discipline to speak of.</p><br/><p>Because of that, he had a bad impression of N.</p><br/><p>However, Jiang Xie\u2019s evaluation of N was quite objective. There wasn\u2019t hatred or friendship, there was just a feeling of two people who didn\u2019t need to walk together.</p><br/><p>Nan Yi added, \u201cHe is very strange. Don\u2019t look at his big organization. He is more of a loner than anyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ge nodded. \u201cThat is true.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two most powerful people in Central were X and N.</p><br/><p>X had no organization and was a single person. N was in Yunge and was surrounded by countless members, but he seemed to be on an island.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had a few friends he had a good relationship with. They had never heard of anyone who had a good relationship with N. The elders of Yunge couldn\u2019t even add him as a friend.</p><br/><p>His only interest was in designing quasi-worlds.</p><br/><p>It was unfortunate\u2026</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe sighed. \u201cOld N designed a total of three quasi-worlds and the only one that succeeded was F-grade.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was silent.</p><br/><p>If he remembered correctly, his second quasi-world was made by a small organization.</p><br/><p>That was still a D-rating. The master of Yunge worked hard to create a world and it was only F-grade?</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe kept talking. \u201cYunge designed many high level quasi-worlds but Old N never teamed up with people and had to design it himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Knowing that he had no talent for this type of thing was simply killing him from anger.</p><br/><p>N worked so hard yet his only success was F-grade.</p><br/><p>For the quasi-worlds that Jiang Xie designed, the lower rating was A and he even created the miracle SS-grade.</p><br/><p>No wonder N kept wanting to beat Jiang Xie on the training field.</p><br/><p>This was really hateful!</p><br/><p>The even more irritating thing was that Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t merciful and he never lost.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt a bit of pity for the master.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe suggested, \u201cI think it is better not to tell him about Jiang Xie\u2019s situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked the question because he wanted to know this answer.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi naturally trusted them but he couldn\u2019t trust N who was a stranger.</p><br/><p>N could retreat but Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>if the quasi-world was erased then Jiang Xie would die.</p><br/><p>What type of mentality did N have towards Jiang Xie? It was really hard to say.</p><br/><p>Maybe he cared about the Central Government and didn\u2019t want the best designer to die. Maybe he long felt resentful of Jiang Xie and wanted to kill him.</p><br/><p>Who knew? There was no knowing what was in a man\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t take the risk with Jiang Xie. \u201cThen I\u2019ll ask you to keep it a secret.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe nodded. \u201cYou can rest assured that we won\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi was still impulsive. \u201cIf Old N tries anything then I will kill him first!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Rui sneered. \u201cI\u2019ll give you the energy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can do more than you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Rui didn\u2019t bother playing with him and lay lazily against the wall, like a soft body with no bones\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zong Xia spoke up. \u201cDon\u2019t act rashly. We have to fix the world before N acts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Xie Xi took out the souls, the necessity of erasing the world wouldn\u2019t exist and there wouldn\u2019t be the task.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought this way too but\u2026</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe was worried. \u201cIt is really necessary to fall in love with six Old Jiangs at the same time?\u201d He accentuated the words \u2018at the same time.\u2019</p><br/><p>Thanks to the world of Cancer, Xie Xi was very friendly to Yan Zhe and couldn\u2019t help looking at him with a bit of helplessness.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe had seen him as part of them and never an outsider since early on and said, \u201cThat old animal has broken his legs. The six together\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe point is\u2026\u201d Gong Rui\u2019s spirit was raised again. \u201cThe six Old Jiangs don\u2019t know that they are the same people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zong Xia added, \u201cBased on the Captain\u2019s character, he definitely won\u2019t share his lover.\u201d</p><br/><p>General Qin finally kept up with the rhythm and nodded. \u201cLove is a matter of two people.\u201d</p><br/><p>It really was a matter of two people but what if one of them had multiple bodies?</p><br/><p>How was this good?</p><br/><p>The group of five people eating melons were still a bit worried.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his mouth. \u201cThis isn\u2019t difficult\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this? Atlantis was the real death mode.</p><br/><p>The current situation\u2026</p><br/><p>The five people gazed at Xie Xi, their gazes so complicated that each person needed 800 words of time to elaborate!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi cleared his throat. \u201cIt will be more secure if you can help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Rui sat straight up. \u201cThere is no need to persuade me. I won\u2019t refuse even if it means walking on a mountain of blades or through a sea of fire!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi looked like he had seen a ghost. \u201cAre you crazy or am I deaf?\u201d</p><br/><p>The slacker was so diligent? The sky was going to change colour and the ground was going to collapse!</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe stared at Nan Yi. \u201cDon\u2019t interrupt and talk about business!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt that something wasn\u2019t quite right.</p><br/><p>Seeing the five people staring at him with focused expressions and serious eyes, Xie Xi couldn\u2019t open his mouth\u2026</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>In order to be absolutely safe, Xie Xi could only temporarily lose his dignity.</p><br/><p>After all, there was the unknown variable N outside and Xie Xi didn\u2019t want any accidents. The faster he could repair the world the better.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Xie Xi suggested. \u201cI will accept you as my believers. I might have to temporarily wrong you and give you to the five star signs as personal servants\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Apart from General Qin, the others secretly thought in their heart, \u2018There are no grievances, no grievances at all.\u2019 How could they be wronged by such an opportunity?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi continued, \u201cI have a miniature communicator here. All of you wear them and monitor their movements. Try to separate them.\u2019</p><br/><p>The five people understood and put the communication device from Xie Xi into their ears.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know that Xie Xi couldn\u2019t use items and just thought he was prepared before entering the quasi-world.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked some more questions and finally arranged them to their corresponding star sign.</p><br/><p>Qin Ge was with Capricorn, Yan Zhe chose Scorpio, Zong Xia had Sagittarius, Gong Rui and Nan Yi were Aquarius and Pisces.</p><br/><p>Libra alone didn\u2019t have a watcher.</p><br/><p>This was also Xie Xi\u2019s intention. This was the first time Libra came here and didn\u2019t need to be watched too much. Xie Xi alone understanding him should be enough.</p><br/><p>This was arranged properly and the rest was Xie Xi\u2019s family members.</p><br/><p>At dinner, everyone gathered at the dining room apart from Libra.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sat in the main seat and his eyes swept over the five people. He smiled approvingly at Capricorn before speaking, \u201cThe intruders have already become subservient to me and they will be your personal servants in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>The five men were stunned the moment the words emerged.</p><br/><p>Sagittarius spoke immediately. \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone to serve me.\u201d His dark red eyes stared at Xie Xi, only seeing Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Scorpio got up and bowed gracefully. \u201cI am your most loyal servant. How can a servant have a servant?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke simply. \u201cThis is an order.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment his words emerged, all five star signs stood up and placed their left hands over their chest, replying in unison, \u201cThank you, my god.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thankfully the male gods were absent or they would be laughing.</p><br/><p>Old Jiang!</p><br/><p>His wife was strict!</p><br/><p>A real hammer!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke again, \u201cYou are my most important star signs. I hope you can get better and better.\u201d</p><br/><p>This way, he could stabilize the five people. There was no one else for them apart from Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>The star signs thanked him piously.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi added a patch to make everything logical. \u201cThe five people have already become my followers but I suspect they still have foreign aid. I will arrange them around you and I hope you can monitor them closely. Remember, don\u2019t separate from them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi signed with relief. Thus, it was arranged for the five seniors to keep an eye on the five Jiang Xies.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe, who just came out of the dungeon, wasn\u2019t psychologically prepared and met such a stimulating scene.</p><br/><p>He just heard the dark elf say, \u201cYou said you would go to me later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pisces opened his mouth. \u201cYour wound has already recovered. Why do you want to bother Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>The dark elf raised his head dangerously and stared at the sea demon. \u201cHow do you know my wound is recovered?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are so proud that a human can injure you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The dark elf replied sarcastically, \u201cA human can escape your illusions. A sea demon is just like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe, Gong Rui, Nan Yi, Zong Xia and Qin Ge, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the area channel, Nan Yi yelled, \u201cWhy do I feel that they are going to fight?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sharp Gong Rui asked, \u201cIs this the legendary fight yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zong Xia calmly summed out, \u201cNo, this is tearing themselves up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe was silent for a while before coming up with the sentence. \u201cOnly Old Jiang can do this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know about their conversation. He needed to deal with these two \u2018dancing on the edge of a knife\u2019 as well as the quiet Scorpio standing silently to the side.</p><br/><p>The surface was coaxed well but he needed to be extra careful of the ink in their stomachs!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

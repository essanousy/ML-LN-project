The strength in his body was something he had never experienced before. It was no wonder that succubi loved this type of thing. There was truly a satisfying feeling of fullness.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned on his elbow and glanced at Xie Xi. \u201cAre you comfortable?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned, saw the tooth print on the other person\u2019s shoulder and his face heated up. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie squinted. \u201cFine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s face became redder but it was impossible for him to say anything else!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned over, kissed him several times on his red cheeks and said, \u201cDon\u2019t forget the promise you made me.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Xie Xi forget? Those words wandered in his head non-stop like a spell. As long as he remembered them, his heart would thump. He nodded wildly and said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t say anything else and only asked, \u201cDo you have classes during the day? Don\u2019t be late.\u201d</p><br/><p>He understood the physique of a succubus. Ordinary people would probably be tired and paralyzed if they didn\u2019t sleep all night but succubi were the opposite. They would be in good spirits.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t in a hurry. The first class was taught by his professor and once the professor saw the reason Xie Xi was absent, he would probably be ecstatic.</p><br/><p>Still, Xie Xi was embarrassed to say this. he kept feeling strange and said, \u201cThen I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie nodded.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi walked to the door of the bedroom before looking back. \u201cYou\u2026 how can I find you in the future?\u201d In fact, it was okay not to find Jiang Xie but he still wanted to ask. Once the question emerged, his heart thumped like it was jumping out of his chest.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cI\u2019ll find you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi bit his lower lip.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t try to steal food. I can see it.\u201d Then he blinked.</p><br/><p>Yes, this was a big demon of the Sixth Domain with extraordinary power. It would probably be easy for him to find Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw that the succubus was nervous and added, \u201cRest assured, I won\u2019t interfere with your life. I\u2019ll just know where you are when I think of you.\u201d It was just like this time when he blocked the door of the bar before the little succubus could do bad things.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s life was honest and he wasn\u2019t afraid of interference. \u201csuit yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>In any case, his time was free while the big demon must be busy. He would wait for the big demon to find him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was about to go out when Jiang Xie suddenly shouted at him. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned to look at him. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s finger drew something and Xie Xi felt something on his body. He looked down and found that his clothes became a windbreaker that\u2026 wrapped tightly around him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was satisfied. \u201cGo to school.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cIf a succubus dresses like this, I will be laughed at.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t listen.</p><br/><p>By the time the two people finished the problem of the clothes, Xie Xi had completely missed his first class.</p><br/><p>After school in the evening, he went to the professor and the professor made an understanding expression. \u201cThis stinky boy finally figured it out?\u201d Looking at this person\u2019s mental state, it was easy to tell he finally wanted to live!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was ashamed. \u201cSorry for making you worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>The professor sighed. \u201cAt least you passed this hurdle. I almost asked the domain master to find the Demon God to help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The professor laughed. \u201cI\u2019m kidding. It is useless to ask. The Demon God wouldn\u2019t care about a little succubus.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also laughed but his heart was moved. His teacher was really good for him and tried to help him.</p><br/><p>The experience meant Xie Xi wasn\u2019t afraid of the upcoming adulthood ceremony.</p><br/><p>The professor said, \u201cI\u2019ll arrange it for you.\u201d Xie Xi\u2019s life span would be shortened if he didn\u2019t go through the adulthood ceremony.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cIt is hard for Teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are saying this now?\u201d The professor teased. \u201cWho was the one who said it would either be the Demon God or death?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was hitting his face. Xie Xi muttered, \u201cThat was nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>The professor poked him. \u201cI also knew that you were talking nonsense! I don\u2019t want to think about the identity of the Demon God. Even if you go to the Seventh Domain, you might not necessarily be able to see him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The professor spoke a bunch of nonsense mainly to vent his fear.</p><br/><p>This student was too good that he had really felt distressed.</p><br/><p>Now things were cleared up and he should scold Xie Xi as a teacher.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was full of guilt and pricked his ears to listen.</p><br/><p>The adulthood ceremony was held very smoothly and Xie Xi clearly felt the power surging in his body.</p><br/><p>The professor told him, \u201cYou have a good boyfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cWhat does it have to do with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The professor said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t good to just know the theory. You must practice\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After the teacher said this, Xie Xi knew that the succubus ate through sex and really absorbed the power of the partner.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked anxiously, \u201cWill it hurt him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The professor raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou care that much?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head too quickly but he seemed to get a taste of something.</p><br/><p>The professor knew Xie Xi had a soft nature and explained, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it is a matter of mutual benefit. You will gain some strength while his physique will be washed clean. Maybe people want this but can\u2019t ask for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was relieved. If it really was one-sided then the succubi wouldn\u2019t have people constantly approaching them.</p><br/><p>These things weren\u2019t written in the textbooks. As for why they weren\u2019t written, it was probably because all succubi knew it and it wasn\u2019t worth mentioning.</p><br/><p>After all, it was rare for there to be a succubus with no experience at this age.</p><br/><p>The textbooks wouldn\u2019t write down a paragraph specifically for Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>The professor reminded him, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about him but you must be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was curious. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><br/><p>The professor explained, \u201cIf he is too strong then you won\u2019t be able to bear it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be too strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t feel any discomfort but in hindsight, he was really full of strength.</p><br/><p>The professor stated, \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>That night, Jiang Xie came to him.</p><br/><p>They had done it many times before but this was the first time Jiang Xie suddenly appeared in front of him and took him straight away.</p><br/><p>They went to bed without saying any words.</p><br/><p>In any case, this was the best food for a succubus and Xie Xi was happy.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Jiang Xie took the initiative to ask Xie Xi, \u201cWhat are your plans after graduation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi lay on the pillow with a large portion of his back facing the outside. Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t help placing his hand on it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s body quivered but he didn\u2019t look at the other person. \u201cI will apply for the Sixth Domain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s lips curved. \u201cYou will go to find me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cOtherwise?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, my little succubus is a good boy who keeps his promises.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him. \u201cI\u2019m not little and I\u2019m not a child. Don\u2019t use this old-fashioned tone of speech.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was full of smiles. \u201cYes, you\u2019re not little or a child. You just grew up today.\u201d His tone still sounded like he was coaxing a child.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi angrily opened his hand and Jiang Xie leaned back. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m not in the Sixth Domain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat domain are you in?\u201d Speaking of which, he hadn\u2019t asked much about Jiang Xie\u2019s situation.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie answered, \u201cThe Seventh Domain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThe Seventh Domain? Then I\u2026\u201d He scored very well and applying for the Sixth Domain wasn\u2019t a problem, but the Seventh Domain\u2026 there were many rigid standards and he couldn\u2019t pass with just good grades. It also depended on luck.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cIf you apply then you can definitely go.\u201d</p><br/><p>HIs tone was so firm that Xie Xi was curious. \u201cWhat exactly is your identity?\u201d</p><br/><p>After knowing this person for so long, Xie Xi had naturally checked Jiang Xie\u2019s identity. Unfortunately, the name was so strange that no one knew it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suspected Jiang Xie was a domain master but the names of the domain masters were known and there was no one called Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was a pseudonym?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked him, \u201cWho do you think I am?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tried to guess. \u201cA demon general?\u201d It had to be at least this level to stay in the Seventh Domain.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuess again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOne of the domain masters? Who\u2026 the names aren\u2019t right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie looked at him. \u201c\u2019Guess again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t guess. \u201cYou\u2019re not a demon general or a domain master. At your age\u2026 you can\u2019t be a clerk!\u201d</p><br/><p>The really big Jiang Xie was poked. \u201cI\u2019m not much older than you.\u201d He was actually eight thousand years old.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really couldn\u2019t guess. He knew what Jiang Xie was afraid of and lay on Jiang Xie. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi blinked.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie bit Xie Xi on the neck as punishment for his seduction. \u201cThe Demon God.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to be loyal to me? Then stay in the Seventh Domain in the future and be the lust domain master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>This news not only blew up Xie Xi but also blew up the entire Demon World.</p><br/><p>The Demon God was an almost legendary existence. No one had seen him apart from the domain masters butt he rumours were clear. For example, the Demon God was above the seven desires and wouldn\u2019t be trapped by any desires. He was an omnipotent existence supporting the entire Demon World.</p><br/><p>Now the god had a succubus companion.</p><br/><p>It was like blowing up the Demon World.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also took a long time to accept the reality while his professor went crazy. \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026 you really only accepted the Demon God or you would\u2019ve died!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t say anything. How did he know that this bastard man would be the sacred and inviolable Demon God?</p><br/><p>Still, it was the truth.</p><br/><p>Once Jiang Xie\u2019s identity was revealed, the first thing Jiang Xie told Xie Xi was, \u201cShould I remind you? Your promise to me is the same as an oath and you will be punished if you break it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was disillusioned. This was the Demon God he wanted to swear allegiance to?</p><br/><p>Later, Xie became the master of Lust.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t good for him to skip ranks and Jiang Xie took this into account. He beat up the domain masters and demons one by one, making them obedient and thankful to Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was strong and after taking on this burden, he must do everything well. He never let anyone point out any mistakes.</p><br/><p>He worked hard and inevitably neglected Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t feel urgent and watched Xie Xi grow up from the little succubus to a convincing domain master.</p><br/><p>This section was mostly related to the development of the Demon World. Xie Xi didn\u2019t think much about it and moved to the end.</p><br/><p>The contradiction between him and the Demon God slightly increased.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t come out. At first, the domain masters were perfunctory about Xie Xi. After several hundred years, Xie Xi mastered the absolute rights with his own strength.</p><br/><p>The two people had been together for so long but never talked things out.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until Xie Xi visited Heaven and watched a movie that he understood the word love.</p><br/><p>Thanks to this introduction, the seeds buried in his heart burst out.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie tied Xie Xi to him with an oath but Xie Xi found the real tie was his love for Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>The Demon World didn\u2019t care about this. In particular, the demons who majored in lust considered loyalty as a joke.</p><br/><p>Yet Xie Xi, the master of lust, wanted faithful love.</p><br/><p>From this time on, Xie Xi had his own ideas about the development of the Demon World.</p><br/><p>He started to promote integration with Heaven and became more inclined to the social form of Heaven. He strived to change the Demon World\u2026</p><br/><p>Such a big move was bound to cause a reaction.</p><br/><p>The domain masters were convinced by him but these policies, which clearly overturned the traditions of the Demon World, shook them.</p><br/><p>They reported the news to Jiang Xie and told him about Xie Xi\u2019s yearning for Heaven.</p><br/><p>Over the years, Jiang Xie had never interfered with Xie Xi\u2019s decisions but this matter was too much. For the first time, he reprimanded Xie Xi with a serious attitude and stopped these reforms.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had cold water poured on him and his blood was chilled.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie coaxed him, \u201cEverything else is up to you but this nonsense can\u2019t be allowed. The Demon World is the Demon World. It can\u2019t be reduced to a second Heaven.\u201d</p><br/><p>This made Xie Xi wonder, \u201cWhat is so bad about Heaven?\u201d Angels were loyal, chaste, sang about love, advocated spiritual abundance and didn\u2019t indulge in physical desires.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was furious. \u201cDo you think I am talking nonsense? Does the Demon World never need to change? Why can\u2019t we learn from the good things about Heaven? Can the Demon World only be like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s voice was soft. \u201cThe Demon World was created by me and I know what is best for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>A deep sense of powerlessness encased Xie Xi. \u201cI don\u2019t like the Demon World.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s voice became cold. \u201cThen you prefer Heaven?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes narrowed and he asked, \u201cWhat did you encounter when you went to Heaven?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi summoned up the greatest courage of his life and told Jiang Xie in a trembling voice, \u201c\u2026Love.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps it happened from a long time ago but he hadn\u2019t understood until now. The reason why Xie Xi\u2019s heart thumped when Jiang Xie said \u2018You can only belong to me\u2019 was because of love.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

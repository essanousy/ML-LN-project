There was another soul? Wasn\u2019t it only one soul for every small world? How could the Gemini world\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finally reacted. Gemini\u2026 there was the twins part!</p><br/><p>Without thinking, he hadn\u2019t expected there to be another soul so Xie Xi didn\u2019t look at all. He was only concerned about Angel Jiang.</p><br/><p>According to the law, the souls should revolve around him. How long had the other Jiang Xie been secretly watching him and become disheartened enough to give up last night?</p><br/><p>What should he do? Xie Xi had been fed so much sugar in this world that he forgot the days when he danced on the tip of a blade.</p><br/><p>His thoughts were a mess as Jiang Xie pulled him to take refuge in the first auditorium.</p><br/><p>This was the first time that Xie Xi saw elements of magic. The students who arrived were shrouded by huge shields that the teachers supported.</p><br/><p>The teachers usually put their wings away and looked like ordinary people. Now they all showed their demon appearance, huge black wings filled with an unknown power and bringing endless security.</p><br/><p>The students in the auditorium were panicked and couldn\u2019t help whispering.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could there be such a big shock?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard the teacher say that the Demon God has fallen\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Once these words came out, the entire auditorium was silent before someone\u2019s scared voice was heard. \u201cHow is that possible? How could our Demon God\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A wrath demon said, \u201cIt is an angel\u2019s intrigue?\u201d A sloth student blocked his mouth. \u201cYou will die if you speak too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was true that they couldn\u2019t say this. Heaven and the Demon World had been peaceful for many years. If such an idea was born, there would be a big mess.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, rationality prevailed and no one was angry with the angels.</p><br/><p>The sloth demons might have lazy bodies but their minds were clear. One brother said, \u201cThe Demon God has been sleeping for more than 100 years and didn\u2019t the last festival. The domain masters thought he would wake up for this festival. Who knew\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>These things were unknown for Xie Xi. He pricked his ears and listened carefully. After all, it was an important clue.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was 105 years old this year. The Demon God fell asleep over 100 years ago? Did it have something to do with him? Wasn\u2019t he born after the Demon God fell asleep?</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter if the Demon God was sleeping. After all, their lifespan was long and governance of the Demon World had long been assigned to the domain masters. There was no need for him to interfere.</p><br/><p>However, the fall of the Demon God was fatal. He was the pillar of the Demon World. Once he fell, the Demon World would fall apart. The domain masters could temporarily hold it up but this was just a drop of water in the bucket. It wouldn\u2019t last long.</p><br/><p>The discussion of the crowd focused on two points. One was why the Demon God fell. What happened? The other was the fall of the Demon God causing the collapse of the Demon World. What should they do?</p><br/><p>These questions couldn\u2019t be answered by the students taking refuge here.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie held Xie Xi\u2019s hand and told him, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Demon World might be ruined but there was Heaven. He could take Xie Xi out of here.</p><br/><p>Of course, Heaven couldn\u2019t ignore such a big thing as the Demon World collapsing. If the Demon World\u2019s collapse was truly irreparable, they would find ways to accept the demons.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t afraid there was no place for him. He was afraid that something would happen to the souls!</p><br/><p>It could be concluded that the Demon God was definitely Jiang Xie\u2019s soul, otherwise the entire Demon World wouldn\u2019t collapse.</p><br/><p>Did this world really have two souls? He only touched Angel Jiang but ignored Demon God Jiang?</p><br/><p>Who wanted this?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t Demon God Jiang too efficient? He said he would fall and he fell. Couldn\u2019t he leave some room for Xie Xi?</p><br/><p>Wrong\u2026</p><br/><p>The panicked Xie Xi became a bit calmer.</p><br/><p>If the Demon God truly died then the angel in front of him wouldn\u2019t be safe.</p><br/><p>The souls moved the entire body. If one was in an accident then all of them would suffer.</p><br/><p>Thus, there must be a turnaround!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stabilized. The thing he had to think about now was how to calm Angel Jiang while coaxing Demon God Jiang.</p><br/><p>The Demon God was dying and must be double coaxed. Angel Jiang experienced such sweetness for so long that if he saw Xie Xi being good to others, he could really kill himself with jealousy!</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t figured this out yet when someone came to find Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>The sudden arrival of four-winged demons shocked the audience.</p><br/><p>The sloth, envy and greedy demons knelt down and shouted, \u201cI greet the domain masters!\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. Three demon masters had come and one of them headed straight to Xie Xi. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The envy domain master reached out for Xie Xi but Jiang Xie held Xie Xi\u2019s other hand.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi definitely had to go but Angel Jiang\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go together&gt;\u201d The sloth domain master glanced at Jiang Xie, no emotions in his light grey eyes.</p><br/><p>The next moment, Xie Xi found that he and Jiang Xie were in a different place.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t in the crowded first auditorium but a grand hall with a dome.</p><br/><p>The floor of the temple was a smooth black mirror with six pillars on each side. Each pillar had a different pattern and the exquisite carvings were impressive.</p><br/><p>There was an empty throne and the throne\u2019s back was very high. It was as high as the pillars on both sides and had complicated lines on it. It was unknown where the light came from but there was a dark purple halo on the throne.</p><br/><p>Even Xie Xi could understand it. This was the Demon God\u2019s Hall in the Seventh Domain. The throne in the middle was the position of the Demon God while the six pillars represented the six domain masters.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed with relief with he came here. According to this situation, there was still a chance of saving the Demon God.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was sure that he could restore the Demon God as long as there was one breath left!</p><br/><p>It was an emergency and the domain masters didn\u2019t speak nonsense. Greed opened his mouth. \u201cWe will temporarily stabilize the Demon World. You quickly wake up the Demon God!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cHasn\u2019t the Demon God fallen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Greed replied, \u201cHe gave up the position of god. It is the same as falling!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just giving up the position of god, okay\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to continue asking but Jiang Xie took his hand. \u201cIf the domain masters can\u2019t wake up the Demon God then what can Xie Xi do? He is just a student who hasn\u2019t yet graduated.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was cold and a tremendous uneasiness gripped Jiang Xie\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Envy sneered. \u201cA student who hasn\u2019t graduated yet? He was one of the seven favourites of the Demon God 100 years ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could easily accept this type of setting but since Angel Jiang was present, he had to pretend to be panicked.</p><br/><p>Greed opened his mouth. \u201cHe was reincarnated. How can he remember this?\u201d He was obviously referring to Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Envy cried out, \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t reincarnated then the Demon God wouldn\u2019t have fallen asleep!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sloth didn\u2019t like to talk but his words were the most useful. \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense. The urgent task is to save the Demon God.\u201d</p><br/><p>Envy sneered and was silent.</p><br/><p>Greed came forward and told Xie Xi, \u201cYou don\u2019t remember anything but 100 years ago, you were the demon master of lust and the lover of the Demon God. We don\u2019t know what happened between you but as a result, you reincarnated without a word and the Demon God fell asleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew it. How could there be no previous setting? This wasn\u2019t a relationship. It was being engaged in a previous life!</p><br/><p>He saw Jiang Xie\u2019s brain hole and could basically guess more of it. Xie Xi loved this person but he was treated as a tool for a dog blood drama.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was really wronged. Since when did he treat Jiang Xie as a tool for X?</p><br/><p>He wanted to be abstinent day and night! Wait\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought of Angel Jiang beside him and glanced over. Sure enough, this person had thin lips and was pale.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had long been accustomed to this type of scene and didn\u2019t find it strange.</p><br/><p>Greed continued, \u201cOnly you can make the Demon God return.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was really afraid that the Demon God would come back while Angel Jiang would leave!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t release his hand and his voice was low and cold. \u201cSince he is reincarnated, he is no longer the master of the Seventh Domain. What will happen if he goes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Envy said, \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for your existence, would the Demon God become disheartened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had no fear. \u201cI can\u2019t let him go. He is my lover. Another person\u2019s life has nothing to do with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Envy grabbed at Jiang Xie\u2019s collar and scolded him, \u201cIf the Demon God doesn\u2019t exist, the Demon World is finished. Do you believe that I won\u2019t kill you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s face didn\u2019t change colour. \u201cI won\u2019t give Xie Xi to anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Xie Xi saw that Envy really wanted to act and was anxious.</p><br/><p>He knew that the soul couldn\u2019t be a simple student but Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to fight here. No matter who lived or died, it would be a half death and this meant death!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told them, \u201cI\u2019ll go so don\u2019t hurt him.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words could only be described as \u2018wonderful.\u2019</p><br/><p>It meant he would go to wake up the Demon God but it also subtly comforted Angel Jiang. \u2018I\u2019m not going because of the previous life\u2019s melodrama but for Jiang Xie.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was really coaxed. He said, \u201cNo, this is the Demon God\u2019s choice. Xie Xi, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Envy reached for Jiang Xie\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>The \u2018frightened\u2019 Xie Xi cried out, \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 the Demon World is my home. I don\u2019t want to watch it fall!\u201d</p><br/><p>Envy released his hand but Jiang Xie didn\u2019t release his grip on Xie Xi from beginning to end.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cCan you let Jiang Xie go with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Envy questioned, \u201cWhy? Are you afraid that I will kill him if you leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>Envy\u2019s words were delivered quickly and accurately. Xie Xi declared, \u201cI must guarantee his safety or I won\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sloth spoke up, \u201cLet them go together.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a faint trace of mockery in the grey eyes that stared at Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt a bit uneasy but he couldn\u2019t throw away Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Forget the domain masters, even Xie Xi himself wasn\u2019t at ease. The best way to save the gourd was to place the gourd right underneath his eyes!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s previous words barely give Jiang Xie a stimulus. Regardless of what the domain masters said or what happened 100 years ago, at least the current Xie Xi loved him and only him.</p><br/><p>This gave the angel endless comfort and allowed him to stabilize his mind in front of this great change.</p><br/><p>What was the domain master or Demon God\u2019s lover? It was all in the past and Xie Xi had discarded it. He was now with Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>This comfort disappeared instantly after seeing a portrait of the Demon God.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also never imagined that the place to wake up the Demon God would have such a huge portrait.</p><br/><p>The man with six wings coming from his back had a pair of purple eyes. His eyelashes drooped slightly and he looked downwards. His distant line of sight seemed to contain the magic to penetrate into the hearts of people.</p><br/><p>This was only a portrait yet it contained such a majestic pressure. It could be imagined how powerful the real person would be.</p><br/><p>The three domain masters saluted to the portrait.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at it in a dazed manner, senses not returning.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie lost all blood the moment he saw the portrait, all previous comfort disappearing like a ghost.</p><br/><p>The Demon God in the portrait looked exactly the same as him. The only difference was the colour of the eyes.</p><br/><p>Sloth glanced at him and spoke slowly, \u201cIt seems that even after reincarnating, the only one in Lord Lust\u2019s mind is the Demon God.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now Xie Xi understood why Sloth agreed to let Jiang Xie come and the previous mocking in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Xie XI was used to seeing the different \u2018forms\u2019 of Jiang Xie and had forgotten this!</p><br/><p>\u2018It must really be fun. Jiang Xie, how much do you like acting as a substitute? Can\u2019t you change the pattern? Hey, forget it\u2026 you should develop fewer tricks to abuse yourself!\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Why wasn\u2019t Big Jiang sleeping and was instead wandering around blindly?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gasped out of fear. Jiang Xie watched him, facial features hidden by the shadows and his low voice as cold as the frost of early winter. \u201cThat is X\u2019s room.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi lived on the third floor. This was the second floor and each bedroom had a suite. Thus, he couldn\u2019t be going to a toilet outside. The worst thing was that Little Jiang\u2019s room was in the east half while his room was in the west. If he had gotten then not only must he be ignorant (can\u2019t distinguish floors), he must also lose his sense of direction.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was like this but he was still the president. He wouldn\u2019t go under the overpass to beg!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie gazed at him silently. Xie Xi bore the pressure that was like a mountain and opened his mouth. \u201cI am sleepwalking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyebrows drew together.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was silent before opening his mouth with panic. \u201cI mean, the boy sleepwalks and I came to see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie grabbed the main point. \u201cWhat are you nervous about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi calmed down and deliberately approached this person. \u201cThe night is quiet and there is an individual behind me. How can I not be nervous?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough, the pressure eased after he approached. Xie Xi took the initiative to ask, \u201cWhat are you doing here so early?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know that X sleepwalks or do you also sleepwalk?\u201d Xiao Xie had been through countless battles and was fearless!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyelids lowered. \u201cI was passing by.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u2018Surely you weren\u2019t waiting here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Big Jiang raised an eyebrow and his calm demeanour somewhat collapsed. \u201cWhat would I be waiting here to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cYou can rest assured, I\u2019m not so hungry. He is only 15 years old.\u201d</p><br/><p>This wave of anti-killing was perfect!</p><br/><p>It was unknown what Old Jiang\u2019s mood would be like in the face of such a high-ranking king couple. He was really wearing a green hat and knew nothing about it\u2026 right?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie coughed lightly. \u201cI got up early and wanted to go downstairs. I passed by here and saw you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason was far-fetched but also possible.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s principle was to mutually let go and not pursue the other person, so he mentioned the sleepwalking. \u201cI have been sleeping with X and know that he starts sleepwalking around 3 or 4 o\u2019clock. Thus, I decided to take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was sour. \u201cYou really care about him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very rational. \u201cHe collected such important data for the United States and is a rare SSS-grade physique. I should naturally care about him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was silent for a moment before suddenly muttering, \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t an SSS-grade physique\u2026\u201d He hadn\u2019t finished when he smiled bitterly and shook his head. \u201cYou go to sleep and I will go in and see X.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke seriously, \u201cI feel he is a bit hostile to you. You shouldn\u2019t go in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had no intention of leaving.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suggested, \u201cI\u2019ll just push open the door and see if he is sleeping.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a goalkeeper and even if Xie Xi saw the main soul, he couldn\u2019t communicate information with Jiang Xie. He had to simply let it go.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xie Xi understood the meaning of Jiang Xie\u2019s last sentence.</p><br/><p>As long as he was a thorough emotional, Big and Small Jiang wouldn\u2019t ask too much from him.</p><br/><p>The society was like this and inherent thoughts had long been rooted in the sea of the human brain. It was normal for a rational person to not understand love. A person who didn\u2019t even know love lacked understanding of loyalty and fidelity.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi just had to maintain the appearance of a rational and Big Jiang wouldn\u2019t think he loved Little Jiang and Little JIang wouldn\u2019t think he loved Big Jiang.</p><br/><p>To sum it up, the slag didn\u2019t love the two of them but both loved him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed. He felt that once he returned to Central, he could write a book and the title would be called: Slag Man\u2019s 36 Schemes.</p><br/><p>Looking at the world, there probably many people more experienced than him.</p><br/><p>The small episode at four in the morning was completely unknown to Little JIang. He slept very well and when he woke up, he saw that there was no one around him.</p><br/><p>The habit of sleeping alone for more than 10 years was changed in just a short amount of time. People were really elusive</p><br/><p>Little Jiang walked to the dining room and found Xie Xi and the old man talking and laughing. Little Jiang\u2019s expression instantly cooled and his lips thinned.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw him and greeted him, \u201cYou woke up early.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Jiang muffled the words, \u2018Not as early as you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cYou just came back and should take a break for two days. I will go to the institute today to organize the follow up data.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Jiang glanced at Big Jiang.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could read minds and hurriedly added, \u201cMr. Jiang and I together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Jiang pulled out a chair and sat next to Xie Xi. \u201cI don\u2019t need to rest. I brought the data back and can give better feedback.\u201d</p><br/><p>Big Jiang slowly stirred his black tea. \u201cWhy? Are there any errors in the data you brought back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Jiang\u2019s eyes were like ice. \u201cThere are no mistakes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Big JIang\u2019s lips curved. \u201cThen what are you so worried about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Jiang who was really young. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt as though his head would explode. The two people hadn\u2019t eaten yet and they were already going to fight?</p><br/><p>He interrupted. \u201cMr. Jiang means that we have confidence in the data you brought back and you should rest in the presidential palace for two days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Jiang sneered. \u201cI said I\u2019m not tired.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to persuade him when Little Jiang turned his head, \u201cI haven\u2019t reached the age where I would be tired from such a task.\u201d</p><br/><p>Big Jiang\u2019s hand stirring the tea stopped as he was poked in his painful point.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them were too much. One said that oneself was useless and the other said oneself was old. Why were they hating themselves? The \u2018emperor\u2019 Xie Xi could only drink from his cup in a weak manner.</p><br/><p>Later, Xie Xi went to the research institute with the big one. The big one looked exactly the same as the little one, apart from his age and temperament\u2026</p><br/><p>It was fortunate that the administrators were rational or if there was an emotional person present, they would write several books on this inner drama!</p><br/><p>Who is Mr. President\u2019s old and new love? Who is Mr. President\u2019s substitute lover? The big fight between the former and the present\u2026</p><br/><p>Fortunately, they were all rational and the only two emotional people involved were in the \u2018big fight.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi followed for an afternoon and after the results came out, the institute president showed no more excitement or joy. Instead, he was solemn and felt some panic.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew that things wouldn\u2019t be simple.</p><br/><p>How could hiding in the pole prevent the universe from collapsing? Could it save the world? Then he wouldn\u2019t have received this task and the world would\u2019ve long \u2018saved itself.\u2019 The collapsed god was certainly the key.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi ordered, \u201cTell me directly. There are no outsiders here.\u201d There was no need to avoid Big and Little Jiang. Rather, he should let them understand.</p><br/><p>The institute president sighed and tried to report the situation in a scientific tone.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that he couldn\u2019t bear the despair until the end and he broke out in tears. \u201cIs there really a Creator?\u201d</p><br/><p>Based on the data Little Jiang brought back, they calculated it and discovered two things.</p><br/><p>One was that the pole did exist and there was a great possibility that it would survive the collapse of the universe and be reborn into a new world.</p><br/><p>However, the pole was very small, small enough to be the size of a person\u2019s palm. Forget the entire United States, not even one person could enter it.</p><br/><p>Some people said they might be able to retain some genes but this was also impossible. Cells needed an environment to survive and as countless years passed in such a large place, there was no hope at all.</p><br/><p>This was too helpless and it was hard to find any hope. Hope was such a faint light but it made people even more desperate.</p><br/><p>It was no wonder why the institute president would collapse and everyone who heard this news was in a trance.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at the second message. \u201cAsk the Creator for help?\u201d</p><br/><p>The institute president replied weakly, \u201cYes, that is what this character means when converted\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Other researchers added, \u201cThis might be a conversion error. How can something like the Creator exist?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was a bit stunned and ordered, \u201cSend the original characters to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is still converting. The original characters are words we can\u2019t understand\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi steadied his heart. \u201cThen tell me as soon as the conversion is completed!\u201d</p><br/><p>His seriousness made the institute president puzzled. \u201cMr. President, do you believe in the existence of the Creator?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know if he is the Creator but he is the last hope of the United States.\u201d</p><br/><p>If the pole couldn\u2019t be relied on then this \u2018Creator\u2019 was crucial.</p><br/><p>Big Jiang also added, \u201cAfter all, the data brought back from the pole is worthy of attention.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was very reasonable. The pole was still an unknown existence for the United States and the information brought back from there needed to be paid attention to, even if it was ridiculous.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi appeased the institute president and temporarily blocked the news. It was even kept a secret from the cabinet members.</p><br/><p>Once the conversion was completed, a meeting would be held to discuss the countermeasures. The institute president explained, \u201cThe fastest the conversion will take is three days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to see it himself but the Academy of Science was needed to convert the characters to something he could read. Thus, he could only endure.</p><br/><p>The situation was too dangerous so Xie Xi made a preparatory plan and even drafted the \u2018declaration of destruction.\u2019 There was no other way. He sat in this position and had to bear all of it.</p><br/><p>The night before the result, Xie Xi carefully prepared a lot and circumvented Big Jiang to enter Little Jiang\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>He had to talk to Jiang Xie about this Creator. There was no accident this time. Xie Xi waited a bit and Jiang Xie opened his eyes. He saw the two different coloured pupils and relaxed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cDid you miss me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think,\u201d Xie Xi spoke blankly, \u201cI want to kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke softly, \u201cI see you are handling it skillfully\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him and didn\u2019t waste time, getting down to business.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cThere is still a soul in this world but he isn\u2019t the Creator. Still, the Creator is very important and you should try to find him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought so as well and asked, \u201cWhy did you tell me to maintain my rational gender?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sighed. \u201cOf course, it is to let you legally hold the left and the right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He already guessed it but he still felt strange hearing Jiang Xie say it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t thinking much. His child was pure and cute, while also deeply loving him. How could his head be green? The more he thought about it, the more unwilling he was. Jiang Xie leaned forward and kissed him hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026\u201d Don\u2019t leave any traces.</p><br/><p>Before he could finish, the unreliable Jiang Xie closed his eyes. Xie Xi was startled as he gazed into Little Jiang\u2019s indigo eyes.</p><br/><p>They had switched!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

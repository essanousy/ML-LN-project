Once Jiang Xie recovered a few of his souls, wouldn\u2019t this little fellow be in love with him?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie glanced a the steady -250 and hopes his souls wouldn\u2019t die.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t say anything. He just entered the fifth prince\u2019s dream as a ghost and the orange progress bar reached 16.666\u2026% and turned green.</p><br/><p>It was full. The fifth prince gave him all of the prince\u2019s love.</p><br/><p>They had only known each other for a few days, saw each other several times and spent some muddled time together in the dreams.</p><br/><p>Even if Dreaming could make the dream come true, the fifth prince was really too good. If there hadn\u2019t been the progress bar, Xie Xi would probably think the fifth prince was pretending. Now\u2026</p><br/><p>These feelings were really wonderful. It turned out the prince had fallen in love at first sight and his emotions were deep.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very confused. The fifth prince, sixth prince and third prince were X\u2019s souls. However, their temperament and idea of love were completely different from the three psychopaths in Love to the Left or Right.</p><br/><p>Randy, Aix-en and Gars killed him without speaking. They were so sick that Xie Xi was always on the verge of collapse because of them.</p><br/><p>Wait, Xie Xi suddenly understood a bit. Was it because of Sein Hall\u2019s betrayal?</p><br/><p>The more love they poured in, the more intolerable it was after being betrayed. The truer the love, the easier it was to be blackened.</p><br/><p>Imagine if the true identity of Sein Hall was exposed. In other words, the fifth prince and sixth prince would know that not only was Sein Hall alive, he also collected the love of their brothers.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Randall and Sirius would surely cut him into sashimi! If he thought about it, Randy, Gars and Aix-en didn\u2019t seem that bad?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t expect to see this magic number of +30 today.</p><br/><p>Then Xie Xi\u2019s lips thinned. The souls weren\u2019t bad but X must be very bad. If X wasn\u2019t a psychopath, how could he set such a perverted task?</p><br/><p>It was just +30 and it instantly became -30.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d Okay, this -250 number was very good and neat (heart dripping blood).</p><br/><p>Xie Xi no longer wanted to think about the fifth prince. He didn\u2019t have much time left. He had to collect love and leave this world.</p><br/><p>Once he left here, he could find X and learn more about the souls.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi returned to the training hall. Sirius had left and the third prince was talking to someone.</p><br/><p>From Xie Xi\u2019s perspective, the man was blocked by the third prince and only long silver hair could be seen.</p><br/><p>The silver\u2026</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this Second Prince Aix-en?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was afraid that the two brothers would fight and hurried forward. As he got closer, he could hear their dialogue.</p><br/><p>Gars, \u201c\u2026It is just rhetoric. Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know what you are thinking!\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en refuted, \u201cYou have a wooden head. What do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gars told him, \u201cI can see through your human face and beast\u2019s heart (two-faced) to the trash.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en ridiculed, \u201cYou are staring at me with a pair of dog\u2019s eyes. Don\u2019t even think about\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished speaking yet when he saw Xie Xi coming over. The third prince had his back to Xie Xi and only realized after turning around at the second prince\u2019s gaze.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hurriedly bowed. \u201cI have seen the second prince and third prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince pulled him over, placing an arm around Xie Xi\u2019s shoulder and showing him off to the second prince. \u201cMy little follower.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, who was being treated like a chick, \u201c\u2026\u201d Wait until I grow tall and then watch out for your dog legs!</p><br/><p>The second prince stared at Xie Xi for a while and finally remembered. \u201cIs this\u2026\u201d This 1% progress slag fish, he couldn\u2019t even remember Xie Xi\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>The third prince said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to know his name or to know him.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t say it well and caused Aix-en to become interested His eyes narrowed and he laughed in an ambiguous manner, \u201cLittle Colin, you have become whiter.\u201d As he spoke, he reached out and tried to pinch Xie Xi\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Gars knocked away the dog\u2019s hand. \u201cDon\u2019t touch him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en wasn\u2019t angry. He kept smiling at Xie Xi, his voice soft and pleasant. \u201cAren\u2019t you suffering following Third Brother? If you come to me, I will make sure you sleep well and that you no longer have to get up early.\u201d</p><br/><p>From this, it was clear that he knew his brother well. The third prince lived in the military camp all year round. He was disciplined and woke up early in the morning. Once he woke up, he would find someone to do morning exercises with him (beating up). Saul\u2019s greatest wish in life was to sleep well.</p><br/><p>Like a big dog looking after its food, Gars directly pulled Xie Xi into his arms. \u201cGo to your palace? Won\u2019t you eat him until he has no bones left?\u201d</p><br/><p>His words were actually quite simple but Aix-en was clearly an old hand at this and he spoke ambiguously, \u201cIt won\u2019t be that fast. Little Colin is delicious and I\u2019ll take it slow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gars reacted by exploding. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it. If you dare touch one of his fingers, I will chop you up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en was accustomed to being scolded by him. \u201cLittle Colin is a man, not an object. Why are you bullying him like that instead of asking what he wants?\u201d Gars held Xie Xi\u2019s arm tightly while Xie Xi thought, \u2018The explosive fish is the opponent of the slag fish.\u2019</p><br/><p>Aix-en spoke again, \u201cIf it is yours, you don\u2019t have to protect it or tie it to your side. Third Brother, be sensible and give Colin some space. Your arms are so tight that he can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gars\u2019 arms immediately loosened but he didn\u2019t lose his anger. \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense. I know my own people!\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en smiled. \u201cIt is getting late. I\u2019m booked a table at Aromen. Let\u2019s eat together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gars opened his mouth. \u201cI won\u2019t go. We already have food to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi needed to increase progress with Aix-en but the main one was still Gars at the moment and he said they wouldn\u2019t go.</p><br/><p>How could Aix-en be thrown away so easily? He said, \u201cThird Brother, I told you not to do this. You are too disrespectful. You should\u2019ve at least asked Colin\u2019s opinion.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t wait for Gars top open his mouth and just asked Xie Xi, \u201cLittle Colin, will you allow me to buy you a meal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gars was fired up and pushed him away.\u201dYou are the second prince. How could a small guard dare refuse?\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en smiled and wondered, \u201cAm I a person who holds grudges?\u201d He had his grudges written on his face!</p><br/><p>Gars knew Aix-en well and Aix-en knew Gars.</p><br/><p>Gars wasn\u2019t a careless person and didn\u2019t want Colin to offend Aix-en. This person was a madman. After all, his hidden arrows were difficult to prevent. Aix-en was sure that Gars would be thinking about protecting Colin and deliberately said this.</p><br/><p>The result was\u2026</p><br/><p>The strange trio sat together for dinner! Xie Xi was sandwiched between the two princes and was in a real dilemma.</p><br/><p>The second prince said enthusiastically, \u201cWhat do you want to eat? Order anything you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince sneered. \u201cWhat\u2019s good. Just order the special dishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had no say and just waited patiently.</p><br/><p>The second prince disagreed, \u201cThere are only the three of us. How can we finish eating it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince scoffed mercilessly. \u201cCheap.\u201d</p><br/><p>The second prince didn\u2019t care as he carefully examined the menu, \u201cLittle Colin, is there anything you can\u2019t eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cI can do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>The second prince didn\u2019t ask the third prince but he knew what the third prince loved to eat. After all, they were enemies who had grown up together and were very clear about each other\u2019s taste.</p><br/><p>The third prince deliberately said, \u201cAdd two more screaming crabs.\u201d This wasn\u2019t actually a crab. It was a type of fish but it looked like a crab and it screamed, thus it got this name.</p><br/><p>This fish was a famous luxury ingredient, just like truffles on land. It wasn\u2019t necessarily delicious but it was definitely expensive.</p><br/><p>The second prince said, \u201cWhy do you eat that thing? It\u2019s terrible.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince replied, \u201cSecond Brother doesn\u2019t have to eat it. I will eat with Colin.\u201d</p><br/><p>The second prince, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince sent him a look. \u201cWhat? Second Brother said you would treat us but you are actually reluctant to spend money? Well, forget it. I will take care of this table today. Third Brother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine.\u201d The second prince\u2019s gentle and bewitching face showed rare signs of collapse. \u201cWhat is so good about this broken fish? It hurts people and is costly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi secretly glanced at the fish. This screaming crab was quite expensive. One alone cost as much as his monthly salary. However, wasn\u2019t he the second prince? How could he be short of money?</p><br/><p>Um\u2026 Xie Xi hadn\u2019t taken it seriously when Gars said his brother was cheap. Now he felt there was some truth to it.</p><br/><p>Still, he was the minister of finance so this didn\u2019t seem to be a bad thing?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi soon realized that the second prince\u2019s cheapness was embedded deep into his bone marrow. Regardless of how he acted as a peacock, his essence was a calculating person who would haggle over everything.</p><br/><p>As he ate, he scolded the third prince, \u201cThis crab leg is full of meat. Why aren\u2019t you eating it?\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, the third prince could peel crab legs. Xie Xi had seen it. The third prince was deliberately angering the second prince.</p><br/><p>The second prince of the underwater kingdom picked up the leg discarded by his brother, picked out the remaining meat and placed it on his plate. The third prince knew his faults and threw away the plate.</p><br/><p>The second prince angrily yelled while picking up the pieces, \u201cThat\u2019s enough! I don\u2019t want to eat dinner with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why did you invite me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The second prince looked at the plate and then Xie Xi who was happily eating the cheapest crescent fruit. \u201cI clearly asked Little Colin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned but not because he suddenly became the topic of conversation. It was because the purple progress of the second prince rose by 3%.</p><br/><p>Why did it go up?</p><br/><p>The third prince grabbed Xie Xi\u2019s crescent fruit and pushed the screaming crab towards him. \u201cWhy are you eating crescent fruit? Eat this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t like the powerful taste of the screaming crab. He picked up the half-gnawed crescent fruit and said, \u201cDon\u2019t waste food. I will finish this first.\u201d</p><br/><p>He just finished speaking when he found that the purple progress of the second prince rose by another 1%.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d All these souls were poisonous!</p><br/><p>The second child scorned the third child. \u201cDo you see how sensible Little Colin is? You don\u2019t know anything about human misery.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince definitely knew how to provoke his brother and just said in return, \u201cGive me two Bai Xieqing.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a type of wine on the seabed. The value was similar to the 82 years old Lafite wine.</p><br/><p>The second prince raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou want to drink wine? No\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince told him, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll treat you.\u201d He glanced at Xie Xi. \u201cIs two bottles enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hurriedly shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t drink. I am allergic.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince regretted. \u201cThen forget it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi found that after his words, the purple bar rose by 1% again. Was the strategy for this slag fish to focus on \u2018stinginess\u2019?</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t look at the third prince\u2019s military origins. His alcohol tolerance was actually very ordinary and he started to feel dizzy after three cups. He ordered two bottles of wine and drank less than half a bottle.</p><br/><p>The second prince was distressed. \u201cYou can\u2019t drink yet you opened all the wine.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince deliberately poked at him. \u201cHow can you not drink? Do you plan to throw it away?\u201d</p><br/><p>The second prince said, \u201cDo you know how much manpower and resources were wasted in brewing this bottle of wine? You know how many people these 300,000 pearls\u2026\u201d He paused before continuing, \u201cThis is why I hate soldiers. All of you waste money the wrong way!\u201d</p><br/><p>He usually wasn\u2019t angry and it was rare for him to be sulking like this. Xie Xi looked at him with much more interest than before.</p><br/><p>The second prince looked at the dizzy third prince then at the bottle of wine and poured himself a cup. \u201cI can\u2019t waste this.\u201d Then he drank.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Okay, the third child and second child were drunk while he sat to the side and watched the fun.</p><br/><p>The meal hadn\u2019t finished when the third prince fell on the table.</p><br/><p>The second prince also staggered. Xie Xi glanced at the two remaining crescent fruit and spoke in a warm manner. \u201cSecond Prince, these aren\u2019t finished. Can I take them with me?\u201d The two of them were fine. He could peel the skin and have them for breakfast tomorrow.</p><br/><p>The second prince\u2019s eyes lit up and he patted Xie Xi\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou are a good boy.\u201d</p><br/><p>He picked up the two crescent fruit and placed them in Xie Xi\u2019s hands. \u201cThis year, we have increased our funds and we increased the production of the crescent fruit. This is a good thing. Many ordinary people use them to fill their stomachs\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi held the two crescent fruits while muttering in his heart, \u2018I didn\u2019t think the slag fish would be like this.</p><br/><p>The second prince\u2019s servant took him away while Xie Xi sent the third prince back to his palace.</p><br/><p>There were very few people on the third prince\u2019s side. Apart from a few guards, there wasn\u2019t anyone responsible for his lifestyle. Fortunately, the buoyancy of the water was great and Xie Xi placed the third prince on the bed without much trouble.</p><br/><p>This person had a bad alcohol tolerance yet he still drank.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw the blue bruises on his arm and thought that the third prince had been on the training fields all day. It was estimated that he was very tired, which was why he was sleeping so soundly.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at the red progress bar and had a thought.</p><br/><p>This was a good opportunity to use Dreaming and increase his progress.</p><br/><p>He had thought that collecting the love of the six princes was an impossible task. Now thanks to Roast Pork Bun\u2019s sudden evolution, the difficulty had plummeted and Xie Xi\u2019s mood was much better.</p><br/><p>He had to complete the main task as soon as possible. Maybe he could try doing the branch task and directly clear the quasi-world.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had a headache as he thought of the side task to collect one million tons of garbage.</p><br/><p>Forget it. Let\u2019s take a look at the third prince\u2019s dream first. Xie Xi used Dreaming and entered straight into the third prince\u2019s dream.</p><br/><p>This guy was really dreaming about him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s vision turned dark and once he opened his eyes, he felt a strong impact.</p><br/><p>He was shocked and hurriedly grabbed the person in front of him. Unfortunately, he hadn\u2019t been able to touch when he heard the third prince\u2019s voice, \u201cYou evil dragon, let him go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun broadcasted live, \u201cDaddy, you were captured by the dragon!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s face was stunned. What was this messy dream?</p><br/><p>He felt his body being clasped by a paw, followed by a low voice that sounded like the second prince. \u201cHe\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh, the dragon was the second prince.</p><br/><p>This truly was the third prince\u2019s dream.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

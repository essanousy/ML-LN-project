His face was shy and red as he said, \u201cI was\u2026 I was crazy\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, sorry\u2026\u201d He apologized before running away under Jiang Xie\u2019s icy gaze.</p><br/><p>He always felt that he would be beaten up if he didn\u2019t run.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned back and looked at Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes were full of surprise. \u201cYou have come back. Weren\u2019t you supposed to be gone seven days?\u201d It was only the sixth night.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s attitude suddenly softened. \u201cI finished early and came back.\u201d He had been so worried that he couldn\u2019t sleep He was afraid that when he came back, the little succubus would\u2019ve already run off with others.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cHow did you do? What was the result of the competition?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke vague words. \u201cI didn\u2019t shame the school.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cFirst prize?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s lips curved and he raised his head. \u201cThe top quality prize.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Okay, this was the world he designed and it was natural to be king.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Xie Xi sand this person\u2019s praises.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cYou are also very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cI didn\u2019t take part in the competition. How am I good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour answer just now is very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was regarding this matter. Xie Xi smirked in his heart. How could he be called good just for refusing sex?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi cooperated with him. \u201cYou have taught me well. I naturally won\u2019t break the rules of Heaven.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s smile was wider than when he won the prize. \u201cHave you eaten yet? I bought a specialty of the Fourth Heaven.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cI have eaten.\u201d He didn\u2019t dare let himself be hungry.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen tomorrow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the words were finished, Xie Xi interrupted, \u201cWhat is the specialty? I will taste it. I still have some space in my stomach.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was curious about the delicious food. The Fourth Heaven would definitely have more different things than the FIrst Heaven.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had the god\u2019s wisdom so he wouldn\u2019t be harmed by anything he came in contact with.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cIt is Snow Cloud Cake. Let\u2019s go back to the dormitory first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded and naturally held his hand.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s ears turned slightly red. He wanted to say that he couldn\u2019t be seduced outside but he couldn\u2019t help holding the other person\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>It was okay\u2026 there was no one here\u2026</p><br/><p>Once back in the dormitory, Xie Xi was afraid his clothes would disappear and quickly took them off.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really wanted to save money. It was a waste of time and money to buy clothes. It was also very troublesome.</p><br/><p>He asked hurriedly, \u201cWhere is the Snow Cloud Cake?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t need the Snow Cloud Cake but a large basin of ice water formed by snow to cool himself down.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough.\u201d Jiang Xie hadn\u2019t seen this person for six days and returned to the pre-training stage. He didn\u2019t dare look. \u201cThe weather is cold. You should wrap yourself in a quilt first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very considerate and wrapped himself up in the thin quilt.</p><br/><p>The white quilt wrapped around the snow-white body, the beautiful and delicate small head exposed\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie felt heat flowing through him and covered his nose while heading to the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It felt that the gradual steps from before were all in vain. Jiang Xie left for six days and came back more useless than before.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sorted himself out and took out the Snow Cloud Cake from his backpack. \u201cIt is a bit sweet. I don\u2019t know if you should eat too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw the cake placed in a black box, looking as light as the clouds in the sky.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was really beautiful. The name Snow Cloud Cake didn\u2019t look good at first but after seeing it, he found that this name was really appropriate.</p><br/><p>It was a round and small cake the size of a palm. It looked like clouds but had the crystal clearness of snowflakes. It was truly beautiful.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cTaste it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded and grabbed one. This Snow Cloud Cake looked like clouds in a dog but it was easy to pinch. The touch wasn\u2019t sticky and it was very refreshing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took a bite and found that the cloud-like skin was crisp and wrapped around a cream filling. The taste was indescribable.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s delicious!\u201d Xie Xi didn\u2019t hesitate to exclaim.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie seemed to sigh with relief. \u201cYou like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi ate three in a row. He wanted to eat the fourth one when Jiang Xie stopped him. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t eat too much at night or you will feel uncomfortable. Leave it for tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi only just discovered something. \u201cYou aren\u2019t eating any?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like sweet things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t sweet. It is very delicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie whispered softly, \u201cI\u2019ll leave it for you to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t easy to go to the Fourth Heaven. If Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t going to participate in the competition then it wouldn\u2019t be easy for him to enter. Therefore, this Snow Cloud Cake was very difficult to buy. He was reluctant to eat it and wanted to leave it all for Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>How could Xie Xi not understand?</p><br/><p>For a time, he also felt it was too sweet. It wasn\u2019t from the Snow Cloud Cake but sweetness that came from the bottom of his heart.</p><br/><p>It was the so-called small changes in newlyweds caused victory\u2026 In any case, Xie Xi felt like this and Jiang Xie had his own thoughts. The two people were very sticky and unknowingly, it was time to sleep.</p><br/><p>Before Jiang Xie went to participate in the competition, the gradual progress of the two people had developed to the point of sleeping together.</p><br/><p>For this progress, Xie Xi felt that Jiang Xie was very selfish.</p><br/><p>If it was just sleeping together, Examinee Jiang would probably have to practice for a lifetime.</p><br/><p>Once Jiang Xie finished washing, Xie Xi wrapped himself in a quilt and climbed into his bed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie just finished washing and felt he needed another cold shower.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him. \u201cIt has been delayed for seven days. We should continue to practice.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it was just acting shameless, who couldn\u2019t do it?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie got into bed and his action of holding people in his arms was nimble.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi lowered his head and smirked, deliberately leaning into this person\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie suffered a lot. It was a bit of the taste of a person taking the university entrance exam.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mind moved and he whispered, \u201cIs this falling in love with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sudden words threw Student Jiang Xie to the sky.</p><br/><p>His head was blank like a flash bomb had been thrown.</p><br/><p>He felt the strength in the other person\u2019s arms and Xie Xi dropped him down to the ground again. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like it? We are just practicing for you to come to the Demon World.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt there was no problem with this brain circuit.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned for half a minute before a reaction came. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi helped him by saying, \u201cOnly two people in love with each other will be so intimate. If we are like this, is it love in Heaven?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart trembled.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi woke him up. \u201cOf course, we are different. We are mainly practicing.\u201d He would let this person dig a hole for himself that he couldn\u2019t climb out of!</p><br/><p>Gemini\u2019s mind was very good. Not only did he find a benefit for himself, he was also able to pick some sugar from the cracks.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you practicing with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi answered, \u201cIn order to let you pass the assessment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wondered, \u201cWhy should I pass the assessment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you pass the assessment, you can go to the Demon World!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie gulped and asked another question, \u201cWhy do you want me to go to the Demon World?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew what this person wanted to hear and was willing to tell him. \u201cIt is because I don\u2019t want to be separated from you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His mouth was blocked before his words finished.</p><br/><p>The step by step Candidate Jiang challenged the super-hard question, wanting to go beyond the university entrance examination and go straight to the university course!</p><br/><p>This night was quiet and the two males lay in bed, yet managed to stop\u2026</p><br/><p>Gemini really wasn\u2019t an average person, Xie Xi thought.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie gasped out. \u201cRemember, don\u2019t say such things to me during the assessment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was also gasping and didn\u2019t understand his words for a moment.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie continued, \u201cIf you say these things, I really can\u2019t go to the Demon World with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>All the other seductions were less than these words?</p><br/><p>He wanted to say he had no interest but thought he was promising too much.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare to tease this person and obediently huddled in the quilt. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was itchy and asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to separate from me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked back, \u201cDoes this need a reason? I don\u2019t want to separate from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie held this person and felt he was finished, completely finished.</p><br/><p>It was nothing to be bewitched by a succubus. He could calm down with a bottle of cold water.</p><br/><p>However, falling in love with a succubus was really the end\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie could control his body but he really couldn\u2019t control his heart.</p><br/><p>He liked this succubus. Perhaps he had been ruined the first time he saw Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt that Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t pass the exchange student examination.</p><br/><p>He specifically looked at situations in the past. The exchange program had been going on for a long time. Basically, every four years, there was always an exchange student at the school.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t always a succubus as an exchange student. Many of the previous sessions never had a succubus exchange student.</p><br/><p>Of course, the other big demons were no better. For example, the big demon who majored in greed. In that year, the graduation rate of the Economic Department plummeted. One by one, they didn\u2019t go to class and went to earn money!</p><br/><p>There was also the big demon who majored in wrath. When he was at school, the Physical Education department became like a gang and would go to other schools to fight. All of them became confused!</p><br/><p>The demon majoring in sloth was even more fascinating. Before entering the classroom, only 10% of the students were sleeping in the back. Once he entered, 100% of them would sleep, including the lecturer at the podium.</p><br/><p>The big demon who majored in gluttony made the school cafeteria miserable. Three meals a day turned into six meals and the students became starving ghosts. It made the workers really tired and bald!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw it with great interest. Compared to his predecessors, the succubus was really a small witch.</p><br/><p>He turned to the school forum and found that there were many posts discussing himself when he first entered school.</p><br/><p>The posts were as followed\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to the experience of the predecessors, will our Law Department become a brothel?\u201d</p><br/><p>The following post was also funny. \u201cWhat brother? It is a green building.\u201d (TL: High-end brothel in Ancient China)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder why the dormitory building of the Law Department is green\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Many roles started to be played.</p><br/><p>After a few hundred posts, many people closed it and scattered. There was the powerful Master Jiang who caught the succubus in a sack. They could forget the dream of a brothel.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw this and laughed until tears emerged.</p><br/><p>A year passed quite quickly and in the blink of an eye, it was almost over.</p><br/><p>There was one month to the assessment and they had to see if Master Jiang could pass!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

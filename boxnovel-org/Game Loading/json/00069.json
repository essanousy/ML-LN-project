He couldn\u2019t step forward or say a word.</p><br/><p>What could he say?</p><br/><p>Sein Hall died for Sirius. They lived and died together. Now Sein was waking up in the sixth prince\u2019s arms. What could the fifth prince do?</p><br/><p>After all, he and Sein only knew each other for a few days. He liked Sein, fell in love with him at first sight and even had an incredibly real dream. However, a dream was a dream, no matter how realistic.</p><br/><p>Sein wasn\u2019t the dream Sein and wouldn\u2019t choose him.</p><br/><p>In the days when the fifth prince heard about Sein\u2019s death and desperately wanted him to live, the fifth prince couldn\u2019t think about it.</p><br/><p>Compared to who Sein liked, it was better to know that he was still living in this world.</p><br/><p>Even so, everyone was greedy. Sein was back and the fifth prince wanted more, but reality dragged him into the bottomless abyss.</p><br/><p>Sein would be with Sirius.</p><br/><p>The two people had been separated from a life or death situation and now Sein was back. The sixth prince risked his life to rescue Sein and Sein would surely\u2026</p><br/><p>The fifth prince was stunned at the thought of his sweetheart being with his younger brother.</p><br/><p>Was there anything crueler than this?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was pained by the sixth prince.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince was too miserable. His father didn\u2019t love him and there were too many brothers and sisters to take care of him. He grew up alone and was abandoned by his father. He was so disappointed that he gave up on everything, even his own life, until he met Sein Hall.</p><br/><p>A person who illuminated the bottom of the sea for him.</p><br/><p>However, this light was fleeting and left a deep shadow on his heart.</p><br/><p>How ecstatic would the sixth prince feel now that Sein was resurrected\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t feel pained for long. The orange progress bar that he hadn\u2019t seen for a long time. The original green colour that represented a perfect 16.66\u2026% fell back to the orange 16.65%!</p><br/><p>The fifth prince was shaken!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t have to know what the fifth prince was thinking. After all, it became full in the dream but there would be a huge drop in reality. It was just like the second and third princes.</p><br/><p>He never thought that the fifth prince would give up just as he came back to life!</p><br/><p>In other words, Sein and the sixth prince were locked too deeply and the fifth prince was a rare normal child. It was natural for him to retreat.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t back down!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi never thought that one day he would say the slogan of a scum male!</p><br/><p>The progress bar was still flashing which should it might keep falling. Xie Xi couldn\u2019t care about the sixth prince and quickly started Plan B.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Xie Xi\u2019s voice was so weak that it seemed to be carried away by the current.</p><br/><p>However, all the people present were sharp and clearly understood.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince was startled and released his hands.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart hurt but there was no way\u2026 blame it on that pervert X!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere am I? I\u2026\u201d Xie Xi frowned before he could finish his words as he made a pained expression.</p><br/><p>He died many times in the first world and knew how to imitate pain. After all, he was a person who had been shot in the heart and had his head cut off!</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun was the first to be fooled and he anxiously rubbed his head against Xie Xi. \u201cWhat happened to Daddy? Where does it hurt? Are you going to die from the pain?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d This little idiot!</p><br/><p>The fifth prince told the sixth prince, \u201cHe just woke up. Don\u2019t scare him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince was stunned and staggered back with a pale expression.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince approached and spoke to Xie Xi in a warm tone, \u201cShall we go back inside first?\u201d</p><br/><p>The \u2018equal treatment\u2019 Xie Xi cried out, \u201cWho are you? Where am I? I\u2026 who am I?\u201d</p><br/><p>The triple questions perfectly set up his amnesia.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who am I?\u2019 The fifth prince was also shocked and he asked softly, \u201cYou\u2026 don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s Plan B was more than this. He screamed and grabbed his head in a pained manner.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince hurriedly retreated. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Don\u2019t think about it. We will go inside first.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince picked up Xie Xi, jumped off the roof and entered the room.</p><br/><p>The Haiqiu state teacher\u2019s head was full of fog. Haiqiu had resurrected many people but this was the first time such a strange situation was encountered\u2026</p><br/><p>The sixth prince put Xie Xi down and grabbed the state teacher\u2019s collar. His face was dark and gloomy. \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Haiqiu state teacher started shaking fiercely. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 e-everything was normal\u2026 the person was also resurrected. By all accounts, there shouldn\u2019t be any problems\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince\u2019s voice was cold. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t remember anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could the Haiqiu teacher know what was going on?</p><br/><p>He had never seen anyone resurrected outside the array, even if the roof was above the array! He had never seen anyone wearing clothes after being resurrected and had never heard of anyone who couldn\u2019t remember anything\u2026</p><br/><p>He even suspected that Sein wasn\u2019t dead and was just hiding somewhere. Then the moment the resurrection started, he swam to the roof to lie down\u2026</p><br/><p>Hah, how could that be?</p><br/><p>The old state teacher felt crazy. How could there be such a thing? These sharp princes, wouldn\u2019t they knew that their sweetheart was dead?</p><br/><p>Of course, the state teacher murmured all of these words inside his heart. He was afraid that he would be slapped to death by the sixth prince if he said anything.</p><br/><p>After seeing the prince\u2019s power as he slaughtered the Haiqiu people, the old state teacher was so scared he pissed!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was afraid this unreliable teacher would say something and hurriedly brought the princes\u2019 attention to himself.</p><br/><p>It was very simple. He just needed to\u2026</p><br/><p>He covered his head and groaned in a pained manner.</p><br/><p>It worked very well. The fifth and sixth princes immediately ignored the state teacher.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that the closer they came, the more pained Xie Xi felt. His eyes became red and he didn\u2019t know how many tears he shed (in fact, it was good that he couldn\u2019t cry under the water). The bulging joints of his white fingers were obvious and he looked extremely pained.</p><br/><p>The fifth and sixth princes were anxious and panicked for a while.</p><br/><p>The calmer eldest prince spoke softly, \u201cDon\u2019t irritate him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince and sixth prince stared at him simultaneously.</p><br/><p>The eldest prince told them, \u201cI called Fourth Brother. He will come over in a while and take a look.\u201d Then he had the guards take the Haiqiu state teacher away.</p><br/><p>The old state teacher cried out, \u201cYour Highness, I saved your lover. Please don\u2019t kill me, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He ate so many underwater people yet still wanted to live, the Haiqiu state teacher\u2019s IQ really wasn\u2019t high\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shrunk back to a corner of the bed and curled up in a ball.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare take a look or listen to anything. He just covered his ears, closed his eyes and murmured to himself.</p><br/><p>The three princes couldn\u2019t get close but they didn\u2019t dare to leave. They could only stand there and wait for the fourth prince to come over.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince wasn\u2019t only an environmentalist. He was the best medical academics under the water and was proficient with a variety of difficult and incurable diseases.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart felt strange. They had just talked marriage and now the fourth prince was coming to see him\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was really sick. He had a heart disease!</p><br/><p>Not long afterward, the fourth prince arrived and froze when he saw the situation in the room.</p><br/><p>Eldest Brother, Fifth Brother and Sixth Brother were in the residence of a small guard. What was going on?</p><br/><p>The eldest prince\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cFourth Brother, go and check what\u2019s wrong with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince\u2019s gaze moved to the bed and he saw the frightened merman.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince\u2019s heart sank as he almost thought it was his little Jesse.</p><br/><p>Then the difference in the fishtails awakened him.</p><br/><p>How could it be Jesse? That little fellow was sleeping peacefully.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince\u2019s spirit returned and he went over to examine Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew he wouldn\u2019t be recognized but he still felt very guilty. Fortunately, he was now \u2018sick\u2019 and it didn\u2019t matter if he didn\u2019t look at the other person.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince brought out some instruments and carefully examined him. \u201cHis vital signs are good and there are no problems. It might be a psychological problem. He is a bit afraid of people so it is best to give him time to be alone and calm down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he spoke, the room sighed with relief apart from the silly cat.</p><br/><p>Needless to say, the others could accept it as long as Sein\u2019s health was okay.</p><br/><p>Sein died so miserably. It was normal for him to not be in a good state after coming back alive.</p><br/><p>Not to mention that Xie Xi also wanted this result. The fourth prince\u2019s words were what he said in his heart. He needed to be alone and he needed to calm down!</p><br/><p>The fourth prince was very curious about this situation but the state of his eldest brother and younger brothers weren\u2019t quite right. He didn\u2019t ask anything more and instructed, \u201cYou should go back first. He is nervous and in pain while you are here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth\u2019s princes eyes looked slightly dim as he asked, \u201cIs he really going to be okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince told him, \u201cHis body is definitely okay but his psychological state\u2026 it isn\u2019t good and will depend on himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince\u2019s eyes flashed and he told the sixth prince, \u201cGive him some time, let\u2019s not disturb him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Very good! Xie Xi was happy as the fifth prince\u2019s bar became full again. Continue to maintain this.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince frowned and wanted to come over again.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince lowered his voice. \u201cIt is good that he can forget those memories.\u201d</p><br/><p>The words were very subtle and the sixth prince was stunned.</p><br/><p>It was indeed better if he could forget those things. However, to forget everything else\u2026</p><br/><p>The fifth prince spoke again, \u201cIt is fine as long as he is healthy. We can talk about other matters slowly. Do you want to see him in such pain?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince closed his eyes. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go back and let him rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>From start to finish, the eldest prince was the furthest away. He just stared at Xie Xi and other people couldn\u2019t guess what he was thinking.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was aware of it but he didn\u2019t want to engage in the past life matters. He might immediately fill up the eldest prince\u2019s good feelings but what about afterward? How could he steady the fifth and sixth princes?</p><br/><p>He had to love six people, not one!</p><br/><p>It hadn\u2019t been too long and Classmate Xie Xi could already casually pull out slag male quotes!</p><br/><p>After sending away the princes, Xie Xi kept acting but there was only one chance to fool the stupid cat.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun blinked. \u201cDaddy is acting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him blankly. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun sang his praises. \u201cYou are very strong. I really believed it.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t him. It was the kitten that was stupid!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told the kitten, \u201cGo out and help me keep watch. If a prince comes then call me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun was energetic. \u201cGood!\u201d He flew to act as lookout.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare go anywhere and kept acting as a dog on the corner of the bed.</p><br/><p>During this time, the sixth prince came and looked at him secretly, followed by the fifth prince and finally the eldest prince.</p><br/><p>Maybe they were afraid that Xie Xi would be uncomfortable. The three people didn\u2019t enter and just looked on from outside. They stood there for an hour before leaving.</p><br/><p>Early in the morning, Xie Xi pretended to fall asleep while 1,5 and 6 looked in on him again. This time they knew he was sleeping and weren\u2019t willing to wake him up. They left after half an hour.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi actually didn\u2019t sleep at all. Once he sent away the three gods, he rolled over and got up.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoast Pork Bun, stay here. If there is a situation, hurry and call me!\u201d Fortunately, the identity of these faces were royal guards and their residences weren\u2019t far away. At this range, Roast Pork Bun could barely reach him. Otherwise, Xie Xi would be walking a wire rope and could die at any time!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi changed to the second face and went to get Colin\u2019s communicator. Then he changed to the first face and got Jesse\u2019s communicator.</p><br/><p>He turned on the communicator and was hit by the incoming information.</p><br/><p>Fourth Prince: [Wait for me at noon and we\u2019ll eat together.]</p><br/><p>Second Prince: [I have a job in the morning. I will pick you up after I finish and we will eat together.]</p><br/><p>Third Prince: [I am at the camp and will come back at noon. I\u2019ll take you to eat delicious food.]</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Who wanted to have a meal? He already felt full just from looking!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

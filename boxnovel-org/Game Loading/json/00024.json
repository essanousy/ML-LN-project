You outsiders are all villains!\u201d The boy\u2019s tender face was veiled with anger.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi crouched down until he was eye level with the boy. He was calm and gentle, treating the seven or eight year old boy in front of him like an adult instead of a child.</p><br/><p>This move caused the little boy to be startled. He was used to looking up at people and now he felt a bit uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>And\u2026</p><br/><p>How could this man be so good-looking, even better than Sister Yunren.</p><br/><p>The boy\u2019s tight nerves subconsciously relaxed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi whispered, \u201cI just arrived here yesterday. I haven\u2019t done anything or hurt anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy was surprised and bit his lips. \u201cYo uare the same, all the same. At first you were good to us but then did bad things. The village\u2026\u201d He was wronged but refused to shed a tear. \u201cThe village became like this because of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned. \u201cWhat the hell did they do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did they do?\u201d This was a switch that allowed the boy to vent. He accused the outsiders of their evil deeds using childish words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou played with our feelings! You occupied our houses! You took away our food! You even trapped us in this small town so we can never leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi expected the previous players to have done a huge disservice to the town but he hadn\u2019t expected it to be like this. Trapping the residents in the small town so they could never leave?</p><br/><p>He asked, \u201cCan\u2019t you walk out of this town?\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy was made. \u201cIf we could leave then we wouldn\u2019t wait here to die!\u201d</p><br/><p>The overall situation of the residents in the town was very bad. It wasn\u2019t only physically but their minds were also thinned into a string that could break at any time.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cWhen did this start?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA year ago\u2026\u201d The boy shook with rage. \u201cIt started when you outsiders fell from the sky! At first, you put on a hypocritical face by helping us do farm work, building a house and soon\u2026 soon\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy glanced at Sun Yunren, tears in his eyes. \u201cSoon you showed your true beastly face! You robbed our home, drove us to work day and night, humiliated and insulted\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The cruel and dirty things sounded worse in the innocent child\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned, \u201cThus, you started hunting outsiders.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy\u2019s golden eyes flashed with a fearless brilliance. \u201cDon\u2019t you deserve to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t solve the problem,\u201d Xie Xi stared at him.</p><br/><p>The boy said ruthlessly, \u201cYou won\u2019t bother us again as long as we kill all of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cI can make it impossible for them to come here but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished the words when he felt the air splitting\u2026</p><br/><p>The boy\u2019s eyes widened, full of panic and despair\u2026 Xie Xi got up and hugged the boy in his arms, the arrow piercing him in the back.</p><br/><p>Song Qi screamed, \u201cBrother Xi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Severe pain immediately took over his whole brain and Xie Xi gritted his teeth.</p><br/><p>The boy was stunned and looked up at him with astonishment.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi endured the severe pain and whispered, \u201cGo quickly, there is danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy was pale and his lips trembled. \u201cWhy did you do this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi whispered again, \u201cGo to the rear mountain\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy\u2019s eyes widened.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pushed him hard. \u201cGo!\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy stared at the outsider and clenched his fists before pulling Sun Yunren to run away.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin\u2019s voice was slowly heard. \u201cAn inferior human, is it worth wasting a life for them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s uniform played a role. The pain faded and the back injury recovered. His forehead was covered in sweat and his face was paler than usual.</p><br/><p>\u201cInferior?\u201d Xie Xi\u2019s voice was hoarse.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin\u2019s sunniness had changed. He still had golden hair but the smile on his face was cruel and arrogant. \u201cYou new people can\u2019t always recognize their identities.\u201d</p><br/><p>He sprang forward and pressed his hand against the arrow piercing Xie Xi. \u201cIf you were inferior then you would be dead right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The wound had recovered but pressing against it caused the sharp pain to come again.</p><br/><p>Sweat dripped down the tip of Xie Xi\u2019s nose. \u201cSo you humiliate them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin smiled. \u201cYou misunderstand. I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t finish his words as Xie Xi kicked him and glanced at Song Qi.</p><br/><p>Song Qi understood and ran in the opposite direction.</p><br/><p>The two of them running together would only lead to both being caught. If they ran separately, at least one of them could get away and find a chance to rescue the other person.</p><br/><p>Zhong JIn laughed and didn\u2019t hesitate to pursue Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>The small minion Song Qi wasn\u2019t worth mentioning. If Xie Xi wasn\u2019t present then Zhong Jin could use one finger to kill Song Qi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi ran as hard as he could and exhausted all his strength.</p><br/><p>He knew he couldn\u2019t run away and that Zhong Jin was playing with him, like a cat chasing a mouse.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi still had to run as much as possible in order to buy Song Qi some time!</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin was much stronger than they thought. They tied him up like that yet he came so quickly. He must\u2019ve easily broken the rope after the frozen effect ended.</p><br/><p>Fortunately they didn\u2019t try to kill him. The effect of the character freeze was too short. Once their fatal immunity was gone, Xie Xi and Song Qi would be the ones to die!</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin deliberately forced him into a small alley and Xie Xi knew he couldn\u2019t retreat once he ran in.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s physical strength was very bad. After all, he stayed in his house all year round and lacked exercise.</p><br/><p>There was an item in the mall that strengthened his body but unfortunately, his level was too low to afford it.</p><br/><p>After running as hard as he could, he was tired and breathless. His hair was wet with sweat and stuck to his cheeks.</p><br/><p>In comparison, Zhong Jin\u2019s breathing wasn\u2019t chaotic and his footsteps were gentle.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s brain worked quickly as he thought about the cards in his hands.</p><br/><p>He still had one life, seven character freezes, a search mirror and the short blade grabbed from Zhong Jin. The search mirror wasn\u2019t very useful. The seven character freezes could only control Zhong Jin for seven minutes\u2026</p><br/><p>Who knew how many lives Zhong Jin had?</p><br/><p>By the way, there was the summoning skill that could summon X\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Who knew if X was an enemy or a friend? The designer of such a perverted game, how could Xie Xi use common sense with him?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at Zhong Jin.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour expression is really tempting.\u201d Zhong Jin glanced over Xie Xi\u2019s face like a searchlight as he mocked, \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that you are a man.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suddenly felt sick.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin put away his smile and asked, \u201cWhere did you get your body freeze?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi deliberately delayed the time. \u201cI bought it in the mall.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou only cleared one world. Where did you get so many silver coins?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cMy luck can\u2019t be so good. I picked the one who cleared the S-grade world at once galnce.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough, he was suspicious. Xie Xi wasn\u2019t surprised since the price of the character freeze was too expensive. Somebody who completed low-grade main tasks absolutely couldn\u2019t afford to biuy it.</p><br/><p>However, at this point in time, it didn\u2019t matter if it was exposed or not.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin stared at him. \u201cIf you are that person, I won\u2019t kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him. \u201cWhat are the conditions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJoin my organization.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked bluntly, \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid that I will pretend to join and then turn things around?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin kept maintaining a certain distance from him.</p><br/><p>Rather than answering Xie Xi\u2019s question, he abruptly changed the subject. \u201cDo you feel sorry for this town?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had no expression on his face.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin said, \u201cIt is true that this town used to be like a painting. It was a very dreamy and beautiful place. I know better than anyone. After all, I painted it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was only involved in drawing the town but I\u2019m not its designer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood. \u201cThis quasi-world was designed by your organization?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin nodded. \u201cYes, we put all our effort into designing it and the zone recognized it as a quasi-world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zone? It was a word Xie Xi was hearing for the first time.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin knew he didn\u2019t understand and patiently explained, \u201cThe zone is the will of the central government. A quasi-world will only be opened after it is recognized by the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked him, \u201cSince this town was designed by you, why do you want to destroy it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDestroy?\u201d Zhong Jin scoffed. \u201cYou misunderstood. I didn\u2019t destroy it. I have been protecting it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin continued, \u201cAfter a quasi-world is opened, the zone will release a variety of tasks and players will enter the world to complete the tasks. Our organization\u2019s ability wasn\u2019t good and the design of this small village is very low. Most of the people who entered the world are newcomers who don\u2019t understand anything. The newcomers did their tasks seriously. Later, they found the residents were simple and ignorant and started\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A hint of pity filled Zhong Jin\u2019s cold eyes. \u201cMy poor children were ruined by them. Shouldn\u2019t I give them a bit of punishment?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stated, \u201cThen you hunted players.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin asked, \u201cShouldn\u2019t those who are persecuted resist?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot all players are guilty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin scoffed. \u201cThat child said it. They were all good when they first entered.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin said again, \u201cI know you have many doubts about me. I do things that are too extreme but it is for this town\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up. \u201cWhat about Sun Yunren?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin\u2019s voice was soft. \u201cShe is my dead lover.\u201d</p><br/><p>He continued, \u201cIt is my fault. I admit it. I designed her after my dead lover because of my selfishness. I love her very much but I also know she isn\u2019t my lover. I\u2019m doomed not to give her a future.\u201d He smiled tragically. \u201cI know you blame me for messing with her but my heart isn\u2019t made of metal. Seeing her like that, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s brow furrowed.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin added, \u201cI pulled you and Song Qi into this game because I took a fancy to your personalities. I know you won\u2019t do any bad things so I hoped you would enter, not others.\u201d</p><br/><p>All doubts seemed to have been explained by Zhong Jin.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin stared at Xie Xi., \u201cJoin us. We might not be as big as Yunge but we will treat you well and give you the best resources.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wavered. \u201cYou are really protecting this town.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Why else would I enter the quasi-world again and again? You should know that repeating low-grade tasks won\u2019t give any rewards and it will also be reversed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case\u2026\u201d Xie Xi walked up to him with a slight frown.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin smiled at him. \u201cRest assured, we\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished when Xie Xi finally got the opportunity to use character freeze on him.</p><br/><p>It was all damn nonsense!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t a three year old child!</p><br/><p>If Zhong Jin was really looking after this small town, it was better to quickly clear the world so that players couldn\u2019t enter. This would also secure a calm and stable life for the residents.</p><br/><p>Why did he keep entering? What did it mean to keep killing players? Wasn\u2019t he driving the residents crazy by intensifying the conflict?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi used three character freezes before running.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that there was no way to stab Zhong Jin!</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin was frozen for three minutes. Once it was lifted, his lips curved in a smile. \u201cReally clever. No wonder why he can clear the S-grade quasi-world.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

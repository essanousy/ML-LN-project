Something that couldn\u2019t be done in reality was real here.</p><br/><p>It was understandable. After watching Xie Xi\u2019s erased memories, forget J and Little Jiang, even Big Jiang wanted to kill himself.</p><br/><p>Therefore, in J\u2019s dream, he would no longer let Xie Xi encounter this \u2018slag man\u2019 in order to prevent Xie Xi from being hurt.</p><br/><p>In the dream, J probably still wasn\u2019t willing to accept it and also felt a bit uneasy, so he had Big Jiang disappear forever.</p><br/><p>Even if there was the next reincarnation, he had to wait until he grew old enough to do things. J and Xie Xi were already locked to death. Forget an iron shovel, he didn\u2019t want to make a gap for even a diamond to drill in.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw the news and said, \u201cIt is unfortunate. He was such a young general.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d If it was unfortunate then don\u2019t kill people!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned over and kissed him. \u201cWhy do you keep staring at him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi followed his thoughts. \u201cHe looks so much like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie immediately became full of smiles and his voice was very gentle. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, that isn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also smiled and grabbed the hand on his shoulder. \u201cIt was right to leave the army. If I had to go to the battlefield now, I will definitely become a deserter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Stars twinkled in Jiang Xie\u2019s black eyes. \u201cBecause of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up at him. \u201cIf the heart is worried then it is inevitable to be timid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie kissed him and whispered, \u201cYou aren\u2019t a deserter. By leaving the army, you can do more for this country.\u201d</p><br/><p>Love and righteousness weren\u2019t mutually exclusive but could be complementary. It was just like big love and little love. They could love a person and their country. The heart was big but it would become as vast as the universe because of a person.</p><br/><p>J\u2019s last part of the dream was like this. Xie Xi was once again sitting on the sofa while watching the news. The contents that emerged was that the e981 rebels were recruited and the leader X was admitted to the underage protection facility due to being a minor.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s fine\u2026 Little Jiang\u2019s treatment was much better than Big Jiang but he was still locked up, which wasn\u2019t much different from reality. Unfortunately, Xie Xi wasn\u2019t the president int he dream and he didn\u2019t enter the presidential palace, let alone meet Little Jiang.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie started to pretend again. \u201cThis X is really young.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi muffled the laugh in his heart. \u201cHe looks exactly the same as you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie questioned, \u201cIsn\u2019t my face very auspicious?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glared at him. \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie liked his anxious appearance and joked, \u201cDo you like my face?\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Xie Xi not know what this person wanted to hear? \u201cI like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart jumped and he looked solemn. \u201cAgain\u2026 say it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke earnestly, \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is love but I want to see you all the time, I want to be with you all the time, I want to keep this life forever\u2026 I hope I can always see you when I open my eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyelashes slightly trembled and he smiled like he was embracing all the beauty of the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is love.\u201d</p><br/><p>He filled his regrets by recounting the most beautiful vows to Xie Xi. \u201cThis time, I won\u2019t leave you alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Living together and dying together was the greatest fortune for two people who loved each other.</p><br/><p>After leaving J\u2019s dream, Xie Xi was still in a bit of a trance.</p><br/><p>The time in the dream was trivial. It felt like a long time but in fact, it was only a few hours. However, the concept of time was never constant in the central government. Whether it was long or short was based on the individual.</p><br/><p>J was still asleep and Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help touching his forehead.</p><br/><p>The souls were different but the essence was the same. They might be different because of different experiences in life but the inside was always the same person.</p><br/><p>This was the person that Xie Xi was familiar with and loved.</p><br/><p>The process of collecting the souls allowed Xie Xi to gain a slow understanding of Jiang Xie. His understanding was comprehensive and the variety of situations couldn\u2019t hide his own Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>He might always complain about the souls doing things but this was an opportunity to understand his lover in all aspects, which was crucial for Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t good at understanding others but now he had learnt a lot.</p><br/><p>Communication, tolerance and trust.</p><br/><p>The experience of the quasi-world was like an exercise, eliminating future dangers and obstacles and covering them with beautiful romantic flowers.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi left J\u2019s room and went to Big Jiang.</p><br/><p>This was too miserable. At least J had the sweetness of the first 200 years. It was true that he had nine rounds of abuse but once a person had a sweet memory, the pain would be washed away and they wouldn\u2019t feel bitter when thinking about it.</p><br/><p>Big J wasn\u2019t the same. Before seeing the memories that Xie Xi erased, he always felt that he had fallen in love with a rational who didn\u2019t understand love. His brain abused himself. Then he saw Xie Xi\u2019s memories and realized that Xie Xi loved him but they missed each other. This made him feel even more abused.</p><br/><p>In particular, he felt that he had hurt Xie Xi and felt guilt and remorse. It was unknown how uncomfortable he was feeling.</p><br/><p>He might be given a sleeping agent but Big Jiang slept in a very restless manner.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi entered and saw this person\u2019s furrowed brow and clenched fists. His mood was too bad and his sleep wasn\u2019t steady. Xie Xi stood by and waited for a while. Once this person slightly calmed down, he used Dreaming.</p><br/><p>There was a slight dizziness and Xie Xi opened his eyes to a stimulation that shot from his waist to his brain.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the kitten was left out of the dream or it would be too unsuitable for children!</p><br/><p>If he knew then he would\u2019ve entered earlier. This person took a long time to calm down and who knew he was dreaming about this?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi got through it with great difficulty until the sky had brightened. His SSS-grade physique wasn\u2019t useless and Jiang Xie had handled him carefully, so there was no discomfort.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie came in while wearing a loose bathrobe. \u201cBreakfast is ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi got up, only to find his legs were a bit soft.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie supported him and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go and get your breakfast.\u201d He talked this way and Xie Xi\u2019s ears trembled from itchiness.</p><br/><p>Xie was so lazy that he simply said, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t say anything else. He carefully placed Xie Xi on the bed and turned away.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took the opportunity to look and found that Big Jiang was a bit cold.</p><br/><p>This dream wasn\u2019t a good dream. If he remembered correctly, this was the two people\u2019s cold period. Xie Xi had been home for three days and it was almost time for the breakup.</p><br/><p>If Jiang Xie wanted to have a good dream, the best node should be when they got together or earlier in the army.</p><br/><p>However, perhaps Big Jiang\u2019s mood was too grey and his desperation too strong. He couldn\u2019t forgive himself so his dream was about the worst time.</p><br/><p>This was the period when Xie Xi deliberately maintained his distance and Jiang Xie thought the young rational was finally tired of sex. It was just that Xie Xi didn\u2019t break up because of Jiang Xie\u2019s boss identity.</p><br/><p>This was the most painful time for Jiang Xie because he got a short sweetness but had to wake up.</p><br/><p>Speaking the words \u2018break up\u2019 with his own mouth was tantamount to stabbing two knives into his heart.</p><br/><p>If Xie Xi didn\u2019t dream then Jiang Xie would be stuck in a repeated nightmare of grief and remorse. How could Xie Xi let this person torture himself again? if Jiang Xie wanted to eat a knife, it should be a knife made of caramel that was sweet when bitten into.</p><br/><p>Soon, Jiang Xie came back. He pushed a table to the bedside and personally set the tableware. Xie Xi sat by the bed and asked, \u201cWhy is there only one set of cutlery?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked him, \u201cHave you eaten?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to eat with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the memories he had seen, the two years of being together were quite sticky. Otherwise, Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t say these words.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t make a sound. Xie Xi hadn\u2019t eaten with him since one month ago but today\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew what this person was thinking. He didn\u2019t care if it was strange since stranger things were to come.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat together.\u201d Xie Xi pated the spot next to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stated, \u201cThe dining cart is too small for two people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about it. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the dining room.\u201d</p><br/><p>An ordinary lover would probably be afraid of being disgusted. However, Jiang Xie just seemed surprised and overwhelmed.</p><br/><p>There were even more startling things. Xie Xi asked again, \u201cI can\u2019t walk. Can you carry me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Big Jiang\u2019s head buzzed and he understood what it was like to be a steam train!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi found it funny but worked hard to stabilize his expression. \u201cI said that you should stop last night. You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was full of remorse and picked up this person. Xie Xi actually wasn\u2019t used to this. He didn\u2019t like this posture and felt it was shameful. Of course, he couldn\u2019t care now. In any case, it was this person\u2019s dream and it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Making this person happy was the most important thing.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, even in the dream, Jiang Xie knew Xie Xi\u2019s temper and there were no outsiders around. Xie Xi sat in the chair and waited for breakfast.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie headed into the kitchen and Xie Xi reminded him, \u201cThe dining cart is still in the bedroom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe food is cold. I will do it again\u2026\u201d He realized his words were wrong and changed them. \u201cI will let them do it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t talk about rational people. These days, even emotional people rarely wasted time in the kitchen.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s lips curved. \u201cBut I\u2019m hungry now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The soft, spoiled tone made Big Jiang\u2019s heart jump.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi continued, \u201cJust eat those dishes. I want porridge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was now like a rational, his arms as stiff as a robot. \u201cI will go and get them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t hold back, his eyes full of laughter. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie turned his head and saw these beautiful eyes full of love. The next moment, Jiang Xie froze. Xie Xi blinked and vaguely felt that he should\u2019ve controlled his emotions. Still, he wasn\u2019t an actor and couldn\u2019t control it live.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at him and called out, \u201cXiao Xie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tried to make himself more rational. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned close to Xie Xi, hand touching his face. \u201cThis is too unreal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart jumped. The corners of Jiang Xie\u2019s lips curved and the smile was full of bitterness. \u201cAm I dreaming?\u201d Otherwise, how could the rational Xie Xi speak to him in such a tone and with this expression in his eyes?</p><br/><p>It was too beautiful, just like he dreamt about for countless days and nights.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, a dream was a dream. In reality, Xie Xi was tired of him and already left him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw a prompt in the lower right corner. [The dream is coming to an end. Please be ready to leave at any time.]</p><br/><p>Other people were awakened by nightmares. Jiang Xie, this person was awakened by a beautiful dream???</p><br/>\n</div>"}

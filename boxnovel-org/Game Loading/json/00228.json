He needed to understand the status quo and know what a succubus was. What was the exchange student and what was angel psychology?</p><br/><p>The old professor was afraid the students would see Xie Xi while watching Jiang Xie and knocked on the blackboard. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s continue understanding the succubus\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The students were very studious. They pricked their ears and listened seriously.</p><br/><p>Demonology was a new course. Originally, it was banned and they couldn\u2019t learn about it. Now it was possible to listen to it in the classroom and there was a pure succubus student, which greatly satisfied the curiosity of the students. It made them focus their spirits like never before.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also listened seriously. Who would expect that a succubus needed to listen carefully to understand what was going on?</p><br/><p>Of course, his appearance was interpreted differently in the eyes of others.</p><br/><p>The average student was afraid to look at him so let\u2019s ignore them. Jiang Xie sitting next to him was very pleased. Excluding the debauched living habits, his roommate was very respectful. He could still be so seriously when listening to a course he knew better than the professor. This was a serious and good student.</p><br/><p>The old professor was also very pleased. Xie Xi was worthy of being a top student of the Demon World. A good seed had indeed come here as a transfer student.</p><br/><p>While feeling pleased, the old professor thought carefully, \u2018I absolutely can\u2019t let him teach. If the young people have to stare at him, they will never be able to hold their meditation chants!\u2019</p><br/><p>The good student Xie Xi didn\u2019t know what these people were thinking and was seriously doing a class summary.</p><br/><p>Succubus, one of the seven big demons that majored in lust.</p><br/><p>Simply put, this race was a walking hormone. They fed on sex and treated it as common as eating and drinking water for ordinary people. They weren\u2019t subject to ethics and morality and were free to do what they pleased.</p><br/><p>A succubus was born with excellent charms and their bewitchment ability was embedded deep in their bones. Forget simple angels, even the other big demons of the Demon World would find it hard to resist one\u2019s seduction.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi summed up the so-called living habits of a succubus.</p><br/><p>First, a succubus hated clothes. In particular, they never wore clothes at night.</p><br/><p>Second, a succubus liked sex. This was a survival instinct.</p><br/><p>Third, after bathing, a succubus would emit the fragrance of an aphrodisiac. People must avoid inhaling this.</p><br/><p>Fourth\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt there was no longer any need to sum it up. He was simply a pervert!</p><br/><p>He thought that Gemini was a good Jiang Xie. Who would\u2019ve expected Gemini\u2019s world to go in such a direction?</p><br/><p>This person also set himself up as a pure angel of abstinence. Xie Xi thought with no expression, \u2018Once back at Central, I can help him abstain from sex!\u2019</p><br/><p>This class was basically about the succubus. After the lecture, the old professor came up with a special \u2018humanitarian\u2019 sentence, \u201cEveryone must respect their racial habits and not force our ethics on other races. We must open our hearts to accept and understand different races. Don\u2019t wear coloured glasses and discriminate against other races.\u201d</p><br/><p>The students needed seriously while Xie Xi was different. He discriminated against himself.</p><br/><p>After class, Jiang Xie asked Xie Xi, \u201cAre you hungry? I\u2019ll take you to lunch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was a bit hungry and the professor said that a succubus in a hungry state would have very high XX desires. Xie Xi was afraid and swore to never be hungry in this world!</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d The moment Xie Xi opened his mouth, he was startled by his own voice.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was also a good angel who listened carefully in class. He was particularly aware of the succubus so his ears trembled and his voice was tight. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll have food soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t in a hurry. He wasn\u2019t hungry enough to seduce Jiang Xie. He was\u2026 really hungry.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ahhh, bastard Jiang Xie, wait until we get back to Central and I\u2019ll beat you up!\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t speak\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie took him to the cafeteria and found a private room. He told Xie Xi, \u201cWait for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie glanced at him and quickly moved his gaze away. He walked away in a manner that could be called fleeing.</p><br/><p>There was a circular mirror decoration in the private room. Xie Xi looked into it and was shocked by himself.</p><br/><p>The corners of his eyes were drooping, his eyes were moist, his cheeks were red and his lips were bright red!</p><br/><p>He was just hungry. How did he look like this? No wonder why Jiang Xie had fled\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi got up and intended to wash his face to calm himself down. He regretted it after becoming wet with water.</p><br/><p>The third note about a succubus\u2014there was a special fragrance after bathing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t smell it himself but Jiang Xie certainly could.</p><br/><p>Was it still too late to open the window and get some air?</p><br/><p>The window was facing the playground. What if the fragrance spread and affected other people?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi deeply felt his sin. He wanted to change the textbook and cross out the sentence about non-discrimination. This succubus race should fall to the bottom of the chain. They deserved to be discriminated against!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie came back in a hurry, apparently afraid that Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help stealing food.</p><br/><p>Stealing\u2026 this word flashed in Xie Xi\u2019s head and he couldn\u2019t help sneering. What a wonderful pun. (TL: This word for stealing food can also mean \u2018to be unfaithful.\u2019)</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie brought lunch and squinted. \u201cEat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t open the window to let out the scent. Instead, he directly closed the door and blocked the window so that the fragrance was trapped inside.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to be normal and wasn\u2019t polite. \u201cThen I\u2019ll eat first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d He remained motionless.</p><br/><p>Once Xie Xi ate some rice, his hunger subsided. He inadvertently glanced towards the mirror and found that he had miraculously returned to normal.</p><br/><p>The colour of food when eating was very important. Comrade Jiang Xie\u2019s understanding of this sentence was very deep.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was free to pay attention to Gemini. \u201cYou aren\u2019t hungry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had just chanted the meditation mantra and couldn\u2019t afford to care about eating. \u201cI\u2019ll eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cThen I will trouble you to come buy textbooks with me after eating.\u201d He wanted to know more about this small world and see how big Jiang Xie\u2019s brain hole was.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cThere is no class in the afternoon. I\u2019ll take you out and see if we can come back before the welcome party.\u201d Then he got up and went to the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi watched him push open the door and his senses returned. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had already pushed it open and the life-threatening fragrance poured out. Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI just washed my hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was worthy of being an excellent student of theology. He calmly closed the door and said, \u201cI\u2019m going out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cOkay\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie went away for 20 minutes. Once he came back, his hair was slightly wet and his body was chilly.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t have to ask to know where he had gone. This wasn\u2019t a shower, it was a cold shower!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke dutifully, \u201cI won\u2019t eat. Let\u2019s go and buy books.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to say, \u201cI can go by myself\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie interrupted, \u201cI am your roommate and must try my best to take care of you, helping you adapt to the environment on this side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him with concern, thinking, \u2018Will this young man be okay?\u2019</p><br/><p>How could he not be a man? Jiang Xie was very calm. \u201cLet\u2019s go. You haven\u2019t gone out to explore since coming here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also wanted to see this small world and what exactly was going on here.</p><br/><p>It really wasn\u2019t a normal world when he had to go off campus to buy books.</p><br/><p>However, there was nothing special outside the school. It wasn\u2019t much different from 21st century Earth.</p><br/><p>Of course, Xie Xi\u2019s Earth didn\u2019t have a wonderful race like the succubus.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had calmed down and carefully gave an introduction to Xie Xi. \u201cThis is a university town. Basically, they are all students or teachers. However, they are high-quality and won\u2019t show their wings in order to take care of students who haven\u2019t graduated.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. It wasn\u2019t good to ask too much and he could only secretly store it in his brain.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie introduced the nearest supermarket and pedestrian street. \u201cWhat are you missing? You can come here to buy them\u2026\u201d Then he paused and spoke again, \u201cOf course, there are many people here. If you can\u2019t adapt then you can call me to join you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi translated in his heart, \u2018It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t adapt. I am afraid that these university students can\u2019t adapt!\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cThere is nothing missing for the time being.\u201d</p><br/><p>The pair finally arrived at the bookstore and Jiang Xie said, \u201cHere we are. This is the biggest bookstore in First Heaven.\u201d</p><br/><p>First Heaven?</p><br/><p>First Heaven, meaning Heaven?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought that he understood correctly. The problem was that Heaven was so\u2026 human?</p><br/><p>They entered the bookstore and the clerk couldn\u2019t help peeking at Xie Xi. Jiang Xie took him to the third floor and placed him in a relatively quiet place. \u201cThe textbooks are fixed and I will help you find them. Wait here for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood that this was to prevent him from hooking up with people.</p><br/><p>He nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d He could take the opportunity to flip through books and understand the status quo.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie left and Xie Xi swept through the books on the shelves, suddenly feeling it was different.</p><br/><p>This truly wasn\u2019t 21st century Earth. The human society didn\u2019t have a history of Heaven that couldn\u2019t be put on a whole wall\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s memories had been strengthened and his reading ability was also fast. In a short time, he found out many things.</p><br/><p>There was a Heaven and Demon World in this world. It was very different from Xie Xi\u2019s impression of angels and demons. Here, they were two countries that lived in harmony.</p><br/><p>There were seven realms in Heaven and seven domains in the Demon World, all of which were similar in size and scale.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the angels and demons had developed both theology and science.</p><br/><p>The First Heaven and First Domain basically weren\u2019t much different from the human society that Xie Xi understood. Regardless of whether it was Heaven or the Demon World, education was very important for the angels and demons. If they wanted to be adults, they needed complete credit and to graduate from a university before they could get a license to support their wings.</p><br/><p>Wings in Heaven were a symbol of status and graduation scores were actually linked to the number of wings. Xie Xi pursed his lips when he saw this and there was a sense he was seeing the university entrance examination.</p><br/><p>Most of the books here were based on \u2018angels.\u2019 Forgive Xie Xi but he really couldn\u2019t see the students in schools as sacred angels.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t like angels at all!</p><br/><p>In 10 minutes, Jiang Xie returned with a cardboard box filled with books.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cThanks, let me carry it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi added, \u201cThe checkout is on the first floor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cAs long as you have a student ID card, these books are free of charge and you don\u2019t have to pay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded, thinking that Heaven\u2019s treatment wasn\u2019t bad.</p><br/><p>They went to buy some daily necessities. Jiang Xie specifically took Xie Xi to the underwear section, his hint very obvious.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could only buy a bag of underwear, indicating that he was a normal person who would wear underwear in the future.</p><br/><p>It was evening when they got back to school.</p><br/><p>Heaven was above the sun. Even in First Heaven, there was no sun rising. The holy light came from Seventh Heaven and would light up and got out according to time.</p><br/><p>It was for this reason that Heaven was called dark.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi returned to the dormitory and Jiang Xie said, \u201cGet ready. We have to go to the welcome party.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie picked up his uniform and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go to the bathroom.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. He didn\u2019t mind seeing Jiang Xie change clothes but Jiang Xie obviously minded.</p><br/><p>Okay, it was good for everyone if the two people changed clothes separately.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had just taken off his clothes and changed into his school uniform when he realized.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t get dressed after taking a shower last night\u2026</p><br/><p>This damn thing! Xie Xi watched his school uniform disappear.</p><br/><p>The first succubus habit: A succubus hated clothes. In particular, they never wore clothes at night.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned and he wanted to say, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to wear it. I can\u2019t wear it!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Jiang Xie came out of the bathroom. He was wearing a silver-white school uniform. The priest-style robes fit perfectly on his body and gave him a sacred atmosphere.</p><br/><p>The holy angel saw his naked roommate.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stated, \u201cMy school uniform is gone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned for a long time before his senses returned. His tight voice was a bit indulgent and helpless \u201cI know you don\u2019t like to wear clothes at night but you have to be dressed for this welcome party.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie thought he got rid of his school uniform because he didn\u2019t want to wear clothes at night?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

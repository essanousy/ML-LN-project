Being handsome was invalid so he pretended to be pitiful. \u201cThe background of this world is mythical and he has been alive for hundreds of years. I am only seeing irrelevant things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie realized his gaffe. \u201cAll your things are the most important to me. It is natural that I can\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was moved but he couldn\u2019t help repeating, \u201cHow are you useful?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned towards his delicate neck and sucked it. \u201cYou see, I can grow strawberries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>He would kill this bastard! That way, he wouldn\u2019t have to marry an N number of people!</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d Jiang Xie told him, \u201cAccording to my speculation, this Azure Dragon should be suspicious that you have another love. He doesn\u2019t know why you agreed to his proposal. You don\u2019t love him and the encounter on Baihua Mountain was even deliberately planned by you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cI can\u2019t directly see his thoughts but I have a brain. I can guess according to his actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was skeptical about this person having a brain!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke again. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t found the person but he has preliminary suspicions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was wary. \u201cWho is it?</p><br/><p>\u201cHis left and right hand men, his trusted aide the Qilin, his second uncle the White Dragon, his younger brother and younger sister\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was gobsmacked. \u201cIf you don\u2019t talk seriously, I\u2019ll leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie looked innocent. \u201cI am telling the truth. He is basically doubting everyone you have met on the Holy Mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cPsychopath.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sighed. \u201cThere is no other way. Who let you pedal six boats and leave a shadow that can\u2019t be erased on the heart of the fourth child.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was furious. \u201cAre you blaming me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlame me, blame me.\u201d Jiang Xie hurriedly shouldered the blame. \u201cBlame me that every hair loves you so much that they can\u2019t extricate themselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was inexplicably frightened by these words. Surely this bastard didn\u2019t have as many souls as his hair? Xie Xi would die! Jiang Xie knew him too well and knew what Xie Xi was thinking with one glance. He smiled bitterly and said, \u201cYour husband is powerful but I can\u2019t split apart so many souls.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had to firmly hold onto the present him. He had divided his soul so much that he would scatter if he did it anymore.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt something wrong and glanced at him. \u201cDividing your soul has an impact on you.\u201d He had long suspected it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cSince it isn\u2019t good, why not give up on using your soul to design a quasi-world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was sometimes afraid of this child\u2019s keenness. \u201cIf I don\u2019t design the quasi-worlds, how could I meet you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned. \u201cThis\u2026\u201d He was too confused!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t wait for him to speak. \u201cIf I couldn\u2019t meet you, what is the point of living endlessly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie continued, \u201cThis is a profitable business with no losses. How could I miss it?\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke vaguely but Xie Xi understood.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie mentioned there were no mature designers in the Central World.</p><br/><p>X was the leader of the current age but his highest design was an SS-grade quasi-world. Then who designed the SSS and higher grade worlds?</p><br/><p>It was unknown because these people were gone.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie said that he had no talent and relied on his souls to design the world. At the time, Xie Xi had thought, \u2018Isn\u2019t the soul also a talent?\u2019</p><br/><p>Now he understood that consuming the soul was consuming oneself and it wasn\u2019t a long-term solution.</p><br/><p>In particular, Jiang Xie\u2019s worlds couldn\u2019t be entered which meant the released souls couldn\u2019t come back. Yet he kept designing quasi-worlds over and over\u2026</p><br/><p>In Xie Xi\u2019s absence, Jiang Xie would\u2019ve eventually scattered among the countless quasi-worlds of his own design.</p><br/><p>It was only by meeting Xie Xi that Jiang Xie brought himself back from the countless quasi-worlds.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why he said there were no losses.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s nose was slightly sour and he felt both angry and distressed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie coaxed him, \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi exclaimed furiously, \u201cI don\u2019t care about you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I should release more souls\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi covered his mouth. \u201cHow can you say that?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie kissed the palm of his hand. \u201cIt is because I have a kind little rose.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt stuffy. \u201cI\u2019m not kind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s voice was low and almost inaudible. \u201cI just like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everything he did had nothing to do with kindness. He just liked Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie froze for a moment before pressing this person down onto the bed. \u201cThat is a foul.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi lay down and stared up at him with wide eyes.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared into his eyes and spoke in a hoarse voice, \u201cWhat do you want me to do? 100 words of love can\u2019t match your sentence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes curved. \u201cIt isn\u2019t because you said too much\u2026 it is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t dare listen or else he would be drowned in syrup.</p><br/><p>The two of them went a bit too far. Jiang Xie wondered, \u201cShould we do it in advance?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pushed him. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were so seductive at the banquet. Holding my hand and also biting my ear\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was dissatisfied. \u201cWho bit your ear?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie exaggerated. \u201cYou came so close that my ear was numb. You didn\u2019t bite it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi realized he had fallen on his own into the pit. \u201cI wanted to be alone with Azure Dragon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou wanted to see me.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was true.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do with me? Both of us alone in bed.\u201d The more he spoke, the less serious he was and the more honest his hands were.</p><br/><p>The two people helped each other and Jiang Xie became full. \u201cI will stay overnight. Don\u2019t do anything too unspeakable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi scolded him with a trembling voice. \u201cYou\u2019re here to help me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jiang Xie grinned. \u201cI am a big help.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next morning, light footsteps were heard outside. Azure Dragon opened his eyes, the colour returning to indigo.</p><br/><p>He bowed his head and saw the man quietly sleeping in his arms.</p><br/><p>This person slept soundly and at ease, the white collarbone showing a few red dots on it.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon\u2019s heart was hot and he wanted to kiss this person, but couldn\u2019t bear to wake him up.</p><br/><p>He had to return to the Holy Mountain before dawn since there were many things to handle.</p><br/><p>The outside attendant had been standing for a while and couldn\u2019t wait any longer.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon quietly moved his arm and carefully didn\u2019t wake up the sleeping person.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi slept soundly and didn\u2019t sense it.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon stared at this sleeping face and felt relieved and uneasy.</p><br/><p>He was relieved because he didn\u2019t wake up Xie Xi but uneasy because he couldn\u2019t touch the heart under this beautiful face.</p><br/><p>Everyone said that the foxes were confusing but he felt that no one could match this little rose.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t speak or even look at him yet Azure Dragon couldn\u2019t restrain his heart.</p><br/><p>Even if he knew\u2026 He refused to let go. Azure Dragon recalled the sweetness of last night and there was a sharp sting from his ice cold heart.</p><br/><p>By the time Xie Xi woke up, no one was around. Gone?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know if it was Jiang Xie or Azure Dragon. Well\u2026 there was no difference. Neither of them would wake up in. In the 60 years in the dream, Jiang Xie had always been careful when waking up first\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled and sweetness had just filled his heart when he sighed.</p><br/><p>He was worried. It used to be for clearing the task but now he was worried about the soul.</p><br/><p>If he did something terrible to the soul, he would be the one suffering in the next world!</p><br/><p>In Atlantis, he proposed to five people. Now there was likely to be five weddings\u2026</p><br/><p>Well, Jiang Xie was a wedding madman!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi got up to wash. He had just finished cleaning up when there was a loud noise from outside. \u201cWhat happened? How could Purple Nine be hurt so badly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard this and hurried out.</p><br/><p>It might all be a setting but Purple Nine took care of him as a younger brother and the feelings were real. Xie Xi stopped when he went outside.</p><br/><p>Red Three was holding a large rose flower. There were absolutely no roses this large in reality. It was 20 centimeters full and was completely purple. It was very beautiful but more than half of the petals had fallen off.</p><br/><p>A little girl was crying and using her clothes to pick up the fallen petals. \u201cSister Purple Nine did it for us! An insect monster broke through the enchantment and sneakily attacked the nursery. Sister Purple Nine drove them away but was also injured!\u201d</p><br/><p>Red Three was anxious. \u201cQuickly, go find the chief! Purple Nine is too weak and if she isn\u2019t treated\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, the elderly rose family\u2019s chief came over. He saw Purple Nine\u2019s appearance and trembled. \u201cP-Put her in the water first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was also anxious but unfortunately, he didn\u2019t know much. He didn\u2019t dare say anything and only listened to the situation.</p><br/><p>Red Three and Purple Nine had a good relationship. He asked, \u201cChief, will Purple Nine be okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>The chief paused.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart rose in his chest.</p><br/><p>Red Three paled and then he saw Xie Xi. \u201c99! Go and ask Lord Azure Dragon to save Purple Nine!\u201d The chief shook his head. \u201cIt is useless. No one can repair such an injury.\u201d</p><br/><p>Repair?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi strode forward. \u201cI will try it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Red Three\u2019s eyes were red. \u201cYes, let\u2019s try it. 99, I will go with you to the Holy Mountain to find Lord Azure Dragon\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will be too late by the time we reach the Holy Mountain.\u201d Xie Xi stated, \u201cStep aside, I\u2019ll try to fix it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone present was stunned.</p><br/><p>It was true that Xie Xi inherited the name of the flower god and was the future companion of Lord Azure Dragon. Even so, he was essentially an ordinary little rose. How could he\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t waste time. He took the petals from the little girl\u2019s arms and carefully discerned the direction. \u201cDo you know what Sister Purple Nine originally looked like?\u201d</p><br/><p>The chief had lived for a long time and had more experience. He stopped asking questions and quickly replied, \u201cI know the order of the petals. I\u2019ve memorize it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi relaxed. \u201cThat\u2019s good. Chief, please tell me the position of the petals.\u201d</p><br/><p>Red Three also reacted and waved his hand. \u201cEveryone out, we shouldn\u2019t disturb the chief and 99.\u201d</p><br/><p>The anxious roses all left and only the seriously injured Purple Nine, the chief, Red Three and Xie Xi were left in the room.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked about the position of the petals and started to use Repair.</p><br/><p>At first, the chief was skeptical. Then he saw that the petals were \u2018repaired\u2019 and became convinced.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi used Repair a total of 70 times to restore all the fallen petals.</p><br/><p>Red Three was filled with joy. \u201cShe\u2019s okay! Purple Nine is okay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was relieved. He had used Repair to help a lot of people but this was the first time repairing a flower.</p><br/><p>The chief trembled with excitement. \u201cFlower god, the reincarnation of the flower god!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi explained, \u201cThis is something that Lord Azure Dragon taught me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d The chief explained, \u201cThis is the power of the flower god. I saw it when I was young. He repaired the scales of Sage Azure Dragon, the tail feathers of Sage Vermillion Bird, the wings of the White Tiger\u2026 it is said that he also repaired the three tails of the nine tailed demon ancestor and the Houqing ancestor\u2026\u201d (TL: Apparently Houqing is a zombie from Ancient China?)</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As it turned out, Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t as good as an old rose.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi identified at least five souls from this remark.</p><br/><p>\u2026Azure Dragon, Vermillion Bird, White Tiger, Nine Tailed Fox and Houqing.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know if there was also the Black Tortoise, Bai Ze, Qiong Ji, Tao Tie and so on.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was fearless and didn\u2019t mind collecting them all.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

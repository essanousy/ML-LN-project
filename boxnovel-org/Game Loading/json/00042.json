The situation was very delicate.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tried to persuade him with words. Unfortunately, he felt his own words were very weak.</p><br/><p>What was Sirius thinking?</p><br/><p>Who could send out so many special guards apart from his close relatives?</p><br/><p>The only difference was whether it was a father or a brother, but it was all the same for the sixth prince.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at the sixth prince. \u201cYour Highness, are we going back?\u201d</p><br/><p>The conspiracy had been revealed. Would Sirius return to the bottom of the sea? Did he still want to go back to the palace when he was abandoned by his family?</p><br/><p>What should Xie Xi do if the sixth prince didn\u2019t return? He still had his task to do!</p><br/><p>\u201cGo back.\u201d The sixth prince stated.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up at him.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince\u2019s demeanour was different from before. His lonely and tender voice was replaced with a firm will. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we go back? It is our home and where we lived.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi realized that the prince in front of him had changed.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince looked at him and said, \u201cSein, thank you. I won\u2019t escape again. I won\u2019t be cowardly and will face everything. I won\u2019t give up on myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was full of relief and nodded with warm eyes. \u201cIt is great that Your Highness can cheer up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sirius had been silent for 19 years. He hadn\u2019t fought for himself for 19 years. Now he finally had feelings that he wanted to guard, a person he wanted to protect no matter what\u2026</p><br/><p>This gave him a new life and the courage to face everything.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to be a disposable pawn at the mercy of others! He didn\u2019t want to let his cherished people encounter danger!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his mouth, \u201cThe bodies have to be disposed of. I will go to the ship to see if there are any tools.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sirius told him, \u201cThere are storage bags in the back warehouse. We have to break these bodies back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The presence of the underwater people\u2019s bodies left on the shore could cause problems.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cOkay, I will grab them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sirius was afraid that these special guards weren\u2019t dead and wanted to send Xie Xi away to deal with them. Thus, he nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>Now Xie Xi was used to his legs and it wasn\u2019t hard to walk. It didn\u2019t take him long to return to the ship and the moment he opened the back warehouse\u2026</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>There was a bright light. Xie Xi was stunned while Roast Pork Bun screamed in his ear, \u201cIt is explosives!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, it was too late. Xie Xi\u2019s face and body were blown to pieces.</p><br/><p>He later realized\u2026 the ship had long been tampered with. If the special guards failed, the prince would be blown up when he returned.</p><br/><p>The fuel used for returning was placed in the back warehouse. The sixth prince would definitely open it when going back. These explosives were specifically meant for the underwater people. Despite the sixth prince\u2019s ability, he would definitely die.</p><br/><p>The killer behind the scenes was really tough.</p><br/><p>The explosion pierced Sirius\u2019 brain like a needle. He turned his head and saw the blaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cSein\u2026\u201d Sirius was pale and he ran at the fastest speed.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that he was too late. The whole ship had been burned to ashes and there was only the shadow of half a person.</p><br/><p>Sirius was dazed, his eyes empty as he failed to understand the situation in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Sein, it is impossible, impossible\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He murmured in the midst of a nightmare. A red aura emerged from his body and enveloped him like a bloody fog.</p><br/><p>\u201cSein, Sein, Sein\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice gradually grew louder.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswer me!\u201d At his scream, the water behind him surged and a wave that was over 10 metres high crashed down.</p><br/><p>The burning ship was extinguished but there was nothing apart from the dark wreckage and the grey smoke.</p><br/><p>Sirius rushed up and rummaged through the burnt remains.</p><br/><p>\u201cSein, Sein, where are you? Tell me! Tell me where you are!\u201d</p><br/><p>His screams were almost made. He seemed crazy as he looked for possibilities in a pile of impossible.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was indeed blown to pieces but he didn\u2019t die.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun judged that this fatal injury\u2019s pain level was too high and he launched the fatal injuries immunity.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun\u2019s three lives were painless so not only was Xie Xi still alive, he wasn\u2019t in any pain at all.</p><br/><p>He sank to the bottom of the water, looking at the pieces of his body being put back together, his mood very complicated.</p><br/><p>He heard Sirius\u2019 cry and felt Sirius\u2019 grief.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t go to see Sirius.</p><br/><p>It was too difficult to explain why Xie Xi was still alive when he had been blown up.</p><br/><p>The save point had disappeared after the guards were taken care of and it was impossible to load the file.</p><br/><p>Thus, Sein Hall was dead.</p><br/><p>Dead people couldn\u2019t be resurrected.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun was crying as he flew over and rubbed his furry head against Sirius, clumsily comforting him.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that Sirius couldn\u2019t feel it. He kept digging into the mess, trying to get back his Sein Hall.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t bear to see anymore.</p><br/><p>Then there was a change in the lower right corner.</p><br/><p>On the task progress bar, the blue colour representing the sixth prince surged to 16.6666\u2026%</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew this was the maximum value because the blue colour gradually became a full green.</p><br/><p>He had seen this colour before. In the first world, there was such a green progress bar underneath the number of days he survived.</p><br/><p>Each colour represented a different prince and turning green should represent that the prince\u2019s love collection was full.</p><br/><p>A while ago, Xie Xi could joke that it was a crafty escape, but now he couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Death.</p><br/><p>It was really cruel.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s body was restored and he could move. Roast Pork Bun flew back and cried out, \u201cDaddy, quickly go to see him. He is sad!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi used Camouflage and replaced his face.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun reacted. \u201cDaddy, don\u2019t you want him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was pierced and he sighed, \u201cThis is better for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>He admired Sirius and regarded him as a friend. However, Sirius\u2019 feelings towards him were different.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was destined not to return these feelings so it was better to simply cut if off.</p><br/><p>Once a person died, nothing could happen.</p><br/><p>Time would fade everything.</p><br/><p>Even so\u2026</p><br/><p>Garbage X, garbage task!</p><br/><p>The souls didn\u2019t have his consciousness. Silly Fork, even abusing them!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really wanted to beat up X!</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun sensed Xie Xi\u2019s bad mood and wondered, \u201cWe really aren\u2019t going back? How can we return to the bottom of the sea without Sirius\u2019 help?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had a small physique. If he swam back to the bottom of the sea, it would be really cold.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, Xie Xi didn\u2019t know the path. If he swam back, who knew where he would swim to?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew that Roast Pork Bun was still hoping for Sein Hall\u2019s resurrection.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, it was impossible for Sein Hall to live again.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t belong to this world. He came here to clear the task, not to trap himself here.</p><br/><p>How could he get back to the undersea kingdom? He couldn\u2019t ask Sirius for help but he had to go back in the shortest possible time.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s brain worked and he had a thought. He could summon X\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>This skill had a cooldown time and should be available again after the last time it was used.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at his skills bar and indeed, the summoning X skill was shown to be available.</p><br/><p>Since X could design a world under the sea, surely he wouldn\u2019t be afraid of water?</p><br/><p>If he was afraid of water, bad luck.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sneered. He couldn\u2019t wait to push X into the water to feed the fish!</p><br/><p>He used the skill and X appeared. X was very good in the water and didn\u2019t look confused. He leaned over to bow and said, \u201cMaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>The originally angry Xie Xi saw his strange eyes and more than half of his anger disappeared.</p><br/><p>Sirius was worthy of being his soul.</p><br/><p>Especially the eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought of the poor sixth prince and felt distressed while also hating X.</p><br/><p>Stupid Fork, a silly Fork!</p><br/><p>After Jiang Xie was summoned, he couldn\u2019t see the goodwill. Otherwise, he would definitely see the wonders of red and green.</p><br/><p>The -1 and +1 flew, the red and green colours mixing together was exciting.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s face was cold as he ordered, \u201cSend me to the bottom of the sea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was smart. \u201cDo you know where the bottom of the sea is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t reveal anything. \u201cVertically downwards.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him because it was too easy to be reminded of Sirius. Then he impatiently said, \u201cThere is an underwater kingdom. Can you send me there in three minutes?\u201d It was okay if he was sent halfway because he should be able to swim the rest of the way himself.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked, \u201cAre any of your things there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cI live there.\u201d There were quite a few of his items.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, then I can send you to your place of residence.\u201d</p><br/><p>What type of skill was this? A dog nose tracker? Xie Xi was slightly surprised and thought that this X really wasn\u2019t simple.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie came close to him. \u201cI will offend you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled. \u201cWhat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished speaking when Jiang Xie easily lifted him up.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cThe speed is very fast and you will be uncomfortable.\u201d Xie Xi was uncomfortable with this position but he couldn\u2019t care too much. The speed definitely had to be fast if he wanted to arrive at the bottom of the sea in three minutes. He would probably be thrown out along the way if they were just holding hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t delay the time.\u201d Xie Xi thought of the poor sixth prince and didn\u2019t want to show X a good face.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told hi, \u201cDon\u2019t be stubborn. You can sleep if you can\u2019t stand it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glared at him. \u201cGo!\u201d What nonsense. What was unbearable and how could he sleep?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie looked down at him, thin lips curving slightly.</p><br/><p>It was too late for Xie Xi to think about the meaning of this smile. He was shocked by the sudden acceleration.</p><br/><p>F-F-Fast!</p><br/><p>They travelled such a long distance in only three minutes. The speed was terrible. Xie Xi had been pulling away from X\u2019s chest and now he grabbed the clothes and directly stuck to X.</p><br/><p>His head was almost stirred into a paste.</p><br/><p>30 seconds later, Xie Xi understood why X had told him to go to sleep if he couldn\u2019t stand it.</p><br/><p>How was this sleeping? It was passing out!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. Xiao Xi felt dizzy and fainted.</p><br/><p>It took only one minute for Jiang Xie to reach the bottom of the sea. He swaggered into the palace of Atlantis and it was like the guards were blind. They couldn\u2019t see him at all.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was unconscious, his fingers still clutching X\u2019s clothes.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had resonated with his soul after coming to this quasi-world. The pain of the sixth prince lingered in his heart.</p><br/><p>The taste of the person he liked disappearing in front of him was indescribable.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the person wasn\u2019t dead and was sleeping peacefully in Jiang Xie\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>The lost ecstasy was also fascinating.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie bowed his head and kissed Xie Xi gently on the white forehead. He was cautious and afraid of shocking Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d Jiang Xie made him fall into a deeper sleep.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s hands relaxed, his brow slightly furrowing as his thin lips moved, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s dream reached the peak. \u201c\u2026Sirius, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>This little guy was really gentle.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared down at the youth without blinking.</p><br/><p>If he had met Xie Xi earlier\u2026</p><br/><p>No, it wasn\u2019t too late.</p><br/><p>Before the summoning time ended, Jiang Xie looked at the elf. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun didn\u2019t know who this person was and asked cautiously, \u201cHandsome guy, who are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour dad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>His dad couldn\u2019t be so handsome. Oh, his dad was really handsome!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Roast Pork Bun approached.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie started patting his small back.</p><br/><p>This action was extremely light, as if he was playing around. Roast Pork Bun felt the slapping of the hand and meowed like crazy.</p><br/><p>Ahhhhhhhhh\u2026</p><br/><p>The kitten\u2019s screams were blocked by Jiang Xie and he was moved away so that he wouldn\u2019t wake Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun thought his life was ending. Who knew that after 10 seconds, he would feel power surging in his body.</p><br/><p>What was going on?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cWait for Xie Xi to wake up and then ask him for some physical potions. If you drink them, you can evolve.\u201d</p><br/><p>The small cat blinked.</p><br/><p>He wanted to ask again but the handsome dad who almost killed him had disappeared.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi slept and after waking up, he couldn\u2019t figure out where he was\u2026</p><br/><p>Oh, he summoned X and asked to be sent back to the bottom of the sea.</p><br/><p>Then\u2026 he was knocked unconscious by the speed.</p><br/><p>He was really useless. Xie Xi wanted to return to the Central World. After completing three tasks, he could improve his basic qualities!</p><br/><p>He was back at the bottom of the sea and the hard battle was just beginning.</p><br/><p>Sein Hall was dead.</p><br/><p>There was still the fifth prince remaining.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the sixth prince, Xie Xi discovered that he couldn\u2019t focus on a single prince. He must equally collect the love of all six princes.</p><br/><p>There was also the side mission. Oh, the side mission could die. He just wanted to get out of here!</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun was buzzing like a fly. \u201cDaddy, Daddy, I\u2019m so hungry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi froze and looked at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>The kitten spread its wings and twirled around. \u201cHungry, hungry, hungry, hungry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi showed dislike on the surface but he actually very very pained. He panicked at this sudden situation. \u201cWhy are you suddenly hungry?\u201d</p><br/><p>The kitten had never eaten anything before.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun actually felt thirsty and hungry and made tearful eyes. \u201cI\u2019m so uncomfortable. Daddy, I\u2019m uncomfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi anxiously asked it, \u201cWhat can you eat? Tell me, I\u2019ll get it for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun remembered the words of the handsome guy and replied, \u201cPhysical medicine, I can eat physical medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Xie Xi had brought physical medicine with him. This potion level was very low but the effect was okay. Since items could be stacked up, he brought many bottles with him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi quickly took it out and fed it to Roast Pork Bun.</p><br/><p>The kitten hugged the physical medicine and drank, the liquid overflowing from his mouth.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cSlow down, don\u2019t choke.\u201d</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun still felt thirsty after a bottle. Xie Xi hurriedly gave him a few more bottles.</p><br/><p>After drinking a full six bottles, Roast Pork Bun finally calmed down.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s forehead was sweaty. \u201cIs it better?\u201d</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun flashed gold and a hint appeared in the lower right corner.</p><br/><p>[Congratulations, the elf Roast Pork Bun has evolved to the beginner level and activated the skill: Dreaming.]</p><br/>\n</div>"}

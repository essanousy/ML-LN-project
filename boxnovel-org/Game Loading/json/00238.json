They were all talented people!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was afraid that Jiang Xie would abuse himself and hurriedly changed the topic. \u201cI have no impression of what happened in the past. How do I wake up the Demon God?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was worthy of being an \u2018old hand\u2019 at this. The translation was that he didn\u2019t remember the Demon God at all and the next sentence drove forward the main point and making it a gesture of public service.</p><br/><p>This attitude barely gave Jiang Xie a slight comfort. Then Sloth deliberately stimulated Jiang Xie. \u201cAs long as you absorb the memories from before your reincarnation, you will know how to wake up the Demon God.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew there was a pit in front of him but he hadn\u2019t expected the pit to be so deep!</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t recover his memories, Jiang Xie would think he was a substitute. If Xie Xi took back the memories, he could wake up the Demon God but what about the angel? Would it be minutes before Heaven collapsed?</p><br/><p>The world was innocent. Don\u2019t let it be destroyed so easily!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie immediately cried out, \u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was already very upset. If Xie Xi acquired the memories, would he still be with Xie Xi?</p><br/><p>Envy sneered. \u201cThere is no room for you to speak here.\u201d This was too much.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t happy but he could understand the mood of the domain masters. After all, the Demon World would collapse. If it could be saved using the memories of Xie Xi\u2019s past life, they wouldn\u2019t frown if they had to sacrifice Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Still, Xie Xi wasn\u2019t happy. Angel Jiang was pitiful enough, why keep bullying him?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi held Jiang Xie\u2019s hand and told him, \u201cI will listen to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The words stunned everyone present. Jiang Xie glanced at Xie Xi but before he could open his mouth, Envy cried out, \u201cXie Xi, are you crazy? For this man, you don\u2019t care about the Demon World?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gazed at Envy. \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense. The Demon World has nothing to do with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the Demon God hurting the Demon World and this was related to Xie Xi but\u2026 he wouldn\u2019t tell this to Envy!</p><br/><p>Envy muttered, \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Sloth was much calmer. He stopped Envy and said to Jiang Xie, \u201cI apologize for Envy. He said something wrong just now. This really does require the opinions of both of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had emotional intelligence and high judgment.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had to cooperate with them but he also had to look after Jiang Xie. He couldn\u2019t let people bully him! Xie Xi stayed close to Jiang Xie and didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>Sloth looked at Jiang Xie. \u201cXie Xi is the master of lust. Even if he doesn\u2019t absorb the memories before reincarnation, he will inherit the position of domain master and will remember it.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the six pillars of the Demon World was Xie Xi. Once Xie Xi gained enough power, he would inherit the position of Lord Lust and also think of these past things.</p><br/><p>However, this was on the premise that Xie Xi would inherit it. If the Demon World was gone, the pillars would be finished and Xie Xi would\u2026</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the other five domain masters wouldn\u2019t allow such a thing to happen.</p><br/><p>Sloth said Jiang Xie\u2019s opinion would be considered but Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t stop it. The three domain masters wouldn\u2019t just watch the Demon World collapse.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also knew these things yet he still said he would listen to Jiang Xie\u2026 Xie Xi was worried and comforting him. Jiang Xie felt it but still felt bitter.</p><br/><p>If\u2026 Xie Xi and the Demon God really\u2026</p><br/><p>Sloth spoke again. \u201cSome things can\u2019t be solved by escaping. It is only when we face them that we can hope to eradicate them.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was exactly what Xie Xi wanted to say.</p><br/><p>He gazed at Jiang Xie and took the opportunity to ask, \u201cHow about we go together?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi added, \u201cTogether, we will receive the memories of before my reincarnation.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three domain masters hadn\u2019t expected Xie Xi to say this\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had no other way. Rather than let Angel Jiang think wildly, he might as well watch the \u2018pre-existing summary\u2019 and maybe he could resolve the world in one fell swoop!</p><br/><p>Of course, Xie Xi had another idea. He always felt this wasn\u2019t a dead knot but a knot that could be opened with a slight pull.</p><br/><p>This was a worthwhile gamble. He would either clarify the situation or maintain the status quo. Why should he block it?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie muttered, \u201cThe memories before your reincarnation\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hide anything from you. It doesn\u2019t matter so shall we face it together?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was so moving. How could Jiang Xie refuse?</p><br/><p>Even if Xie Xi really loved the Demon God in his previous life, at this moment, Jiang Xie believed that Xie Xi was in love with him and loved him wholeheartedly.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was satisfied with this firm confidence and trust. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three domain masters looked at each other and exchanged opinions with their eyes.</p><br/><p>Finally, Greed pulled out a pure white ball of light and told Xie Xi, \u201cThis contains the memories of your past life. If you want to share it with Jiang Xie then you can go in together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded and picked up the white light ball. The three domain masters retreated, giving them enough privacy.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at the light ball. \u201cI really\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi approached and kissed him. \u201cTrust me, I love you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare say that the past had passed since he didn\u2019t know what the past was.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s expression became determined. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people\u2019s minds entered the light ball and a large number of memories instantly filled their minds. They understood it all at once.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was happy and he recalled this pre-existing summary.</p><br/><p>The memories of his childhood passed quickly and he focused on the party after Xie Xi entered university.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was once again a stop student. It wasn\u2019t only this life but his life before reincarnation. The master of lust was an academic master.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie really arranged Xie Xi neatly.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi might be a succubus but he was a unique succubus.</p><br/><p>In his sophomore year, his professor shouted at him, \u201cYou can\u2019t drag it out any longer. You have to accept the ceremony of adulthood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>The professor was very worried about him.\u201dDon\u2019t just say you know with your mouth! Your body should also adapt. A succubus not liking sex is going against nature!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t make a sound.</p><br/><p>The professor sighed. \u201cHow is there a succubus like you? Pick and choose, who do you want to choose?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cI don\u2019t like people and I can still get high scores.\u201d</p><br/><p>The professor was angry. \u201cYou are very powerful. You only watch movies yet you are the most accurate student. You can get first in the year but what is the use? You are a 22 year old succubus and a virgin! If this is known, the entire Demon World will laugh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t open his eyes and his lips were tightly pressed together.</p><br/><p>The professor said, \u201cI\u2019m not interfering with your private life but you have to think about yourself. You must hold the adulthood ceremony at the age of 23. You also know that experiencing the ceremony as a virgin will lead to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s brow was tight. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a seminar in the Sixth Domain the day after. Come with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up at him.</p><br/><p>The professor was really angry. \u201cYou don\u2019t look at any of the stinky people in the First Domain. If you go to the Sixth Domain and still don\u2019t pick a person then I won\u2019t care about you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke with some shame, \u201cProfessor\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The professor poked him in the head. \u201cHow is there a person with your brains?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was no wonder why the reincarnated Xie Xi would experience such danger in the adult ceremony. He was both a theoretical and practical idiot!</p><br/><p>In his last life, he had a professor who cared about him. After reincarnation, he went to Heaven and knew nothing about the situation of succubi. Of course, it was useless to know. Who would guess that a succubus would have no experience?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi followed the professor to the Sixth Domain.</p><br/><p>Ordinary demons of the First Domain weren\u2019t qualified to come here. It wasn\u2019t only a status problem but they also couldn\u2019t withstand the pressure of the deeper demon realm.</p><br/><p>Of course, Xie Xi\u2019s trip wasn\u2019t a long-term stay and it was only temporary. His body could withstand it for a few weeks or the professor wouldn\u2019t have dared bring him.</p><br/><p>He was called an assistant but the professor just wanted him to go out and hook people. Thus, the professor didn\u2019t care about Xie Xi at all and even rushed him away.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to live up to the professor\u2019s heart and went out.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know why he was like this. Succubi used sex as food and it was like ordinary people eating and drinking. He was like an anorexic person and it was inevitable that the professor would worry about him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really couldn\u2019t go on like this. He couldn\u2019t drag out the adult ceremony and once the ceremony was held, he either needed to have sex with someone or he would die.</p><br/><p>Rather than choosing anyone because he was hungry, it was better to choose someone pleasing in advance and quickly get rid of his virginity. Then he wouldn\u2019t have to worry.</p><br/><p>Thus, Xie Xi seriously went to a bar every night. He wanted to find a slightly eye-catching person to resolve the current crisis.</p><br/><p>His professor had told him, \u201cYou stinky boy, if you don\u2019t even look at people in the Sixth Domain then do you want the Demon God in the Seventh Domain?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi even said, \u201cNo, that won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>The professor said, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare say that you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled bitterly, \u201cHow am I worthy to meet the lord?\u201d</p><br/><p>The professor chased him away, \u201cGo ahead, come back and be sure to let me see a new you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Poor Xie Xi spent five or six days at the bars and wasn\u2019t interested in any demon.</p><br/><p>During this period, many big demons came up to talk to him. Men and women, black and white-skinned\u2026 there were all types.</p><br/><p>However, Xie Xi became nauseous when he thought about sleeping with them and didn\u2019t even want to talk to them.</p><br/><p>By the eighth day, if Xie Xi wasn\u2019t afraid of the professor then he really didn\u2019t want to go out.</p><br/><p>He was drinking in a corner when a grey-haired demon approached him. \u201cGo with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had previously rejected him and today he wasn\u2019t interested. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Who would\u2019ve expected the big demon to suddenly grab his hand and pull him up. \u201cLow level succubus, what are you doing here? I have to sleep with you tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>A demon who could live in the Sixth Domain definitely wasn\u2019t low grade. Xie Xi was his opponent but just his wrist being held gave the illusion that his hand would be broken. \u201cYou, let go!\u201d He cried out painfully.</p><br/><p>The grey-haired demon pulled him straight up. \u201cLet go? I\u2019ll let you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet him go.\u201d A low voice was heard.</p><br/><p>The grey-haired demon opened his mouth. \u201cHe is with me first, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished his words when he saw the person behind him. The demon who was as arrogant and domineering as a rooster suddenly lost all momentum. \u201cDDDDDD God\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned his head and met a pair of deep purple eyes.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Xie Xi and Jiang Xie returned to their own Central.</p><br/><p>They created a new Central, just like the countless quasi-worlds that had been cleared.</p><br/><p>Once the mission was completed, they could leave and after that, there was no need to interfere.</p><br/><p>The new world, the new Central was like an 18 year old adult. It only needed independence and freedom.</p><br/><p>Back in Central\u2019s garden, Xie Xi was still a bit confused. \u201cAre we really back this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie moved his fingers and a water curtain appeared out of thin air.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cWe\u2019re back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wondered, \u201cGo and see the task rewards?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was also very curious. \u201cGood!\u201d</p><br/><p>His mission was long enough to repair 12 small worlds and he created a new Central\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened the rewards interface and his eyes became more and more bigger.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned over and was sour after one glance. \u201cYou reached half of my fortune.\u201d He had experienced thousands of small worlds and completed countless tasks!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned and his senses slowly returned. \u201cHalf\u2026 are you so rich?\u201d The golden flashing rewards in front of him made him blind.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t see it\u2026 he couldn\u2019t\u2026</p><br/><p>There was so much good stuff that it was numb\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie pinched his white cheek. \u201cIs your husband a poor man in your heart?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie hugged him and suddenly suggested, \u201cLet\u2019s get married quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t keep up with this person\u2019s brain circuit. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie kissed him with sighing. \u201cIf we wait any longer, my betrothal gift won\u2019t be more than your betrothal gift.\u201d This was already half. After a few more tasks, he wouldn\u2019t able to afford his child even if he gave all his money.</p><br/><p>What a mess!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pushed him away. \u201cYou are speaking nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was sincere. \u201cReally, we should get married. There might be no legal procedures but we can call Ah Zhe and the others to play together.\u201d By the way, he also had to clean up these bastards.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gazed at him with some anger between his eyebrows.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart was glued to this person and he immediately noticed it. He softened his voice and said, \u201cOkay, if you don\u2019t like it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he finished, Xie Xi frowned. \u201cWe\u2026 didn\u2019t we get married a long time ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s spoke in a low voice, \u201cDid you say that thing for fun?\u201d</p><br/><p>They were vague words but Jiang Xie suddenly understood.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was referring to the life the two people spent in Dream Come True.</p><br/><p>They truly got married at the time and were together for over 60 years.</p><br/><p>Since then, this child had already identified him as the only companion?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart was sweet and bitter as he held Xie Xi\u2019s hand. \u201cIt is a dream but a reality for the two people. I definitely won\u2019t forget it.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was what Jiang Xie had told Xie Xi after leaving Dream Come True.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s demeanour relaxed but he still looked at the other person with some anger. \u201cSince it is true, why get married again? We didn\u2019t\u2026 divorce.\u201d</p><br/><p>Instantly, honey-like sweetness filled his chest cavity and Jiang Xie kissed Xie Xi. \u201cYou really are my baby.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t stand him saying this. \u201dYou are speaking nonsense again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I won\u2019t say it.\u201d Jiang Xie got closer. \u201cIt is better to do it a few times!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the \u2018doorbell\u2019 of the garden rang at this time.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe\u2019s voice was heard. \u201cOpen the door, open the door, open the door!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie felt a bit empty and cancelled the doorbell function.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard it and stated, \u201cGod Yan came.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hurt.\u201d The souls were all returned and the aftereffects of the white space couldn\u2019t harm the current Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about how this was a complete Jiang Xie and his heart was particularly slid.</p><br/><p>Of course, he was practical and couldn\u2019t ignore their friends.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for Yan Zhe, the last six small worlds would\u2019ve never been so easy.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shouted, \u201cGo open the door!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi whispered a sentence to him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cDon\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s ears were red. \u201cIs it useful for me to regret it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie let him go. The two men dressed neatly and opened the garden door.</p><br/><p>It was more than Yan Zhe. There were all the lonely male gods.</p><br/><p>Nan Yi opened his mouth. \u201cNeglecting your friends when smitten with a new love Old Jiang!\u201d Letting them wait outside for so long, he wanted to know what was going on!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cDisturbing love, I wish you a lifetime of being single.\u201d</p><br/><p>T-The heart was pierced!</p><br/><p>Nan Yi now had a \u2018handle\u2019 in his hand and he spoke very proudly. \u201cYou can\u2019t talk. You appear as many people to talk about love.\u201d</p><br/><p>They finished the video and really laughed. It was enough for 3,000 years of fun!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had long had the memories of the souls. How could he not know?</p><br/><p>He knew them much better than Xie Xi and knew what they would do with his eyes closed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s black materials were in the hands of others but he was still very calm. He said, \u201cSpeaking of which, the world story of the new civilization will be put on the shelves.\u201d</p><br/><p>At first, this topic sounded random but all the faces of the male gods changed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke slowly. \u201cThe wonderful performance of the five god level players, shouldn\u2019t I share it with Central. I will let everyone watch and study it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe took the lead in having his hairs raised. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wondered, \u201cWhy not? It is a SSS-grade world and didn\u2019t the five of you work hard?\u201d</p><br/><p>Language was mobilized. The contents of the words really caused a desire to beat up this person!</p><br/><p>However, they couldn\u2019t beat him\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finally responded.</p><br/><p>The new civilization was the quasi-world that he and Jiang Xie redesigned after the repair. In other words, it was the world where they became planets.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw a bit of the live broadcast at the time.</p><br/><p>Qin Ge became a stare and the other four were planets.</p><br/><p>The star was hot and cold and couldn\u2019t get close out of fear he might swallow up the four planets.</p><br/><p>The four planets were also very sad. One was poisonous, one was too small, one was a lazy rock and the other worked hard to raise a lower life form only to have it die.</p><br/><p>The task of these five balls was to create a new civilization and they were tossed badly.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was the designer so he had the world story and could clearly see the five balls\u2019 \u2018hard work.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was unknown what the five big men had gone through but even Gong Rui had an expression of \u2018life and death\u2019 and cried out, \u201cIt can\u2019t be put on the shelf!\u201d</p><br/><p>General Qin was honest. \u201cIt is too\u2026 shameful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi was even more urgent. \u201cOld Jiang, if you dare to put it on the shelves then I will fight with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen it yet. Is the SSS-grade mission very difficult?\u201d</p><br/><p>All five had constipated expressions.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie added, \u201cYou have experienced the heaven and earth god level missions. What is the SSS level?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe exclaimed, \u201cThat is different! The former is erasing and the latter is clearing it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The task of erasing was basically wiping out everything, especially for the violent Jiang Xie and Nan Yi. It was simply killing from beginning to end!</p><br/><p>In the five balls, they didn\u2019t kill and were stupid to the extreme! They did many stupid things and didn\u2019t dare to recall them.</p><br/><p>If this was released to the Central Government, it definitely wouldn\u2019t be Old Jiang who would be laughed at for 3,000 years. It would be them!</p><br/><p>Jiang stated, \u201cOh, this really isn\u2019t suitable for public release.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nonsense! This wasn\u2019t watching for studying. It was called public punishment!</p><br/><p>Looking at his pretentious appearance, how could the five people not understand?</p><br/><p>He was full of unwillingness but for his own face, Zong Xia took the initiative in handing over the video they could reminisce about for 3,000 years.</p><br/><p>General Qin didn\u2019t pay anything because he didn\u2019t have any videos.</p><br/><p>After recovering the videos, Jiang Xie made a satisfied smile. \u201cIt won\u2019t be on any shelves. Although I can sell it for a lot of money, you know the most important thing I have is money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They regretted it. They really wanted to beat him down in a life and death struggle!</p><br/><p>Nan Yi refused to accept defeat. \u201cSo what if there is no video? We have all seen it and it is carefully imprinted in our minds!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d It was a shame!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t the same. His face didn\u2019t change and his heart didn\u2019t jump. He could also counter them. \u201cYour mind is full of my love story with Little Xie. Are you happy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He stabbed Jiang Xie. \u201cVery happy, the love of seven people is rare.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke again. \u201cYes, I divided into six parts and they all love Little Xie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Rui was also caught.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at Xie Xi with deep feelings. \u201cNo matter what I become, Little Xie likes me.\u201d</p><br/><p>This remark caused a strong discomfort and the single dogs quit the group chat.</p><br/><p>The male gods who rushed over and returned as feathers were very unwilling. \u201cHow can we not beat this old animal?\u201d</p><br/><p>God Yan replied, \u201cIt is because you don\u2019t have his thick face!\u201d</p><br/><p>The gods felt sorrowful\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or cry as he looked at Jiang Xie. \u201cI have never seen you with such a thick face!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie made an innocent expression. \u201cI am telling the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was really honest\u2026</p><br/><p>Even if he divided into 120 parts, he would fall in love with Xie Xi at first sight. Even if he divided into 120 parts, Xie Xi would recognize him with one glance.</p><br/><p>He was honest but this was already the biggest show-off.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was sweet and his eyes full of laughter.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie kissed him. \u201cThe people are gone. Shall we continue? You promised me that I could\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What did this damn person want!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi just wanted to be abstinent when he saw the garden full of roses and suddenly remembered something. \u201cWhy do you like roses so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>The garden was full of roses and there was also the shadow of roses in the quasi-worlds that Jiang Xie designed.</p><br/><p>Not to mention that Xie Xi was the flower god and Beast King Rose\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie paused.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him. \u201cDid you see something when you touched the centre?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke lightly. \u201cI once saw you among roses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhat happened next?\u201d It definitely wasn\u2019t a good future.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cThe next time I saw you, you weren\u2019t breathing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was tugged.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at him. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d He told Xie Xi, \u201cOnly what we believe now is real.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was even more distressed and kissed him. \u201cYou avoided all the futures. How could you be sure that there would be a now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if he didn\u2019t see the future, there would still be countless possibilities when walking the path of adversity.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke in a low voice. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was really unsure but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He stared at Xie Xi and declared, \u201cEven if there was only one-millionth of a chance, I was going to try it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fortunately, he met the present.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s luck was good.</p><br/><p>Was there anything more fortunate than fulfilling his lifetime\u2019s wish?</p><br/><p>Perhaps it should be said that Jiang Xie never relied on luck.</p><br/><p>He took step by step, separating himself from the shackles of fate and seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

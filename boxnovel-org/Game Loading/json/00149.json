His short legs moved quite quickly and he soon hid in the sea of roses.</p><br/><p>The roses here weren\u2019t as kind as the small roses on Earth. They were probably on the edge of transforming and were very large. They easily hid Houqing\u2019s small body among them.</p><br/><p>The little jasmine wasn\u2019t happy. \u201cHow is this rose still hiding? He saw Lord Flower God but didn\u2019t come out to greet him!\u201d</p><br/><p>The daisy buried her. \u201cIt isn\u2019t as if you\u2019re politer.\u201d</p><br/><p>The jasmine pinched her waist. \u201cThe first time I saw Lord Flower God, I couldn\u2019t endure the sound of his voice and knelt down!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little girl, you were scared!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t take care of these two flowers because he had to catch Houqing. Houqing was still so small that it seemed the memories in this god\u2019s wisdom were long.</p><br/><p>Such large roses and such a small child, Xie Xi had to look closely in order to find him. The bickering daisy and jasmine realized their lord was looking for the small child and hurriedly ordered, \u201cRoses, scatter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered if yelling at them was useful? Then the roses spread out like a receding tide. Oh, he forgot that these flowers weren\u2019t normal. Shouting really worked!</p><br/><p>The roses spread out and Little Houqing could no longer hide. He looked around in a dazed manner, the absence of cover making him nervous.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt a strange heartache at the sight and spoke softly, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, I won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Houqing looked over, his big eyes full of uneasiness. Xie Xi slowly approached him like he was approaching a solitary little beast.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Xie Xi asked in a friendly manner.</p><br/><p>Who knew that the moment Xie Xi asked the question, Little Houqing would run back into the depths of the roses.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t Jiang Xie say that every piece of hair liked Xie Xi? Was this called liking? Sure enough, X\u2019s words couldn\u2019t be believed!</p><br/><p>Poor Little Houqing ran and hid among the roses. Xie Xi followed and caught up with the little guy. Soon after, Little Houqing fell into Xie Xi\u2019s arms. His eyes were wide and his white face was like a piece of tender tofu.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled and tried to make his voice gentle and affable. \u201cWhy are you running?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Houqing stared at him for a while before finally saying, \u201cGood fragrance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Houqing\u2019s face flushed and he whispered, \u201cYou smell good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t smell himself. The flowers were born with a variety of aromas and it was innate so he couldn\u2019t smell it.</p><br/><p>It was a bit strange that a child was saying he had good smell but Xie Xi didn\u2019t want him to run away. \u201cIf I smell good, why hide?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Houqing\u2019s logic was fascinating. \u201cYou smell too good and I can\u2019t get close.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>This seemed to poke Little Houqing\u2019s heart and he struggled to run again. Xie Xi held him tightly and coaxed him. \u201cOkay, I won\u2019t ask. Don\u2019t run around anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was too gentle and Little Houqing\u2019s strength waned as he allowed Xie Xi to hold him. Xie Xi stared into his eyes and found that Little Houqing was torn between running and not wanting to run\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d Little Houqing\u2019s face was pinched and he looked up at Xie Xi in a confused manner.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help it. Ahhhh, how could he be so cute? Such a lovely little fellow, how did he grow up to be the old person with a glib tongue?</p><br/><p>Time flies and people change, Xie Xi deeply appreciated the meaning of this sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo soft.\u201d Xie Xi\u2019s eyes curved as he smiled and pinched the soft face.</p><br/><p>Little Houqing reacted by lowering his head and thinking about something. Then he raised his head slightly, as if saying, \u2018You can keep pinching me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d His blood was half empty!</p><br/><p>Such a small person and still so cute. It was really a foul!</p><br/><p>Flower god, don\u2019t become dizzy because of a small child!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about coming back to the flower world with me? I will take care of you in the future.\u201d Xie Xi didn\u2019t have to ask about Houqing\u2019s family.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Little Houqing lowered his eyes sadly. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Houqing\u2019s lips trembled as he whispered, \u201cAnyone near me will be cursed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned. In Atlantis, the sixth prince was excluded by everyone because of his different coloured eyes. He lived alone in his palace and didn\u2019t experience the love of his father.</p><br/><p>Was it the same for Little Houqing? Was Jiang Xie excluded and ignored because of these eyes?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s original world should be similar to Xie Xi. In such a society, the different coloured eyes were indeed bizarre and unknown. In Jiang Xie\u2019s childhood, he had likely been excluded or even subjected to endless bullying.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart jerked as he thought of this.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d He asked Houqing.</p><br/><p>Houqing shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the flower god,\u201d Xie Xi told him. \u201cA god can\u2019t be cursed.\u201d</p><br/><p>He finished speaking and brightness flashed in Little Houqing\u2019s clear eyes. \u201cA god\u2026 won\u2019t be cursed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, not only will I not be cursed, you can stay with me and anyone who is close to you won\u2019t be cursed anymore.\u201d Xie Xi tricked the little child.</p><br/><p>Little Houqing was stunned by the bluff and his big eyes were full of trust. \u201cYou aren\u2019t lying to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was soft. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then LIttle Houqing\u2019s lips curved, revealing a cautious and unskilled smile. It seemed to be the first time he was smiling and he was cautious, like a newly blooming seedling first seeing the sun.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hugged him. \u201cRest assured, I\u2019ll take care of you in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>The memories of the souls would return to Jiang Xie once he took them back. Changing Houqing\u2019s childhood was also changing Jiang Xie\u2019s past.</p><br/><p>Just like in Dream Come True, Jiang Xie changed Xie Xi\u2019s life, letting him finish university, experience a real him and live a full life with no regrets.</p><br/><p>This time Xie Xi would give Jiang Xie a warm past. It was true that this wasn\u2019t Jiang Xie\u2019s real childhood but as Jiang Xie said, there was no limit between reality and falsehood. They were real and what they experienced was real.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took Little Houqing back to the flower world. The jasmine and daisy were curious along the way, twittering like birds instead of flowers.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Flower God, is he a rose flower?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird. Why is he so small if he can transform?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a two coloured rose?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have seen both red and blue but I have never seen one that is red and blue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once they talked about his eyes, Little Houqing visibly shrunk back and his eyelashes trembled.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cDoesn\u2019t he look good?\u201d He was asking the jasmine and daisy.</p><br/><p>The two flowers immediately replied, \u201cGood-looking! I have never seen such a beautiful little rose!\u201d They mistook Houqing as a rose.</p><br/><p>It seemed he had never been praised before. Little Houqing was somewhat happy and didn\u2019t know how to deal with it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi explained, \u201cHe isn\u2019t a rose flower.\u201d</p><br/><p>The jasmine asked curiously, \u201cHe isn\u2019t a rose? Then what flower is he?\u201d Their cultivation was low and they couldn\u2019t see his prototype.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could see it clearly. Houqing wasn\u2019t a monster or a beast. He was\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told them, \u201cHe is a human.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA human?\u201d The daisy had never heard of it. \u201cWhat type of flower is a human?\u201d</p><br/><p>The jasmine also said, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of a human.\u201d</p><br/><p>The dairy retorted, \u201cOf course you haven\u2019t heard of it. Only knowledgeable people like Lord Flower God will remember all flower types!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t remember! However, a human wasn\u2019t a flower and he patiently explained. Unfortunately, the two flowers had little knowledge and directly asked Little Houqing, \u201cLittle human, are you a little human?\u201d (They use Xiao = little/small. However, the combination of characters can also mean person of low social status, nasty person, vile person).</p><br/><p>Little human.. this was a bad word in human society, flowers! Unfortunately, there was no way to explain this. Xie Xi had to say, \u201cHe is called Houqing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The jasmine and daisy were confused again. \u201cIsn\u2019t he a human?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could only follow their brain circuits. \u201cThere are many types of humans, just like flowers have the jasmine and daisies.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them understood. \u201cIt turns out to be like this.\u201d After realizing it, they didn\u2019t forget to praise Xie Xi. \u201cLord Flower God truly knows a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi listened to the flowers blowing hot air and his face heated up.</p><br/><p>Little Houqing looked up at Xie Xi. \u201cH-Houqing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, can I call you that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Houqing smiled and nodded hard. \u201cYes.\u201d Everything this person said was nice and it was particularly comfortable to hear.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also smiled. \u201cAfter this, you will be called Houqing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Houqing nodded like a chick pecking at rice. Xie Xi touched his soft little head and took him back to the flower world.</p><br/><p>Raising a child wasn\u2019t an easy task but Xie Xi wasn\u2019t too worried. After all, there were many flowers in the flower world. How could he not handle a child?</p><br/><p>Who would\u2019ve expected something big to happen after he got a good night\u2019s sleep?!</p><br/><p>The matter started from him sleeping. After returning to the flower world, Little Houqing seemed very tired. He had already fallen asleep in Xie Xi\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi put him on the bed and was also a bit tired so he accompanied Little Houqing to sleep. By the time he woke up, Little Houqing was gone.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t feel too anxious. He just thought that the little guy had gone out to play. He slowly got out of bed and was cleaning up a bit when he heard noise outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is he becoming less and less energetic?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI gave him several bottles of jade dew. Why does he seem to be wilting even more?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBurying him in the dirt doesn\u2019t work. Is he sick?\u2019</p><br/><p>After hearing the final sentence, Xie Xi hurriedly pushed open the door and saw a thin and pitiful Little Houqing.</p><br/><p>The daisy was anxious. \u201cWould you like to chance soil? I have fertile soil that I have treasured for 10 years\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi quickly stepped forward and picked up Little Houqing. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>The flowers were relieved to see him and the magnolia came forward. \u201cLittle Houqing has no spirit since three days ago. His physical condition is worsening every day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Three days ago? Xie Xi was shocked and wondered, \u201cHow long have I been sleeping?\u201d</p><br/><p>The magnolia replied, \u201cYour sleep was very short this time. You only slept for seven days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!!\u201d This was short?</p><br/><p>He had been sleeping for seven days. No wonder why Houqing had this miserable appearance.</p><br/><p>A child who didn\u2019t eat for seven days and only drank water was simply starving to death!</p><br/><p>He had overestimated the flowers. They took jade dew all year round and sunbathed in the soil. They didn\u2019t know what humans should eat.</p><br/><p>Still, Xie Xi hadn\u2019t expected to sleep for seven days!</p><br/><p>He hurriedly said, \u201cHe is hungry. Is there rice in the flower world?\u201d Going hungry for so long, he should drink porridge first!</p><br/><p>\u201cRice?\u201d The flowers glanced at each other. \u201cThere are only flowers in the flower world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked again, \u201cAre there any animals here?\u201d Drinking animal milk was also good.</p><br/><p>The flowers looked even more blank. \u201cWhat is an animal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned\u2026 the flowers of the later generations didn\u2019t eat but there were countless creatures in the Holy Mountain and Demon Sea. It was impossible for them to not know what small animals were.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told them. \u201cYou take care of him. Don\u2019t give him anything else apart from jade dew. I will come back soon.\u201d He could only go out to see for himself.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Little Houqing grabbed his clothes, small face full of uneasiness.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was so distressed he felt like he was burned by a soldering iron. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have been sleeping too long. I\u2019m going to find you food.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Houqing was hungry but he still refused to let go. He clutched Xie Xi like a drowning person catching driftwood.</p><br/><p>The magnolia spoke up. \u201cYour Excellency, you can\u2019t leave him in this bad state. If you need to find something then tell us and we\u2019ll find it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also didn\u2019t want to go out with such a weak Houqing. He could only rely on the flowers. He explained carefully but unfortunately, the flowers had never seen rabbits, sheep or cows.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is the Holy Mountain? Where is the Demon Sea?\u201d The flowers had no idea at all.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought of a method. \u201cFind me a pen and I\u2019ll draw an example for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The flowers were very good this time and quickly brought him a pen.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had walked through the Holy Mountain and Demon Sea and remembered the route and terrain. He carefully painted it because he feared his painting skills were too bad and the flowers wouldn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>Miraculously, Xie Xi\u2019s pen was brilliant. The image he thought in his mind was actually drawn out, like a 3D projection.</p><br/><p>The flowers were amazed and Xie Xi himself was shocked. He continued to draw what he thought of in his mind.</p><br/><p>The flowers saw the white rabbit, the goats, the cows and fresh milk and even various grains and utensils\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Flower God is so powerful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also felt that this was too good.</p><br/><p>With these \u2018photos\u2019, the flwoers left the flower world to find food for Houqing.</p><br/><p>Not long after they came back, Xie Xi saw a pot of rice porridge. He was shocked but didn\u2019t care too much. He just quickly fed it to Houqing.</p><br/><p>Little Houqing was really hungry and ate it in a straightforward manner. Xie Xi was afraid he would eat too much in one go. He supported Houqing\u2019s body and estimated the weight before quickly saying, \u201cOkay, eat more later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Houqing\u2019s obedience really distressed people. Xie Xi saw the child stop immediately. He obviously wanted to eat more but didn\u2019t touch it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi explained, \u201cIt isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t want you to eat. I\u2019m afraid that you can\u2019t bear eating so much. Wait until later to eat again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Houqing nodded and still clutched Xie Xi\u2019s clothes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare to sleep. He took care of Houqing for three days and only felt relieved after seeing that Houqing\u2019s body was stable.</p><br/><p>He gave the flowers a \u2018parenting\u2019 class, afraid that no one would take care of Houqing after he fell asleep.</p><br/><p>The flowers understood a lot and the jasmine felt a bit curious. \u201cI never knew there was such a big place outside the flower world!\u201d</p><br/><p>The daisy added, \u201cYes, there are many strange animals on the Holy Mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>They spoke about what they saw and Little Houqing listened very seriously, apparently curious.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked him, \u201cWould you like to go and have a look?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Houqing held his clothes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled at him. \u201cI\u2019ll accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Houqing glanced at him. \u201cNo\u2026 trouble?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Xie Xi wanted to take him out to get some air, as well as let him see the outside world and know he wasn\u2019t an outsider.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Xie Xi told the flowers. \u201cWe\u2019ll go see the Holy Mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi left the flower world and saw the present Holy Mountain, which gave him a strange feeling. Perhaps it was because the time was too early? Why wasn\u2019t it developed yet?</p><br/><p>The jasmine yelled, \u201cWow, a big white rabbit!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Houqing quickly looked over and Xie Xi also took a look.</p><br/><p>Houqing blinked. \u201cWhite rabbit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>How was this a rabbit? It was clearly a hurt tiger!</p><br/><p>The jasmine wanted to catch the white rabbit and Xie Xi didn\u2019t stop her. He just listened to a fierce roar in a childlike voice.</p><br/><p>The jasmine was startled and started intently. \u201cWow, there is also a small white rabbit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw a little white tiger the size of a cat.</p><br/><p>The jasmine wanted to hug the \u2018white rabbit.\u2019 The white tiger might be small but he was fierce. He stood in front of a seriously injured white tiger, small claws sticking out and his posture vigilant. He also exposed little white teeth.</p><br/><p>Fierce was fierce, cute was also cute!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

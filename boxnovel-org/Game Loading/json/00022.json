This was equivalent to a second life.</p><br/><p>The gun went off and the man died.</p><br/><p>It was too late for Xie Xi and Song Qi to do anything.</p><br/><p>The villagers swarmed, not caring about the blood on the ground. They lifted up the body and chanted, \u201cDedicate him to the dragon god, to the dragon god!\u201d</p><br/><p>They left and Xie Xi and Song Qi\u2019s nerves were only slightly relieved.</p><br/><p>Song Qi\u2019s forehead was covered with sweat. \u201cIsn\u2019t this a fucking D-grade world? Why is it so dangerous?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes drooped. \u201cThe person who burned to death last night was a player.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had been far away and could only hear pained screams as the man was set on fire.</p><br/><p>Song Qi\u2019s scalp was numb. \u201c\u2026Did he take so long to burn because he was wearing a uniform? \u201cThis is too cruel. Immunity to fatal wounds doesn\u2019t mean the fatal wound is painless. He suffered from the burning pain, died, got an extra life and experienced it again\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cThese villagers know players very well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi didn\u2019t want to die. \u201cBrother Xi, we have to quickly complete the task and leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him. \u201cDo you want to disband the team?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi didn\u2019t react.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi calmly explained, \u201cMy task has no clue and I must delay the time. Your task can still be completed. I also have the character freeze and search mirror that I can give you to use.\u201d</p><br/><p>The setting meant that items could be stacked up 10 times and only counted as taking up one slot. He had used the search mirror once and there were still four uses left.</p><br/><p>Song Qi was shocked by his remark.</p><br/><p>The search mirror and character freeze meant his task could be completed very easily.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have to steal. He could use the search mirror to locate someone\u2019s house to sneak into. If he was discovered, he could use the character freeze to delay the time. One minute was enough and then he could leave this world. As for the side mission, it didn\u2019t matter if it was completed or not.</p><br/><p>The grade of his main mission was low but the difficulty wasn\u2019t high. Xie Xi\u2019s task was of high quality and the difficulty corresponded to that. If the world was dangerous, it was hard to say whose luck was better.</p><br/><p>Song Qi asked him, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can do it myself.\u201d He had cleared the trash game Love to the Left or Right. This problem wasn\u2019t big.</p><br/><p>Song Qi gritted his teeth. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t leave you alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled.</p><br/><p>Song Qi told him, \u201cI might have no ability but I can see people with my eyes. I can always help you look in the rear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi reminded him, \u201cThis town is very dangerous. The villagers know the players very well and are hunting them in an organized manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I can\u2019t leave! If it wasn\u2019t for you, I would still be locked up in the dungeon. Who knows when they were going to sacrifice me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was used to being alone and didn\u2019t mind doing his own task. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi interrupted him. \u201cFor the sake of wealth, I want to complete the side mission!\u201d Once he said this, Xie Xi didn\u2019t have a reason to persuade him to leave.</p><br/><p>He glanced at Song Qi and declared, \u201cI want to clear the instance.\u201d</p><br/><p>His calm voice hit Song Qi\u2019s mind like a heavy hammer.</p><br/><p>He grasped Xie Xi\u2019s meaning.</p><br/><p>Clearing the instance wasn\u2019t just completing the task. It also blocked the world so that players could no longer enter.</p><br/><p>No matter the reason, villagers were hunting players.</p><br/><p>As long as they cleared the world, players couldn\u2019t enter and the killing would stop!</p><br/><p>An indescribable feeling surged through his blood and Song Qi felt an unprecedented thrill. \u201cI will help you clear this world!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s main mission was likely to be the core task. As long as the side mission was completed as well, the probability of clearing the instance was 80% higher.</p><br/><p>It was worth a try! Song Qi blindly believed that if it was Xie Xi, they would be able to clear the instance!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go find the previous\u2026\u201d Xie Xi hadn\u2019t finished speaking when he suddenly stopped.</p><br/><p>A man was approaching them at a very fast speed. Song Qi straightened his body, on guard against the person.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi quickly opened his mouth. \u201cBrother Jin.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person who came was Zhong Jin. He saw Xie Xi and sighed with relief. \u201cI managed to find you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was also relieved. \u201cFortunately, you are okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin smiled. \u201cI have the uniform and can\u2019t die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi returned the smile.</p><br/><p>At this time, Song Qi turned away and was stunned when he saw Zhong Jin. \u201cBrother Liu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had been staring at Zhong Jin and keenly captured the flash of surprise in his eyes. It was very light and soon disappeared, making Xie Xi doubt if it was an illusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d Zhong Jin asked doubtfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Xiao Song! I ate the roasted meat with you after we just entered this world!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRoasted meat?\u201d Zhong Jin laughed. \u201cI eat nutrient solutions all year round. ow can I eat roasted meat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi blinked.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cYou must have the wrong person. Brother Jin entered the game with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I admit my mistake. We are from different batches.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin asked, \u201cYou are a previous player?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi nodded. \u201cYes, I came here around three or four days ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>This made Zhong Jin frown. \u201cIt has only been three or four days yet 80% of players in your group died?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi became tense. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m the only one left.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin\u2019s brow furrowed even more. \u201cSpeaking of which, this world has a problem.\u201d He glanced over at Xie Xi and wondered, \u201cWhat is your task?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled and replied, \u201cCollect Aunty Sun\u2019s mace.\u201d</p><br/><p>The startled Zhong Jin also smiled. \u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi reacted quickly and his face distorted. \u201cMine is even worse. It is to collect the underwear of young girls\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin laughed loudly. \u201cYou have this task\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cYes, how can there be such a wonderful task?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin laughed for a long time before saying, \u201cA collector\u2019s task is like this. It is rather strange but such tasks are relatively easy to complete.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi sighed. \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy. I was locked up in a dungeon the first time I stole.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin told him, \u201cIt is nothing. I will help you. The task is easy to complete and then you can leave the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi asked him, \u201cWhat is your mission?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am an explorer and received the task of exploring the cave at the rear mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi exclaimed, \u201cWow, Brother JIn\u2019s task is definitely high grade.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is hard to say. If the grade is difficult, I\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t be easy to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his mouth. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be hard to explore the cave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin shook his head. \u201cExploration isn\u2019t just going in and taking a look. I have to go all the way to the end and I suspect there is a dragon hidden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it the dragon god they mentioned?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d Zhong Jin told them, \u201cYou must be careful. This town is abnormal and the residents are crazy. As long as they see an outsider, they will sacrifice the player and dedicate the body to the dragon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fear still lingered inside Song Qi. \u201cWe just saw a man shot to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>A solemn expression crossed Zhong Jin\u2019s face. \u201cWe can\u2019t waste time. I will first take you to complete your tasks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cBrother Jin\u2019s task is harder. You shouldn\u2019t waste your time helping us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin shook his head. \u201cYou have little experience and I can\u2019t help worrying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi glanced at Xie Xi, who said, \u201cIt is too embarrassing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin said, \u201cWhy are you so polite? We are all chosen people and it is appropriate to help each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go! I will first take you to Aunty Sun\u2019s house to find the mace,\u201d Zhong Jin told them.</p><br/><p>They walked together and Zhong Jin suggested, \u201cDon\u2019t be too nervous. The more nervous you are, the more likely you are to expose yourself. Be natural.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cWere the players recognized because they were too nervous?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMost likely.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi\u2019s face distorted. \u201cI\u2019m finished. Your words made me even more nervous!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin smiled. \u201cDo you want to wait here? I will first help Xie Xi find the mace and then help you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi shook his head. \u201cNo no, I don\u2019t want to stay on my own. It is terrible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin\u2019s eyes slightly flashed. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Perhaps Aunty Sun\u2019s home also has your mission item.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi pretended to gag. \u201cAunty Sun definitely isn\u2019t a young girl. Of course, perhaps she has a granddaughter or something\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He really had a crow\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin was much more open than them. He actually dared to ask the villagers for directions. Perhaps it was really a problem of attitude. The villagers showed a good attitude towards Zhong Jin and told him the way.</p><br/><p>They arrived at Aunty Sun\u2019s house without much trouble.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s task definitely wasn\u2019t to find a mace. Still, this task wasn\u2019t without a basis. Previously, Song Qi had mentioned the many side tasks he refreshed and one of them was to collect Aunty Sun\u2019s mace.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why Xie Xi didn\u2019t panic when they came to Aunty Sun\u2019s house. This task was real and there was no need to worry about being exposed.</p><br/><p>Who knew that once he arrived, a thin woman with loose skin would rush at him with a kitchen knife. \u201cBai Xia! You dare to step into my house!\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi was shocked but Xie Xi quickly glanced at Zhong Jin. Zhong Jin was unexpectedly pale and took a step back.</p><br/><p>It was clear that Auntie Sun was scolding Bai Xia and also facing Xie Xi, yet Zhong Jin was the one flustered\u2026</p><br/><p>No wonder why Xie Xi found the Bai Xia in the photo to be familiar.</p><br/><p>Auntie Sun shouted, \u201cYou are a white-eyed wolf, a cowardly thing. You dared smear Yunren\u2019s innocence and walk away! I will die with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>She rushed over and Xie Xi deliberately hid behind Zhong Jin. Then Auntie Sun rushed at Zhong Jin.</p><br/><p>There was a big change in Zhong Jin\u2019s complexion.</p><br/><p>Auntie Sun shouted angrily, \u201cGive me back my Yunren, you scum! Give me back my Yunren!\u201d</p><br/><p>A soft voice was heard. \u201cMother! Don\u2019t hurt Brother Bai Xia!\u201d The skinny girl rushed over and hugged the woman\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>Auntie Sun\u2019s loose flesh trembled. \u201cYou silly child, you silly child!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Yunren cried out, \u201cBrother Bai Xia came to pick me up. He wants to take me away. He promised me that he would take us to his world. Mother, we can all go to God\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes were cold when he heard this.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin pulled Xie Xi and Song Qi away. \u201cLeave first!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi and Song Qi followed closely and the three of them left the town, stopping at a secluded place.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin gasped while Xie Xi glanced at him. \u201cWho is Bai Xia?\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, when they first entered the world, the villagers shouted Bai Xia\u2019s name. Zhong Jin was fatally wounded and it was estimate he couldn\u2019t hear what they said. After all, the uniform gave immunity to fatal injuries but not the pain.</p><br/><p>The scene was also chaotic. Zhong Jin was recovering and it was normal not to hear clearly.</p><br/><p>However, Zhong Jin\u2019s face changed slightly.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pressed him. \u201cAre you Bai Xia?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin turned to look at him, the sunshine in his eyes gradually fading.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi continued, \u201cYou really entered the world for a second time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have long been suspicious.\u201d Zhong Jin removed his disguise, revealing the true face of coldness and cruelty.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

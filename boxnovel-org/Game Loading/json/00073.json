There wasn\u2019t even a house here. It was just an endless sea of flowers. The white rose flowers were like clouds of heaven, a cluster of dreams\u2026</p><br/><p>He had to admit that it was beautiful.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t have too much of a concept about beauty and ugliness but he had a normal aesthetic regarding other affairs.</p><br/><p>He liked the feeling of standing here, his mind clear and refreshed. It was as if all his tiredness and troubles had gone with the swaying white roses.</p><br/><p>He felt less annoyed when he saw the man with different coloured eyes not far away.</p><br/><p>Oh, this sentiment lasted for three seconds. After that\u2026 it really ruined all these beautiful roses!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s spirit returned and the dislike in his heart quickly turned into numbers flying out. How could X plant so many white roses?</p><br/><p>White roses represented pure love. How could this crazy pervert know what was pure?</p><br/><p>No! He didn\u2019t understand love!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled, his voice polite and courteous. \u201cHello God X.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart trembled as a red rain poured towards him. The taste of ice and fire were proportionate in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke his name.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared blankly. \u201cZombie?\u201d (TL: Xie Xi uses the characters Jiant Xie that mean zombie instead of the characters that actually make up his name.)</p><br/><p>They were the two worst homonyms that Xie Xi thought of.</p><br/><p>It was hard to hear and worse than the stupid Fork.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t need to read Xie Xi\u2019s mind to know what he was thinking and explained, \u201cThe river bearing spring will pass away, the moon declining over the pool will slant west.\u201d (Jiang = river. The character used in this poem and Xie= slant)</p><br/><p>This poem was familiar. It was Zhang Ruoxu\u2019s A Moonlit Night on the Spring River.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finally knew it was river slant, not zombie but so what? He was still a silly fork anyway.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had long known Xie Xi\u2019s name and there was no need to introduce it. Xie Xi was more curious about something else. \u201cGod X, are you a human?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ever since experiencing the Fairy Tale Town world, Xie Xi knew that players who were selected by the Central Committee weren\u2019t all humans. For example, Aaron was a dragon. Zhong Jin looked human but since he was Aaron\u2019s friend, who knew what species he actually was.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t difficult to understand. If all the games were new worlds about to become independent, the selected people must come from thousands of world. Forget other worlds, the universe where Xie Xi existed might not only contain humans. It might have other intelligent creatures.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie deliberately circumvented the topic because he was a bit distant from the child. The good feelings kept falling and he was afraid that this goodwill value would become a hatred value.</p><br/><p>Although the current -444 was very similar to a hatred value.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome this way.\u201d Jiang Xie moved sideways and Xie Xi saw a little pavilion in the garden. Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help thinking about Love to the Left or Right. Randy often took him to the pavilion for afternoon tea.</p><br/><p>The style wasn\u2019t the same. The pavilion in the quasi-world was more grounded while the one here was airy like clouds.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi followed and sat in a soft wide-back chair.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned over and poured tea for him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi instantly saw the shadow of the housekeeper Randy\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie glanced at him and suddenly said, \u201cYoung Master, please drink the tea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi instantly stiffened and his eyes slightly widened. The result was that -1, -1, -1, -1\u2026 flew towards the -444.</p><br/><p>Well\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie honestly changed the topic. \u201cI am human. In theory, we are homologous.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words really diverted Jiang Xie\u2019s attention. Xie Xi was really scared but he soon remembered the matter regarding the world plot. Jiang Xie must\u2019ve seen it and knew what Xie Xi experienced.</p><br/><p>The young master was playing a trick on him. Xie Xi was in a fit of rage and Jiang Xie had a wave of negative numbers.</p><br/><p>Poor Old Jiang his \u2018world shaken\u2019 countless times and was now a true iron plate!</p><br/><p>\u201cWe might have the same origin,\u201d Jiang Xie hastened to save the precarious goodwill. \u201cBut it is a parallel world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi still wanted to know things and temporarily closed his prejudice. He asked, \u201cDoes it mean our worlds aren\u2019t the same?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to use honorifics.\u201d Jiang Xie continued. \u201cIn fact, as long as the timeline is different, it can be understood as a different world. Your world and mine belong in the same framework and are homologous worlds but the designer is different. There are difference clearance tasks and after the world became independent, it went in a different path. Thus, they became different worlds.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled and couldn\u2019t help taking a breath. \u201cThe designer is different?\u201d The \u2018real\u2019 world where he lived was also designed!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie continued, \u201cAfter a world is cleared, all independent worlds are real. You don\u2019t have to doubt this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s spirit returned and he asked, \u201cAll the worlds are designed? After they are cleared, the Central Government selects players from the independent world to clear new quasi-worlds?\u201d</p><br/><p>It sounded like a loop.</p><br/><p>Designers created a quasi-world where collectors, explorers and recorders entered to complete tasks. They either discovered, collected, recorded or even tested quasi-world problems. Once the clearance task was complete, it would become a new world.</p><br/><p>In the process, a large number of players was bound to be eliminated. Then the Central Government would select new players from the worlds and things would be repeated.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t imagine that his own world was designed. Who designed such a huge, logical and sophisticated world?</p><br/><p>Oh\u2026 Lost Atlantis was also magnificent and logical.</p><br/><p>Thanks to this, Xie Xi instantly lost his curiosity about the \u2018creator god\u2019 of his own world.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mind moved and he asked, \u201cThe Central Government is also designed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie praised him and guided him, \u201cWho knows? Maybe we are in a quasi-world and an existence we don\u2019t understand is trying to complete the clearance task here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shaken.</p><br/><p>It was quite possible, like a Russian doll. This might seem like the whole world but it was actually covered with layers and layers\u2026</p><br/><p>It was ridiculous and very small, so small that the meaning of their own existence couldn\u2019t be found.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cThis question can be considered but don\u2019t question your own existence.\u201d</p><br/><p>What if he questioned it?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help looking at him and wondered earnestly, \u201cIf you deny your existence, will you disappear?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied very firmly. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was sensitive and referred to the first half of his words. \u201cYou mean, no one will deny their existence?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cRight.\u201d This child was really smart.</p><br/><p>No one could really deny their existence because once negated, their existence itself became a paradox.</p><br/><p>Negation didn\u2019t exist because once it existed, it couldn\u2019t be denied.</p><br/><p>The truth of oneself couldn\u2019t be denied so there was no need to ask questions about disappearing.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke again, \u201cYou can\u2019t deny it but you can question. The doubts will blur many things. What you need to do is to firmly believe in yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt thoughtful.</p><br/><p>He spoke these questions but they were difficult to see through. He needed more experience and time to gather to his own truth.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi still had doubts in his heart. \u201cWhy was I chosen?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was estimated that everyone who came to the Central World would be curious about this.</p><br/><p>Why did he become a player, why did he leave the original world and why come to the Central World which was the upper layer of the Russian doll?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes flashed and there was some distress in his voice. \u201cIt is because in your world, no one needed you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi froze as cold moved from the soles of his feet straight up to his chest cavity.</p><br/><p>In his world, no one needed him anymore.</p><br/><p>Yes, his mother Xie Su was pregnant. She had a new child and a new family. He was just a burden.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s low voice continued. \u201c\u2026And you aren\u2019t tied to the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood.</p><br/><p>His only tie in that world was Xie Su.</p><br/><p>He hated her and complained about her but he still loved her.</p><br/><p>This was his mother, his only relative.</p><br/><p>Xie Su was pregnant and gave up on him completely. He knew that his mother had a new life and finally let go.</p><br/><p>The only tie was broken so he came here.</p><br/><p>He was stunned but there weren\u2019t many emotions on his face. This quiet appearance was extra painful.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t know what Xie Xi had experienced in his own world but he could see the soft heart under Xie Xi\u2019s lonely appearance.</p><br/><p>Even if he was abandoned, even if he only had himself, he was still strong.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d Xie Xi sighed with relief. \u201cIt is good that I came here.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t depressed for too long.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t surprised that Xie Su gave up on him. He also gave up on her and they didn\u2019t owe each other anything.</p><br/><p>There were no ties so it was good that he came to the Central World to start a new life.</p><br/><p>Well, it would be better if he didn\u2019t encounter X!</p><br/><p>Jiang. life teacher. Xie found it wasn\u2019t easy to rely on his mouth to add some goodwill as he lost points again\u2026</p><br/><p>It definitely must be broken. What a trash skill.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi cheered up and had a new question. \u201cGod X, what happened to the princes after I cleared the world?\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to know but after thinking about the last scene, he felt he wasn\u2019t qualified to ask.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie pondered a bit before saying good things. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about it. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t worried. Such a thing happened because of X\u2019s perverted design!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t say this but Jiang Xie could guess from the falling goodwill.</p><br/><p>He cleared his throat and explained himself. \u201cThe quasi-world might be my design but I don\u2019t know what the clearance task it. Even without the Quasi-World Protection Law, it is impossible to know because the clearance task isn\u2019t fixed. It will change depending on the world situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi inwardly sneered but there was a smile on his face. \u201cThen I got this task because of my own reasons?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie naturally didn\u2019t dare say it was because of Xie Xi and took the initiative to reveal the truth. \u201cIt is my reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s teeth itched. \u201cThe designer is able to interfere with the clearance task?\u201d This big liar!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie coughed. \u201cIf my soul still remains in the quasi-world, they will affect the clearance task.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t understand this. Why did the six princes want him to pedal six boats? None of them looked like fish who wanted to be cheated on!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained in detail. \u201cYou can understand it as after entering the quasi-world, my souls woke up. They are essentially the creator and one of the factors in the quasi-world that isn\u2019t independent. The clearance task is affected by them. Once they are satisfied, the world can become independent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi still didn\u2019t understand. \u201cThey are satisfied by me pedalling six boats?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cWhat if all of them want to become close to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was cautious. \u201cThey see you and want to become close to you. Everyone\u2019s will is very strong and joined together to become\u2026\u201d Collect the love of six princes.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie emphasized it. \u201cIf someone else entered the world, the task they would receive definitely wouldn\u2019t be like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, no one else could answer but he worked hard to clarify this. \u201cThe essence of Lost Atlantis is a quasi-world that explores the themes of racial integration, sea and land co-existence, environmental protection and art without borders.\u201d</p><br/><p>The tasks were all profound and serious but became love obsessed since Xie Xi arrived.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>So it was really his own reason?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s fake smile became tense and he asked, \u201cWhy do your souls want to be close to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied calmly, \u201cIt was probably love at first sight.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

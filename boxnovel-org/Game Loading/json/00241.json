What do you know about love?\u201d</p><br/><p>These questions completely extinguished the faint cluster of flames in Xie Xi\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>What was he expecting? What was he dreaming of?</p><br/><p>The man in front of him was the supreme god.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t make a sound and only bit his lips.</p><br/><p>Hundreds of years had passed and his appearance had long lost its tenderness and youthfulness. However, the enthusiasm in his bones hadn\u2019t changed in the slightest. He was still the Xie Xi who didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed and would prefer to face death if he didn\u2019t meet the right person.</p><br/><p>The usual Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t bear to see him like this. As long as Xie Xi could be happy, everything was fine. But today\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie closed his eyes and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t forget, you made a god\u2019s oath.\u201d He might\u2019ve tricked Xie Xi to keep Xie Xi by his side but a god\u2019s oath was still a god\u2019s oath. Xie Xi couldn\u2019t repent.</p><br/><p>A god\u2019s oath, it was an oath to a god.</p><br/><p>Was Xie Xi afraid of this oath?</p><br/><p>He suddenly looked up, eyes full of rebellion. \u201cSo what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was dumbfounded and his face was completely blank.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s lips were pale but there was an angry blush on his face. \u201cSo what if I violate the oath?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to live?\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t want to live\u2026 don\u2019t want to live\u2026 he shouldn\u2019t have lived a few hundred years ago!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finally understood what he had been waiting for, what he had been tangled up in and what he had clung to.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to grow up because he wanted a faithful love!</p><br/><p>However, he couldn\u2019t find it. If he couldn\u2019t find it in the Demon World then he wouldn\u2019t have hesitated to give up his life.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hoarsely told Jiang Xie, \u201cWhat is the meaning of living like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes shrank but he only saw Xie Xi\u2019s back as Xie Xi disappeared.</p><br/><p>The great hall was empty and Jiang Xie sat on the throne of the Demon God, nails digging into his palms.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, he shouldn\u2019t be near this succubus.</p><br/><p>Just a few hundred years, it was only a few hundred years but those hundred years scattered in the blink of an eye. He\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was disheartened. He not only refused to see Jiang Xie but also left behind all domain master matters.</p><br/><p>Lord Sloth, who had a good relationship with him, came to ask what was going on.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi directly quit his responsibilities.</p><br/><p>Sloth had never talked a lot. This time, he probably talked a year\u2019s worth. \u201cWhy do you look like this? Is it that you don\u2019t want to do anything without the Demon God\u2019s favour. Is the Demon World in your eyes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi listened and his heart became more and more defeated.</p><br/><p>Other people could see his mind. Was it so obvious?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head and told Sloth, \u201cI was busy as well. It is enough for the Demon World to have him. He never needed me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sloth couldn\u2019t refute his words.</p><br/><p>Indeed\u2026 no matter the domain masters, the Demon World would thrive as long as there was the Demon God.</p><br/><p>Sloth sighed. \u201cWhy are you like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also wanted to know the reason why. Why was he dissatisfied with the status quo, why did he want to think about love?</p><br/><p>But he\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told Sloth, \u201cYou will have to work hard in the future. I want to settle in the First Domain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sloth couldn\u2019t persuade him. After all, Xie Xi wanted the Demon God but the Demon God was the entire Demon World. How could the noble god give him such private feelings?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi went to the First Domain, settled at the border and gazed at the distant Heaven.</p><br/><p>He fantasized about a life in Heaven. He imaged that Jiang Xie was an angel and he was also an angel. They didn\u2019t have the shackles of identity and desire. They simply met and fell in love.</p><br/><p>So what if there wasn\u2019t a long life? A short burst of love was enough for a lifetime.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gazed at Heaven and immersed himself in his aimless fantasies.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Jiang Xie went to Heaven to investigate all the people Xie Xi had met during his visit.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know which angel Xie Xi had fallen in long with. He thought that everyone he saw was impossible and couldn\u2019t think of who it might be.</p><br/><p>For a moment, he wanted to destroy all the angels who had seen Xie Xi to keep him under control.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, it was useless. Xie Xi would only hate him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie left Heaven and saw the soulless Xie Xi in the First Domain.</p><br/><p>He hid his body and stood there, watching Xie Xi gaze at Heaven with a pair of beautiful eyes.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t surprised. If it wasn\u2019t for the oath, Xie Xi would\u2019ve already gone to Heaven.</p><br/><p>It was because he expected such a day that Jiang Xie spoke such conditions, thinking of at least tying this little succubus\u2019 body to him.</p><br/><p>However, what was the use of this?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t look for anyone but he was no longer looking for Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>They were so close but Xie Xi would never look at Jiang Xie again.</p><br/><p>Day after day passed and Xie Xi finally couldn\u2019t stand it.</p><br/><p>The more beautiful the fantasy, the crueler the reality.</p><br/><p>He had left the Seventh Domain for so long but Jiang Xie hadn\u2019t looked for him once.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was angry because Xie Xi overstepped.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had worked had for many things and knew more than most demons, such as the reincarnation ceremony.</p><br/><p>He would use this to break free of all constraints and start a new life.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t willing to die timidly. He wanted to break away from the oath and let the Demon God know that not everything was as he thought and not everything was in his control. Xie Xi could resist him!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie could stop Xie Xi\u2019s reincarnation ceremony but what was the use?</p><br/><p>This was Xie Xi\u2019s decision and Jiang Xie could never control him.</p><br/><p>Once Xie Xi started the ceremony, Jiang Xie stood beside him and watched him sleep, watching his body shrink as he changed from an adult succubus to a young child with a small tail.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi curled up in the formation and closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned over and picked him up, whispering, \u201cDo you hate the Demon World that much?\u201d The Demon World was Jiang Xie. If Xie Xi hated it so much then what was the meaning of Jiang Xie\u2019s existence?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie handed over the sleeping succubus and a white ball of light to Sloth.</p><br/><p>Sloth was surprised. \u201cLord Demon God, Xie Xi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet him start a new life,\u201d Jiang Xie stated. \u201cI am tired and will hand over the Demon World to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Jiang Xie fell into the darkness.</p><br/><p>Since then, the Demon God never appeared and at the same time, a small angel called Jiang Xie appeared in the First Heaven.</p><br/><p>After his reincarnation, Xie Xi forgot everything, including his love.</p><br/><p>He became the Xie Xi who went to Heaven and found love.</p><br/><p>The memories came to an abrupt end.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi confirmed his own thoughts. Sure enough, Angel Jiang and the Demon God were the same person, making him breathe a sigh of relief. Then he thought about this dog blood misunderstanding and wanted to smash Jiang Xie!</p><br/><p>What a trash plot! What type of barren imagination?</p><br/><p>Was Xie Xi a half talker? Was he a man who couldn\u2019t even confess? Why didn\u2019t he straightforwardly say that he loved Jiang Xie? How many times did the ball fall on the racket?</p><br/><p>It seemed that the next ball would have to hit Jiang\u2019s face, hard and ruthless. Let him have a bruised nose and face and see if he dared think about it!</p><br/><p>The memories of before the reincarnation could only be seen by Xie Xi. This time Jiang Xie saw it because he was with Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>At that time, Xie Xi had just been reborn and a little succubus in the shape of a child couldn\u2019t accept the memories. Thus, the Demon God couldn\u2019t see them.</p><br/><p>If he saw them then how could there be these crooked things?</p><br/><p>Of course\u2026 this was a \u2018former setting\u2019 and it only existed after Xie Xi entered the world.</p><br/><p>The angel who didn\u2019t want to be the Demon God was still in a daze.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s senses returned. \u201cYou always loved me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He saw all this and understood the great misunderstanding. Xie Xi loved him and only him.</p><br/><p>Years ago, he would rather die than be casually with people, yet he was together with Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>He went to Heaven where he didn\u2019t meet someone he loved. He just watched a public welfare movie and understood his own heart, understanding that he always loved Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Then Jiang Xie said something like that to him\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was flustered. \u201cI thought you fell in love with another person. I thought you wanted to leave me, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He explained, hated his own misunderstanding of Xie Xi and hating himself for making a mess of things.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was angry but let it when he thought that these bad setting was due to the negative feelings caused by the collapsing world.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also wasn\u2019t good\u2026\u201d Xie Xi told the other person. \u201cI didn\u2019t make things clear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou worked hard, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A succubus and the domain master of lust, how much courage did it take to speak about love to the Demon God? Not only was this opening up his own heart, it was overthrowing faith and subverting the nature of a succubus. He must\u2019ve felt completely desperate.</p><br/><p>Yet Jiang Xie thought Xie Xi said those things because of another person\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to love me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie hated himself even more. \u201cCompared with your courage, I am really weak.</p><br/><p>He liked his little succubus since the first moment they met. However, he hesitated for so long and tied Xie Xi to him with a vile oath, giving their supposedly pure love a bad start.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gave up on blaming Jiang Xie. After all, this wasn\u2019t Jiang Xie\u2019s fault but the fault of the collapsed world.</p><br/><p>Anyone left behind will feel despair.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was once a person who was left behind and could understand.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up at him and asked, \u201cI loved in the last love and I still love you in this life. Then\u2026 do you love me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at him and spoke the long-hidden feelings. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi kissed him and the two people left this world with the sweet kiss.</p><br/><p>Back in the rose garden, Xie Xi saw the sleeping Gemini.</p><br/><p>He sat for a moment and calmed down.</p><br/><p>This world was actually really simple.</p><br/><p>The previous summary might be very dog blood but the result was excellent. As long as it was watched to the end, Xie Xi didn\u2019t have to do anything and the misunderstanding would be lifted.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi carefully reviewed it and found that this was actually Jiang Xie helping himself.</p><br/><p>When Xie Xi first entered, he met Angel Jiang and Angel Jiang was the Demon God whose memory was sealed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi fell in love with the angel and afterwards, the two people went to the Demon World. The Demon God thought that Xie Xi really loved Heaven so he didn\u2019t want to be the Demon God. He just wanted to be a real angel and be together with Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>This led to the collapse of the Demon World.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the Demon God also left a back door for himself, which were the memories before reincarnation.</p><br/><p>As long as Xie Xi watched them with Jiang Xie, Jiang Xie would no longer disregard the identity of the Demon God and the Demon World naturally wouldn\u2019t collapse.</p><br/><p>Rather than say that Xie Xi repaired the world, it was better to say that Jiang Xie was trying to save himself.</p><br/><p>Was this the consciousness of the soul or was Jiang Xie finally able to interfere in the small worlds?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know but he was happy either way!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

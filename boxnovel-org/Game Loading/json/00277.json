It was as if the wounds were on Xie Xi but on his heart.</p><br/><p>He carefully held Xie Xi, the fear in his heart like a giant root under a big tree, tangling around his entire body.</p><br/><p>Why\u2026 was this person always hurt? Why\u2026 couldn\u2019t he protect this person? Why, why\u2026</p><br/><p>The questions, blame and powerlessness glued together, almost collapsing his spirit.</p><br/><p>He healed Xie Xi day and night without sleep. He didn\u2019t dare to blink, as if a moment of darkness would cause him to lose this person forever.</p><br/><p>No, he must never lose Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Once Xie Xi woke up, he saw the pale and tired Houqing who seemed like he hadn\u2019t been sleeping for days.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi complained about this person\u2019s nonsense but he still felt bad for Houqing. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing touched his hand, tested Xie\u2019s forehead with the back of his head before speaking in a near begging voice. \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was humble to the extreme, as if standing on the edge of a cliff and eager for a last way to live.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned and asked in a weak voice, \u201cHouqing, what do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only want you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie XI sneered. \u201cWhat you want is the throne under me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing suddenly looked up. \u201cNo, everything I do is for you.\u201d\u2019</p><br/><p>This was probably the funniest thing Xie Xi had ever heard. \u201cFor me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Making him a figurehead, putting him under house arrest and letting him suffer humiliation, this was all for him?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was cold. \u201cIf you still care about our previous relationship even a little bit, let me go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing trembled and asked, \u201cWhere will you go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was expressionless. \u201cA place without you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing these words, the mud in Houqing\u2019s heart started churning.</p><br/><p>His fear and uneasiness reached the extreme. His eyes became red and his face was as pale as a demon who couldn\u2019t see the sun. He declared, \u201cYou aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>He imprisoned Xie Xi. He no longer let Xie Xi see anyone, no longer let him leave the room and even chained him up.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thoroughly exploded. \u201cYou are mad!\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing whispered nervously, \u201cYou don\u2019t know how scared I have been all these years. You don\u2019t know how scared I was every time you went to the battlefield. You don\u2019t know that every time I saw the dead soldiers, I would think they have your face. You don\u2019t know\u2026 you don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His words reminded Xie Xi\u2019s voice of the memories and his voice softened, \u201cThose things are all gone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing stared at him, the smile making people\u2019s back cold. \u201cI thought it was over. I thought that once you ascended to the throne and became the world\u2019s most noble person, you wouldn\u2019t be in danger again. However, I was wrong\u2026 I was wrong\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned. \u201cNo one is completely safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Houqing shook his head, the white hair looking cold and making him seem paler and sickly. \u201cToo many people want to hurt you. The more I look, the more afraid I am. The more I can\u2019t find them, the more they are like ants. There are too many to be killed. Why\u2026 why do they hurt you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The words made Xie Xi tense. \u201cWhat have you done?!\u201d The empire was just established and everything was on the right track. If killing was used to suppress the rebels then it would end everything!</p><br/><p>The kingdom they worked hard to build was to bring peace and happiness to the people, not to use dictatorship to exert terror and suffering!</p><br/><p>Houqing didn\u2019t seem to hear his voice as he kissed the back of Xie Xi\u2019s hand. \u201cBe obedient, Brother Xie. Stay with me, okay? No matter what you want, I will support you in everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi blew up. \u201cHouqing! What the fuck is wrong with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing kissed his lips, making him speechless. Then Xie Xi bit the tip of his tongue. Houqing\u2019s mouth overflowed with blood but he smiled like it wasn\u2019t painful. \u201cPlease rest. Your wounds haven\u2019t completely recovered.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smelt something and then fell asleep.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only Xie Xi who couldn\u2019t leave this room. Houqing didn\u2019t go out and abandoned everything. He no longer cared about political matters and only stared at Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t trust anyone. The guards were all rubbish and couldn\u2019t protect Xie Xi. No one could protect Xie Xi apart from him. He would protect this person with life and soul, not letting Xie Xi suffer any damage.</p><br/><p>Once Xie Xi\u2019s injuries healed, Xie Xi couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know the man in front of him. This was obviously the little white tiger he saved but Houqing was already a stranger. Xie Xi started a hunger strike and didn\u2019t eat or drink to resist Houqing.</p><br/><p>Houqing asked him, \u201cIsn\u2019t it appetizing? Tell me what you want to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him. \u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing\u2019s thin lips trembled. \u201cIt is dangerous, really dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sneered. \u201cHouqing, this is enough. What do you fucking take me as? I\u2019m not a flower in a greenhouse. I lived in a swamp and walked over mountains while you were still being chased by beasts!\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing was silent.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi ordered, \u201cUndo the chains or I won\u2019t eat!\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, Houqing was forced to remove the chains. However, the doors and windows were still closed and he didn\u2019t leave.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was tired of this person. He couldn\u2019t imagine how his closest person could turn into this! Even the white hair he usually liked had become a disgusting existing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t imagine what was going on outside. Both him and Houqing were absent. He was afraid that the entire empire was torn apart!</p><br/><p>He was increasingly unable to understand Houqing and didn\u2019t know what this person wanted.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t find a way to escape and was going crazy. He asked Houqing, \u201cFor how long are you going to torture me? What did I do to make you hate me so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are too good to me. No one has ever been so good to me. How can I hate you? I\u2026 love you too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was Houqing\u2019s so-called confession.</p><br/><p>In such a situation, Xie Xi only heard the irony and absurdity in the words. Xie Xi smiled sarcastically. \u201cYou love me? Do you love me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing seemed a bit nervous. \u201cI have always\u2026 all the time\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be kidding!\u201d Xie Xi shouted. \u201cThis is what you call love? Let this love go to hell!\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing was shocked.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be entangled with you. Let me go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing\u2019s throat moved. \u201cDon\u2019t say that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him coldly. \u201cIf you love me then sorry, I don\u2019t love you.\u201d</p><br/><p>This made Houqing fall into an ice cave. He smiled with as much strength as possible. \u201cHow is that possible? You are so good to me. How could you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou disgust me.\u201d Xie Xi interrupted. \u201cHow can I full in love with someone like you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing was stunned and there was no lustre in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s spirit was on the verge of collapse. He had been strong all his life. Why did he have to suffer such humiliation now? What\u2019s more, the humiliation was given to him by his loved one. He was extremely angry and thought he was blind for giving his trust to such a madman!</p><br/><p>Houqing spoke sadly. \u201cNo, it is impossible. You don\u2019t hate me. You said that you only have me in his life\u2026\u201d This was what Xie Xi told him during the time they were dependent on each other.</p><br/><p>Without warning, Xie Xi\u2019s fingers turned into claws and he stabbed at his own chest cavity.</p><br/><p>Houqing was shocked.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took out his bloody heart and told Houqing, \u201cThis heart absolutely doesn\u2019t belong to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing saw the bloody heart in front of him and this became his life\u2019s nightmare.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him viciously, \u201cLet me leave or I will crush it.\u201d Due to his physical strength, it was hard to die as long as his heart was still beating. However, once the heart was injured, it was difficult to recover.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing\u2019s pupils shrank. \u201cNo, don\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was pale but his eyes were as dark as an abyss. \u201cLet me go or I will die in front of you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi woke up sweating from this dream. Too exciting! Both of them were neurotic!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finally discovered the cause of this injury\u2026 It wasn\u2019t anyone else who did it. It was committed by his own hand. His heart was dug out but he didn\u2019t die. He wasn\u2019t a normal beast!</p><br/><p>Still, this obviously left a huge hidden danger that led to his body\u2019s decline. It took so many medicines to treat this heart.</p><br/><p>Xie XI had been soaking in the medicinal bath and the scar on his chest had faded a lot. After knowing the situation, he looked at the outline of the scar and could see the traces.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook as he worried about Virgo\u2019s state of mind? How could he collapse so badly? The souls of the other worlds were disheartened at best. Virgo was paranoid to the point of madness.</p><br/><p>Then thinking about it\u2026 Jiang Xie\u2019s souls weren\u2019t lacking in neuroticism.</p><br/><p>In Love was a Dead End, all three of them were sick. Atlantis wasn\u2019t much better and he was also frightened by Randy who tried to resurrect him. After all, the quasi-worlds were completed by Jiang Xie and the souls were much better off.</p><br/><p>In this world, Jiang Xie was fused with Leo and there was no chance with Virgo? Was this what blackened Virgo?</p><br/><p>From the perspective of a bystander, Xie Xi could understand Virgo.</p><br/><p>The war left Virgo with too much psychological trauma. It wasn\u2019t resolved and became more and more intense. He slowly changed from over protection to putting Xie Xi under house arrest. Finally, Xie Xi\u2019s near death completely maddened him.</p><br/><p>After all, Xie Xi\u2019s setting was a founding emperor who fought in a war. How could he understand Houqing\u2019s feelings? How could he feel Houqing\u2019s tension and anxiety? His blind desire to leave completely intensified the contradiction until his act of almost suicide awakened Houqing.</p><br/><p>It was just that this behaviour was too fierce. Houqing let him go but didn\u2019t let himself go.</p><br/><p>Houqing stayed in the Rose Palace and thought of the distant Xie Xi. He was a walking mass of pain, guilt, despair and restlessly.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sat on the bed for a while and sighed once his heart no longer hurt.</p><br/><p>Then he soon became nervous again.</p><br/><p>It was broken\u2026 in this state of mind, wouldn\u2019t Houqing\u2019s old disease reoccur after watching Xie Xi and Leo day and night?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew there was a previous setting and Houqing wouldn\u2019t dare anger him but Leo\u2026</p><br/><p>The souls were always sly and ruthless to themselves, never merciful.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

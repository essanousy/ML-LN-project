I\u2019ll go buy it for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie followed his brain circuits and said, \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t how expensive it is but that money shouldn\u2019t be spent indiscriminately.\u201d</p><br/><p>This saying\u2026 it made sense but didn\u2019t it seem like there was something wrong? Xie Xi didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie continued, \u201cThere is no need to spend unnecessary money. I\u2019m not in a hurry and will wait for you to make it for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was in a ditch again and nodded, \u201cYes, wait a few days and I\u2019ll make it for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s lips curved in complete satisfaction.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until later when Old Jiang bought the machine to make takoyaki that Xie Xi came to his senses.</p><br/><p>What was money shouldn\u2019t be spent indiscriminately, it shouldn\u2019t be wasted?</p><br/><p>What shouldn\u2019t be spent was the money to buy a machine! Having this type of thing at home was the biggest waste!</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, it was already too late. Now Xie Xi was shrouded in the dazzling aura of \u2018Teacher Jiang is a good person\u2019 and his filter was especially deep. It was easy to be fooled.</p><br/><p>They bought the ingredients and Jiang Xie turned into the stationary area. Xie Xi didn\u2019t suspect him and thought Teacher Jiang was buying a book to prepare for lessons.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw a white book instantly and picked it up. \u201cDoes this look good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie glanced at the notebook again. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good?\u201d</p><br/><p>The milk-white book had a few\u2026 they were probably rose indentations? The shape wasn\u2019t round and it was very childish. Jiang Xie opened the book and the colourful paper inside stung Xie Xi\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Teacher Jiang, a bit man actually liked things like this. Sure enough\u2026 um\u2026 Really fancy!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled and told him, \u201cIt\u2019s very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Every person\u2019s aesthetics were different. He didn\u2019t agree but he shouldn\u2019t discriminate. Who cared if it was a big man and big woman, they all had to be respected.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wondered, \u201cIs it appropriate to give to people?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was relieved. It turned out to be a gift\u2026 that\u2019s fine, young girls would like it a lot.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is appropriate!\u201d Xie Xi encouraged him. \u201cThe other person will certainly like such a beautiful book.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also think so.\u201d Then Jiang Xie handed the book to Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up at him. \u201c?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie grinned, revealing his white teeth. \u201cI\u2019m giving it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi accepted the girl\u2019s book with a stunned face. \u201cWhy give it to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Did he look like a person who would use this type of book? What type of misunderstanding did Teacher Jiang have about him?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you wanted to do the bookkeeping?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cI already have a book. There is no need\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Jiang Xie interrupted. \u201cHello, I want to check this out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The brain circuits were currently going through the following loop: Jiang Xie\u2019s mind was full of the child and the white hands holding such a lovely book.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt this book was picked according to Teacher Jiang\u2019s taste and Teacher Jiang was a man with the heart of a girl. He wanted to see Xie Xi use such an embarrassing thing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi solemnly declared, \u201cTeacher, rest assured. I will use it well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s guess was strengthened!</p><br/><p>The two people bought a pile of things and went home. Then Xie Xi rolled up his sleeves. \u201cTeacher, you must be busy. I will call you when it is time for dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t want to go do work, he wanted to see Xie Xi cook.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi comforted him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m used to this. There will be no problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t continue staying here. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>He went to the study but his heart was itchy as he thought about the kitchen. It was wonderful to have another person in the house.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi made a meat and vegetable soup and when he placed it on the table, Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t wait for Xie Xi to call for him and came out.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi laughed. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d He thought Jiang Xie was too hungry to wait.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was a bit hungry but it was more because of inexplicable expectations.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt smells good.\u201d Jiang Xie stated.</p><br/><p>\u201cTry it. If there is anywhere that isn\u2019t tasty, tell me and I\u2019ll adjust it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie nodded and sat at the table. He couldn\u2019t wait to move his chopsticks.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi watched a bit nervously. He felt that he cooked well but he wasn\u2019t sure if Jiang Xie would like it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned for a while before smiling brightly. \u201cDelicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed with relief and also smiled. \u201cI\u2019m glad Teacher likes it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw his smile and thought in his heart, \u2018I like it, I like it so much!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cCome and eat together.\u201d Jiang Xie called out to him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll eat in a while\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so polite with me. It is boring to eat alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words poked at Xie Xi. He knew better than anyone how lonely it was to eat alone. Xie Xi originally thought it was very inappropriate but now he felt it didn\u2019t matter. They were both alone and understood what it felt like.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll gladly eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>After eating, Xie Xi cleaned up the dishes while Jiang Xie used all his strength to control his hands and not help. After all, this was a person he barely convinced and he had to hold back.</p><br/><p>He could control his hands but not his legs. Jiang Xie walked into the kitchen, saw Xie Xi washing the bowls by hand and immediately said, \u201cYou should use the dishwasher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe dishwasher is very easy to use.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cI won\u2019t use it.\u201d He had never used this thing before. Jiang Xie also hadn\u2019t used it but the modern electrical appliances were very easy to understand. As long as people didn\u2019t fear it, the usage could be figured out.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cI\u2019ll teach you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t doubt him. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie quickly glanced at the operations panel and pretended to be proficient. Don\u2019t worry about doing it properly, it just had to look like he did it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t understand but he was very supportive. \u201cIt was originally like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was probably it\u2026 Jiang Xie asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t it simple?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi continuously nodded, \u201cVery convenient!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should use the dishwasher because it has sterilization at high temperatures. It is better than washing by hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>This child\u2019s hand was so tender. How could it always be soaked in water? Xie Xi sincerely thought, \u2018It is good to have money. I want to be a teacher in the future!\u2019</p><br/><p>After finishing in the kitchen, Xie Xi picked up the vacuum cleaner and started cleaning.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was rushed back to the study. He used the excuse of getting a glass of water to peek at the work. He saw the heavy vacuum cleaner and then returned to the study. The laptop web page became Taobao and the search content was: the best vacuum cleaner.</p><br/><p>There was a sweeping robot? No, if he bought a sweeping robot then Xie Xi might feel there was no work to do. What if he quit?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie picked the most expensive and lightest cordless handheld vacuum cleaner.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi used the washing machine to do the laundry and placed them to dry on the balcony. The clock pointed to 9 o\u2019clock. Xie Xi moved in a circle to check and after confirming there were no problems, he knocked on the door of the study.</p><br/><p>Teacher Jiang, who was picking a washing machine in the study, called out, \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi came in and stated, \u201cTeacher, I\u2019ll go back first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie looked up at the time and got up. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll send you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hurriedly refused. \u201cNo, I can go back on my own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s house was a bit far but now he had money and could take the bus.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can that be?\u201d Jiang Xie acted sorrowfully. \u201cA teacher for a day is a father for life. This old father will naturally send his child home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or cry. \u201cThere is really no need, I can take the bus.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cYou are working for me and it is the boss\u2019 obligation to take care of the safety of the employees.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to say something but Jiang Xie had already put on his coat and grabbed the car keys.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cIt\u2019s too much trouble\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly get in the car with me. I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He could only trot to keep up with this person\u2019s steps.</p><br/><p>This week, Xie Xi was very happy. He lived well and never had such a long lasting good mood. The time he spent smiling in this one week might exceed the previous decades.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi liked this job and he also liked the humorous Teacher Jiang. The most satisfying thing was that every meal was eaten clean.</p><br/><p>This was undoubtedly the biggest encouragement for a cook!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also liked the new vacuum cleaner. A vacuum cleaner could actually be so light. Not only was it wireless, it was also extremely powerful and there were seven or eight different heads that could be changed.</p><br/><p>There was a suction head that was specifically used to clean beds. Xie Xi used it for the first time and then told Jiang Xie, \u201cYou see, it is full of mites!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes curved. In fact, these were just cotton buds but he wasn\u2019t willing to tear down this person\u2019s thoughts and agreed. \u201cIt is really scary. Fortunately, you cleaned it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will also go clean the sofa.\u201d The vacuum cleaner was used as a toy.</p><br/><p>This week, Jiang Xie was also having a wonderful time. He had been lonely for 20 years. This type of happiness and satisfaction was unimaginable to people who had never experienced it before.</p><br/><p>The two happy people had their own little troubles.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s trouble was that Jiang Xie would send him home every night. This was too much trouble but no matter what he said, Jiang Xie still insisted.</p><br/><p>The trouble with Jiang Xie was that he was too greedy. He wanted to see the child if he got up in the middle of the night.</p><br/><p>On this day, Jiang Xie had a meeting and it wouldn\u2019t finish until 9 o\u2019clock. Xie Xi asked him, \u201cWill you be coming home for dinner?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sent back a WeChat. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi waited for him at home and waited until around 10 o\u2019clock. Jiang Xie had spoken from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. and his voice was hoarse. He was also a bit tired.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw him come back and quickly reheated the meal while also making a light soup. Jiang Xie leaned against the kitchen door and said, \u201cThere is no need to bother. That\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t budge. \u201cIt\u2019ll be done soon. Teacher, just wait.\u201d Jiang Xie waited at the door, staring at the apron that was tied around Xie Xi\u2019s waist.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned around and was startled. \u201cTeacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was surprised and his brow furrowed. \u201cI\u2019m tired. I must\u2019ve fallen asleep standing here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cThere is a meeting for eight hours, who would be able to stand it? Come, eat first and then you can rest early.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them had dinner before Xie Xi said, \u201cDon\u2019t send me back tonight. I\u2019ll go by myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>The teacher was too tired today and couldn\u2019t drive him back. Jiang Xie leaned down. \u201cI have an idea\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was putting the dishes in the dishwasher and only realized after a while. \u201cHrmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe idea\u2026 if you agree, it will be a lot easier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned to look at him. \u201cTeacher, say it. As long as it is within my power, I will certainly agree!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s voice was slightly hoarse and continued a different taste. \u201cMove in with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie already dug the pit. He squeezed his eyebrows together and made an exhausted expression. \u201cThis way, I don\u2019t have to worry about your safety when you go home at night and you can also prepare breakfast for me in the morning.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If they hadn\u2019t lost their arms or legs then they would be great teammates.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about the nature of this game field and wasn\u2019t surprised. These people had just finished the I love you VS shameless game.</p><br/><p>This was also to prevent people from exchanging information about the games.</p><br/><p>However, Miss Yun just said that she had enough intelligence. Perhaps she met an acquaintance who played more than one game like Xie Xi meeting Kong Ronglian.</p><br/><p>In general, these odds were very small.</p><br/><p>First of all, this person had to complete two games and the second game had to be the same as her so that they appeared in the same rest area. They also had to be familiar enough to exchange information.</p><br/><p>Even if they exchanged information, she had to be lucky enough to pick this project.</p><br/><p>The odds of this were so small that it was negligible. The game field didn\u2019t have so much luck.</p><br/><p>For example, Xie Xi received information on the carousel but he didn\u2019t pick that project. Of course, Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to piece the brain-breaking game that was riding on the zombie horses!</p><br/><p>The man without a left arm gazed at Jiang Xie in a dejected manner, \u201cYou are too stupid. The two of you will die if you stay here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The famous figure in the Central Government and the SS-grade designer X was called stupid twice in one day. Xie Xi actually felt a bit\u2026 happy.</p><br/><p>The brother without a right arm also said, \u201cThere is no point in being sentimental. Brotherhood is good but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie interrupted, \u201cWe aren\u2019t brothers.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the point! He was somewhat annoyed with the missing arm brothers who analyzed his life problem.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie calmly told them, \u201cWe are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi always thought that X had no brains and quickly said, \u201cHe is my master! We are student and teacher!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi raised a smiling face. \u201cMaster, you as so kind. I knew you wouldn\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled at him. \u201cI can leave anything but I can\u2019t live without you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The no arm brothers heard this thick and impure taste and had the same expression. The teacher and student were in love, no wonder why they had to die together.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was furious and didn\u2019t want to find arms for them!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are going to die yet you are still in the mood to smile.\u201d The one who said this was a short-haired man without a leg. He was thinner than the people present and his expression was the ugliest.</p><br/><p>The I love you VS shameless game gave him a huge shock and the group of people just now had broken his hope. Thus, his spirit was very unstable. \u201cDo you know who that woman is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought, \u2018Who can it be? In any case, she can\u2019t be a female version of X.\u2019</p><br/><p>The short-haired man exclaimed in a tone that scared them to death. \u201cShe is Miss Yunge! Don\u2019t you know Yunge? The largest organization in Central, filled with senior players and even excellent designers!\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh\u2026 them\u2026</p><br/><p>He spoke such sensational news but Jiang Xie and Xie Xi were indifferent. Then the man became annoyed, \u201cYou are newcomers who know nothing!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man who hadn\u2019t spoken seemed to be afraid of pain and he whispered, \u201cHer name is Yun Die. This time, she brought a dozen elites to open the world together. There is also an intermediate explorer. I have seen him and he should\u2019ve received all the intermediate qualifications. He is very strong!\u201d</p><br/><p>How strong could he be? Could he string up a group of zombies?</p><br/><p>The man without a left arm spoke up. \u201cIt is no use saying this. They have got on the car so let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The short-haired man without a leg resisted, \u201cI won\u2019t go! I would rather wait here to die than be fed to zombies.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man without a left arm raised his eyebrow. \u201cIf you don\u2019t go, we will be missing a person and the car won\u2019t start. Do you want us to die here with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard this and knew why Yun Die waited for them to arrive. The rules of the game stated that the car had to be full before it started.</p><br/><p>The short-haired man sneered. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this? You will die anyway!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other man with no arm had a more explosive temper, \u201cYou want to die but we want to fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>The short-haired man cursed, \u201cFuck, a bunch of cripples will just die!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man without a right arm cried out, \u201cHow do you know without trying? You might not have a leg but you aren\u2019t even bloody!\u201d</p><br/><p>The short-haired man sneered. \u201cIn any case\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish, Xie Xi stood before him and asked, \u201cDo you want to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>The short-haired man looked up to sweat but became stunned.</p><br/><p>The young man who didn\u2019t need to use face cream had a pair of very beautiful eyes. However, at this time, they were filled with an explicit intention to kill. His pale lips were slightly raised and his voice was like an ice blade buried at the bottom of an abyss. \u201cI can help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The short-haired man had a sallow complexion. \u201cYou, what are you going to do?\u201d Xie Xi slowly asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t it boring waiting here to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>The short-haired man was frightened. \u201cIf you kill me, you won\u2019t have enough people. This is also a dead end!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t get on the car anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>The short-haired man stuttered, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cThere are dead ends to the left and right. Since you are anxious to die early, I will help you first.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the baptism of the first world, it was easy for Xie Xi to pretend to be crazy and he easily tricked the short-haired man.</p><br/><p>They were all players. Xie Xi might seem soft but he couldn\u2019t be regarded as a child. Not to mention that he was missing a limb. It would be easy if this young man really wanted to kill him.</p><br/><p>Putting aside this short-haired man, the other three also felt awkward.</p><br/><p>Only Jiang Xie had an almost uncontrollable smile on his face. How was this child so cute?</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d The short-haired man burst out before getting up. \u201cYou\u2019re a damn lunatic.\u201d He jumped pretty fast on one leg and got into the car.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at the other three and they also got on the car without speaking.</p><br/><p>Not all of the four people were frightened and even felt some hope. These two able-bodied people seemed confident. Could they be strong enough to act for six people?</p><br/><p>They spoke about death but who actually wanted to die? They might lack an arm or leg but they had tenaciously arrived at this second project. Who would be willing to wait for death?</p><br/><p>They got on the car and the game begun.</p><br/><p>A voice was heard in their ears, \u201cWelcome to chicken mobilization. Please try to defeat these nasty chickens! The high scoring team in the first round will be able to upgrade their car and the second round will be safer! Come on! These chickens are too annoying. Be sure to kill them all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi quickly thought about the message.</p><br/><p>The task was to defeat the chickens and the clearance conditions might be to kill. At present, it seemed that there were two rounds and it was a team competition mode. The team with the higher score could upgrade their car, which was more advantageous in the second round of combat\u2026</p><br/><p>Yun Die had already set off early and had probably gained a lot of points already. Xie Xi thought there would be a scoreboard and sure enough, he looked in front and saw a fluorescent card. The words on it were simple and rough.</p><br/><p>First Car: 22 points.</p><br/><p>Second Car: 0 points.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s group was obviously in the second car. The short-haired man started to speak frustrated words, \u201cHow can we fucking survive?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was already in the car so Xie Xi was too lazy to care about him and sat down next to Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>The four disabled people still wanted to live. They took their seats according to the serial number and were responsible for one direction.</p><br/><p>The car was round and had six seats facing six directions. Each seat had a long knife. Based on this, it was obvious that the chickens would come from six directions and one person was responsible for one side. That\u2019s why Yun Die hoped to find a strong person.</p><br/><p>Since attacks were coming from six directions, one gap was fatal. It was best to have six steady people so the survival rate was the highest.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s combat effectiveness was ordinary and he might not be able to beat a chicken.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why he sat next to Jiang Xie, so they could take care of each other. The thing he wasn\u2019t sure about was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I put chicken legs on them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie muffled a laugh. \u201cIf the chickens are big then it should be easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought of that image and felt complicated. \u201cWon\u2019t they be too ugly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are afraid of death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Xie Xi was relieved. \u201cI hope they are big chickens!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi noticed his strange expression and asked, \u201dWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie coughed and replied, \u201cApprentice, I taught you well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><br/><p>The stinky Teacher Jiang, \u201cDon\u2019t say chicken. You are I are civilized.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was good that Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t see the goodwill refreshing or he would probably flinch and zip up his mouth.</p><br/><p>The car started and Xie Xi was able to see the chicken\u2026</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the chickens were very small. They looked like normal, fierce roosters. Their chicken crown was colourful and they didn\u2019t seem seriously strong at first glance!</p><br/><p>The chickens were small but the surprising thing was they were riding a zombie alone. It seemed they could manipulate these zombies as they rushed towards the car!</p><br/><p>The four people with limbs missing were pale and shivering.</p><br/><p>This game really wasn\u2019t simple. The chickens were simply fixtures while the real mobilization was the zombies!</p><br/><p>So many zombies\u2026 there were no end to them. Even if they weren\u2019t seriously injured and had limbs missing, they wouldn\u2019t be able to kill so many zombies!</p><br/><p>What about the two people who were physically sound? It was impossible even if they had full intermediate qualifications. They could only run away from the zombie tide!</p><br/><p>It was over, it was over. A real dead end.</p><br/><p>The short-haired man said, \u201cI fucking said it already. Getting on the car is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The man beside him cut off a zombie\u2019s arm. The angle was just right and push sprayed all over him.</p><br/><p>The short-haired man stiffened and turned to look at Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had long been annoyed with him. Could this person stop polluting the child\u2019s ears with swear words?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also cut a zombie on his side and told Jiang Xie, \u201cHelp me stop them for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was easy with the zombies. The four disabled people could be resurrected full of blood!</p><br/><p>The first car.</p><br/><p>Yun Die looked at the counter.</p><br/><p>Zhou Wuwei spoke from beside her, \u201cMiss, rest assured. We will definitely win the first round.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had 26 points while the second car had 0 points. It was estimated that those people didn\u2019t even have the courage to get on the car!</p><br/><p>Yun Die thought of that handsome and extraordinary man and lamented, \u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t think he was a fool.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second car has points!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you yelling? So what if they have points? With four crippled people, they can only cut off a few heads\u2026\u201d Zhou Wuwei couldn\u2019t finish his words because he was gobsmacked.</p><br/><p>Yun Die asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d She looked up at the scoreboard and froze.</p><br/><p>How could this be?</p><br/><p>Why did the second car suddenly have 25 points?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Xie Xi felt furious when he heard these worlds. So superstitious! This was still a high school student!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare to make a sound. Jiang Xie was already isolated and it would be even worse if it was discovered he brought a cat to school.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, there were still normal people. The transfer student Kang Hong burst out laughing. \u201cWhat are you talking about? Isn\u2019t it forbidden to believe in these things since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China?\u201d</p><br/><p>What ghost eyes? He thought his classmates were joking.</p><br/><p>The classmate had a serious expression. \u201cIt really is evil. You might not believe it but many people have been affected.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong refuted, \u201cHis eye colours are just a bit different. Is this worth making a fuss about?\u201d The boy was quite lively and joked around, \u201cDon\u2019t you think this is cool? The different coloured eyes is a setting in comics!\u201d</p><br/><p>This made Xie Xi very happy. Yes, this was a normal high school student. Did they not watch anime? Why were they scared of different coloured eyes?</p><br/><p>The classmate was cautious. \u201cThere was a new teacher who didn\u2019t believe it previously. Then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong asked, \u201cWhat happened afterwards?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was also very curious. He wanted to hear more but at this time, Jiang Xie turned off the tap, went outside and interrupted their conversation.</p><br/><p>The moment he saw Jiang Xie, the classmate\u2019s expression changed, closed his eyes and turned to flee.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This was too poisonous! Jiang Xie moved away without looking at anyone. Kang Hong called out, \u201cJiang Xie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stood still.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to their nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cThey aren\u2019t speaking nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong was stunned.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t look at him while speaking indifferently, \u201cThat new teacher asked me a question in class and was then diagnosed with lung cancer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong stayed and wondered, \u201cWhat does that have to do with you? Won\u2019t he still be sick even if he didn\u2019t ask the question?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t speak and strode towards the stairwell.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong caught up. \u201cIt definitely isn\u2019t an illness that can be caught in a day or two. Isn\u2019t it just a coincidence?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t explain. He just accelerated his pace and kept a sufficient distance.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was uncomfortable. There were still many people like Kang Hong in this world but Jiang Xie lost the courage to be in contact with people.</p><br/><p>No matter what happened before, it was conceivable that there must be many people around him who were unfortunate.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was a coincidence or perhaps there were other factors. It was just that under the fierce rumours, all the blame was pushed on Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie acquiesced to this exclusion and isolation because he also believed that he was cursed and didn\u2019t want to bring disaster to people.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suddenly understood why he was a cat. If he was a person, he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to get close to Jiang Xie. He couldn\u2019t get close to the Jiang Xie who blocked himself in order to protect others. Xie Xi sighed in the schoolbag, distressed for the young man outside.</p><br/><p>The moment Jiang Xie walked out the school gate, he took Xie Xi out because he was afraid of the kitten suffocating.</p><br/><p>\u201cPoor thing.\u201d Meow.</p><br/><p>Temperature filled Jiang Xie\u2019s cold eyes. \u201cToday was really good. You weren\u2019t discovered by anyone.\u201d The kitten was quiet and sensibly avoided other people.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi cried out, \u201cCrap!\u201d How could he be discovered?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie understood his cat language. \u201cLet\u2019s go back and I\u2019ll play with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi remembered the colourful and dazzling fairy stick.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s bad mood was blown away by the kitten\u2019s soft and \u2018coquettish\u2019 nature. No matter what happened outside, he wasn\u2019t alone when he went home.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie felt some expectations and wanted to go back to prepare food for the kitten.</p><br/><p>As it happened, he had just entered the community when he saw an acquaintance.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong made an unexpected expression. \u201cJiang Xie, you live here too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned. He didn\u2019t expect to see Kang Hong again. He quickly turned his eyes away with a \u201cYes.\u201d Then he walked towards his unit door.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong chased him. \u201cI\u2019m just in unit six. We moved in the other day. This is your unit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t talk to him.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong exclaimed, \u201cWe are classmates and live in the same community. Don\u2019t be so indifferent.\u201d Then he touched Little Jiang\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s body stiffened and his footsteps stopped. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><br/><p>His low voice was filled with deterrence, shocking Kang Hong.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cAll the rumours are true. Stay away from me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong paused before chasing again. He stood in front of Jiang Xie and declared, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that I can die after you looking at me. My body is healthy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished speaking when he saw the little kitten in Jiang Xie\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cHello teenager.\u201d Meow meow.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong\u2019s eyes flashed with small stars. \u201cSo cute!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d There was the feeling of his state being changed!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned and his face was as stiff as a board.</p><br/><p>The cat slave Kang Hong immediately approached. \u201cAre you raising it? It\u2019s so little, so cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had no idea what to say.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong continued. \u201cMy mother is allergic to cat hair and my family can\u2019t raise cats. However, my sister raised two after getting married and I often go to see them\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know Kang Hong was a chatterbox before. Once he started talking about cats, he couldn\u2019t stop.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie held Xie Xi and didn\u2019t go anywhere.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong had completely ignored his classmates\u2019 warnings and only wanted to have a good relationship with Jiang Xie thanks to the cat.\u201dWhat is it called?\u201d He asked for the name of the kitten.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie hadn\u2019t given the kitten a name because he felt he couldn\u2019t raise it.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong saw through this. \u201cYou haven\u2019t given it a name yet? Then you have to think about it. Wait for me to go back and help you find a name with good luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi rolled his eyes. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t superstitious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong cried out, \u201cListen to it! So cute!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finally understood the mood of pets. Humans didn\u2019t understand them no matter what and it was really frustrating.</p><br/><p>In the end, Jiang Xie was still a young man and in his deep heart, he also wanted contact with people.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo we need to check it?\u201d He asked Kang Hong seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, find a few good names and let it choose.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked curiously, \u201cHow can it choose?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong explained, \u201cRead the names to the cat and see which one it is interested in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt turned out to be like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi blinked at the fooled young Jiang Xie and was too lazy to turn things over.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong was worthy of someone who had a cat in his sister\u2019s home and he knew a lot. \u201cYou just picked it up, right? Have you taken it to the vet for an examination? Have you got it vaccinated? There is sterilization\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shocked. \u201cShut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie shook his head. \u201cI only took it home yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you should take it to the pet hospital on the weekend and check its body first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie nodded solemnly. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong added, \u201cOnce I go home, I\u2019ll ask my sister to call the hospital to make an appointment for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be polite. Later, don\u2019t stop me from playing with the kitten, haha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie paused but it was impossible for him to say words of rejection. Jiang Xie went home with Xie Xi. Xie Xi disliked Kang Hong\u2019s idea about sterilization but he was also very pleased. At least there was a classmate\u2026 even if this classmate\u2019s motivation wasn\u2019t pure!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie touched the kitten. \u201cI\u2019ll prepare food for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi still had to resolve his physiological problem and first went to the litter box.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie ate noodles and Xie Xi also didn\u2019t have much harvest. He didn\u2019t find out what this world\u2019s currency was like.</p><br/><p>In fact, he could draw many valuable things such as gold. However, Jiang Xie\u2019s age was too small. An underage person bringing a piece of gold to a pawn shop would make people suspicious. Then it would cause trouble when Xie Xi was trying to improve this youth\u2019s life.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about it and could only hate his cat body. If he was a person then he would raise Little Jiang in an instant.</p><br/><p>There were still classes in the afternoon. Based on Xie Xi\u2019s good performance, Jiang Xie continued bringing him to school.</p><br/><p>They met Kang Hong on the way and Kang Hong whispered, \u201cIs the cat at home?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie nodded.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong requested, \u201cCan I go to your house to do homework at night?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had a cat\u2019s ears and thought, \u2018What homework? In fact, you want to play with a cat!\u2019</p><br/><p>Then he remembered that this cat was himself and felt dislike.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie frowned.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong told him, \u201cI have never raised a cat but I often go to my sister\u2019s house and have experience. I will show you tips about cat food and cat litter. If you do it wrong, the cat might get hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>The entry point was enough and Jiang Xie finally agreed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi placed his cat paws on his chin and thought, \u2018Okay, you finally want to have a friend so I will deign to accompany you and play.\u2019</p><br/><p>In the afternoon classes, the new student Kang Hong was very miserable. He had to receive new textbooks and a school uniform. He also had to greet his teachers and classmates, so he was very busy.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stayed alone in the last row but he was very happy. As long as he reached out, he could touch a soft and fluffy cat.</p><br/><p>If he teased it, the kitten would bite him with small teeth which weren\u2019t painful at all, only a bit itchy.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was in an unprecedented good mood all dark. It seemed that since meeting this kitten, his dark life had a different colour. It was sunshine, an incredible cozy colour.</p><br/><p>After school, Jiang Xie was still alone. He had just exited the school gate and released Xie Xi when the panting Kang Hong caught up. \u201cWe agreed to do homework together. Why didn\u2019t you wait for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had deliberately avoided Kang Hong because he was afraid this person would be in danger. He was also afraid Kang Hong would be crowded out by their classmates.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong saw the kitten instantly and ignored everything else as he exclaimed, \u201cYou brought the cat to school.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a wonderful topic and Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cIt is very well-behaved.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I didn\u2019t hear it at all. Did it stay in the hole at your desk?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie nodded.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong asked, \u201cDid it sleep all afternoon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cNo, it only slept in Chinese class.\u201d Xie Xi had fallen asleep thanks to the Chinese teacher\u2019s ancient language.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong was surprised. \u201cIt was awake yet didn\u2019t run around?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie nodded. \u201cIt is very sensible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally sensible! I also want to raise such a good cat!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled, his gaze towards Xie Xi filled with gentleness and satisfaction.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi bowed his head and licked this person\u2019s palm.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong was crazy with envy. \u201cIt licked you, it licked you with a pink and tender tongue!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s ears were almost deafened by this person!</p><br/><p>Kang Hong came over. \u201cYes, lick me too. Kitty, lick me too okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shouted, \u201cNot good!\u201d He turned his head and didn\u2019t look at this person.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was amused. \u201cIt is afraid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong didn\u2019t force it. \u201cOnce I play with it a few more days, it won\u2019t be afraid of me and will\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Cat Xie who had no expression. \u201cDream on!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong exclaimed, \u201cIt said yes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d In a fit of rage, he drilled into Jiang Xie\u2019s bag and didn\u2019t go out!</p><br/><p>The teenagers walked home together, looking like an image of normal students. People who had this habit wouldn\u2019t understand how lonely it was to walk alone.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong might be talkative but Xie Xi didn\u2019t hate him. It was because the Jiang Xie in front of him was too quiet and it was unbelievable compared to the Jiang Xie who loved to talk nonsense in Central.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was thinking about coming out once they approached the door of the community when Jiang Xie\u2019s shout was heard. \u201cKang Hong, be careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, who poked out his head, saw a speeding car rushing straight at Kang Hong. Jiang Xie dropped his bag and flew forward to push Kang Hong away.</p><br/><p>Then what about Jiang Xie? How could he escape?</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t too late. Xie Xi took out the sketch pen and drew a different space shield which protected Jiang Xie\u2019s body.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

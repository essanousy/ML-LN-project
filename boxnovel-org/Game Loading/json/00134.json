Xie Xi was dazed and wasn\u2019t too clear about the situation.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon wore a moonlight garment with a dragon pattern flashing on the sleeves. His body was slender and his facial features were cold. In the beautiful sunshine, he was as fresh as the first snow.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was slightly startled and stared blankly.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon whispered, \u201cYou are a little rose. How can you know Houqing of the Demon Sea?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t answer and he was still curious about his situation.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon in front of him was unscathed and wasn\u2019t in the half-dead state. This wasn\u2019t Azure Dragon Palace. Flowers were blooming in the distance and the sky was full of sunshine. Was this the flower festival? Did he accidentally enter the painting?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t understand and slightly frowned while thinking.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon leaned over and said, \u201cYou are badly hurt. I\u2019ll take you to heal your wounds.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi moved and the pain caused him to frown.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon picked him up and wondered, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you change back to your original form first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was a good person who didn\u2019t want to be a rose. He was afraid that once he became a flower, he wouldn\u2019t be able to turn back. He wasn\u2019t very skillful with this transformation!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head. Azure Dragon reassured him, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter as long as you are comfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>His temperament was warm and his voice was very nice. His body had a fresh scent like jungle bamboo and inexplicable reassured people.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi whispered, \u201cSage, thank you for saving me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon was slightly surprised. \u201cYou recognize me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi explained, \u201cOur Rose Mountain has been blessed by the sage for many years. Of course I recognize you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon smiled. \u201cI have never seen a little rose like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t like being called this by people because he always felt it was a joke. However, Azure Dragon\u2019s tone was gentle and Xie Xi couldn\u2019t refute that he was a rose. \u201cI\u2019m not little. I have long become an adult.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon was startle. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u202619 years old.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon\u2019s eyes were full of laughter. \u201cYou are really an adult but you are still a little rose.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Fine, who made him a real rose flower!</p><br/><p>The teasing from Azure Dragon was actually to distract Xie Xi from his pain. Xie Xi also felt this and his heart warmed.</p><br/><p>The doctor arrived and Azure Dragon carefully put Xie Xi down.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know his own situation and only felt that his lower body was numb. The doctor frowned as he examined Xie Xi for a long time. \u201cThis injury\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon interrupted. \u201cSay it outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor bowed and followed him out. Xie Xi became even less aware of what was wrong with him. After a while, Azure Dragon came back. There was a shadow on his face but he smiled. \u201cYou are fortunate. If it was delayed any longer, no one could save you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thanked him.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke easily but the doctor came in with a white pill in his hand. The doctor\u2019s posture was dignified and tense, as if he was reluctant.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon didn\u2019t care. He took the medicinal pill and placed it against Xie Xi\u2019s mouth. \u201cEat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very sensitive and realized that things might not be simple. \u201cYour Excellency, this medicine\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the usual blood staunching pill. You eat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said this and the doctor looked like he was going to cough up blood. If this was a blood staunching pill, the doctor would probably have to take it first to stop his internal bleeding.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt that this was something that happened a long time ago and no longer thought about it as he ate the pill.</p><br/><p>This \u2018blood staunching pill\u2019 was very strong. After eating it, Xie Xi felt itchy, sore and painful. It was indescribable.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon held his hand. \u201cIt will be a bit uncomfortable. Please endure it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was somewhat unable to maintain his mind. He gritted his teeth but couldn\u2019t prevent himself from crying out.</p><br/><p>He vaguely heard Azure Dragon\u2019s low reprimand, \u201cWhat is happening?\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor was terrified. \u201cThis Qing Pill is a world treasure and has the effect of resurrection. This small rose\u2019s foundation is too shallow and it is normal that he can\u2019t withstand it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon cried out, \u201cIt\u2019s been too long!\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor replied, \u201cI have a bottle of analgesia here. If used, he will surely sleep well and will be fully recovered when he wakes up. Just\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what?\u201d \u201cThis analgesic has some side-effects.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat side effects?\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor explained, \u201cHe might forget some of the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt he would die from the pain and vaguely heard Azure Dragon\u2019s gentle yet pained voice. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, it will stop hurting soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>At his gentle whisper, Xie Xi stopped feeling pain and he seemed to fall asleep. He woke up refreshed without any more discomfort.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon watched over him for one night and saw him wake up. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cThank you for your help, Sage Azure Dragon!\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon saw him smiling happily and was relieved. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. There\u2019s no need to thank me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be. If it wasn\u2019t for the sage saving me in time, I would\u2019ve died on that mountain.\u201d Azure Dragon asked him, \u201cHow can you be so badly hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Xie Xi know? This was originally a setting of the painting and he came in halfway. There was no way for him to know.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon was still staring at him. Xie Xi hesitated before replying, \u201cI was probably bitten by a worm monster\u2026 us roses are most afraid of the worms.\u201d</p><br/><p>This injury definitely wasn\u2019t a bite. Azure Dragon watched him and asked, \u201cHave you been to the Demon Sea?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied like it was natural, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>If he hadn\u2019t been to the Demon Sea, how could he call out the name of Ancestor Houqing in such a helpless and sentimental voice while he was in danger?</p><br/><p>It was the side effect of the analgesic. This little rose had forgotten some past events.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon just wanted to save him but now he was selfish and didn\u2019t want the rose to think about the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay it\u2026\u201d Azure Dragon asked in a low voice, \u201cHow would you like to thank me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon stared at him and his thin lips curved in a smile. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you wanted to thank me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow will you thank me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi blinked. \u201cHow do you want me to thank you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon was truly a certain someone\u2019s soul. \u201cThen how about giving your heart to me?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

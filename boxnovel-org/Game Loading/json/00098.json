It was really within Xie Xi\u2019s power to do this but\u2026</p><br/><p>Since Jiang Xie dared to open his mouth, he was naturally prepared. He was completely ready and just waiting to release it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was silent for a long time before whispering, \u201cThis\u2026 it isn\u2019t appropriate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cI\u2019ve always had the problem of not eating breakfast. I know this isn\u2019t good but I can\u2019t change it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s lips moved but he didn\u2019t dare answer.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie continnued, \u201cI can buy breakfast outside but you\u2019ve already discovered that I\u2019m picky. The outside food is either too oily, too salty or not very good. In short, I don\u2019t like to eat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was really true. After spending a week today, Xie Xi noticed Jiang Xie\u2019s preferences. He ate most things and wasn\u2019t a picky eater, but he was picky about the ingredients.</p><br/><p>Every time they went to the supermarket, they had to buy the best things. If it was a little bit worse, he would frown.</p><br/><p>One time, the supermarket sent a small bag of a different brand of rice. Xie Xi was afraid of wasting it and used it to cook. Jiang Xie ate it and found it tasted wrong. He didn\u2019t say to redo it but after eating, he said, \u201cUse the previous rice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was surprised at the time because he couldn\u2019t taste a difference at all.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hesitated. \u201cIf Teacher wants to have breakfast, I can come over earlier and do it for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou take one hour coming by bus. Since I get up at 7 o\u2019clock, you will have to get up at 5 o\u2019clock. Isn\u2019t it a sin to not get enough sleep when growing up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew this wasn\u2019t realistic. The place where he lived didn\u2019t have a direct bus to Jiang Xie\u2019s place. He had to run more than 10 minutes to another bus stop. If he really wanted to make breakfast on time, he might have to wake up at 4.30.</p><br/><p>It was okay for two days but he wouldn\u2019t be able to endure it for a long time.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke again, \u201cIt is convenient if you move in. I can eat breakfast and you don\u2019t have to go back and forth. I also have an empty room and it is a waste to leave it empty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi still thought it was inappropriate. \u201cThe accounts aren\u2019t calculated\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people lived in different ways.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie continued, \u201cIf you move in, we can go to school together.\u201d Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t have to spend money on the bus fare to go to school.</p><br/><p>It would be false if Xie Xi said he didn\u2019t feel warm.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie released all the reasons to move in. \u201cIf you live here, I won\u2019t have to send you back at night and will save a lot of money on gas.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s face was slightly hot. \u201cYou really don\u2019t have to send me back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is impossible not to send you back unless you move in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie released the killing blow. He sighed and borrowed his hoarse voice to commit a foul. \u201cA person living alone is really boring.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was instantly distressed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie knew Xie Xi\u2019s soft belly and quietly stated, \u201cI occasionally wake up at night and feel the house is empty and as quiet as a grave\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi quickly said, \u201cHow can such a good house be a grave?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t as good as a grave. At least a double tomb will have two people sleeping together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His distress was gone in an instant!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had done this intentionally. He originally wanted to show weakness to stimulate the child but after seeing that the child was really sad, he just wanted to amuse the child and make him happy.</p><br/><p>A gentleman didn\u2019t need to use these tricks.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie cleared his throat. \u201cIf you move in and make me breakfast, I will double your salary!\u201d</p><br/><p>The offensive using money was really bad!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had long wanted to move in and have personal company. He knew the taste of living alone more than anyone else. This type of emptiness\u2026 it turned the whole house into another space, one isolated from the world and full of stillness and cold.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew this so Jiang Xie definitely knew it\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi muttered, \u201cI can move in\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart jumped and he held his breath.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gulped and continued, \u201cI will be responsible for your breakfast. If you stay up late, I will also cook you a late dinner. You don\u2019t have to give me a raise. I will\u2026 I won\u2019t pay any rent.\u201d His voice was really small by the end of his words.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t deaf and his ears were excellent. He didn\u2019t hesitate to clap loudly, \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi still felt embarrassed and formed fists. \u201cIf Teacher every thinks that I am trouble, I will\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe water has spilt and you can\u2019t take it back!\u201d Jiang Xie was afraid that Xie Xi would feel regret.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean that if Teacher thinks it isn\u2019t convenient for two people to live together in the future\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t let him finish. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><br/><p>That day would never happen.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled and nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter. If that day really appeared, he would quietly leave. Jiang Xie sighed and couldn\u2019t resist his restless heart. By all accounts, he should be reserved and let Xie Xi move in tomorrow but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cStay here tonight.\u201d Forget it! Don\u2019t talk about one night, he didn\u2019t want to wait a minute longer!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was surprised. \u201cTonight?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you are going to move in anyway. There is no different from tonight or tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled helplessly. \u201cI have to clean up.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said he would move in but he didn\u2019t even have a change of clothes or toiletries.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie got up and walked to the front door. He opened the locker and many things fell out.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes were wide as he stared at the pile of items in a stunned manner. New bedding, pyjamas, home clothes, bathrobe, towels, mouthwash, cups, electric toothbrush, toothpaste, cleansing soap\u2026 there was even a set of men\u2019s skincare!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Xie Xi was shocked speechless.</p><br/><p>Since Jiang Xie wanted to persuade the child, he was naturally prepared. He had good intentions as he bought everything except for underwear. He was just waiting for Xie Xi to come!</p><br/><p>This huge pile of things showed that not only was Old Jiang careful, he also couldn\u2019t wait!</p><br/><p>Teacher Jiang casually spoke nonsense and fooled the stunned child. \u201cI didn\u2019t say it in case you thought I was joking but I have prepared these things for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie looked \u2018sad\u2019. \u201cI have a distant cousin who said he intended to test into X University. He intended to live here and I really hate living alone. Thus, I prepared all these things for his arrival. Who knew that kid would fly off like a bird and go abroad.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a perfect reason. It covered his own craziness and also brushed up Xie Xi\u2019s pity.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was fooled. \u201cTeacher has a cousin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cHe is the same age as you but far worse than you. He isn\u2019t sensible at all and I can live leisurely without his presence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at this pile of things and felt that Jiang Xie had been really looking forward to his cousin\u2019s arrival. Really\u2026 it was heart-wrenching.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about it. If he had a cousin who wanted to live with him, he would\u2026 would\u2026 No, he wouldn\u2019t do this! Poverty meant he couldn\u2019t afford so many things!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t want to add any psychological burden to him. \u201cFortunately, you will move over or these things will only gather dust!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s lips curved uncontrollably. \u201cSometimes I always feel like\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything is just right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled and shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s a coincidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>If everything was just right and natural, if it was predestined then it was too beautiful to be true.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, stayed here, not because of the pile of things\u2014 he still had to go back to pack tomorrow since there were many bok=oks and other things to bring.</p><br/><p>The reason he stayed tonight was because he didn\u2019t want Jiang Xie to send him back.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was very tired and fell asleep leaning against the kitchen door. How could Xie Xi let him drive?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t bear it.</p><br/><p>In light of Jiang Xie\u2019s sleepiness, Xie Xi ordered him despite it being only 10 o\u2019clock. \u201cGet some early rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie acted tired all night and it was really unseemly to be energetic now. Thus, he honestly returned to his room.</p><br/><p>He stated, \u201cI have a bathroom in my room. You can use the one outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d His room didn\u2019t have a bathroom and the only one available was next to the living room.</p><br/><p>This location was deep in Jiang Xie\u2019s house. Xie Xi had to go from the guest room past the study to the bedroom. As long as Jiang Xie didn\u2019t close the door, he could see the child running back and forth in pyjamas.</p><br/><p>How could he be so happy? He couldn\u2019t see it tonight since he had to go to sleep first. But there was tomorrow, the day after tomorrow and the day after that\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was startled. He didn\u2019t know when the smile on his face had filled with such sweetness.</p><br/><p>Life was really like a dream. The first half was a nightmare that he wanted to quickly wake up from. The second half became a dream that people were willing to indulge in.</p><br/><p>This dream was so good. What did it matter if he didn\u2019t wake up?</p><br/><p>The two men slept opposite each other.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi slept particularly well. He lay on a bed that was very comfortable and slept soundly in a room that wasn\u2019t cold. Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t the same. He was so excited that he couldn\u2019t sleep. He was very sleepy and tired but he couldn\u2019t close his eyes.</p><br/><p>The thought of the child sleeping next door meant he couldn\u2019t sleep!</p><br/><p>The next day, Xie Xi got up to make breakfast. Jiang Xie stayed awake until 5 in the morning before sleeping for a bit. His ears were excellent. He heard Xie Xi getting up and immediately woke up.</p><br/><p>He endured in bed before finally getting up to wash. He calculated the time and left the room.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw him and smiled. \u201cThe noodles are just cooked.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stood in place, watching the thin light of the morning fall on Xie Xi, like an angel falling from the sky. If he could see this sight every day in the future, he would have nothing more to ask for in his life.</p><br/><p>The happy days were particularly fast. In the blink of an eye, it was winter vacation.</p><br/><p>In the past, Jiang Xie had been too lazy to celebrate the new year. He ran to foreign countries to do academics and was still busy. This year\u2026</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t leave the country even if the President of Country M came to beg!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cTeacher, do you have plans for the new year?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie pondered before replying, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi lowered his eyes. \u201cThen I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished when Jiang Xie interrupted. \u201cI bought a six pounds king crab as well as a large number of raw ingredients for the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall. How about using it for a new year\u2019s dinner?\u201d (TL: A type of Chinese soup. Wiki Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha_Jumps_Over_the_Wall)</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie added, \u201cI also bought red paper. Later we should write blessings together and stick them up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tried hard to endure it but his eyes still turned red.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw it and felt distressed. His voice became softer, \u201cThe two of us will stay at home and spend the new year together, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s nose was sore and he didn\u2019t dare to say anything in fear that he would cry. \u201cHmm!\u201d</p><br/><p>For the first time, he experienced the taste of the new year.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

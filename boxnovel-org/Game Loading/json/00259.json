They showed an aggressive attitude as they bared their teeth at the little lion.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was surprised and felt he had touched a corner of this world.</p><br/><p>A beastman world?</p><br/><p>Animals could become humans?</p><br/><p>This should be the case. Jiang Xie was the main consciousness of the world. If he couldn\u2019t become human then how could anyone be human?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought he was a person this time but according to the situation, he was most likely a tiger.</p><br/><p>The tiger was this weak. Was he the legendary sick cat?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t have time to think about it because the four little kids were fighting together in a messy ball.</p><br/><p>They were all big cats but the cuteness was completely different.</p><br/><p>The three young tigers didn\u2019t have the round head or ears of the little lion, or even his beautiful golden eyes and soft fur\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi paused and suspected that his filter had permeated the universe!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fight\u2026\u201d Xie Xi wanted to separate these naughty children but unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t help. He felt pain from his chest the moment he shouted.</p><br/><p>Who would pay attention to him? The young tigers fought many people and had to clean up this lion that came from nowhere.</p><br/><p>The little lion wasn\u2019t at all frightened by facing three enemies. He relied on his small size to flexibly dodge and let the young tigers hit themselves.</p><br/><p>For adults, this picture was probably of a stray little boy fighting against three spoiled young masters.</p><br/><p>The \u2018little masters\u2019 were inexperienced and were furious at being teased.</p><br/><p>However, the lion was much smaller and the three young tigers weren\u2019t completely inexperienced. They no longer scorned the enemy and rushed together, not allowing the lion to hide.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the lion was going to be injured, Xie Xi endured the tearing of his lungs and rushed over.</p><br/><p>Who knew that this little guy wouldn\u2019t back down and struck a young tiger in the middle with his head.</p><br/><p>The young tiger was shaken by him and was pressed down by the lion. The little lion opened his mouth and bit the tiger\u2019s throat.</p><br/><p>The young tiger was frightened and screamed as if he was in danger. The other two cubs saw this and fled in fright.</p><br/><p>The little lion was the big winner but the wound on his hind leg was torn open and blood stained the bandages.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi arrived at the scene like a late policeman. He picked up the little lion, \u201cDo you want to be crippled in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>His hug destroyed the prestige of a \u2018warrior\u2019 and the little lion wanted to come down.</p><br/><p>He struggled for a moment until Xie Xi turned his head and coughed.</p><br/><p>The little lion didn\u2019t dare to move. This man was too weak and he was afraid that one paw would break the man\u2019s bones.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pressed down the blood in his chest and carefully examined the little lion\u2019s wounds.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, it was torn open and yesterday\u2019s medicine was used in vain. This was fine since Xie Xi could draw a lot of medicine anyway. It was just that it hurt every time he used the medicine and he didn\u2019t want to see Jiang Xie in pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait here!\u201d Xie Xi wanted to be serious but unfortunately, his voice was weak and his momentum insufficient.</p><br/><p>The little lion was obedient and gave a low cry.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi went to get the medicine box and gave him fresh bandages.</p><br/><p>The little lion had probably become used to yesterday\u2019s pain. Today he didn\u2019t even shake. Once he was bandaged, he raised his head and stood upright.</p><br/><p>The angry Xie Xi gave him a pair of bows. \u2018Since you want to be so domineering, I will give you two bows and make you a diamond barbie!</p><br/><p>He was busy changing Jiang Xie\u2019s bandages and had no room to care about the little tiger\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>This was a bunch of naughty children and they were really boring.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t a three year old child.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the little tiger remaining didn\u2019t leave and probed in his head to look.</p><br/><p>The little lion glared at him. The tiger only had saliva on his neck and no blood, so he wasn\u2019t afraid.</p><br/><p>There was a sound and the little tiger became a boy.</p><br/><p>The little boy wore brown shorts and was around 1.2 or 1.3 metres tall. His cheeks were round and bulging and his eyes were curious. \u201cWill the invalid cure the disease?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion heard the word \u2018invalid\u2019 and bared his teeth.</p><br/><p>The little boy was stunned and change his words. \u201cUncle, can you cure this illness?\u201d</p><br/><p>From invalid to uncle, Xie Xi\u2019s status had undergone a qualitatively leap.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t say anything as he glanced at the little boy.</p><br/><p>The little boy stood straight and said, \u201cMy name is Wang Huer (King Tiger Two). Before\u2026 I\u2019m sorry about before!\u201d The stones they threw were still at the entrance of the cave.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was speechless for a moment. Who gave this name? What was the meaning of tiger and two? It was a bit appropriate\u2026</p><br/><p>Wang Huer spoke earnestly, \u201cUncle, this herbal medicine is really amazing. My brother is also injured? Can you look at him?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have to say it but Xie Xi guessed the reason for the quick attitude change.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t someone who had to be good to everyone. He didn\u2019t learn to repay evil with good.</p><br/><p>This naughty boy blocked the door and yelled at him. Presumably, the adults weren\u2019t any better. If it was normal Xie Xi definitely wouldn\u2019t care, but here\u2026</p><br/><p>He asked, \u201cIs it trauma?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Huer replied, \u201cYes! Like there lion, there is a lot of blood on his hind legs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi ordered, \u201cTake me to see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi urgently needed to understand the background of the world. He would know more if he took this opportunity to integrate with the native people of this world.</p><br/><p>The little lion could understand their words and he let out a low growl.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood without needing a translator. The lion must be saying, \u2018Are you stupid? They just bullied you yet you\u2019re going to help them!\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought, \u2018If you didn\u2019t make too many private settings\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The thing he actually said was, \u201cThe children were just playing, don\u2019t worry about it too much.\u201d He would pretend to be a good old man instead of a bad one.</p><br/><p>This made Wang Huer reveal an ashamed expression. Xie Xi saw it and his heart felt a bit more comfortable. This boy wasn\u2019t spoiled to the bones.</p><br/><p>The little lion was on fire and gave a low cry.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cWait for me in the cave. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion stared at him and let out a whining sound of warning.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help it. If he didn\u2019t go out to understand the world, how could he repair it?</p><br/><p>\u201cBe obedient.\u201d He patted the little lion\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>The little lion didn\u2019t allow the pat as he evaded it and ran into the house.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi helplessly smiled and spoke to Wang Huer, \u201cI\u2019m not in good health and can\u2019t carry the medicine box. Can you help me bring it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Huer hurriedly replied, \u201cGood, good! I\u2019m strong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without waiting for the little boy to pick up the medicine box, the lion rushed over and bared his teeth at Wang Huer.</p><br/><p>Wang Huer was startled and moved back.</p><br/><p>The little lion carried the medicine box and strode to the entrance of the cave.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cDidn\u2019t you refuse to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion walking in front snorted.</p><br/><p>The translation was probably, \u2018If I don\u2019t look at this idiot then I don\u2019t know how you will die. This is the medicine that cures my legs and no one can touch it.\u2019</p><br/><p>No matter the sentence, this was Leo!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought he was a famous translator and was much better than a fake translator.</p><br/><p>It was bright outside the hole.</p><br/><p>It seemed that it was summer and the region\u2019s temperature was high. It was somewhat hot despite being early morning.</p><br/><p>The advantage of Xie Xi\u2019s weak physique showed. He was very tired but he didn\u2019t sweat at all.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Wang Huer\u2019s home wasn\u2019t far away. They walked slowly for 10 minutes and saw a small village.</p><br/><p>Wang Huer was anxious. He could run this distance in a minute but in order to accommodate Xie Xi, it took more than 10 minutes of walking.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked around as he entered the village.</p><br/><p>The village\u2019s style was very rough and most of the villagers were strong-looking. Even the women were full of beauty and power.</p><br/><p>Some people saw Xie Xi and were shocked. They didn\u2019t shout out \u2018invalid\u2019 but their eyes showed their dislike.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw the situation in the village and felt a bit relieved.</p><br/><p>Animals understood survival of the fittest better than humans, especially carnivorous communities. Under the harsh conditions of survival, they had to give up on the old, weak and sick.</p><br/><p>It was cruel and helpless. The long history of evolution had been carved into the genes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s physique meant he couldn\u2019t hunt and protect himself. Since he was useless, it was natural to be excluded by villagers.</p><br/><p>They arrived at Wang Huer\u2019s house and a man who wasn\u2019t too tall but was unusually burly came out. \u201cHave you gone crazy again? Your brother is ill and if he doesn\u2019t get better, you\u2019ll have to follow the team to hunt!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Huer hurriedly cried out, \u201cFather! My brother\u2019s leg can be healed!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man didn\u2019t take it seriously. \u201cI hope so. Your brother is in good health and might be able to hold on.\u201d</p><br/><p>If he couldn\u2019t survive\u2026 the man\u2019s face was upset.</p><br/><p>Wang Huer was worthy of his name and only said, \u201cInvalid, Uncle can cure him. I saw him cure the lion\u2019s hind legs.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man choked out, \u201cInvalid uncle?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mouth twitched\u2026</p><br/><p>Wang Huer didn\u2019t dare say invalid again and tried to explain, \u201cThe one in the cave\u2026 that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The man finally seemed to notice the thin man who would be blown away by the wind behind his son.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his mouth. \u201cHello, if the injury is trauma then I can help treat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man couldn\u2019t react.</p><br/><p>Wang Huer continued, \u201cFather, you see. The lion beast\u2019s hind legs were originally very badly wounded. Now he is no longer bleeding!\u201d He pointed to the little lion to show the man.</p><br/><p>The man frowned, \u201cHow did you bring back a lion beast to the village?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Huer spoke urgently, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about this. Let the thin uncle go see my brother. Brother won\u2019t bleed anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>From invalid uncle to thin uncle, Xie Xi wasn\u2019t comforted as he whispered, \u201cMy surname is Xie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Huer sighed. \u201cUncle Xie, come quickly. My brother is in the house!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi followed him into the house.</p><br/><p>The furnishings of the house were quite similar. The style was simple but it was better than his cave.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw the injured Wang Huyi (Tiger One), the brother of Wang Huer.</p><br/><p>This was a real adult tiger sitting on a straw mat and emitting killing intent.</p><br/><p>He was mentally prepared but Xie Xi\u2019s heart still thumped at the sight of the big tiger.</p><br/><p>Wang Huer hurriedly explained the situation. Wang Huyi was in tiger form but he could still speak. \u201cThank you for your help.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was a lot more sensible than the naughty child.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI will help you deal with your wounds first. It might a bit painful but please bear with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion reluctantly approached with the medicine box, staring as his medicine box was used by a tiger\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi naturally healed this tiger and achieved what he wished. He smoothly integrated with the village and switched from the invalid to a respected doctor overnight.</p><br/><p>Then he obtained a general understanding of the world\u2019s background.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, this was a beastmen world and there were many wars. Several tribes were vying for the top leadership.</p><br/><p>This was called the Tiger Country but it was actually a city-state. It was surrounded by the Lion Country, Bear Country, Leopard Country and Wolf Country.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t always fight each other. For example, the Lion Country and Tiger Country had a good relationship. They always had an alliance so the tigers were surprised but not hostile at the little lion wandering through the village.</p><br/><p>The Tiger Country was currently in a very bad situation. Wang Huyi, who completely recovered and could go hunting, explained, \u201cSince the disappearance of Beast King Rose, our Tiger Country has plummeted and we are missing the momentum of the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard the word \u2018rose\u2019 and his nerves became tense.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t blame him\u2026 Jiang Xie was really fond of placing the rose flower on his head!</p><br/><p>Wang Huer was filled with longing, \u201cThe beast king disappeared after I was born. He is the only real king of beasts who led the eight kingdoms!\u201d</p><br/><p>Another person said, \u201cHe is the pride of our Tiger Country!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Huyi sighed. \u201cIt is a pity that the beast king was attacked and his whereabouts are unknown\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of tigers sighed. Xie Xi was expressionless as he reasonably suspected that he was Beast King Rose.</p><br/><p>A female tiger said, \u201cMr Xie, your son should transform into a person. He can\u2019t keep dragging this out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Son??</p><br/><p>Oh, the tigers thought the little lion was Xie Xi\u2019s son\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Why was his hand sharper than a knife? Why was Greenton\u2019s chest more brittle than a biscuit? What happened to his endless energy?</p><br/><p>At this moment, a strange and familiar voice entered Xie Xi\u2019s ears. It was the voice of Sein Hall, the real owner of this body.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamned, everybody is damned.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter the price, I will bury them!\u201d</p><br/><p>A flower appeared in front of Xie Xi and he started to see Sein Hall\u2019s memories.</p><br/><p>The seven year old body born with exquisite loveliness was laughing innocently in his mother\u2019s arms. The image changed. The boy trembled as he hid in a corner while a loud quarrel was heard outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, please control yourself! I\u2019m the hostess of Duke Hall\u2019s house!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou despicable woman, what qualifications do you have to marry him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The beautiful and arrogant woman slapped the face of Sein\u2019s mother. The duchess made a frightened expression. \u201cWhy did you hit me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHit you?\u201d Princess Xilin stepped on her abdomen. \u201cWhat can I do if I want to kill you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The duchess was pale. \u201cNo, I have\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, you are pregnant again.\u201d Princess Xilin stepped hard on the duchess\u2019 belly. \u201cYou dirty blood, what qualifications do you have to be pregnant with his child?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sein Hall was terrified. He rushed out after seeing his mother\u2019s screams and tried to stop this crazy woman, but he was too young. He was easily held back by a servant and watched as his mother was tortured to death.</p><br/><p>Blood flowed as his gentle mother lay pale on the ground, the empty eyes desperately looking at the world.</p><br/><p>The woman who killed his mother not only didn\u2019t get the punishment she deserved, she ended up as his new stepmother.</p><br/><p>Sein Hall cried and complained to his father about her crimes but his father locked him up for one month until he changed his tune and admitted that what he saw was a hallucination the devil presented to him.</p><br/><p>Princess Xilin didn\u2019t want to let him go but his father reluctantly protected him. Sein Hall didn\u2019t suffer too much abuse apart from cold treatment. However, the death of his mother, the cowardice of his father and the indifference of the royal family and church caused serious trauma to his young mind.</p><br/><p>No one believed in his words or the cause of his mother\u2019s death. No one believed that the princess was a murderer and no one believed that the royal family and church were sheltering such a demon.</p><br/><p>Greenton was the first ray of light for Sein Hall. He thought his cousin would help him gain justice for his mother\u2019s death. But no\u2026 his cousin said he would take Sein away. Greenton\u2019s words were full of indignation but he didn\u2019t dare to offend the royal family.</p><br/><p>Sein Hall met the vampire Aix-en at the age of 14. He inherited his mother\u2019s beauty, which was like a blooming rose. The suppressed despair and hatred meant this rose was dyed with blood.</p><br/><p>Aix-en fell in love with him at first sight and was deeply infatuated with him. At first, Sein Hall thought he would die. Then he saw the obsession in Aix-en\u2019s eyes and felt hope.</p><br/><p>This was a very powerful man. With the vampire\u2019s help, he could retaliate against this disgusting empire!</p><br/><p>He took advantage of Aix-en and carefully planned things out. He wanted to find the Sacred Heart, complete the first embrace and become an immortal vampire. Then he unexpectedly saw a forbidden technique in Aix-en\u2019s house.</p><br/><p>If he had the blood of thousands of enemies and the heart of a loved one who sacrificed themselves, he could gain the power of the devil and slaughter this world.</p><br/><p>Just becoming a vampire wasn\u2019t enough to wipe out the empire but it was possible with the power of the devil.</p><br/><p>Sein Hall hated the brutal Princess Xilin, hated the queen who sheltered the murderer, hated the church that didn\u2019t distinguish between right and wrong, hated his incompetent father and all the foolish people who believed in this violent rule.</p><br/><p>They were damned, all damned! He wanted to kill everyone and send them to hell!</p><br/><p>Thus\u2026 the 15 year old Sein Hall started to prepare for this forbidden technique.</p><br/><p>Gars was the first sacrifice he chose. He was a poor and helpless ghost. As long as Sein showed him a bit of attention, Gars gave his heart unconditionally.</p><br/><p>Sein had amazing beauty and a noble identity in the eyes of the world. He also had a pleasant voice and gentle words. Gars unsuspectingly fell into a deep and affectionate dream that he couldn\u2019t extricate himself from.</p><br/><p>His first attempt at the forbidden technique ended in failure bit he got an unexpected profit. His personal housekeeper, the faithful Randy got a power beyond imagination and became as strong as the vampire Aix-en.</p><br/><p>This gave Sein Hall great encouragement. He knew that the forbidden technique was possible. If he succeeded, he would gain enough power for revenge!</p><br/><p>He started carefully preparing for the second attempt. This time, it covered the entire castle and he would attract more enemies!</p><br/><p>Gars was a failure. Sein Hall abandoned him and offered him to Aix-en as food. Unexpected, he gained some power because of the forbidden technique and was resurrected as a vampire.</p><br/><p>Sein Hall didn\u2019t mind an extra loyal dog and Gars stayed with him as a \u2018maid.\u2019</p><br/><p>The next sacrifice he chose was his cousin Greenton. Greenton was fascinated by him. After Sein Hall\u2019s confession, he became confused and wasn\u2019t sure what to do.</p><br/><p>Sein borrowed Randy\u2019s power and killed many people, creating great fear and uneasy through the empire and giving them a motive to crusade against him.</p><br/><p>He needed more blood from the enemies for his array and deliberately led them to attack the castle.</p><br/><p>Once everything was ready, the array was activated and the forbidden technique successfully launched.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gained the power of a devil.</p><br/><p>Through these memories, Xie Xi finally figured out the game\u2019s plot.</p><br/><p>He felt great sympathy towards Sein Hall but he couldn\u2019t agree with what Sein Hall was going to do.</p><br/><p>Killing Xilian and getting revenge on the queen and duke were beyond reproach. They deserved it.</p><br/><p>However, why bother feeling angry at the innocent people? They lived in this country under such rule. Where did civilians get the right to choose? They were just living their own lives but thanks to government pressure, they closed their mouths and ended up bearing Sein Hall\u2019s anger.</p><br/><p>Sein Hall\u2019s life was very miserable and his experience very painful. There was too much to bear\u2026 due to this pain, he caused greater disaster and despair to innocent people. How was he different from the princess?</p><br/><p>They unleashed their pain onto those who were unrelated.</p><br/><p>Why turn yourself into your enemy for revenge?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned as these words flashed through his brain. His experience wasn\u2019t as painful as Sein Hall but he also complained about his father who left and his mother, who left him alone in a dark room, so hungry he had to go through the trash for food. After countless times where his trust was broken, he dropped out of school.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t act like Sein Hall but he was also immersed in resentment, lost himself and gave up on his dream.</p><br/><p>He locked himself in a cramped rental house, not contacting anyone or associating with anyone. If this continued, would he end up venting his anger towards everyone like Sein Hall?</p><br/><p>Things seen from the perspective of a third party were unusually clear.</p><br/><p>By the time Xie Xi\u2019s spirit returned, the castle had fallen into a grave-like silence.</p><br/><p>The people who attacked the castle were dead. They were drained of blood and their corpses were like dead wood. The shape of a person couldn\u2019t be seen at all.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help frowning.</p><br/><p>Randy and Gars knelt down and spoke in a respectful and sincere manner. \u201cCongratulations to Young Master for achieving your wish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt a powerful force in his body that was indescribable to ordinary people. His body seemed to be filled with endless strength and his five senses were enhanced. It felt like he could hear whispers from thousands of miles away.</p><br/><p>He had endless power, a power that allowed people to do whatever they wanted.</p><br/><p>At this point, Aix-en finally realized what was going on. He was surprised and there was some anxiety in his eyes. \u201cSmall Sein, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A hint appeared in the lower right corner of Xie Xi\u2019s vision.</p><br/><p>[Skill (Temporary): Devil\u2019s Whisper \u2013 Will cause the sleep effect. Duration is 24 hours.]</p><br/><p>It was now the early hours of the seventh day. The task could be completed in 24 hours. Xie Xi sighed and used the sleep skill on the three people in front of him.</p><br/><p>He was currently much stronger than them and they fell to the ground at the same time, sleeping honestly.</p><br/><p>It looked like\u2026 he just had to wait 24 hours to pass the game?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi naturally didn\u2019t go out to kill anyone. He stayed in the castle for the whole day.</p><br/><p>Night fell and the time remaining was dwindling.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi review the game. The first half made him feel like dying but the second half made him feel regret.</p><br/><p>He had studied computer science and once participated in the production of a game. At the time, his mentor said that a game should create an awakening.</p><br/><p>It was a work of art and not only should it bring surprise and happiness to the player, it should also make them reflect and think.</p><br/><p>The bell rang in the early hours of the morning and Xie Xi stared intently at the lower right corner.</p><br/><p>[Mission progress: the seventh day.]</p><br/><p>The next step was to complete the task. He didn\u2019t know what would happen after it was completed.</p><br/><p>Eh? Xie Xi blinked and doubted his eyes.</p><br/><p>[The mission has failed. Please load the file in one minute.]</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>Failed? Why? How did he fail?</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t he have to survive for seven days? He survived to the seventh day. On what basis did he fail?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at his mission target for a minute. After loading the file, he suddenly understood.</p><br/><p>Live for seven days, it wasn\u2019t surviving for at least seven days. It was to live for only seven days, no more and no less!</p><br/><p>Thus\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes were dark as he read the file back to the middle of the sixth night.</p><br/><p>Aix-en was astonished. \u201cSmall Sein, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi rudely placed the sleeping skill on him. He didn\u2019t have the heart to deal with these three people.</p><br/><p>After waiting for 24 hours, Xie Xi saw the seventh day was coming to an end and stabbed himself in the heart at the last second.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 it hurts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought, \u2018Isn\u2019t this a fatal injury? Why does it hurt so much?\u2019</p><br/><p>This game was broken!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at the bottom right and it turned out that he failed.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t a normal person right now and couldn\u2019t die simply from stabbing his heart!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, he still had a drop of good feeling towards the game. Now\u2026 MMP!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi read the file again and Aix-en was full of surprise. \u201cSmall Sein\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knocked them out immediately. He waited until it was dark and started to kill himself one hour earlier.</p><br/><p>He stabbed himself with the knife but the wound started to heal. He desperately pushed the knife in deeper\u2026</p><br/><p>12 o\u2019clock.</p><br/><p>Xie.hung from the sky.big devil.can\u2019t die.Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t good to be too strong. Why was it so difficult to die?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi read the file again and was about to force the three people to sleep when he had a thought.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t kill himself. Was it possible for these three people to kill him?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

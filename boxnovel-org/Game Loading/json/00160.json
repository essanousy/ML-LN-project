His hand was itchy and he pressed it.</p><br/><p>He would search first to see what the next world was like.</p><br/><p>The last world\u2019s \u2018play\u2019 was very happy so he was looking forward to the next world.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s change in heart was big enough. First, he wanted to stab the person when he saw the name Designer X. Now he looked forward to it. Sure enough\u2026 people had to grow.</p><br/><p>The little rose was reborn as a slag flower!</p><br/><p>To Xie Xi\u2019s surprise, a new world didn\u2019t appear after it finished searching. Instead, a line appeared: [Please change your occupation first. The current quasi-world needs a specific occupation.]</p><br/><p>Change occupations? Xie Xi was currently a collector and could change to a recorder or explorer.</p><br/><p>Even so, Xie Xi always felt that this particular occupation wasn\u2019t a simple low-level occupation.</p><br/><p>Most players only promoted themselves to intermediate level instead of changing occupations because they were poor. However, Xie Xi didn\u2019t have this problem. He had too much money to spend that getting qualifications for other occupations wasn\u2019t a problem.</p><br/><p>He wanted to know the identity of the next world. Thus, he changed to an explorer and searched for a new world. The result was the same and he was still asked to switch occupations.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned and changed to recorder. He searched against and still got the prompt to change occupation.</p><br/><p>It seemed he was right when he thought this particular occupation wasn\u2019t a low-grade occupation.</p><br/><p>However, the current Central World only had four occupations.</p><br/><p>Collectors, reporters, explorers and designers.</p><br/><p>Did he have to change occupation to a designer?</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t do that either!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt helpless and had to set aside the new world to see the rewards for this task.</p><br/><p>After passing through Wonderful Painting of the Mountains and Seas, his beginner experience was full and he could be promoted to an intermediate player.</p><br/><p>However, this promotion wasn\u2019t instant. He also had to complete a promotion test.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t care much about the gold reward. Then he heard a loud sound and looked at the number of figures with a weary face.</p><br/><p>Wonderful Painting of the Mountains and Seas didn\u2019t have a low level. Lost Atlantis was S+ while this quasi-world was S++.</p><br/><p>Any quasi-world above the S grade gave a special reward. Xie Xi accepted the reward.</p><br/><p>[Ding dong, congratulations on getting the Golden Items Box. After equipping it, the items bar will be expanded to nine slots.]</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d This seemed pretty good?</p><br/><p>Gold, it should be decent.</p><br/><p>The emperor of luck didn\u2019t understand the market. If other people knew this, they would probably scream with a red face!</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s just say that in the past, Jiang Xie cleared 30 S-grade worlds in order to expand his items bar. Finally\u2026 well, he used the gold coins from the S-grade worlds to buy it for a high price at the black market.</p><br/><p>It was the same Golden Items Box but they had different lives.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi equipped the box, saw the expanded squares and was quite satisfied.</p><br/><p>Originally, there were many items and few slots. Every time he went to a quasi-world, there was too little room. This time, he didn\u2019t need to be afraid. Even if he brought nine uniforms, this was nine lives and was halfway to being immortal!</p><br/><p>He also had the skill that allowed him to bring back something random from the quasi-world.</p><br/><p>Last time, he accidentally brought back the Repair skill. This time\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened the skills list and was\u2026stupified.</p><br/><p>Who would\u2019ve thought that there would be a day when the emperor of luck was scared by himself!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie returned to Central and lay half-dead in his garden.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe hurriedly came. \u201cWhy are you trying to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>He scolded. \u201cDo you fucking like the S &amp; M play?\u201d</p><br/><p>Good fellow, this body was disabled and there was no room for that!</p><br/><p>The scene was so bloody but Jiang Xie was still in the mood to joke around. \u201cWhat are you talking about? My little baby doesn\u2019t want me injured at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Doctor Yan had a toothache.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s fingers couldn\u2019t move but his mouth was very sharp. \u201cQuickly give me treatment. He will surely be sad if he sees me like this when he comes later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe saved people but he wanted to save this person twice more!</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you only have a light pain.\u201d While scolding him, Yan Zhe\u2019s white light fell on Jiang Xie\u2019s body, helping him recover at a speed that was visible to the naked eye.</p><br/><p>He was worthy of being a famous god-level nurse in the Central World. This healing ability was comparable to resurrection.</p><br/><p>He habitually gave Jiang Xie pain relief first then regretted it when he finished. This guy talked so much when he was dead from pain. Now that it didn\u2019t hurt anymore\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you,\u201d Comrade Old Jiang was physically and mentally ill. \u201cIn the quasi-world, Xiao Xie really became a little rose. You can\u2019t imagine how cute\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was here to treat Jiang Xie, not eat dog food! He would fucking choke this damn person!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was also helpless about his body\u2019s injuries.</p><br/><p>The thing he exchanged this time was his body. It was reasonable that he should always stay within the soul and not have any interaction with Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>What caused his injuries? He forced himself to take control of the souls\u2019 bodies and also used the names of the souls to attract them back to him.</p><br/><p>If the souls were considered as his body, he wouldn\u2019t be able to leave Wonderful Painting of the Mountains and Seas.</p><br/><p>As an unlucky person, it was terrible. He ended up splitting himself into five and squeezed into five bodies to avoid the rules.</p><br/><p>They were still the souls\u2019 bodies so he might pay some price but he wouldn\u2019t lose his body.</p><br/><p>It was just that after leaving the quasi-world, his body was a broken rag on the verge of death.</p><br/><p>Qin Ge was stunned and hurriedly called Yan Zhe over.</p><br/><p>Only a divine nurse could restore Jiang Xie\u2019s body in such a short period of time.</p><br/><p>By all accounts, players could purchase items to restore their body as long as they returned to Central.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t do this. The higher the level of the players, the stronger their resistance to the drugs in the mall, not to mention that their bodies were highly advanced. Ordinary drugs were worse than a cup of boiled water to high level players.</p><br/><p>Once Jiang Xie\u2019s treatment finished, Yan Zhe got up and staggered a bit.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie frowned. \u201cYou have taken a big step backwards. You are tired from such a simple healing?</p><br/><p>Think about the year when Yan Zhe was the milk god of the team. He used them as zombies, dying, resurrection, dying, resurrecting again and again yet they didn\u2019t see him unsteady at all.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe\u2019s ears were buzzing, \u201cI\u2019m tired of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was choking on Jiang Xie\u2019s dog food!</p><br/><p>The healing took half an hour and Jiang Xie never stopped talking, fucking dictating a 500,000 word love novel!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t conscious of it but still spoke intimate words. \u201cIf you are tired then you are tired. Admit it and sit down to rest. I will tell you how Flower God Xie Xi created a new world for love\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe frowned. He regretted, he really regretted it! He shouldn\u2019t have come to the garden and healed this guy!</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Jiang Xie didn\u2019t continue because he received a message from Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cGuess what I brought back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie joked, \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be the god\u2019s wisdom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

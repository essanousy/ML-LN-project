Then the third prince was going to divorce him?</p><br/><p>Here was the question. When did they get married?</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t have a wedding in the dream, let alone outside it. He had only made it to this stage with the fifth prince. How did he become a married man in the second prince\u2019s dream?</p><br/><p>The second prince was unusual. The other princes wanted to marry Xie Xi, while this person dreamt of him marrying someone else.</p><br/><p>This shouldn\u2019t be called the second child. He was clearly the third child!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was sure that he hadn\u2019t entered the wrong dream. Putting aside the panel prompts, the arrogant expression of the third prince was too exaggerated.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou only know how to nag me all day long. What\u2019s wrong with buying a car? Why shouldn\u2019t I buy a plane? What about my bets? Did I spend your money?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was speechless. The third prince was really reasonable. It wasn\u2019t Xie Xi\u2019s money being spent.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are still so small-minded after getting married. I can\u2019t teach you anything! Isn\u2019t it my family\u2019s money being spent? You can\u2019t spend all of it even if you have 10 hands and 10 lifetimes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tried to follow the logic of the dream. \u201cI am doing it for your own good\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His path was truly right. The third prince became even angrier. \u201cYou know nothing. It is too shameful! If you are really good to me, don\u2019t worry about spending money!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought in his heart, \u2018Second child, your heart knot isn\u2019t small. You scolded your brother so many times that the lines are smooth.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stayed silent but the third prince could still pick out the thorns. \u201cIf I knew you weer this stuffy, I would\u2019ve been better off marrying a piece of wood instead of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Don\u2019t find a piece of wood. Look for a mallet!</p><br/><p>The third prince vented his anger and finally came back to the topic. \u201cDivorce, we can\u2019t continue like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t have a chance to think about leaving\u2026</p><br/><p>The next moment, the scene changed and he was sitting at a meeting table with the third prince. There was a lawyer as well as a divorce agreement in front of them.</p><br/><p>Oh, it seemed that he could leave.</p><br/><p>The third prince spoke viciously, \u201cAren\u2019t you thrifty. Since you don\u2019t want my stinking money, take your junk and get lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>The divorce agreement was simple and rough, with one line occupying the entire A4 sheet of paper: [All of Gars\u2019 premarital property.]</p><br/><p>It might be a dream but this was too careless. As the second prince and minister of finance, shouldn\u2019t he write the divorce agreement more seriously?</p><br/><p>The third prince three the pen at him. \u201cSign it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s lips twitched as he took the pen and signed his name.</p><br/><p>The scene changed again. Xie Xi found himself standing miserably in the pouring rain.</p><br/><p>Looking at this, he had successfully divorced the third prince? Well, he should say that he was kicked out of the house by the third prince?</p><br/><p>In the eyes of the second prince, he and the third prince had such an ending?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really wanted to thank him. He hadn\u2019t talked about love and hadn\u2019t been married. He first experienced the taste of divorce.</p><br/><p>These princes lacked understanding of the land. The underwater people couldn\u2019t understand the taste of land people standing in the rain.</p><br/><p>The textbooks talked about how land people used umbrellas in the rain and the underwater people were confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do they want to use umbrellas? Isn\u2019t being drenched in water the most enjoyable time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that it is for romance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s romantic to use an umbrella on a rainy day?\u201d \u201cIt is romantic, especially on rainy days. Men hold umbrellas for women and it is considered one of the most romantic things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe land people are so strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>The land person Xie Xi felt that mermaids were even stranger!</p><br/><p>The second prince\u2019s understanding of the land was much deeper than that of the third prince. This was obvious from the structure of the previous house. However, when it came to rainwater, he was still unable to understand.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Xie Xi felt no discomfort standing in the rain. It was a refreshing feeling like standing in the forest in the early morning. It was true that for the sea people, the taste of rain on the land was indeed comfortable.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, the poor ghost who was kicked out of the house, wasn\u2019t too miserable. He felt comfortable like he was soaking in a hot spring.</p><br/><p>At this time, the owner of the dream finally appeared. A pair of clean black shoes appeared in front of Xie Xi. He looked up and saw a silver-haired man holding an umbrella.</p><br/><p>This hair colour was difficult for an ordinary person to handle but it complemented Aix-en perfectly. He was born elegant and noble. There was no sense of disagreement as he stood there in his suit, looking like he just emerged from a painting.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was slightly startled. Did this dream have a filter? Was the second prince so beautiful?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come you\u2019re here. Where\u2019s Third Brother?\u201d Aix-en asked.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood. It seemed they were still brothers in the dream!</p><br/><p>The \u2018abandoned\u2019 Xie Xi said sadly, \u201cWe are divorced.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en was stunned and his voice filled with anger. \u201cWhat happened? What mess is Gars making again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also wanted to know what the two brothers were up to!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was a lonely and pitiful person without needing to open his mouth. Aix-en frowned and told him \u201cDon\u2019t stand in the rain, you might catch a cold. Get in the car with me first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so polite? We are a family\u2026\u201d Aix-en paused and couldn\u2019t continue after realizing that Xie Xi was divorced from Gars.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi got on Aix-en\u2019s car and he handed over a towel. Xie Xi thanked him and wiped off the water.</p><br/><p>Aix-en said, \u201cI will take you to find him. I can\u2019t let him fool around like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>A flash of distress appeared in Aix-en\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou have only been married for a month. How did this happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>It turned out to only be a month\u2026 he was very harsh regarding his brother.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was opening his mouth when he felt his nose become itchy and he sneezed.</p><br/><p>Aix-en immediately said, \u201cAre you cold?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi rubbed his nose and said, \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you be fine when it has been raining for so long?\u201d Aix-en told him, \u201cI\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi immediately said, \u201cI won\u2019t go back. I have nothing to do with him anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, don\u2019t go back. I\u201dll take you to my place first so you can change your clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hesitated. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was suitable for a newly divorced man to change clothes at the home of his ex-husband\u2019s brother.</p><br/><p>Aix-en spoke again, \u201cI remember that you are a foreigner and don\u2019t have any friends here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood that it was necessary to go and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en sighed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Even if you are divorced, you can still call me Brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mouth curved and he couldn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>Your brother! Which brother\u2019s dream was so irregular!</p><br/><p>Aix-en took him home. The second prince\u2019s stinginess was embedded deep in his bones and refused to let Xie Xi go. The apartment he lived in wasn\u2019t small. It was more than 200 ping and the decorations were also good. (Ping= unit of measurement. 200 ping = approximately 661 square metres)</p><br/><p>Aix-en told him, \u201cCome in, the house is warm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi walked in. His feet were wet so he didn\u2019t step on the white carpet.</p><br/><p>He made such a casual move and Xie Xi saw the purple progress bar in the lower right corner flashing.</p><br/><p>Who would think that the most handsome and suave second prince would be so stingy!</p><br/><p>Aix-en said, \u201cDon\u2019t pay attention to this. Go and take a shower in the bathroom first. I will get you some clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>If Xie Xi hadn\u2019t paid attention to the progress then he wouldn\u2019t have realized. This was truly a duplicitous man.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi now felt that his body was uncomfortable and said, \u201cThank you.\u201d Then he went to the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about it while having a shower. Was this style right? Let\u2019s change the gender. A divorced man was picked up by his ex-wife\u2019s sister and was taking a shower in the house of his ex-wife\u2019s sister? Well\u2026 Xie Xi muttered, \u201cX is a really big pervert.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Jiang\u2019s knee was shot by an arrow.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was much more comfortable after the shower. Then he heard Aix-en\u2019s voice from outside. \u201cI hung the clothes on the door. It might be a bit big but you can wear it first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi whispered his thanks and opened the door to get the clothes.</p><br/><p>Aix-en avoided suspicion by heading to the kitchen. Xie Xi was surprised as he took the clothes into the bathroom and started to dress.</p><br/><p>It was a simple set of pants and a shirt but the size was too large\u2026 Xie Xi didn\u2019t feel that he was much shorter than the souls but in these princes\u2019 dreams, he was inexplicably small.</p><br/><p>He was clearly 180cm. How did he become 170 cm in their eyes? Couldn\u2019t they give him back 10cm?</p><br/><p>Aix-en was at least 190cm tall. How could his clothing not be big on the Xie Xi who shrank to 170cm? This was the shirt. Then what about the pants? Couldn\u2019t the pant leg take both his arm and waist? Wasn\u2019t there a belt?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had no choice and had to go out like this.</p><br/><p>Aix-en brought him a cup of hot milk. \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t have any new clothes. I\u2019ve worn them but they are washed\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He froze before he could finish talking.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up at him helplessly. \u201cDo you have a belt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en\u2019s eyes widened and he quickly put down the milk. \u201cI\u2019ll look for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am troubling you.\u201d He didn\u2019t think too much. He just found it funny that he was dressed like this and Aix-en probably thought it was a joke.</p><br/><p>Aix-en soon came back with a brown leather belt.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took it and tried to tie the belt. Unfortunately, these pants really weren\u2019t right. Xie Xi\u2019s shirt was too long and it was hard to tuck it into the pants. The pants kept slipping down, making him unable to put on the belt.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had some doubts about himself. Was he so stupid that he couldn\u2019t even wear his clothes?</p><br/><p>Or perhaps\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finally understood. Was it Aix-en who didn\u2019t want him to wear clothes?</p><br/><p>\u2018Sister\u2019, you took your divorced brother-in-law home and you even don\u2019t want him to be dressed. These thoughts were very dangerous.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about it and asked simply, \u201cCan you lend me a hand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en\u2019s heart jumped.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at him helplessly. \u201cHow can I not do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en gulped and his voice was slightly hoarse. \u201cI will help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He moved closer to Xie Xi, his slender fingers trembling slightly before his calm was restored. He carefully passed the belt through the straps, fixing it and tightening it. Then the thin waist was highlighted, causing Aix-en\u2019s pupils to shrink.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en\u2019s spirit recovered and he tried to help Xie Xi lock the belt, only to find\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned. \u201cThe belt is too big.\u201d The belt was obviously Aix-en\u2019s and his waistline was quite different from Xie Xi. There weren\u2019t enough holes in the belt.</p><br/><p>What should he do? It was too hard to lock and the belt couldn\u2019t be used.</p><br/><p>Aix-en\u2019s next words were, \u201cThe house is very hot. Or\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u2018Does he want me to just wear a shirt?\u2019 Fortunately, Aix-en still wanted to live. \u201c\u2026Let me buy you clothes.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

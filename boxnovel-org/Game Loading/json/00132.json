He was clearly standing in a place where fire was burning but his hands and feet were cold as ice.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t need to ask what this guy was thinking! The damn thing was\u2026 he couldn\u2019t explain it.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t seen Vermilion Bird yet and Vermilion Bird was dying. If he told Azure Dragon it was a misunderstanding in Vermilion Bird\u2019s presence\u2026</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird would surely show him a death performance on the spot!</p><br/><p>The phoenix could be reborn after dying but Vermilion Bird\u2026 it didn\u2019t seem possible?</p><br/><p>How could Xie Xi dare take this risk?</p><br/><p>The man with the colourful tail feathers knew the inside story. His mood was complicated when he saw that Azure Dragon had also come. He was annoyed by this greedy scum flower but if the scum flower left now, their sage would die. He had to stabilize this situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Azure Dragon.\u201d The man with the colourful tail feathers greeted him. \u201cOur sage doesn\u2019t have any major problems. He just needs to rest. I\u2019m really ashamed about bothering you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to take the Azure Dragon away to give Xie Xi a chance.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that this trick was too low level. Azure Dragon wasn\u2019t a fool and he opened his mouth, \u201cIn that case, Xiao Xie will go back with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words were clear and calm. There was nothing unusual but everyone present got a chill that soaked their bones. In particular, Xiao Xie was frozen and trembling in the fire.</p><br/><p>The man with the colourful tail feathers made an ugly face. \u201cLord Xie Xi still has something to do\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon didn\u2019t wait for him to finish. \u201cThen I will wait for him and also take a look at Vermilion Bird\u2019s situation. I won\u2019t feel assured until I see him awake.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t go! Xie Xi wasn\u2019t surprised at all. It would be strange if Azure Dragon left. What to do?</p><br/><p>Could he speak sweet words to Vermilion Bird in front of Azure Dragon? What if Azure Dragon hacked them to death in a fit of rage?</p><br/><p>Should he go out first with Azure Dragon to have a good talk? Could Azure Dragon be coaxed to wait?</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t mention coaxing since it wasn\u2019t even certain it would work. Based on Vermilion Bird\u2019s current situation, Xie Xi believed that taking even one step away meant Vermilion Bird wouldn\u2019t hesitate to die!</p><br/><p>The fifth prince was a real artist and artists were naturally sensitive. If Xie Xi slightly revealed his intention of coaxing Vermillion Bird to live, it was estimated that Vermillion Bird would rise to heaven.</p><br/><p>The man with the colourful feather tails was also very clear about this point and looked anxiously at Xie Xi, his voice full of pleading. \u201cLord Xie Xi, you\u2026 you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi definitely wouldn\u2019t leave Vermilion Bird no matter what. The important thing was to save this person!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi cruelly turned his head and entered the blazing red light.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t see behind him but Azure Dragon\u2019s gaze seemed to be ice that penetrated his clothes and stabbed him in the back.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gritted his teeth and put all his mind on Vermilion Bird. \u201cSage\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird lay on the bed with his eyes closed. His facial features were the same as Jiang Xie and they looked almost identical when Vermilion Bird\u2019s eyes were closed.</p><br/><p>Vermillion Bird was pale and haggard, his life obviously at risk.</p><br/><p>How could Xie Xi not be emotional after seeing such a Jiang Xie? His eyes were red and his voice choked. \u201cSage, please wake up. Open your eyes and look at me, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird seemed to hear his voice and his thin lips moved as he called out lightly, \u201cXiao Xie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded and held his hand. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird weakly held him, voice as low as a whisper. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t bear to see you with other people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi prepared himself. \u201cI won\u2019t be with anyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird, White Tail and Nine Tails added together weren\u2019t anyone else to Xie Xi!</p><br/><p>These words were very powerful, piercing the heart of the person behind him while giving hope to the person in front of him.</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird was weak and dying. Now he could open his eyes and the fire burning the palace disappeared, showing the exquisite jade outline.</p><br/><p>The birds present were ecstatic. \u201cThe sage woke up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird held Xie Xi and asked while staring at him, \u201cYou really won\u2019t be with anyone else?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had already said this and wasn\u2019t afraid to say a few more words. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut your engagement\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI won\u2019t marry someone else.\u201d This was true. His marriage object had always been one person.</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird sat up, his red clothes hanging down and lining his skin like a painting. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew what he wanted to hear and sent a message to his heart. \u201cI like you. How can I be with other people?\u201d</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird\u2019s pupils shrank and he grabbed Xie Xi\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me.\u201d Xie Xi wasn\u2019t lying but this situation\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I lie to you, thunder will\u2026\u201d Xie Xi\u2019s vow hadn\u2019t finished when Vermilion Bird interrupted. \u201cDon\u2019t say it. I am happy as long as you have me in your heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>He finished speaking and all the fire in the Vermilion Bird Palace disappeared while the birdsong became exhilarated and jubilant.</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird held Xie Xi\u2019s hand and got out of bed, only to see Azure Dragon in the main hall. Vermilion Bird was startled and his grip on Xie Xi\u2019s hand increased.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi inevitably looked at Azure Dragon. Azure Dragon\u2019s lips were tight and there was no blood on his face. He stared at Xie Xi without blinking\u2026 Finally, he coughed lightly and there was a trace of blood at the corners of his mouth.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was pierced!</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird didn\u2019t say a word but pulled Xie Xi into his arms, fearing that Xie Xi would be taken away.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon stared from a distance before turning away without saying anything. His back was desolate and lonely, as if he had been abandoned by the whole world.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was a hornet\u2019s nest. If Vermilion Bird wasn\u2019t holding him, he would definitely chase after Azure Dragon.</p><br/><p>Steady, steady\u2026 Xie Xi told himself. He worked hard to save Vermilion Bird and it couldn\u2019t be undone.</p><br/><p>It was imperative to be alone with Vermilion Bird and discover the situation from Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>He understood it and it was reasonable but the emotional Xie Xi couldn\u2019t let it go. The thought of Azure Dragon truly experiencing betrayal\u2026</p><br/><p>He felt pained and angry but didn\u2019t know who to feel pained for and who to be angry at!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t fulfil the designer\u2019s responsibilities without separating his soul. The separation of the soul led to worlds that only Xie Xi could enter. As soon as Xie Xi entered, the group of souls would scramble for his attention.</p><br/><p>How could he feel angry? What was he angry about?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie loved him so much that every strand of hair would die for him?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was pained, sweet and also bitter. He experienced thousands of gestures of love every minute!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was distracted and Vermilion Bird\u2019s voice was full of uneasiness. \u201cXiao Xie, did you say those words because you saw that I was seriously hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was stunned. \u201cWhat are you saying? Would I say those words to coax you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird whispered, \u201cAzure Dragon heard all of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not good and didn\u2019t meet you earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, their encounter was very early, early than the fourth prince (Azure Dragon). However, in Atlantis, Xie Xi had agreed to the fourth prince\u2019s proposal while the fifth prince (Vermilion Bird) was busy resurrecting Sein and didn\u2019t have a chance to propose. The dream didn\u2019t count.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart wasn\u2019t steady and he glanced at Vermilion Bird. \u201cYour Excellency, you just woke up and should rest well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird wasn\u2019t in a hurry. \u201cDo you want to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was a mess. \u201cI won\u2019t go. I\u2019ll be here with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird\u2019s eyes were bright and the joy was palpable.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t recovered yet and it wasn\u2019t easy to control the fire. He lost his natural fire and if it was someone else, they would\u2019ve died thousands of times.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s words made him cheer up and he seemed to be okay, but just standing required strong support.</p><br/><p>The man with the colourful tail feathers saw this and quickly said, \u201cThe sage needs to rest. We will go first!\u201d</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird nodded. \u201cI worried all of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of birds cried out, \u201cThe sage is safe, it is a great blessing for the bird family!\u201d</p><br/><p>The birds left and only Vermilion Bird and Xie Xi were left in the huge temple.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi helped Vermilion Bird back to bed. He lay down and the eyes stared at him without blinking. \u201cI always afraid that I\u2019m dreaming\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished these words when the different coloured eyes emerged.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was so angry that he pulled away his hand.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie unexpectedly didn\u2019t try to hold him and spoke weakly, \u201cThis Vermilion Bird can really perform. He is actually half dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt a strange heartache and returned his hand. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie rubbed his soft hand and coughed. \u201cYou should hurry to Azure Dragon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had a terrible thought in his heart\u2026</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon and Vermilion Bird were together and Jiang Xie shared their memories. Thus, he knew what Azure Dragon was thinking.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cBefore Azure Dragon met you, his cultivation contained no desire. In order to be with you, he broke his core and devoured his body. However, he didn\u2019t mind since you won\u2019t have a long life, even with the name of the flower god. He only wanted to live with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was tense. \u201cThis\u2026 everything\u2026\u201d What the hell was this setup?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied quietly, \u201cThere is no other way. I love you so much that I am a desperate man.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was still in the mood to speak like this! Xie Xi couldn\u2019t be angry. \u201cWhat is Azure Dragon\u2019s situation now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe will be able to survive if you quickly coax him.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was that serious! Xie Xi asked anxiously, \u201cIf the soul dies, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cObjectively speaking, the souls and I exist at the same time. If one disappears, I will cease to exist.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was worse than Xie Xi thought but it was also logical. Existence was existence, there was no separating it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t sit still. \u201cI\u2019ll go after him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie nodded. However, Xie Xi wasn\u2019t reassured. \u201cWhat about Vermilion Bird?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cThere is no one here and I will stay awake for a short time. It will be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now it was Jiang Xie, not Vermilion Bird present. As long as no one came, the problem wasn\u2019t big.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare delay the time. Jiang Xie pulled him over and handed him something. \u201cThis is a stealth charm so the other birds won\u2019t see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a good thing. If the other birds discovered he left, they would enter the palace to check Vermilion Bird\u2019s condition.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi used the stealth charm and immediately left.</p><br/><p>At this moment, he was personally aware of what it meant by solving one problem only for another to crop up!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

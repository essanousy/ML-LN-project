Crook!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cao Yan was smug. \u201cHehehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was so-called sad music and a zombie rushed over, biting him on the arm.</p><br/><p>Cao Yan was furious. \u201cMy beloved armmm!\u201d He slashed his knife and cut the zombie.</p><br/><p>If the zombies had brains, their fury would probably soar into the sky. How could they not be angry? How could they not feel hatred? Chickens were riding on them and it was so hard to bite something, only for the taste to be awful enough to vomit. They didn\u2019t even have time to do this before they were cut into two!</p><br/><p>Well\u2026 the zombies were working hard.</p><br/><p>Cao Yan didn\u2019t abandon anything as long as it was easy to use. The most important thing was whether it looked good.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Yi looked at two female zombie legs on the ground and couldn\u2019t make up his mind.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was speechless. \u201cYou still haven\u2019t changed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChanging legs is changing legs. Still, look at these two legs. The first one\u2019s calf looks good. It is slender and well-balanced with no damage. The second one is coordinate and healthy like a living leg.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was silent. \u201cHam?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuang Yi explained, \u201cIt is a living leg.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d He really couldn\u2019t understand the world of the half zombies!</p><br/><p>Then Zhu Li came over and asked mysteriously, \u201cBoss, can we install two?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at his intact leg. \u201cYou don\u2019t want your original leg?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Li quickly shook his head and replied earnestly, \u201cI mean, two on one side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t respond. Zhu Li added, \u201cIf it is possible, it is better to have three on one side. A six legs dance is absolutely\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What six legs dancing? Was he trying to scare the zombies to life? Xie Xi was ruthless. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Li felt regret. \u201cI guess there is no way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cao Yan interjected, \u201cIt won\u2019t work. If you want six legs then you need to have six hip joints.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Li wondered, \u201cShould I add six hip joints first?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, the hip joints also need support. You would need six waists.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Li muttered, \u201cThat isn\u2019t good. It is too inconvenient.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t tell if the people in the car or the zombies under the car were the monsters!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled at him. \u201cEveryone rest. The second round will soon arrive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone could see the counter and the huge gap made them very relaxed. The other side had no chance of reversing it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could understand why they cut the zombies so fiercely.</p><br/><p>Before they were injured, these four people were weak. They were very confident in their ability but the I love you VS shameless game was too pitted. They had bad luck and lost an arm or leg.</p><br/><p>Finally, they came across the Yun Die team. This group had information on the chicken mobilization game and directly sentenced the four disabled people to death. The tiger Zhu Li lost his fighting spirit and became lost to the extreme.</p><br/><p>After getting on the car, Xie Xi gave them new hope. It was hope similar to gaining a cheat in an online game. Their arms and legs could be changed casually, adding countless possibilities to the battle.</p><br/><p>They were originally distressed about using their arms to block since it might be broken. They were originally afraid of kicking with their legs since it might be hugged. Now how could they be afraid? It was worthwhile to change to a zombie leg. How many zombies were there\u2026</p><br/><p>From desperation to good times, from hell to heaven, it was no wonder why they killed zombies like crazy.</p><br/><p>The score that shot up wildly showed their repressed reluctance and resentment.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t see the expressions on the faces of the first car players but they could imagine how colourful the expressions were when they saw the score.</p><br/><p>The more they thought about it, the more energetic they became and the more they slashed at the zombies!</p><br/><p>This lasted until Jiang Xie stopped them. The arms and legs could be changed casually and it was quite fun, but they didn\u2019t only kill zombies with these arms and legs. Their physical exertion wasn\u2019t small.</p><br/><p>They vented their grievances and opened the score. The other side couldn\u2019t catch up anymore so they should rest.</p><br/><p>The next round was a hard battle. At the end of the day, the first car wasn\u2019t their real enemy in this game.</p><br/><p>The first car didn\u2019t know the situation over here. They thought it was as they guessed and the man could no longer hold it anymore. The second car was on the verge of being wiped out.</p><br/><p>Zhou Wuwei sneered. \u201cHow strong is one person? This is a collaborative game.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Die sighed with regret. \u201cIt is a pity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is nothing to feel sorry for.\u201d Zhou Wuwei told her. \u201cThis type of mindless rascal, it is useless for him to possess such strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe must have personal talent to be able to do this. I\u2019m sad that such a person is ruined.\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone immediately flattered her, \u201cYou are too kind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, your heart is so soft that you are caring about a person who hurt us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man without a hand got goosebumps as he stood in a corner. Kind and soft? He didn\u2019t know the meaning of these words anymore.</p><br/><p>At the end of the first round, the second car won with an undisputed advantage.</p><br/><p>An announcement was heard in the cars. \u201cYou worked hard to drive away the chickens. These chickens are annoying but there are even more annoying big guys. Please be prepared. The cars will be upgraded. After upgrading, please continue to defeat the annoying chickens!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a sound and their broken car instantly updated.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god, it\u2019s a gun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA gun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also have three grenades!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw that he had\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was next to him and smiled at the sight. \u201cVery good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cWhy do I have a bulletproof vest?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other four were unanimous. \u201cTo protect us\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned around and the half zombies changed their words. \u201cBoss sits in the centre!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nanny or boss\u2026 Xie Xi couldn\u2019t tell which word was more annoying!</p><br/><p>The car upgrades should be assigned according to the previous battle. It wasn\u2019t based on how many zombies were killed but the \u2018class positioning.\u2019</p><br/><p>For example, the tiger Zhu Li got artillery, which was very similar to his previous style.</p><br/><p>The screaming Cao Yan got a submachine gun which had a very energetic outburst.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Liu got a grenade, which was in line with his combat style.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Yi cared about beauty. \u201cThis electric whip is very exciting!\u201d There were sparks around him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at his long legs and realized, \u2018Is this a female soldier?\u2019</p><br/><p>Poor Xie Xi had been \u2018hiding\u2019 in the corner and treated as a protected object. Thus, he actually received a bulletproof vest!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t satisfied. He could also fight and unleash a bombardment! However, the half zombies didn\u2019t let him shoot. His previous hands were to give them arms and legs. How could he touch such things? In fact, compared with guns, Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to touch these zombie limbs!</p><br/><p>The car entered the venue for the second round. The zombies and chickens disappeared and they stopped in an empty hall. The calm after the excessive excitement always made people somewhat uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>Everyone watched intently, on guard for any monsters that would suddenly appear.</p><br/><p>A chicken scream was heard, followed by even more chickens. There was a whoosh and chickens with colourful crowns poured out. This time they were running on their own feet instead of riding zombies.</p><br/><p>What was this situation? Everyone was a little stunned. This didn\u2019t last long. In three or four seconds, thousands of chickens gathered together and became a big rooster with a height of five or six metres!</p><br/><p>The big rooster was like a hill. The sound that emerged from it was so loud that it seemed to deafen people!</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Zhu Li grabbed his head due to the pain. Cao Yan wasn\u2019t much better as he covered his ears.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned to look at Jiang Xie. Jiang Xie\u2019s hands were tightly pressed against Xie Xi\u2019s ears to help him block it. Xie Xi\u2019s ears were hot but his mouth said, \u201cI have my own hands.\u201d He could cover his ears without Jiang Xie doing it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was embarrassed. \u201cMy hands aren\u2019t good. Their reaction speed is too fast and my brain couldn\u2019t control them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, the rooster\u2019s scream stopped and Jiang Xie lowered his hands. \u201cHit it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Li couldn\u2019t wait any longer. He grabbed his weapon and fired wildly towards the rooster.</p><br/><p>The sharp-eyed Xie Xi saw something red coming from Jiang Xie\u2019s ears\u2026</p><br/><p>He froze as he recalled that Jiang Xie had god level qualifications. The highest the qualifications, the more developed the five senses and the sharper the sensations. The impact of the rooster\u2019s scream on Jiang Xie must be far greater than any of the other people present.</p><br/><p>After all, his hearing was definitely the best so that scream\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to say something but Jiang Xie had already rushed out.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had really reacted more instinctively than rationally. He judged the chicken\u2019s scream using his own standards and was afraid that Xie Xi would become deaf. Thus, he first covered Xie Xi\u2019s ears. In fact, Xie Xi\u2019s current hearing level meant he would have a headache at most and there were be no real damage. Meanwhile, Jiang Xie\u2019s eardrums almost shattered.</p><br/><p>The four half zombies weren\u2019t weak and combined with their weapons, the rooster couldn\u2019t do anything.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stayed in the car. His eyes were fixed to Jiang Xie and he couldn\u2019t help looking at this person\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t clear from this distance but there didn\u2019t seem to be anything different in Jiang Xie\u2019s demeanour. It was like the trace of blood was only his illusion. \u201cBack!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie suddenly called out and the other four responded quickly. They moved back and returned to the car.</p><br/><p>Then they saw that the dying rooster suddenly stood up and was full of blood again!</p><br/><p>What was going on?</p><br/><p>The group of four couldn\u2019t believe it and released a crazy bombardment. The rooster was beaten again but the next moment it was completely healed. The incredible thing was that its combat power had become stronger and its speed increased by one gear. It actually managed to peck at Cao Yan\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>Cao Yan yelled, \u201cMy favourite arm!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, who had been observing the battle, almost cried out, \u2018What favourite arm? How many favourite arms have been changed by you?\u2019</p><br/><p>Due to the \u2018injury\u2019, the four men retreated back to the car. Xie Xi changed someone\u2019s \u2018favourite\u2019 arm while saying, \u201cDon\u2019t mess around. The ammunition is limited and it will be troublesome if you use it all up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Liu muttered, \u201cThis big rooster isn\u2019t quite right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Li added, \u201cI also think the legs are too strong.\u201d HIs focus was the legs!</p><br/><p>Zhuang Yi thought about it. \u201cThere seemed to be six lights flashing in the back. Did you see it?\u201d</p><br/><p>He mentioned it and other people cried out, \u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had also seen it. \u201cIt was as if something rushed into its body.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cao Yan\u2019s brain hole opened. \u201cIs it a chicken?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned. This was really possible since the big rooster was originally made from countless chickens. Once it consumed too many chickens and was about to fall to the ground, new chickens were added? Was that how it recovered quickly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had long wondered about something.</p><br/><p>Why did Yun Die value six people so much? It required six people to start? Then just casually fill up the numbers. Wasn\u2019t it better to start gaining points early?</p><br/><p>The first round of zombies was cruel but it wasn\u2019t to the point where six people had to deal with it. Sure enough, the demands for six people was for the later rounds.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cI remember the light points. We will stand in one direction!\u201d</p><br/><p>The four half zombies were shocked. \u201cBoss, you can\u2019t get out of the car!\u201d What a joke! They couldn\u2019t let their nurse encounter unexpected accidents!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was speechless. These bastards were treating him as a weak chicken! No\u2026 the half zombies: it is more like a small auxiliary.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took the lead to jump off first. \u201cDon\u2019t be careless about the enemy or you might die.\u201d</p><br/><p>The half zombies immediately followed. Their eyes were fixed on Xie Xi lest something happen to him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to give them any more arms and legs! Jiang Xie followed with a smile and Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help glancing at his ears. Jiang Xie was startled.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his mouth to speak but the big rooster started to go crazy. Just kill the chicken first!</p><br/><p>Their guess was right. Once the big rooster was hit, new chickens would rush to replenish the energy. The place where the six people stood happened to block the path of the chickens. The chickens ran fast but they had zero fighting power which was why they previously needed to ride the zombies.</p><br/><p>Once they blocked the chicken\u2019s way, the big rooster couldn\u2019t withstand the gunfire and the battle was over!</p><br/><p>Zhu Li went up to look at it. \u201cThe chicken legs are still intact!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cao Yan cursed him. \u201cWhat do you want to do? You can\u2019t even let go of chicken legs?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Li asked him, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to try chicken wings?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cao Yan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss!\u201d Cao Yan asked, \u201cCan you add chicken wings?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stumbled and sent them away. \u201cGet lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>They were psychopaths! The disabled didn\u2019t die and they were talking around the big rooster.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t listen anymore and went to Jiang Xie\u2019s side. Jiang Xie smiled at him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked softly, \u201cDo your ears hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s smile deepened. \u201cSlightly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s expression tightened. \u201cYour eardrums hurt?\u201d He couldn\u2019t fix this type of injury.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was able to hold back his curved lips and the -365 goodwill couldn\u2019t stop him. He whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing\u2026 it won\u2019t hurt anymore if you blow on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened.</p><br/><p>Old Jiang was unstoppable. \u201cOr perhaps a kiss?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mind returned. His ears were hot but his voice was like autumn wind sweeping leaves. \u201cIt seems that I was worrying for nothing. Master is old and already losing your hearing. The rooster\u2019s scream was nothing!\u201d</p><br/><p>His heart was pierced. Compared to Xie Xi, Jiang Xie who lived a long time was really\u2026 a bit old! Jiang Xie was dissatisfied and grabbed the person\u2019s wrist, pulling him over. \u201cAm I really your master?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at him with burning eyes. \u201cI\u2019m really not secretly in love with you?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

How could they be a natural pair?</p><br/><p>Wait, who wanted to pair up with him? It wasn\u2019t Bluetooth and Bluetooth!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi no longer cared about Jiang Xie in case he forgot things.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared hard at the -365. \u2018What crazy thing did I do to make the child hate me so much?\u2019</p><br/><p>Could it be\u2026 well, it couldn\u2019t be too extreme or Xie Xi would\u2019ve already broken their relationship.</p><br/><p>It was a pity for Old Jiang. He broke his head thinking about it but didn\u2019t expect it was due to the worlds he designed.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t mention the Quasi-World Protection Law. Even if he didn\u2019t sign this, his amnesiac brain couldn\u2019t imagine that the quasi-worlds he designed would be like that.</p><br/><p>After all, his original purpose for designing those worlds was very serious, whether it was getting rid of demons for the people (Love to the Left or Right) or land and sea coexistence and environmental disputes (Lost Atlantis)\u2026</p><br/><p>In any case, he didn\u2019t imagine his love scrambled brain would make himself wear a green hat! (TL: Means your significant other cheated on you)</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his mouth. \u201cLet\u2019s go in and see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mood was a bit complicated as he was about to open the door. He wanted to complete the task and leave the open world, but he also didn\u2019t want to.</p><br/><p>The Jiang Xie in front of him was strange and familiar. What about after they returned to Central?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t like X. It was the designer X who stayed in the rose garden and saw through everything. Xie Xi always felt like there was an inexplicable sense of distance between them. But\u2026</p><br/><p>X was Jiang Xie and Jiang Xie was X. They were the same person from beginning to end.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi retracted his thoughts and stared a the sun door.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, the red door indicated the heat. After pushing the door open a crack, Xie Xi felt the blazing heat.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie moved forward first. \u201cBe careful.\u201d He completely pushed the door open.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes fell on his hand.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie reassured him. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I have thick skin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie continued, \u201cMy skin is thick but my face is thin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t mention Xie Xi, even the group of four had a toothache at the words. They were afraid they wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the word \u2018thin-skinned\u2019 later on.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was too lazy to care about this and picked up Jiang Xie\u2019s hand. Sure enough, it was red and blistered. Xie Xi had just discovered that the temperature of the door was becoming hotter and hotter. Jiang Xie had pushed it open and the final temperature must be very high.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had been enduring it and finally couldn\u2019t hold back. \u201cOr you can blow on it for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glared at him. \u201cDo you think I have a magic breath?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is my magic breath.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The four people silently turned away and cough\u2026 they learnt it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was both distressed and angry. He finally cruelly opened his claws, \u201cIt might hurt but this side has no medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was afraid that he was worried. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t blow on it in front of people and stared intently inside the door.</p><br/><p>The door opened and there was a sea of fire inside. It seemed there was no place for anyone to move. The people who originally wanted to follow silently retreated when they saw this.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t have to go in. Just looking showed that it was dangerous.</p><br/><p>Cao Yan suggested, \u201cI\u2019ll go and see first.\u201d He went in while spraying fire from his mouth.</p><br/><p>Zhu Li hurriedly said, \u201cI\u2019ll go with him.\u201d They both had fire related skills that could act as an anti-fire curtain for a bit.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t feel urgent. He waited for the two fire-resistant people to probe a bit before going in.</p><br/><p>The next minute, Cao Yan and Zhu Li came out. \u201cThe inside is full of fire but fortunately, there is no smoke. We can pass as long as we\u2019re careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no water around and no way to wet their clothes. The possibility of ignition was extremely high once entering. Since the inside was full of fire, how could they extinguish the fire? It would be a mess if many people entered.</p><br/><p>The people who waited to see really didn\u2019t want to enter this door. They felt it was too dangerous.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi might be able to give people arms and legs but it wasn\u2019t useful in this fire. The fire might burn to the point where it couldn\u2019t be repaired.</p><br/><p>It was natural to feel cautious. Xie Xi had no opinion on this. He wouldn\u2019t lead others or refuse others. It was like the two doors in the labyrinth. Everyone had the right to choose.</p><br/><p>Cao Yan took the initiative. \u201cI will go ahead.\u201d He could resist fire and his arms could be burned casually. He wasn\u2019t afraid of pain.</p><br/><p>Zhu Li said, \u201cI\u2019ll be in the rear.\u201d He could fight the fire but his zombie leg was needed to move. If he burned himself, he would just be cumbersome.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Liu and Zhuang Yi might not be fire resistant but they were agile and their self-preservation wasn\u2019t weak.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t weak at all. His beginner qualifications were almost full and he was stronger than most newcomers.</p><br/><p>The quarter meant to have him in the middle but Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cMy eyesight is better. I will follow behind Cao Yan.\u201d If he went ahead, he could see more clearly and spot any changes.</p><br/><p>Zhu Li wanted to argue when Jiang Xie told them, \u201cDon\u2019t you trust in your boss?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Li was stunned before his spirit returned. Yes, their boss wasn\u2019t a pure healer. He was a vigorous and decisive frontline warrior with accurate judgment!</p><br/><p>Remember the chicken mobilization game where Yun Die tried a sneak attack. The quarter hadn\u2019t reacted but their boss had long held a gun and didn\u2019t hesitate to shoot the woman. If it wasn\u2019t for their boss, who knows how many times they would\u2019ve died!</p><br/><p>Zhu Li scratched his head. \u201cI was confused!\u201d</p><br/><p>The lineup was settled. Cao Yan was in front, Xie Xi second, Jiang Xie naturally relied on his wife (not), Zhuo Liu and Zhuang Yi were next and Zhu Li was last.</p><br/><p>Other people wanted to follow but they couldn\u2019t control that many people. This was a narrow path. The group would lead the way and the other people could only follow. It couldn\u2019t be helped if they couldn\u2019t keep up.</p><br/><p>The entire procession went in. They entered the door and it was all fire. The other people couldn\u2019t see and Cao Yan and Zhu Li couldn\u2019t rely on their fire-resistance to search for the path. It was extremely difficult to find.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi played his role and stretched out his five senses to the extreme.</p><br/><p>His eyes stared at the fiery red and his ears listened to the sizzling fire. He was extremely focused because he was afraid something would pop out of the fire.</p><br/><p>They walked like this for half an hour and everyone was sweaty.</p><br/><p>Cao Yan wondered, \u201cHow long is this road?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi bowed his head and looked. \u201cGo further.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had been marking their way since they set off. If they were walking in a circle, they would see the marks left behind.</p><br/><p>Cao Yan knew this and replied, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>He stopped after three steps. There was no need for him to speak as Xie Xi had already seen the marks they left behind. It was really a circle\u2026</p><br/><p>It seemed they couldn\u2019t just walk straight through this corner.</p><br/><p>Cao Yan asked, \u201cWhat do we do? If we go in a circle then we can\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>This situation couldn\u2019t last long. Cao Yan and Zhu Li couldn\u2019t withstand this heat, let alone other people.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned and thought about it. \u201cWalk a bit longer. I feel like I heard something before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s lips curved. He hadn\u2019t said anything because pretending to be deaf had many benefits. His ears were good but it wasn\u2019t worth fighting.</p><br/><p>Besides, his hearing wasn\u2019t in line with the restrictions of the open world. If he solved everything, was there any fun in the game?</p><br/><p>It was fortunate that Qin Ge and Yan Zhe weren\u2019t here to hear him or they would surely swear at him. \u2018What do you know about having fun in the game?\u2019</p><br/><p>The other four were confused. \u201cWas there a sound?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cI\u2019m not sure either but it was like\u2026 the crying of a child.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Liu wondered, \u201cA child crying? How can there be a child in this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cao Yan called out, \u201cLet\u2019s go! If this is a circle, we will definitely pass by it. Boss, listen carefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>They really didn\u2019t hear anything. It was probably because Xie Xi\u2019s hearing qualifications were higher.</p><br/><p>The reason why Xie Xi didn\u2019t tell them to stop previously was because he wasn\u2019t sure the sound was a clue. It would\u2019ve been good if they could go outside in one trip.</p><br/><p>Now it seemed like the path was circular and he had to rethink things.</p><br/><p>He was more focused than before. His whole body was red from the fire but his eyes were always calm.</p><br/><p>In fact, Xie Xi was very nervous. Everyone had come in this door because of him. If he couldn\u2019t bring them out then\u2026</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t think about it. They had to leave! Xie Xi listened intently and after 10 minutes of walking, he whispered, \u201cStop!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was here. Previously it was vague but now that he was listening more clearly, it was definitely a child crying.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked them, \u201cDo you hear it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The quarter shook their head. They couldn\u2019t hear anything over the sound of the fire.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi listened for a moment and was quite certain. \u201cIt is a young child in the 9 o\u2019clock direction.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group looked that way and Zhu Li became startled, \u201cIndeed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that he looked seriously, he actually could see a red baby in the flames.</p><br/><p>He floated in the flames but wasn\u2019t burnt. He just cried fiercely and his voice became louder and louder, allowing everyone to hear it.</p><br/><p>Zhu Li said, \u201cI\u2019ll go over and take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi grabbed his clothes. \u201cCan you do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Xie Xi suddenly said. \u201cHe seems to have discovered us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little baby discovered that someone was watching him. He cried a bit before tilting his head and looking over.</p><br/><p>Miraculously, the flames became smaller the moment he stopped crying. It was originally sky high but now it was the height of a bush.</p><br/><p>The group\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cThis child is the key!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, it only lasted a moment. The child started crying again and the flames became bigger than before.</p><br/><p>Zhu Li said again, \u201cI\u2019ll go and check the situation.\u201d It would be easy to get out of here if they could keep the child from crying.</p><br/><p>However, there was no need to walk over as the child moved towards them while crying.</p><br/><p>The baby was white and tender and wasn\u2019t burned by the fire. The tears that he wept dried instantly and only his pitiful voice could be seen.</p><br/><p>After approaching, Zhu Li couldn\u2019t help whispering, \u201cLittle baby, don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><br/><p>The baby looked at him and cried even more fiercely!</p><br/><p>Zhu Li, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuang Yi looked like a woman and should have a higher affinity with the baby. He tried to make his voice gentle, \u201cLittle guy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no need to look. The baby directly howled and the fire grew wilder!</p><br/><p>The narrow trails became narrower and several people were afraid to move.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Liu didn\u2019t dare go forward.</p><br/><p>The baby cried for a while before the sound became smaller and more wronged. \u201cMummy, Mummy and Daddy doesn\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd was stunned. Who were his Mummy and Daddy?</p><br/><p>Then a scene occurred that made people even more stunned. Jiang Xie leaned over and hugged the baby. \u201cOkay, don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the baby really didn\u2019t cry. He stared at Jiang Xie and murmured, \u201cDaddy\u2026\u201d Then he couldn\u2019t endure it anymore and howled.</p><br/><p>This was a terrible situation!</p><br/><p>Flames were emitted from the baby and Zhuo Liu and Zhuang Yi quickly hid in case they were burnt!</p><br/><p>Miraculously, Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t burned. His handsome features in the fire were particularly dazzling and his gentle voice was heard, \u201cYour mummy is here. He won\u2019t hug you until you stop crying.\u201d</p><br/><p>It actually worked! The baby didn\u2019t cry!</p><br/><p>The quartet was horrified and wondered, \u2018Which bastard did you make this illegitimate child with?\u2019</p><br/><p>Then Jiang Xie held out the child towards Xie Xi and said, \u201cDon\u2019t burn your mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>He took the baby and stared at him.</p><br/><p>The baby stared back for a moment before smiling. \u201cMummy!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was so loud that the people outside the door could probably hear it! At the same time, all the flames were extinguished.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

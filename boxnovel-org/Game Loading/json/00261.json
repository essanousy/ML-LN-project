The blonde hair was dazzling and the furry round ears were too cute!</p><br/><p>Then there were the paws that grew from the white wrists like small gloves. The pink meat pad made people\u2026 want to squeeze it!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was sure that he wasn\u2019t a person obsessed with cuteness but he was turned over by this little lion.</p><br/><p>Little Jiang disliked himself. He looked down at his hands and asked Xie Xi, \u201cHow am I different from others?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also wanted to ask, \u2018How are you different from others?\u2019</p><br/><p>The lion\u2019s paws stretched out and the nails were as sharp as a knife, forming a sharp contrast to the furry paws.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was dead. There was no doubt that the cause of death was excessive blood loss.</p><br/><p>Little Jiang sensed Xie Xi\u2019s abnormality and asked anxiously, \u201cIs this failing the transformation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was once again stunned by this soft voice. He cleared his throat and said, \u201cIt was successful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s golden eyes were full of discontent. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>His ears shook and he extended two small paws.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes silently widened. He might need to get a blood transfusion while taking quick-acting heart-saving pills. This was too lethal!</p><br/><p>\u201cSir?\u201d He followed the villager\u2019s method of calling Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Mr Xie, who had just sighed with relief, was killed again.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyebrows twisted and his voice was filled with anxiety. \u201cAre you tired? Go to bed and rest.\u201d He spoke while holding up Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t look at this person\u2019s small size. The strength was very big and it was easy for him to support Xie Xi who was taller than him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s body couldn\u2019t adapt to too many emotional fluctuations. He slowed down for a while as he suppressed the darkness in front of him.</p><br/><p>Was it shameful? He personally experienced what it meant to be dazzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir?\u201d Little Jiang Xie called out again.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke gently, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pour you some water.\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned and his long tail swept over Xie Xi\u2019s knee. Xie Xi was fortunate enough to be weak or he would\u2019ve reached out to grab them.</p><br/><p>This lovely little tail attracted people!</p><br/><p>Anyone who saw it would have the urge to grab a handful!</p><br/><p>Little Jiang Xie seemed to be six or seven years old but he was very sensible. He poured water for Xie Xi and also started a fire to cook rice. He boiled the rice porridge that Xie Xi usually drank.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stopped him, \u201cNo, there is no need to bother.\u201d Unfortunately, he was too weak and could only speak.</p><br/><p>Little Jiang Xie didn\u2019t listen and brought over a bowl of rice porridge.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could only say, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at him. \u201cNo need for thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare to look at the child and could only drink porridge to restore his strength. Who knew that this little fellow would promise in an old-sounding voice, \u201cYou can rest assured that I am already a qualified beastman. I will take care of you in the future and not let you be cold or hungry, nor will people bully you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished when Xie Xi almost choked on his mouthful of porridge.</p><br/><p>He coughed violently, \u2018If you take care of me, sooner or later I will be dead from your cuteness!\u2019</p><br/><p>Little Jiang Xie hurried to pat him on the back, golden eyes worried. This man was too weak that he couldn\u2019t drink porridge properly. However, Jiang Xie had beast paws and couldn\u2019t feed this man.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, he didn\u2019t say these words. Otherwise, Xie Xi would laugh to death!</p><br/><p>After coughing for a long time, Xie Xi was almost accustomed to this broken body. Therefore, he was in high spirits from a good mood.</p><br/><p>He told Little Jiang Xie, \u201cI will be satisfied if you grow up well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Jiang Xie leaned down and said, \u201cYou saved me and I will repay you. As long as I am there, I won\u2019t let you be wronged.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was very manly but with the small face\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s lips curved and he nodded. \u201cThen can you tell me who you are?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019ll be Little Xie later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s smile deepened. \u201cAs my son?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn short, I will take care of you and raise you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Please don\u2019t casually say that you will raise me or the misunderstanding will be even greater!\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes curved. \u201cI\u2019m not a lion beast. How can I have such a child?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help touching the little ears.</p><br/><p>In the beast form, the little lion didn\u2019t like people touching his ears. It was the same even after becoming a person.</p><br/><p>It was because it was Xie Xi that he resisted. Still, he couldn\u2019t help shaking his ears.</p><br/><p>He shook and Xie Xi\u2019s palms itched. His heart had bad intentions. Maybe there wouldn\u2019t be these small ears once the child got bigger and he wouldn\u2019t be able to touch even if he wanted to!</p><br/><p>Little Jiang Xie leaned back and asked him, \u201cAre you a tiger?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suspected this but who knows? After all, he didn\u2019t know how to transform.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t answer this question and asked Little Jiang Xie, \u201cHow can I rest assured if you don\u2019t make your situation clear?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Jiang Xie leaned down, his long eyelashes trembling. \u201cI fled from the Lion Country. They killed my family and I have nothing left.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi guessed that the little lion didn\u2019t have it easy but it was still painful to hear.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t tease him and asked, \u201cWhat happened? Who killed your family?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Jiang Xie shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. When I woke up, my father and sister had fallen down in a pool of blood and the house was burnt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father and sister\u2026</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xie Xi was certain that Jiang Xie had lost these two relatives in his original world.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke again. \u201cI was small and they weren\u2019t prepared, allowing me to escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about the tragic sight when he first saw the lion and couldn\u2019t help lowering his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Jiang Xie raised his spirits. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he grew up, he would make them blood-soaked!</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t say it because he was afraid of scaring the sick man in front of him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi patted him on the back of the hand. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Jiang Xie\u2019s paws pressed against the back of the hand. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Okay, this person was the beast king and very powerful.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi went to consult with the professional Huer\u2019s mother about the transformation of the little lion.</p><br/><p>Huer\u2019s mother gazed at the small Jiang Xie and smiled happily. \u201cOh, I said that this little lion will be a chubby boy. Look at the white face and thick paws. The small legs are also very powerful. He will definitely be tall!\u201d</p><br/><p>She wanted to touch the little lion but he flexibly avoided her.</p><br/><p>Huer\u2019s mother was even happier. \u201cThis is really good! He will definitely be excellent at hunting!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi laughed. The adjectives of Huer\u2019s mother were much richer than him.</p><br/><p>Regarding the beast ears and tail, Huer\u2019s mother said, \u201cThis is a lucky phase!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huer\u2019s mother explained, \u201cOnly those with a strong power will retain some beast characteristics. I heard that Beast King Rose also retained his beast ears and tails!\u201d</p><br/><p>As a senior fan of Beast King Rose, Wang Huyi solemnly spoke, \u201cThe reason why the beast king was called Rose was because he had a pattern like a blooming Chinese rose on the back of his left ear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this Mary Sue setting? The pattern was like a rose? Was he serious? What was the difference between a single rose and a Chinese rose?</p><br/><p>Wang Huyi spoke seriously, \u201cAfter the beast king fully became an adult, his left ear had a red rose earring.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was silent. He wanted to go back to Central and search Jiang Xie\u2019s warehouse to see what messy things this person was hiding!</p><br/><p>Huer\u2019s mother added, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. This shows that he will be a brave and fearless soldier!\u201d</p><br/><p>This obviously matched the heart of Little Jiang Xie. His face was calm but his golden eyes became brighter.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked again, \u201cThen once he comes of age, he will completely become human?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huer\u2019s mother replied, \u201cNot necessarily. You might have to wait until the estrus period is over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>Huer\u2019s mother covered his mouth and smiled. \u201cLittle Xie will definitely be a handsome young man. I don\u2019t know how many females will be confused by him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t yet recovered from the word \u2018estrus.\u2019</p><br/><p>Huer\u2019s mother asked Little Jiang Xie, \u201cLittle Xie, do you want to live and work in Tiger Country? Find a tiger wife and give birth to lion and tiger beasts\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lion and tiger beasts?? There was even genetic segregation?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was alarmed and pulled Little Jiang Xie to leave. \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t urgent. He is still small.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huer\u2019s mother shouted, \u201cHe isn\u2019t too small. I will pick a good person for him. If Mr Xie doesn\u2019t leave the village, I will help you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t listen anymore. He exhausted all his strength to bring Little Jiang Xie back to the cave.</p><br/><p>Huer\u2019s mother smiled in the distance. \u201cMr Xie\u2019s skin is really thin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was tired to death and breathless!</p><br/><p>Who knew that Little Jiang Xie would add another sentence, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry. I will take care of you even if I get a wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>This disease meant he really didn\u2019t have the energy to be angry!</p><br/><p>Little Jiang Xie saw his body soften and hurriedly held him. \u201cOkay, it isn\u2019t a big deal. I won\u2019t marry anyone. You don\u2019t have to be afraid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was half dead but couldn\u2019t help hitting him on the head. \u201cYou are only this big. What are you thinking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Jiang Xie carefully coaxed him, \u201cYes, don\u2019t think about it. In any case, I won\u2019t leave you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was too lazy to speak.</p><br/><p>Speaking of which, this little guy was only six or seven years old. There was still more than 10 years left until adulthood. Even if he would really lose these features after estrus, it was too early to talk about it now. He shouldn\u2019t be anxious.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really underestimated this world.</p><br/><p>Huer\u2019s mother wasn\u2019t lying. If Xie Xi wanted a daughter-in-law then he really had to pick now.</p><br/><p>A little more time passing was really late for an ordinary male!</p><br/><p>The grown cycle of beastmen was actually very short.</p><br/><p>Half a year later, Xie Xi\u2019s little lion was taller than him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had to shamefully tiptoe if he wanted to touch the beast ears.</p><br/><p>Today was the day when Wang Huer got married. The Wang family held a big banquet and Huer\u2019s mother sent an early invitation to Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi woke up with low blood sugar and gasped on his bed.</p><br/><p>Little Jiang Xie\u2026 oh, it was just Jiang Xie!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie opened the door while carrying hot water and towels, as well as breakfast and laundry.</p><br/><p>As promised, he took care of Xie Xi properly by doing all the housework.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi watched him grow up so quickly and felt panicked.</p><br/><p>According to such a method, Jiang Xie would be an adult in a month or two.</p><br/><p>Adulthood was nothing. The key was the estrus period!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

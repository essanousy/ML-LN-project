This temperature was truly something that a flower couldn\u2019t withstand.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Nine Tails lifted him up and transmitted a steady stream of heat to him, easing the stiffness of Xie Xi\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finally wasn\u2019t cold but he still had no strength. He couldn\u2019t change back to human form.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails whispered to him. \u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Sorry, roses couldn\u2019t speak!</p><br/><p>Nine Tails didn\u2019t want him to respond. He just carefully controlled the heat so that he wouldn\u2019t burn the little rose.</p><br/><p>In fact, Nine Tails found it difficult to generate heat. His cultivation was in the yin (cold) direction. If he wanted to generate heat, he had to reverse these exercises. This wasn\u2019t easy and was breaking off his own veins.</p><br/><p>A few days ago, Nine Tails never imagined that he would do this for a small flower. He didn\u2019t care about offending his brother Houqing and didn\u2019t hesitate to warm up the flower.</p><br/><p>As long as he brought the flower back to the palace, someone else would take care of him. However, Nine Tails couldn\u2019t bear to see the small rose uncomfortable for even half a minute.</p><br/><p>Why? They just met. Why did Nine Tails care so much? It was like he was stunned and lost his sanity.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wilted in Nine Tails palm and didn\u2019t bother acting. This powerless appearance wasn\u2019t much different from how he felt.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails took him back to the palace and found someone to bring him the Warm Pill.</p><br/><p>The foxes sent over a jar that contained a lot of Warm Pills. Nine Tails unexpectedly poured them all out and piled them around the rose like a quilt.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The fox, \u201c!\u201d How wasteful! This was their thrifty Ancestor Nine Tails!</p><br/><p>Nine Tails asked Xie Xi, \u201cAre you still cold?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi moved his lower petals in a way that meant: Take away the Warm Pill. I feel uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails smiled and relaxed. \u201cIt\u2019s fine as long as you aren\u2019t cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d A flower was really unable to communicate with the fox!</p><br/><p>After turning into a flower, Xie Xi didn\u2019t have much concept of time. He always felt it was a moment when a day had actually passed. This was a lack of energy caused by physical weakness and it entered Nine Tails\u2019 eyes.</p><br/><p>The small rose had shut himself off. Nine Tails might\u2019ve saved the flower but the flower didn\u2019t want to face reality.</p><br/><p>In the past few days, Nine Tails found countless doctors to check on Xie Xi. The doctors told him, \u201cThe flower doesn\u2019t have any problem with his body.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails asked, \u201cThen why isn\u2019t he changing back?\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor sighed, \u201cIt is he who doesn\u2019t want to change.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard this sentence and really wanted to spit out: Quack! He wanted to transform but he had no strength!</p><br/><p>Nine Tails felt melancholy and sighed with relief Then he picked up his spirits and carefully accompanied Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt this was useful and liked Nine Tails\u2019 intimate care. Of course, Jiang Xie always treated him well but that guy was essentially a naughty monster. It took him only three seconds to lose his seriousness. He was never as careful as Nine Tails.</p><br/><p>Xiao Xie thought that the souls were really cuter than the body.</p><br/><p>Seven or eight days passed and Nine Tails brought a bunch of jade bottles. He eagerly said, \u201cIt took some effort but I\u2019ve obtained them. It is your favourite drink.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Should he pretend to be touched?</p><br/><p>How could a flower show such complex emotions? It was too difficult!</p><br/><p>This jade dew was estimated to not be a simple ingredient. Once a few drops fell on Xie Xi\u2019s petals, he felt the strength of his body doubling and he changed back to a human body.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails\u2019 eyes were bright and his voice was slightly nervous. \u201cDo you want to drink some more?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was touched by this scene. After all, it was all personal. He looked at the jade bottles and frowned lightly, his face pale. \u201cI don\u2019t want to drink.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails was surprised for a moment. Xie Xi turned away, not having the strength to even look at the bottles.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails\u2019 heart was bitter as he persuaded Xie Xi, \u201cThese are very good for your body. You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head and didn\u2019t say anything. Nine Tails ruthlessly asked, \u201cAre you no longer concerned about the world after leaving Houqing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s lips trembled as he heard this name and his eyes darted around, highlighting his desire to escape.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails held down his shoulder and stared at him. \u201cHe used you as a substitute for other people. He isn\u2019t looking at you. Do you want to give up your life for such a person?\u201d</p><br/><p>These sentences brutally opened the rose\u2019s festering scars. It was cruel but it was also a type of detoxification.</p><br/><p>Sometimes things that weren\u2019t said were only evaded. After escaping, there would be an even more explosive outburst after a long time passed. It might be very painful now but it was better than breaking to pieces later!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head, face still pale. \u201cShut up, don\u2019t say it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails stared at him. \u201cIf you want to live a lifetime being deceived, I can send you back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suddenly looked up. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to go back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails looked distressed. \u201cForget him. He doesn\u2019t deserve your love.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi substituted himself into the scene and the emotions quickly fell in place. \u201cIt would be nice if he doesn\u2019t deserve it. How good would it be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, being worthwhile or not had never been used to measure liking a person.</p><br/><p>Who wanted to love someone who didn\u2019t love them back? Who wanted their hearts to tilt towards a destined tragedy? Who wanted to entrust their most passionate feelings towards someone who wasn\u2019t worth it?</p><br/><p>If this type of emotion could be controlled by reason, how could there be so many infatuated men and women in the world?</p><br/><p>Nine Tails heard him say this and his heart was poked like a hornet\u2019s nest. Yes, if the rose didn\u2019t like Houqing then he wouldn\u2019t be haunted by this.</p><br/><p>What if he had been deceived by Houqing for the rest of his life? A small rose\u2019s life was short. Wasn\u2019t it good to have a happy life? Why did Nine Tails want to wake him up? He also wasn\u2019t willing to wake up.</p><br/><p>Intellectually, he knew what was best but emotionally it was different. Nine Tails did things for such grandiose reasons but it was still for the sake of his own desires. Finally, there was only an endless abyss that they couldn\u2019t escape from.</p><br/><p>The two of them didn\u2019t speak again. They were so close but so far apart as they had their own thoughts.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could basically guess the direction of this drama. He couldn\u2019t bear to see Nine Tails sad and pushed the \u2018plot\u2019 forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Nine Tails\u2026\u201d Xie Xi whispered.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails looked over, silver eyes reflecting all of Xie Xi. \u201cSay it. As long as it is within my power, I will help you.\u201d Even if he wanted to be sent back to Houqing to continue sleeping in the fantasy\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi whispered, \u201cI heard you have a spell that can make people forget everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails was stunned.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi continued. \u201cCan you help me?\u201d</p><br/><p>His words filled with despair and helplessness caused Nine Tails\u2019 fox heart to explode.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He endured the bitterness rising in his throat. \u201cI can help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled, eyes covered with a thin mist. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no need for thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the origin of the bewitchment. Houqing mentioning that Xie Xi was enchanted by Nine Tails should be because of this.</p><br/><p>Of course, Xie Xi didn\u2019t know if he took the initiative to ask or if Nine Tails couldn\u2019t stand it anymore in the original setting of the souls.</p><br/><p>In any case, this wasn\u2019t important. Xie Xi forgot Houqing and fell in love with Nine Tails.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails\u2019 enchantment definitely wouldn\u2019t work on the present Xie Xi. In theory, he wasn\u2019t part of the painting and wouldn\u2019t be affected by the spells here.</p><br/><p>Still, it was easy for him to adjust his mood. After all, whether it was Houqing or Nine Tails, they were all Jiang Xie and made him feel distressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou woke up.\u201d Xie Xi forgot Houqing and saw Nine Tails smiling softly.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails asked, \u201cLittle Rose, coming all the way to Nine Tailed Fox Palace, what do you want to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi froze.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails smiled. \u201cAre you lost and can\u2019t find your way home?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi inwardly called him shameless but a faint blush rose on his face. Thus, XIe Xi fell in love with Nine Tails.</p><br/><p>Sadly, Houqing treated Xie Xi as a substitute and now Nine Tails had become Houqing\u2019s substitute.</p><br/><p>When NIne Tails used the enchantment, he shifted Xie Xi\u2019s feelings and thoughts about Houqing to himself.</p><br/><p>This was tantamount to a quenching thirst for him but also gave relief to Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>The enchantment caused a loss of memory but once Xie Xi saw Houqing, he would instantly remember everything. His despair would double and it would be harder to face everything.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the same when the emotions were transferred. Even if Xie Xi saw Houqing again, he wouldn\u2019t think anything. It was because he didn\u2019t forget but changed the person he liked.</p><br/><p>This type of enchantment couldn\u2019t be broken by anyone unless Nine Tails was seriously injured.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails didn\u2019t want Xie Xi to live in the dream of being deceived by Houqing. He chose to deceive himself and was incredibly sober about what he was facing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s love, dependence and attachment to him was under the premise of treating him as post-Houqing.</p><br/><p>How ironic. The so-called rational person was vulnerable in the face of such feelings.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi and Nine Tails passed a period of time where honey was mixed with oil but this didn\u2019t last long. Houqing had found them.</p><br/><p>Houqing arrived and saw Xie Xi and NIne Tails kissing under a cold plum tree.</p><br/><p>The silver-haired man was holding the waist of the rose while the rose\u2019s arms were wrapped around his neck as a kiss was accepted. His eyes were full of intimacy and love, as if it was enough if there was only this person in the world of ice and snow.</p><br/><p>Houqing shouted, \u201cNine Tails!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails shifted and protected Xie Xi in his arms. \u201cHow dare you have to nerve to come looking for him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou framed me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails\u2019 expression was blank. \u201cWhat could I do if you weren\u2019t guilty?\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing\u2018s veins bulged with rage. \u201cLet him go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails said, \u201cI like him and only him alone. It isn\u2019t comparable to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t finish his words because Houqing couldn\u2019t bear it anymore and attacked.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails moved Xie Xi to the side and moved, the two brothers shattering the ground with their fight.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could see it clearly and vaguely felt that Nine Tails was weaker. After all, their styles were different and the direction wasn\u2019t the same.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails\u2019 enchantment was the root of his invincibility but the spell had a drawback. Using it would release the last cast. In other words, if he used an enchantment on Houqing, he would increase his chances of winning but the one on Xie Xi would be released.</p><br/><p>Thus, he would never use it.</p><br/><p>Houqing was full of hatred and his start was extremely heavy. He completely disregarded life and death. Nine Tails was pushed back and eventually smashed by Houqing who found a flaw.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails flew back more than 10 metres and blood flowed from his mouth.</p><br/><p>Houqing didn\u2019t intend to let him go, quickly moving forward and grabbing the fox\u2019s neck. \u201cRemove the enchantment.\u201d Nine Tails\u2019 face was white but he sneered, \u201cSo what if it is released? He knows everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRelease it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails chuckled. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing struck him in the belly. \u201cAs long as you are seriously injured, the enchantment will be naturally released.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were brothers and knew each other very well. Houqing was also clear about the flaw in Nine Tails\u2019 spell. His so-called previous sentences were just the last feelings between brothers. Since Nine Tails was so stubborn, he would no longer have scruples.</p><br/><p>How could Xie Xi see this and not understand? If this continued, Nine Tails would be beaten to death by Houqing. Killing yourself over this type of thing, Jiang Xie was probably the first!</p><br/><p>After seeing that Houqing was about to strike again, Xie Xi rushed forward and stood in front of Nine Tails, taking the hit instead.</p><br/><p>Time suddenly seemed to freeze and the sky and earth turned upside down as Houqing and Nine Tails let out a heartbreaking scream. \u201cWhite 99!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This fucking hit, it hurt!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

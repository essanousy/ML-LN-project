If he used Colin\u2019s face then it would be too busy. He hadn\u2019t taken care of the two cockfighting people in the palace yet. If he provoked another person then he would probably never fill up the progress in this lifetime!</p><br/><p>Despite the use of the first face, the current situation was somewhat troublesome.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince\u2019s words were very intriguing. The underwater people were also human. He asked this question because he was questioning Xie Xi\u2019s identity. After all, it was impossible for an ordinary person to raise their hands and get rid of the pile of rubbish without a trace.</p><br/><p>How should Xie Xi explain the scene just now?</p><br/><p>He glanced at the fourth prince and said, \u201cI am Jesse Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince lowered his gaze and saw Xie Xi\u2019s clothes. \u201cAre you a guard of the palace?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was wearing the guard\u2019s light blue uniform. The appearance had changed due to the rubbish but it could be distinguished with a closer look.</p><br/><p>He told the fourth prince, \u201cThis subordinate has seen the fourth prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>For a moment, the surrounding seawater shrank back a bit. Xie Xi felt a cold and bitter killing intent as the fourth prince raised his hand and grabbed Xie Xi\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>His hand was cold and a fragrance came from it. The smell had some bitterness to it, like it was a type of herb.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was choked but he was fearless. He looked up at the fourth prince with calm eyes.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince tightened his grip and asked in a low voice, \u201cWho the hell are you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had difficulty breathing. Redness rose to his face and uncontrollable moisture appeared in his eyes.</p><br/><p>His face was handsome and romantic. At this moment, the fearless expression made it seductive to the extreme.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince\u2019s eyes narrowed and he loosened his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t lie or I will kill you.\u201d This last sentence was whispered into Xie Xi\u2019s ears. He had no doubt that he would be killed as soon as he did anything suspicious.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince who lived in a simple manner, not only was he not sick, he also showed a fierce hostility.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cI am a guard of the palace called Jesse Hall. If there is even a bit of falsehood in my words then please take my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince pressed him. \u201cWhat were you doing just now? Where did the rubbish go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke very bluntly. \u201cI can\u2019t say it clearly but I suddenly gained an ability. Thus, I wanted to try it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince stared at him. \u201cWhat ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can eliminate garbage.\u201d</p><br/><p>What bullshit ability was this? If this was peacetime then he would probably be treated as crazy? Eliminate garbage? How could anyone have that ability?</p><br/><p>However, the fourth prince saw it with his own eyes. This person walked out of the shield, stood in a sea of dirt and reached out. Then the disgusting rubbish disappeared.</p><br/><p>He actually saw it so he had to believe these words.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very calm. He was confident in the identity of the first face and his words weren\u2019t nonsense. He did somehow get an ability to let rubbish \u2018disappear\u2019. It might be obtained in his items bar but in the eyes of others, it had disappeared.</p><br/><p>The highest level of lying was to have 70% of it be true while 30% was false. Xie Xi didn\u2019t understand it before but now that he was stepping on many boats, he couldn\u2019t not understand.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince watched him for a while, the dark eyes like a searchlight examining the inside of Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was honest while showing some timidity and uneasiness. His emotions were correctly in place.</p><br/><p>Stepping on many ships had some benefits. He would\u2019ve died in Love to the Left or Right if he hadn\u2019t learnt acting. Xie Xi learnt the benefits of a \u2018good play.\u2019</p><br/><p>The fourth prince finally released him. The prince was still expressionless and his voice was cold. \u201cYou can eliminate garbage?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was relieved and answered, \u201cYes, as long as I touch it with my hands. There are some limits. It won\u2019t work if the number of garbage is too small.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hastened to keep up.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince really wasn\u2019t sick. No, he was in better than good health! At this speed, he would undoubtedly win the 100 metres sprint if he participated!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had used a potion and was wearing the guard uniform but his tail was exposed to the outside. It was corroded by the sea and damaged. He originally had an ordinary physical condition. He wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up, even if he wasn\u2019t injured.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince paused and came back. \u201cGive me your hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was confused but he couldn\u2019t provoke this mysterious prince. He had to hold out his hand.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince held him and the next moment, \u2018flew\u2019 away with him.</p><br/><p>The reason he called it flying was because this speed was too fast. The word \u2018swimming\u2019 seemed too weak and powerless!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t have to do anything but he felt pain from the water rushing towards his face. The good thing was that his ability to adapt was very powerful. If this was ordinary plastic surgery, his face would probably be deformed right now!</p><br/><p>The fourth prince looked warm and soft but he was this reckless. The third prince wasn\u2019t as good as this!</p><br/><p>They finally arrived at the destination and Xie Xi took a deep breath once they stopped.</p><br/><p>The wound on his tail had widened and the pain was killing him.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince glanced at his tail and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t mind. It was because he saw a huge garbage heap in front of him. The reason he used heap rather than mountain was that the rubbish was spread out all over the sea instead of in one pile\u2026</p><br/><p>For example, it was like a place on land were countless rotting objects and corrosive things were floating in the air. The air was even dyed a dirty grey. This shocking sight was something that the underwater people had to look at and live with.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince said, \u201cLet me see you get rid of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had long guessed the prince\u2019s intentions and was happy.</p><br/><p>He calmed down, closed his eyes and swam in. He was about to enter when the fourth prince shouted at him, \u201cWait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned to look at him. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince started to unbutton his clothes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi blinked and couldn\u2019t keep up with this person\u2019s brain circuits\u2026 what was he doing, taking off his clothes?</p><br/><p>The fourth prince took off the coat of his uniform, revealing his sexy body. Not only did it not look sickly at all, but it was also very strong from exercise. Xie Xi felt envious when he saw this sight!</p><br/><p>The half-naked fourth prince wasn\u2019t uncomfortable as he came over and wrapped his uniform around Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince was all and his clothes were long. Xie Xi\u2019s uniform had a short cut due to the curve of his tail. The prince\u2019s uniform covered a large part of him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finally understood and he said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the fourth prince swam and stuffed all of the fishtail inside the uniform.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cYour Highness, I have an injury on my tail and will just dirty your clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince swam back up with no emotional ups or downs in his cold eyes. \u201cGo ahead. If you lie to me, this will be your funeral clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he covered Xie Xi\u2019s head with the coat.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d You are so powerful, I can\u2019t afford to upset you!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi blankly swam in. Due to his previous experience, he held his breath to protect his internal organs. Even so, his hand wasn\u2019t shielded and the skin of the back festered at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t masochistic. He was afraid of pain, even if he wouldn\u2019t die. Thus, he hastened to confirm the rubbish collection.</p><br/><p>The progress bar of the side task rose to 5%.</p><br/><p>This pile of garbage was 40,000 tons. Good!</p><br/><p>He collected it so thoroughly that not only was the rubbish gone, the dirty water was also purified. It was a pity that the injuries on his body couldn\u2019t be restored.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince frowned and floated there.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked back at him. \u201cYour Highness, I haven\u2019t lied to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>This ability was really against the sky. It couldn\u2019t be explained with logic.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince didn\u2019t seem to think it was evil and took Xie Xi\u2019s hand again. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t have an opportunity to speak at all. This humanoid flying car was very fast and rushed out in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun hung onto Xie Xi\u2019s collar and was smashed by the sea water. He called out, \u201cStimulation, stimulating, this is very exciting~\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d If he wasn\u2019t afraid of revealing himself, he would really pull out this bun and spank him.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince took him to another garbage dump. Xie Xi was extremely happy that the fourth prince was helping him fill up his side task.</p><br/><p>They moved back and forth for a night and Xie Xi collected a total of 330,000 tons of garbage, making the task progress rise to 33%.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince finally stopped. He looked at the clothes on Xie Xi and said, \u201cGo back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t collected enough but he had no say and could only follow.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince entered the palace and directly took Xie Xi back to his palace.</p><br/><p>There was no one in the palace, not even a servant. The fourth prince approached and ripped off the rotten clothes.</p><br/><p>It had been so tightly wrapped that Xie Xi wasn\u2019t hurt. It was just his left hand exposed to the outside that was very miserable. After collecting so much rubbish, the back of his hand was bloody.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince frowned slightly and ordered, \u201cWait here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi floated in the palace and waited.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince soon came back and the cold aroma around his body was heavier. Xie Xi saw that he was holding a small box in his hand. Once the prince opened it, the smell of medicine emerged. This was the smell that was always around the fourth prince.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince leaned over and carefully applied medicine to Xie Xi\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>The effect of this medicine was surprisingly good. Once it was applied, Xie Xi\u2019s hand wasn\u2019t in pain anymore and the wound was slowly healing.</p><br/><p>What a good medicine!</p><br/><p>The fourth prince covered his hand before kneeling down and applying the medicine to his tail.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked down at the focused prince and felt a bit embarrassed.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince was really mysterious and hard to understand.</p><br/><p>The medicine was applied and Xie Xi was also covered by this faint aroma. He didn\u2019t know why but Xie Xi had a thought. Did the prince smell like this because he often used the medicine?</p><br/><p>Why? Was it due to the garbage in the shallow waters?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked him, \u201cWhy was Your Highness there?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince didn\u2019t answer the question. \u201cThis medicine has a side effect and you will be full of weakness. Go inside to lie down. You can go back once it is better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to speak but he felt that his body was exhausted of strength. He couldn\u2019t even maintain his upright posture.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince wasn\u2019t surprised and directly carried him into a room, settling him on a bed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t expected the side effect to be so strong. Not only was he full of weakness, he couldn\u2019t even lift a finger!</p><br/><p>The fourth prince spoke again, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, once the effect of the medicine is over, your injuries will be gone and you will return to the same state as before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled and opened his mouth, only to find that even talking was laborious.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t use this ability in the future and don\u2019t approach the garbage dumps.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought he had misheard and struggled to open his mouth. \u201cWhy?\u201d The rubbish hurt so many merpeople. Wasn\u2019t he protecting them by cleaning it up?</p><br/><p>The fourth prince\u2019s pupils shrank and his voice contained no temperature. \u201cBecause it is useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shocked.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince stared at him and explained slowly, \u201cThe garbage can be cleaned up but as long as the land people are there, new rubbish will soon be born. Your ability is really interesting but it is unfortunately uselessly. It will just make the land people blindly dump more garbage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard a bitter hatred in the last words.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince\u2019s voice became much gentler. \u201cRest, I will help you take leave from the guard\u2019s office.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up at him and found that the grey eyes were as deep as a tomb.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince left and it took a while for Xie Xi\u2019s spirit to return.</p><br/><p>He unwittingly glanced at the lower right corner.</p><br/><p>There was a new colour on the progress bar for the main task.</p><br/><p>Black\u2026</p><br/><p>8%\u2026</p><br/><p>What was going on?</p><br/><p>The only remaining person was the eldest prince. How did it suddenly appear and had also risen to 8%?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If he was embarrassed then go sleep on the floor!</p><br/><p>The prince was embarrassed and the joy in his eyes wasn\u2019t too obvious. He held Xie Xi and whispered, \u201cSleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was warm enough and it felt refreshing. Xie Xi wasn\u2019t annoyed and deliberately teased him, \u201cIs this really okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince was slightly startled and comforted him, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, no one will know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi whispered, \u201cWill you really not be seen? What if we fall asleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince told him, \u201cSaul will be watching from outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saul was Xie Xi\u2019s attendant and the third prince\u2019s lieutenant in reality. If he knew that he had such an image in his boss\u2019 dream, it was unknown if he would keep following the third prince to the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke again, \u201cI haven\u2019t slept well these days and he has been accompanying me. What if he can\u2019t endure?\u201d The implication was that Saul might also fall asleep.</p><br/><p>The third prince comforted him. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I won\u2019t fall asleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up at him. \u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t slept well for so many days. I will stay up and keep watch for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi whispered, \u201cIt will be hard for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Probably not. The third prince since, \u201cI will do anything for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was satisfied.</p><br/><p>Then he reacted again. What did it matter if Gars stayed awake all night? This was his dream. What was the difference between sleeping and not sleeping? The trick didn\u2019t work at all!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought that he was an adult. Why should he care about a child-like man\u2019s dream?</p><br/><p>The third prince didn\u2019t do anything else. He just carefully held Xie Xi and coaxed him to sleep.</p><br/><p>It could be seen that the third prince was very pure. His sweetheart was in his arms yet he was polite and didn\u2019t do anything. It was good that he didn\u2019t do anything to annoy Xie Xi. Jiang Xie relied on the third prince\u2019s foolishness to increase goodwill to -233. He didn\u2019t want it to plummet to -999.</p><br/><p>The next day arrived in the blink of an eye and Xie Xi saw the third prince\u2019s dark circles.</p><br/><p>It had clearly been one second yet the third prince drew his own panda eyes. His dedication in the dream was truly admirable.</p><br/><p>The third prince asked him, \u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t dream and slept very well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there anything else that isn\u2019t comfortable?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know if he wanted Xie Xi to be comfortable or not and could only say ambiguous words, \u201cMuch better.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince sighed with relief. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><br/><p>He got up and his brow furrowed as soon as he moved.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood. \u201cAre your legs numb?\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince shook his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>His legs were still motionless. It was like they were broken instead of numb!</p><br/><p>What was this? Xie Xi made a guess. \u201cShall I massage them for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince hurriedly said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll be okay in a minute.\u201d Meanwhile, the \u2018broken\u2019 leg silently moved towards Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Couldn\u2019t you say it straight out? Why beat around the bush in the dream?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cLast night you were afraid to wake me up so you didn\u2019t move. It must\u2019ve been very tiring? I\u2019ve had a numb leg before. It would be better to massage them.\u201d</p><br/><p>He reached out and touched the leg as he talked.</p><br/><p>The third prince told him, \u201cYour Highness doesn\u2019t need to bother with such a little thing.\u201d Yet his leg was moving over again.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t want it then don\u2019t come over here!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi muffled his smile and carefully helped promote blood flow.</p><br/><p>A numb leg was being pressed. This sensation might cause an average person to cry out.</p><br/><p>The third prince was a tough person, although he might be pretending and his leg wasn\u2019t numb at all. In any case, he didn\u2019t make a sound and acted like this was a prosthetic leg.</p><br/><p>His legs were long and strong, especially the calf. The texture was also clear and it was very hard. Xie Xi\u2019s hands were sore as he pressed against it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d Xie Xi asked him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no need to press it anymore. I can get out of bed.\u201d He moved his leg and tried to get out of bed, only to suck in his breath and start sweating.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Brother, this wasn\u2019t a numb leg, it was a broken leg!</p><br/><p>The third prince failed his \u2018attempt\u2019 and lamented, \u201cYour Highness, just ignore me. It will be fine after a minute.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Xie Xi not understand? The prince just wanted a leg massage.</p><br/><p>Fine. Xie Xi saw the task progress rising to 16% and decided to keep massaging it for him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi bowed his head and pressed hard against the leg with great difficulty.</p><br/><p>The third prince\u2019s pants were quite slippery and Xie Xi wasn\u2019t used to it. He didn\u2019t think much as he said, \u201cI will help you pull up your pants. It is too slippery.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince\u2019s pupils shrank and his eyes turned red.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pulled up the pant leg and placed his slightly cold hands on the calf\u2026</p><br/><p>The \u2018broken-legged\u2019 third prince jumped up, miraculously healed!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince got out of bed with his numb leg unable to be seen at all. He cried out, \u201cI am fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi blinked in confusion, \u201cAre you really fine?\u201d Wasn\u2019t there cold sweat on the prince\u2019s forehead? Xie Xi just wanted to give a good massage. How did the prince run away?</p><br/><p>The third prince told him, \u201cI, I will go wash. Your Highness should change clothes first!\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned and left to throw water on his face, the image from before still filling his mind.</p><br/><p>Colin sitting beside him with a white neck, focused eyes and slender fingers\u2026 Gars was afraid that the slender fingers would melt like soft tofu when touching his rough legs.</p><br/><p>This thought caused Gars head to become hot and he wanted to pour a bucket of water on his head!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had no idea what the third prince was smoking but he finally got up with sore fingers.</p><br/><p>He changed his clothes and met the third prince, who said calmly, \u201cYour Highness, I will go back first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave breakfast before you go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince muttered, \u201cIf someone comes over\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t opened his mouth when the attendant spoke, \u201cMr. Gars, His Highness is in better spirits and you should accompany him to eat breakfast. What if he doesn\u2019t eat again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xie could originally eat at least three crescent fruits but after hearing the attendant\u2019s words, he couldn\u2019t eat half.</p><br/><p>The third prince started to struggle again.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could only say, \u201cNo one will come at breakfast. Eat before leaving.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it is Your Highness\u2019 wish, I won\u2019t refuse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought, \u2018How is it my wish? In your dream, am I qualified to have a wish?\u2019</p><br/><p>Breakfast finished and the third prince finally left. Before he did, he urged Xie Xi, \u201cYour Highness, please be sure to eat and sleep well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded while thinking that it wouldn\u2019t be this simple.</p><br/><p>As he thought this, the third prince said again, \u201cYour Highness, you should pay attention these days. I\u2019m always worried that the dragon won\u2019t let you go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI won\u2019t leave the palace and the dragon won\u2019t dare to break in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince was worried. \u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><br/><p>The prince was reluctant to leave and glanced at Xie Xi several more times.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t on the same wavelength as him and wasn\u2019t sure what he wanted.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, there was the attendant who understood this person. \u201cMr. Gars, if you have time, please be sure to sneak in and see His Highness. His Highness is shy and can\u2019t say it but after you leave, he will be sad again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He wasn\u2019t shy and really couldn\u2019t say this!</p><br/><p>The third prince heard what he wanted to hear and whispered to Xie Xi, \u201cYour Highness, rest assured that I will find a way to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was afraid he would break the act as soon as he opened his mouth and barely maintained an awkward and polite smile.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the third prince couldn\u2019t tell it was a fake smile. He felt sweet in his heart and very great\u2026</p><br/><p>The third prince left and time passed quickly for Xie Xi. In the blink of an eye, it was noon.</p><br/><p>The attendant urged him, \u201cYour Highness, it is time to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had just finished breakfast and now he had to eat again.</p><br/><p>The attendant sighed. \u201cSure enough, you don\u2019t want to eat after Mr. Gars left.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He guessed that such a sentence would emerge.</p><br/><p>The attendant said, \u201cYou don\u2019t cherish yourself. If Mr. Gars knows this, he will feel bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke sincerely, \u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d He really wasn\u2019t hungry.</p><br/><p>The attendant complained, \u201cYou are so infatuated that the gods must be touched. Fortunately, Mr. Gars feels the same way as you. The two of you are really\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He started to monologue again. Xie Xi started to suspect that the third prince had seen too much Shakespeare!</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you don\u2019t want to eat, go to the garden and relax.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t refuse. The dream hadn\u2019t ended yet and there was likely to be more things.</p><br/><p>He went to the garden and had just sat in the small pavilion when the sharp-eyed attendant called out, \u201cYour Highness, it is Mr. Gars!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was somewhat puzzled. Wasn\u2019t this too soon? He was already back?</p><br/><p>The attendant told him, \u201cMr. Gars is definitely worried about you and came back to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi followed him while thinking about what the third prince wanted to do this time.</p><br/><p>He had just approached and hadn\u2019t spoken yet when the \u2018Gars\u2019 in front of him smiled and whispered, \u201cNo one can save you this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This voice was the second prince and this evil charm was the same, causing him to have a toothache.</p><br/><p>\u2018Third Prince, your brain is too broken! This is your brother, your brother!\u2019</p><br/><p>The attendant shouted, \u201cAh, it is the dragon! The dragon broke into the palace disguised as Mr. Gars!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was caught by the dragon who flew up.</p><br/><p>In Gars absence, the soldiers of the palace were like rotten cabbages.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was blown by the wind again and unexpectedly missed the underwater world.</p><br/><p>The third prince didn\u2019t know much about the land and was ignorant about the wind. Therefore, the land world in this dream was very high. There was no wind on the land and there was a huge wind in the air. Third Prince, what was this misunderstanding about the land?</p><br/><p>The dragon indiscriminately bombarded the royal palace and then arrogantly took Xie Xi away.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was uncomfortable because of the wind and passed out in the third prince\u2019s dream.</p><br/><p>He woke up in a dark cave. It was a dark and damp place with a large pile of gold in front of him.</p><br/><p>Well, he was taken away by a dragon\u2026</p><br/><p>The third prince was addicted to being a hero and saving him once wasn\u2019t enough.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi got up and saw the second prince sitting on a pile of gold and silver.</p><br/><p>The second prince had become a \u2018living image\u2019 and his laughing appearance was generally the same as reality.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could understand this.</p><br/><p>In the eyes of the third prince, his older brother was a dragon who monopolized a huge amount of wealth!</p><br/><p>The second prince said, \u201cI have already sent a letter to your father. If he wants to save you then he must give all the gold and silver in the palace to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood. This was a kidnapping.</p><br/><p>He was too lazy to care about this fake dragon and just waited for the third prince to save him.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, this fake dragon still had a lot of drama. The second prince told him, \u201cStay away from my gold. If you touch it, I will cut off your hand!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Psychopath.</p><br/><p>After a while, the second prince added, \u201cThe jewels on your body are mine as well.\u201d Then he took away Xie Xi\u2019s belt buttons and even a small piece of gold on his shoes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Psychopath!!</p><br/><p>More time passed before the second prince threw him two crescent fruits. \u201cYou can only eat this. If you don\u2019t eat then you will go hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at the two crescent fruits and understood.</p><br/><p>It was no wonder why the second prince had so many lines\u2026 the third prince didn\u2019t forget to blacken his own brother in the dream!</p><br/><p>A miser, always calculating costs, haggler and only let others eat crescent fruits\u2026</p><br/><p>Well, this was truly the second prince in the eyes of the third prince.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

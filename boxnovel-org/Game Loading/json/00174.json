Jiang Xie, these thoughts were very dangerous.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if the universe collapses and civilization dies?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Li Su spoke softly through the communicated, \u201cMr. President, should I send up the tea?\u201d</p><br/><p>The atmosphere did need to be eased so Xie Xi nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie gave a low laugh. Xie Xi looked at him and didn\u2019t understand why he was laughing. Jiang Xie explained, \u201cIf you nod here, can Li Su see it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He always felt this soul was difficult to tangle with and Xie Xi had the illusion that everything was seen through by this person.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stood in front of this person and was full of tension.</p><br/><p>In Central, Jiang Xie\u2019s age and experience were far beyond Xie Xi but he controlled it and never gave Xie Xi a sense of distance. Now the Jiang Xie in front of him deliberately didn\u2019t control it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cWhat would you like to drink?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlack tea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi quickly remembered that he seemed to be drinking black tea frequently. The entire presidential palace habitually prepared black tea for him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi himself had no special preference regarding tears. Then did this world set it up so he liked black tea? Was it related to the former president?</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t blame Xie Xi for thinking this. He had seen so much in the past that his brain could make up the routine.</p><br/><p>Weren\u2019t they a couple before? The rational Xie Xi couldn\u2019t understand love so Jiang Xie left?</p><br/><p>Well\u2026 Xie Xi always felt like this was very characteristic of the souls.</p><br/><p>Secretary Li personally came over with two cups of black tea and some snacks. He was a very sharp person. After all, he became the president\u2019s secretary at a young age and his future wasn\u2019t limited.</p><br/><p>At this time, Secretary Li was cautious as he put down the refreshments and spoke softly, \u201cMr. President, Mr. Jiang, please enjoy the tea and tell me if you need anything else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that Xie Xi saw a thin layer of sweat on Secretary Li\u2019s forehead. As for this! Xie Xi felt that his secretary was worthless.</p><br/><p>Li Su glanced at Xie Xi and Xie Xi ordered, \u201cGo back first and don\u2019t wait for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Secretary Li was stunned. He secretly glanced at Jiang Xie before suddenly looking away. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>He reacted like this and Xie Xi was puzzled. What was he suddenly thinking about?</p><br/><p>Li Su left and Jiang Xie sipped the black tea, sighing, \u201cThe black tea of the Capital Star tastes good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pressed sharply. \u201cThen come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned back and stared at him without a word.</p><br/><p>The topic seemed to be coming back to the main point and Xie Xi spoke, \u201cNow is the most dangerous time. The universe is collapsing and all civilizations will be destroyed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was as cold as always. \u201cIf the old doesn\u2019t leave then the new won\u2019t come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a disaster of extinction. It doesn\u2019t matter if the world is destroyed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is just the destruction of the universe. What does it have to do with the world?\u201d</p><br/><p>His question made Xie Xi freeze. Jiang Xie saw Xie Xi\u2019s stunned look and sighed, his voice becoming gentler. \u201cThink about it. What are you protecting?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied quickly, \u201cThe entire United States.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked, \u201cDo you love him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Due to the language, Xie Xi understood that it was \u2018him\u2019 rather than \u2018it.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, as president of the United States, I love all citizens and this country.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie shook his head. \u201cThat is just responsibility.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi exclaimed, \u201cResponsibility isn\u2019t love!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was silent as he stared at Xie Xi without blinking. After a long time, he smiled but it was cold and helpless. \u201cSure enough, it shouldn\u2019t be forced.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s expression faded away and the black tea remained untouched. He got up and declared, \u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Xie Xi let this person go? He hurriedly asked, \u201cWhy do you say that I don\u2019t understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie took his hand and whispered, \u201cThen do you love me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shocked by the words and didn\u2019t know how to answer. Was it too hasty to say that he loved this person? If he didn\u2019t love Jiang Xie\u2026 would he not see Jiang Xie until the universe was destroyed?</p><br/><p>What was the question of love or not love? It was a matter of death!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gritted his teeth. \u201cI am also rational, do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie gazed straight into his eyes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi started sweating from the oppressive feeling and raised his head. \u201cIf you understand then\u2026 can\u2019t you teach me?\u201d</p><br/><p>This should be insurance, right? At the very least, he could keep this person behind.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wondered, \u201cYou want to learn?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought he finally touched the right method and exclaimed, \u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpected, Jiang Xie\u2019s voice didn\u2019t contain any ups and downs. \u201cYou still won\u2019t learn.\u201d</p><br/><p>The confused Xie Xi asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stated calmly, \u201cI have already taught you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d This broken person.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie added, \u201cThus, stop learning. I don\u2019t want others to teach you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was really suffering. He actually had \u2018learnt\u2019! Not only did he understand love, he had been with the person for more than 60 years!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at the man and took a few steps forward, pulling at his sleeve. \u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was slightly startled and glanced at the hand.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suppressed the desire to pull back his hand and declared seriously, \u201cTomorrow\u2026 let\u2019s go on a date.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie slowly looked at him. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t let this person go. \u201cIf I don\u2019t understand and words can\u2019t explain it, why don\u2019t we try it for one day?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was obstinate. \u201cI will be waiting for you here tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes slightly narrowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou might not come but I will definitely wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s grey eyes were cold. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand feelings but you are very familiar with taking advantage of them.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d What damn taking advantage?! He clearly loved this person!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie left and Xie Xi sat on the sofa, only to discover that his back was covered in sweat.</p><br/><p>The pressure was truly amazing. The \u2018dead-hearted\u2019 Jiang Xie was so strange that Xie Xi was shocked.</p><br/><p>The next day, Xie Xi naturally waited here early. He was filled with a lot of tension and was afraid that Jiang Xie wouldn\u2019t come. Fortunately\u2026 no matter how cold his head, Jiang Xie was still Jiang Xie. He arrived at 9 \u2018clock.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stood up and Jiang Xie told him, \u201cToday, I will do whatever you want me to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was relieved. \u201cI\u2019ll prove it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie raised his eyelids to look at the other person. \u201cListen clearly. I am talking about what you want me to do, including going to the pole.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned and interrupted him. \u201cI\u2019m here to go on a date with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at him. \u201cI\u2019ll only give you one chance. If you want to do the president\u2019s duty, I can help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stubborn. \u201cI just want to date you today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie gazed at him silently. Xie Xi wasn\u2019t afraid to save the world or anything\u2026 the premise was to \u2018save\u2019 the soul. The collapsed god hadn\u2019t been found but the collapsed souls couldn\u2019t be left alone!</p><br/><p>After a long time, Jiang Xie replied, \u201cThen I\u2019ll listen to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was relieved. \u201cI booked some movie tickets. Shall we go to the cinema?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie seemed to laugh but his voice was miraculously gentle. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a single word but it because beautiful because of the seemingly helpless laugh, as if countless emotions were crowded together and the word was too small to fit all of them.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart trembled and he didn\u2019t dare look at this person.</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s itinerary had been carefully planned. Xie Xi even ordered a bestseller which he read overnight and had a full strategy.</p><br/><p>Under normal circumstances, Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t need a love book to guide him. In the 60 years, he went on several dates with Jiang Xie. Most of them were led by Jiang Xie but Xie Xi also had experience.</p><br/><p>The reason why he bought the book was because he didn\u2019t know the background of this high-tech society. He was afraid he wouldn\u2019t understand the market and would be a joke.</p><br/><p>For example, the first major event of dating in the Earth age was watching movies. It might be different in this high-tech society.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, after reading the dating guide, Xie Xi found that cinemas were still present. They just had a holographic mode and the virtual experience was more exciting and fun.</p><br/><p>The guide book was very reliable and even recommended a corresponding movie.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had no experience in this area and directly selected the safest love movie. The book said: In this lifetime, if you find someone you like then you must take them to see this movie.</p><br/><p>There was such high praise that Xie Xi hurriedly booked the tickets.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had never seen a holographic movie and although he was prepared, he was still a bit tense when it officially began.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie perceived this and his eyes slightly darkened, but he didn\u2019t say \u2018there is no need to force it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s attention was quickly attracted by this unique viewing experience.</p><br/><p>The movie was very beautiful. The protagonists were a ration and an emotional disguised as a rational.</p><br/><p>The rational person was very young. He was a young general in military attire and had high spirits.</p><br/><p>The emotional pretending to be a rational was his boss, who took great care of him.</p><br/><p>Later, the rational became a mature adult and wanted a partner. His emotional boss pretending to be a rational asked him, \u201cDo you want an emotional person?\u201d</p><br/><p>The rational person shook his head. \u201cEmotional people are too much trouble. Rational is simpler.\u201d</p><br/><p>The emotional person smiled. \u201cYour purpose of finding a partner is to resolve your physiological needs?\u201d</p><br/><p>The rational took it for granted. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s be together.\u201d</p><br/><p>The rational was surprised. \u201cYou are my boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>The emotional asked, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m old?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can that be? Just\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The emotional disguised as a rational spoke lightly. \u201cRest assured, I won\u2019t be troublesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t think there would be so many bed scenes in this movie. He turned red when he saw it. The holographic effect was really\u2026 um\u2026 too exciting.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie by his side was as calm and stable as an old monk. He wasn\u2019t affected by the movie at all.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t believe it. This was the big demon who said, \u201cWe can do it 70 times a night in the Antarctic!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Jiang Xie cocked his head. \u201cDo you need any help?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s gaze moved down and his tone was flat. \u201cCome here, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sharply exclaimed, \u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>This type of cinema was private and only the two of them were watching the movie. It was normal to do this type of thing but\u2026 through the mottled light and shadows, Xie Xi saw Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes. They were no feelings of desire in them, only coldness and alienation.</p><br/><p>After seeing this movie, Xie Xi had some suspicions. Was he like the rational person in the movie and only saw X as a tool to relieve desire?</p><br/><p>The movie was playing the first contradiction between the protagonists.</p><br/><p>The simple catharsis couldn\u2019t be maintained for long. After the freshness was over, the rational person got tired. However, his partner\u2019s status was too high and he didn\u2019t mention breaking up. He just tried to drag out matters.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that his partner was an emotional disguised as a rational and soon noticed it.</p><br/><p>Seeing up to here, Jiang Xie frowned and his eyes seemed colder. \u201cIf you don\u2019t need relief then forget it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood this person and guessed what he was thinking. Then Xie Xi whispered, \u201cIt is just venting desires, not love.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s pupils shrunk but he didn\u2019t reveal anything on the surface. \u201cWatch the movie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was curious about the development and continued to watch. He might be able to find out more clues from it.</p><br/><p>In the movie, the emotional mentioned the breakup first and the rational was obviously relieved.</p><br/><p>The emotional told him, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry. Your future won\u2019t be affected by our breakup.\u201d</p><br/><p>The rational smiled in a heartless manner. \u201cAh, rational should really be with other rational.\u201d</p><br/><p>The emotional person\u2019s complexion was pale but his eyes were filled with flames. \u201cYou will find another rational?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><br/><p>The emotional asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>The rational replied, \u201cHow to say it? For a rational person, working hard is enough.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Every time, I would slash you with a thousand knives!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was pale. Something seemed to be extinguished from his eyes as his voice lowered. \u201cOnce I am dead, you won\u2019t have such dreams again.\u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence seemed to empty all his strength and his weak appearance evoked an old memory in Jiang Xie. He recalled the humble cave and the weak man who smiled so tenderly.</p><br/><p>A sharp sting covered his entire heart and Jiang Xie turned away.</p><br/><p>He came suddenly and stopped even more suddenly.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi fell to the ground, the chain hitting the ground and the clear sound ringing in the entire dungeon.</p><br/><p>The dazed Jiang Xie actually thought this was the cave and Xie Xi had accidentally dropped a bowl.</p><br/><p>It seemed that if he turned back, he could see the beautiful black eyes full of love, as if he was the only one in the world.</p><br/><p>Fake, all fake!</p><br/><p>He was bewitched by those eyes!</p><br/><p>Anger swallowed up his sense of reason. By the time his senses returned, he found that he had broken the chains binding Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up at him blankly. \u201cLittle Xie?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie looked into the black eyes that were like a summer night, bringing infinite coolness and comfort to people on a hot day.</p><br/><p>This person used these eyes to keep saying, \u2018Jiang Xie, I love you.\u2019</p><br/><p>How ridiculous. To this day, his heart was still beating for his hypocritical man.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled with cold eyes. He grabbed Xie Xi\u2019s chin and asked, \u201cBeast King Rose, do you only seduce men?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened and his eyes dimmed, becoming grey.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie kissed him in revenge. It was rough and imperious, with no gentleness.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi started to struggle, desperately trying to push him away.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie placed him against a wall and spoke viciously, \u201cDo you believe that I am here for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was motionless. His entire body looked frightened and he was as pale as a dead man who stopped breathing. \u201cLittle Jiang\u2026 kill me\u2026 kill me, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart was dripping blood. It was absurd that looking at this person\u2019s current appearance, he felt more pain then when this person tried to kill him.</p><br/><p>This man being in pain was worse than the despair of betrayal.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie hated himself after realizing he was so mean and weak.</p><br/><p>He hated Xie Xi nad hated his incompetent self even more. He opened his mouth and spoke with no expression \u201cIt is just a kiss yet you want to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s expression became even uglier.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cIs it shameful? Do you feel really bad? I want you to taste what I tasted!\u201d</p><br/><p>He picked up Xie Xi and took him out of the dungeon.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s body was shaking but his heart thought\u2026 he could finally eat and drink!</p><br/><p>He was very steady throughout the whole process and every expression was controlled.</p><br/><p>The little lion could work hard. Once the \u2018truth\u2019 was exposed, this would be his crematorium!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie took him out of the dungeon and all the guards were stunned. They wanted to come up to him and speak but the lion king\u2019s pressure meant not one of them could move.</p><br/><p>There was a personal servant outside the dungeon and the servant was also shocked by the sight.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie ordered in a low voice, \u201cGo and prepare the bath.\u201d</p><br/><p>The servant didn\u2019t dare to ask and could only bow his head. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to have a bath. He might have the cleaning ball to keep himself clean but it was comfortable to soak in a hot bath.</p><br/><p>His heart was beautiful but his face was still nervous. He asked Jiang Xie in a trembling voice, \u201cWhat are you going to do\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie took him back to the palace. Before placing Xie Xi in the bath, he grabbed a bottle of medicine and opened Xie Xi\u2019s mouth to pour it in.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shocked but couldn\u2019t break free at all.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was extremely fierce but there wasn\u2019t much force in his hand. Half the medicine spilled out of the bottle.</p><br/><p>However, a few drops of this medicine was enough to make Xie Xi exhausted.</p><br/><p>After taking the medicine, Jiang Xie carried him to the bath. He was expressionless as he tore off Xie Xi\u2019s clothes and threw him into the water.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had no strength. His back was facing Jiang Xie and his black hair scattered. It was stained with water and became darker, the contrast very sharp.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie entered the water and kissed Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t move at all. In addition, the position was narrow and there wasn\u2019t room to move.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t say anything but under the water\u2026</p><br/><p>He did the things like in the dream but Jiang Xie didn\u2019t feel the slightest bit of happiness.</p><br/><p>Great sorrow and despair captured him. He retaliated and got revenge but his heart seemed to be placed on a cutting board and was cut to pieces.</p><br/><p>In the past nine years, Jiang Xie had countless dreams related to Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>The dreams had nothing to do with the Rose Palace. They were in the cave, the village, the endless wilderness\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi occasionally slept under the sun and occasionally held the tree trunk while waiting for him to collect the honey. Sometimes in the village, he would look over as if he noticed Jiang Xie\u2019s gaze. Then Xie Xi would give a smile that only belonged to Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie felt that he wasn\u2019t tempted by those dreams, it was the smile.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had observed that Xie Xi never looked at others with such a gaze and never gaze such a smile to others.</p><br/><p>This was his own, a gentleness that Xie Xi only gave him.</p><br/><p>It was full of endless indulgence and bone-deep love.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was captured by this love and indulged in Xie Xi\u2019s deep feelings.</p><br/><p>However\u2026 this love was fake.</p><br/><p>Every time he woke up, Jiang Xie thought of Xie Xi\u2019s last cold expression and his cruel words. \u201cSince you know this, I can\u2019t let you go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to kill him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was going to kill him\u2026</p><br/><p>His Xie Xi was going to kill him\u2026</p><br/><p>The despair that rose at that moment was more unbearable than the death of his family.</p><br/><p>For his family, Jiang Xie\u2019s memories were limited to his father and his sister. He had no impression of the others.</p><br/><p>He was only one month old and his mother died giving birth to him. What could he remember?\u2019</p><br/><p>There were only the fire and the screams for fear. His desire for revenge was bred from his desire for survival.</p><br/><p>Living was to get revenge.</p><br/><p>He fled the Lion Country and met Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>This was the real beginning of his life. Xie Xi was the person who gave him life.</p><br/><p>Yet the person who recognized his existence wanted to wipe him out.</p><br/><p>Leo didn\u2019t shed any tears but his chest was always cold.</p><br/><p>In the end, Xie Xi fell asleep.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s strength collapsed. He clung to Xie Xi as if he wanted to be embedded in the body. \u201cWhy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Why\u2026</p><br/><p>If time could be reversed, he wanted to stay in that small village forever and indulge in the unreal dream.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi actually experienced what it meant to be unable to get out of bed.</p><br/><p>Cough\u2026</p><br/><p>In fact, it was quite fun.</p><br/><p>In any case, Jiang Xie didn\u2019t dare to be really rough. Xie Xi pretended to faint and this guy held him with a tearful expression.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for Xie Xi being afraid to wake up then he would be roaring with laughter.</p><br/><p>A few days later, Xie Xi wasn\u2019t afraid of the lion king dying. He was afraid that there would be holes in his heart and lungs.</p><br/><p>It was estimated that the fire was almost out and Xie Xi manipulated the robot.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t allow anyone to get close to this section of the palace. He drove out all the servants and looked after Xie Xi alone.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was similar to a plaything used to release energy. In any case, he couldn\u2019t use the strength in his body and had to \u2018stay in bed\u2019, making him weaker.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t show a good face to him and spoke words that were hard to hear, but his behaviour was extremely gentle and he didn\u2019t allow Xie Xi to feel any discomfort.</p><br/><p>At first, Xie Xi asked Jiang Xie what he waned.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was expressionless. \u201cTo torture you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stopped asking.</p><br/><p>In some ways, the high frequency of sex was quite torturous.</p><br/><p>The robot came to his place under the risk of death.</p><br/><p>The guards naturally didn\u2019t dare to stop him. He was the saviour of the lion king and the teacher respected by the lion king.</p><br/><p>At this time, Jiang Xie was looking at a memorial to the throne (TL: an official communication to the emperor of China, generally careful essays in classical Chinese). Xie Xi slept on the soft couch beside him where Jiang Xie could see him. His explanation for himself was that he was afraid of Xie Xi\u2019s tricks. As far as his heart was concerned\u2026 in any case, Xie Xi understood.</p><br/><p>The robot fell to the ground. \u201cYour Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie put down the memorial with a cold expression. \u201cTeacher, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty should be careful. Beast King Rose\u2019s name might be ruined but he was once the god of war. You should behead him but actually humiliating him like this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie read all the things in the memorial and threw it down. He got out and exclaimed, \u201cThis is my lone feud and how I handle him is up to me alone! You can\u2019t talk about him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you took him out of the dungeon and placed him in your bedroom. This is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was angry. \u201cIf Teacher only wants to talk about this then please leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>The robot lay on the ground. \u201cYour Majesty, you are getting married soon, but with a man like this\u2026 it will hurt the nation\u2019s luck!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi woke up just to hear this sentence and he cast a shocked look at Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie felt it but couldn\u2019t turn his head.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi whispered, \u201cYou are going to be married?\u201d</p><br/><p>The room was so quiet that the sound of breathing was clear and audible.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie turned to look at him. \u201cWhy? DO you think that I still remember you and refused to get married?\u201d</p><br/><p>The colour that Xie Xi gained over the past few days disappeared. \u201cNo\u2026I\u2026 I\u2019m happy for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart became a ball as he sneered. \u201cYou aren\u2019t qualified to be happy for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi lowered his eyes, his hands tightly holding onto the bed.</p><br/><p>The robot spoke again, \u201cYour Majesty, the rolls of names contains the daughters of important ministers. You can\u2019t be so cold to their hearts!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was unable to restrain his anger. \u201cThese matters, there is no need for you to criticize or give orders!\u201d</p><br/><p>The robot didn\u2019t say anything. He inexplicably looked up at Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi lowered his eyes.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was aware of it and a strange feeling entered his heart. Even so, he didn\u2019t think too much. He only thought that the teacher wanted to kill Xie Xi in his heart.</p><br/><p>That night, Jiang Xie didn\u2019t do anything with Xie Xi and Xie Xi sat on the bed in a daze.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie gazed at this person and felt that he was suffocating. He knew he should kill Xie Xi and that he shouldn\u2019t be so ridiculous.</p><br/><p>However, if reason could kill emotions then there wouldn\u2019t be so many helpless things in life!</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t stay here any longer. He left the room and stood under the moonlight.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie knew that Xie Xi couldn\u2019t run. Xie Xi\u2019s hands and feet were in a powerless state and he couldn\u2019t escape over the palace walls.</p><br/><p>Just then, a dark shadow flashed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s sharp senses instantly discovered it.</p><br/><p>He quickly rushed back to the palace and discovered a man in black kneeling in front of Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>The man in black whispered, \u201cYour Majesty, please go back with this old slave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t say anything but Jiang Xie was already furious. He immediately shot at the man.</p><br/><p>Fine! Xie Xi had a back hand and really wanted to escape!</p><br/><p>After several rounds of confrontation with the man in black, Jiang Xie felt a strong sense of familiarity.</p><br/><p>He tore off the masked man\u2019s disguise.</p><br/><p>Once the old face appeared, Jiang Xie was stunned. \u201cTeacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>How could this be?</p><br/><p>This man rescued him from the Beast Forest and taught him martial arts. He was the teacher of the lion king? How could he be Xie Xi\u2019s person?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had been paving the way for so long for this trick.</p><br/><p>The robot fell to the ground and kowtowed three times with his head bumping against the ground. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Your Majesties, this old slave isn\u2019t good, I can only\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that he was going to commit suicide, Jiang Xie aimed at his weapon with a short knife.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s brain was in chaos as he approached and asked forcefully, \u201cTell me, what the hell is going on?!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

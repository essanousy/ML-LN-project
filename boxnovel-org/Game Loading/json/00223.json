He only wanted to stimulate Taurus. He didn\u2019t expect to stimulate Jiang Xie to emerge!</p><br/><p>There were two conditions for triggering the white space. One was Xie Xi suffering from a fatal mental condition or Jiang Xie feeling that Xie Xi had a tendency to self destruct.</p><br/><p>This time it was because of the latter.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie and Taurus were in a state of fusion so Taurus\u2019 emotions were Jiang Xie\u2019s emotions. The white space couldn\u2019t distinguish between the main person and the soul piece. It only felt Jiang Xie\u2019s huge fear and anxiety. It decided that Xie Xi had the tendency to self destruct and started it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained and Xie Xi felt chagrin and anxious. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect\u2026\u201d He knew Jiang Xie\u2019s heart knot wouldn\u2019t open without pretending to be tired of the world but he didn\u2019t expect this person to become half dead!</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t forget Jiang Xie\u2019s miserable appearance the last time the white space was opened.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. If I can recover 12 souls in one breath then I won\u2019t need Ah Zhe.\u201d</p><br/><p>His credibility in this area was already -999 and Xie Xi didn\u2019t believe him. \u201cThis white space can only be triggered once in a quasi-world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie looked up at the sky.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was made. \u201cCan\u2019t you cherish yourself?\u201d If it was triggered many times, Jiang Xie wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand it even if he recovered 120 souls!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie hugged hi and coaxed, \u201cI cherish myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoing all these dangerous things, can you call this cherishing yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s voice was soft. \u201cWhat should I do if you are in danger?\u201d</p><br/><p>The white space was triggered. Jiang Xie might be in danger but if it wasn\u2019t triggered and Xie Xi had an accident, there wouldn\u2019t be any significance in Jiang Xie\u2019s life.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart trembled and his anger disappeared, leaving only softness and pain. He turned and hugged the other person. \u201cIf you are in danger, how can I live alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was euphemistically but Xie Xi directly stated it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was afraid Xie Xi would have an accident and didn\u2019t hesitate to open the white space.</p><br/><p>Yet if Jiang Xie was in danger and left Xie Xi alone, Xie Xi didn\u2019t know how he would continue to live.</p><br/><p>In his lone life, what was the meaning of existence if he didn\u2019t have this person?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart shook and it was sunny and bright, like the dark clouds in the sky had been blown away. His lips curved in a smile. \u201cI was thinking wrongly. I will protect myself in the future.\u201d He would protect himself to protect Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>The mistake caused Xie Xi to finally untie Jiang Xie\u2019s heart lock.</p><br/><p>The timid lock on Jiang Xie\u2019s heart was undone and he understood how to cherish himself.</p><br/><p>They were now two people. No matter who was lost, it would be fatal to the other person.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie loved Xie Xi, thus he had to love the Jiang Xie that Xie Xi loved.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw there wasn\u2019t much time left and didn\u2019t want to see Jiang Xie in the white space again. He organized his emotions and communicated regarding the quasi-world.</p><br/><p>He asked, \u201cIs the small world of Aries your past?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cIt has been so long that I don\u2019t remember my past clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was surprised. \u201cIt is like this\u2026\u201d The memories had indeed occurred too long ago and Jiang Xie had gone through too many words. It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say he had gone through a few lives.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie said, \u201cStill, it was quite similar. My parents died early and I was rejected due to these strange eyes\u2026\u201d Then he laughed again. \u201cMy luck, as you know, has always been bad.\u201d He was unlucky whether or not he went to Central. It was only after he met Xie Xi that he was freed from it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is nothing good or bad about luck.\u201d It wasn\u2019t bad for Xie Xi to meet such a strong Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t want him to worry and distracted him by changing the topic. \u201cI did have a sister called Jiang Hong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThen the Taurus small world is also your past?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie rubbed the tip of his nose. \u201cNot at all. I didn\u2019t meet you when I was 17 years old.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was slightly itchy due to Jiang Xie\u2019s actions but he was afraid that there wasn\u2019t enough time. He continued speaking, \u201cThen Jiang Hong in reality\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Hong\u2019s voice was soft. \u201cShe died of illness when I was 15 years old.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was tugged.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cI can\u2019t remember the details. My sister didn\u2019t suffer any blows at the time. She was just sick and couldn\u2019t stand the endless pain. She begged for euthanasia.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t imagine how the 15 year old Jiang Xie faced those times.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie said, \u201cThese small worlds are mixed with some of my memories. It is normal. My designs of the quasi-worlds are filled with my emotions and I placed my souls in them. This is to inadvertently satisfy my unfulfilled wishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>For example, to let his sister live.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart hurt as he questioned, \u201cWhen did you enter the Central Government?\u201d</p><br/><p>Those who went to Central were people who had been abandoned by their original world and gave up on their original world. The 15 year old Jiang Xie had no close relatives. Did he\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cI really can\u2019t remember but it should be very early. Look at my young and handsome face. It is the original goods and there is no reprocessing.\u201d There were drugs for rejuvenation in Central. If those who came to the Central were too old, they could save themselves and rejuvenate themselves by doing tasks.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This person didn\u2019t forget to be shameless!</p><br/><p>The time was coming near and the two people had communicated almost everything.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t want Xie Xi to frown and teased him, \u201cI have a cat specialized essence. Once we return to Central, I\u2019ll send it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke seriously, \u201cYou should also choose a specialized essence. It will increase all qualifications by a certain percentage. The cat essence might only be purple grade but it can be stacked. You can take it first and later there is the gold\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished his words when Xie Xi exclaimed, \u201cRoll!\u201d</p><br/><p>Was there anything he didn\u2019t understand? This person had the memories from the Aries world and was planning something naughty. Forget the cat essence. Xie Xi wanted a lion essence to bite this bastard to death.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie \u2018rolled over\u2019 and gave Xie Xi a lingering kiss.</p><br/><p>The two men left the white space while kissing.</p><br/><p>Back in reality, Xie Xi silently opened his eyes and saw Taurus sleeping beside him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled, closed his eyes, found a comfortable position and fell asleep. There were no dreams and when he woke up, the sky wasn\u2019t bright yet.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi rubbed his eyes and heard Jiang Xie\u2019s voice. \u201cWake up, I\u2019m taking you to a place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d He was in a daze and for a moment, he forgot where he was.</p><br/><p>He was only reminded when he saw the hidden worries in Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes. Yes\u2026 this was Taurus\u2019 world where he was world-weary!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke with no strength. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiling Mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was surprised. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClimb the mountain and watch the sunrise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi instantly wanted to die. \u201cSo early in the morning\u2026\u201d Climbing the mountain to watch the sunset at 5 or 6 in the morning, he would really be tired of the world!</p><br/><p>It was unknown what Taurus was up to but he was as stubborn as an old cow. \u201cHurry up or we will miss it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi silently refused.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie gave the killing blow. \u201cIf you are obedient in these three months, I will return Chengyu to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have never lied to you.\u201d He never lied to Xie Xi but Xie Xi deceived him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had no interest in Chengyu but Jiang Xie was taking the initiative to give him \u2018psychological treatment\u2019 for his world-weariness and he had to cooperate.</p><br/><p>After all, his aim was to use this to help Jiang Xie release his heart knot\u2026</p><br/><p>It was just that he didn\u2019t expect the treatment to be so tiring!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you count as obedient?\u201d Xie Xi sat up and struggled to ask.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cI want you to accompany me for activities.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cDoes that include climbing the mountain at five in the morning to see the sunrise?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes.</p><br/><p>Yes, your sister!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned over and wrapped himself up like a silkworm cocoon.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie questioned, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you could do anything for Chengyu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hatefully thought, \u2018I am doing everything for you!\u2019</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie added, \u201cIt seems you are no longer interested in Chengyu. Then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened the quilt and looked at the other person with messy hair.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s voice was filled with some warmth. \u201cAre you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gritted his teeth. \u201c\u2026I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, climbing the mountain didn\u2019t matter. Xie Xi wasn\u2019t afraid of anything since his physique meant he could climb three mountains without gasping. However, the time was too early? Wasn\u2019t this meant for sleeping? Why go hiking?</p><br/><p>Xiling Mountain was a scenic spot on the outskirts of D City. It was known as the first mountain on the sea. Once someone climbed to the peak, they could see the beautiful scenery of the sea and the sky.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had no interest in the scenery. His body was covered in the cold air of someone who just woke up.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, this sentiment was in line with the world-weariness of Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>It was early but there were many people who wanted to see the sunrise on this mountain.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t tired when climbing the mountain but he was very happy.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was worried and afraid that Xie Xi\u2019s body couldn\u2019t stand it, so he walked very slowly.</p><br/><p>In fact, this Xiling Mountain wasn\u2019t very high and most of it was a flat path. It was very suitable for the \u2018skinny\u2019 Xie Xi to hike.</p><br/><p>The higher he went, the fresher the air became and the more Xie Xi lost his anger.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw the beads of sweat on Xie Xi\u2019s forehead and asked, \u201cAre you tired?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s sweat was all fake and aiming for sympathy. \u201cI\u2019m not tired.\u201d His mouth was more tightly closed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie reached out a hand. \u201cThis part is a bit steep. I will help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi happily grabbed this hand.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie carefully protecting him and climbed more than a dozen steps together.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was so tired that he gasped.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie took a bottle of water out of the backpack and gave it to him. \u201cWould you like to drink?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took a few big mouthfuls. Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes flashed and he asked, \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi noticed his expression\u2026 Walking for so long was to make him eat?</p><br/><p>In fact, there was no need to go to so much trouble. Xie Xi wanted to eat salted duck eggs with porridge and crab dumplings from the moment he woke up.</p><br/><p>He was hungry just having such a thought.</p><br/><p>The benefit to climbing the mountain was that Xie Xi could justifiably say, \u201cA bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes were bright. \u201cI brought some food. Come this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was warm. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie led him to a space with nobody and opened the backpack under the green pines.</p><br/><p>He took out a mat and laid out two, three, four\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes were big. \u201cSo much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Then Jiang Xie pulled out two more dishes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or cry when he saw the seven or eight insulation boxes. Taurus was trying too hard to make him eat.</p><br/><p>The even more surprising thing was that the insulation boxes contained hot rice porridge, exquisite dumplings and salty duck eggs cut into pieces\u2026</p><br/><p>The things he wanted to eat had been fully prepared by Jiang Xie. What was this called? A heart connection?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help laughing.</p><br/><p>The two people washed their hands with warm water from the thermos pot and Jiang Xie said, \u201cEat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi picked up a small dumpling and the delicious taste of crab filled his mouth.</p><br/><p>He had never eaten such delicious crab dumpling. It was as if his heart was filled.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

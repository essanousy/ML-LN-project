His identity was torn in front of everyone and he pretended to be the demon summoned by Sein. Finally, he was killed by the three perverts and completed the task.</p><br/><p>He thought he would never experience anything related to that world again. He never imagined that the eldest prince\u2019s dream would turn out to be the memory of his past life!</p><br/><p>What should he do? How much did Randy remember?</p><br/><p>If it was because the breaking up then this dream would be fine. He could coax Randy\u2019s heart and soul and probably collect all the souls. However, if it was after the breakup\u2026</p><br/><p>He clearly remembered the words he said to the housekeeper Randy.</p><br/><p>\u2018You are just a servant, what qualifications do you have to get my love!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018A monster who isn\u2019t a ghost and a servant of low status, how can I love you?\u2019 He was eager to die and really said many things!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was terrified and could only hope that the eldest prince didn\u2019t think too much. At the very least, don\u2019t think of the \u2018shocking revelation!\u2019</p><br/><p>Randy smiled gently but his face was too pale and there was no shine in his eyes. The colour of his mouth was charming as he whispered softly, \u201cYoung Master, it isn\u2019t good not to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to respond but found he couldn\u2019t open his mouth or speak. He tried to move his body and found that it was stiff. He couldn\u2019t move at all.</p><br/><p>What was this situation now?</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master should be obedient.\u201d Randy bent over and kissed him on the forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to dinner.\u201d As he spoke, he reached out and carefully picked Xie Xi up.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t even move his eyes and could only be at Randy\u2019s mercy.</p><br/><p>Randy held him carefully, as if he was holding a fragile porcelain doll that would break with a bit of force.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could feel his care but also felt an indescribable horror. It was as if he really was a porcelain doll at this moment\u2026</p><br/><p>Randy carried him to the dining room. The decorations in the old castle were still gorgeous but the light was very dark. The swaying candlelight made everything seem unreal and as if ghosts could pop out at any time.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi never expected that he would one day be scared by the dream of another person.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t afraid of ghosts. He was just afraid of this scene and the man who killed him many times.</p><br/><p>Randy placed him on the high backed chair, carefully arranged the napkin for him and gently raised his arm, placing it next to the knife and fork. Unfortunately, Xie Xi couldn\u2019t move his arm to hold the knife and fork.</p><br/><p>Randy said, \u201cMaster, wait a minute. I will go and serve you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Randy did everything by himself. It seemed that he was the only one in this castle.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to wait but he had to wait. He couldn\u2019t move at all!</p><br/><p>After a short time, Randy came back. He was holding a silver tray covered by a semicircular lid. It looked quite normal.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt some doubts in his heart. He couldn\u2019t even talk. Could he eat?</p><br/><p>Randy put down the tray and whispered, \u201cI kept you waiting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t speak or move, he could only listen silently.</p><br/><p>Randy didn\u2019t want his response either. He had a gentle smile on his handsome face as he opened the lid with his white-gloved hand.</p><br/><p>It was right in front of Xie Xi\u2019s fixed gaze and he saw the plate instantly.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun covered his little nose and cried out, \u201cWow, what is this? Internal organs?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was really internal organs. It was bloody internal organs!\u201d</p><br/><p>Randy kept smiling despite taking out this dark dish and he whispered, \u201cI will serve Young Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d Who wanted to eat this?!</p><br/><p>Randy\u2019s eyes dropped and looked extremely gentle. \u201cYoung Master will eat this first and tomorrow I\u2019ll get you a human heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!!\u201d Who, who wanted to eat a human heart?!</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun was frightened as he clung to Xie Xi\u2019s neck. \u201cDaddy, the eldest prince is terrible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was also terrified. This might be a dream but he didn\u2019t want to experience the taste of a heart!</p><br/><p>Randy was a well-trained housekeeper. His every move was elegant and neat. Despite cutting the bloody internal organs, he still maintained his perfect movements and decent smile. People couldn\u2019t help thinking that this was a top steak\u2026</p><br/><p>What damn steak, it was internal organs!</p><br/><p>Randy forked a bloody piece and raised it to Xie Xi\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He wouldn\u2019t eat even if he was killed!</p><br/><p>Randy\u2019s voice was full of pampering. \u201cYoung Master, it isn\u2019t good if you don\u2019t eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>It really wasn\u2019t good to not eat but who was going to eat this damn thing?</p><br/><p>Randy was full of helplessness. \u201cYou don\u2019t like animals? That isn\u2019t good. I didn\u2019t prepare any human hearts in advance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was powerless and inwardly thought, \u2018Don\u2019t use the tone of coaxing a child to say such words!\u2019</p><br/><p>Randy gently coaxed him. \u201cYou should eat first. If you don\u2019t eat then you will feel uncomfortable at night.\u201d Then he sent that bloody thing towards Xie Xi\u2019s mouth. Xie Xi didn\u2019t know where the strength came from but he managed to move!</p><br/><p>He pushed the fork away, speaking in a dry voice, \u201cNo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Randy was stunned. The fork in his hand fell and the raw meat stuck to the gorgeous carpet in a shocking manner.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know if he was doing the right thing but he would rather leave this damn dream than eat bloody organs!</p><br/><p>Due to this resistance, he finally seemed able to control his body. He moved and looked up at Randy.</p><br/><p>Randy\u2019s dark eyes flashed, like stars appearing in the dark sky. His voice contained an unbearable excitement. \u201cYoung Master\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes moved and he spoke in a slightly stiff manner, \u201cRan, Randy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Randy hugged him, cold lips falling on his neck in an almost mad manner. \u201cYou finally woke up. You finally\u2026 you\u2019re finally back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned and could only passively be held.</p><br/><p>Randy had always been calm and steady. There were few times when he lost his temper but now he was completely out of control. He held Xie Xi extremely hard, as if Xie Xi would fly away if he was released. It was as if this was a beautiful dream and he would wake up to despair at any time.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was tense as he thought about what the eldest prince remembered, including the last words he said.</p><br/><p>Then this dream was a continuation of the quasi-world? Was this what happened after he left the world?</p><br/><p>He left and Sein Hall must\u2019ve definitely died. The housekeeper Randy didn\u2019t give up and kept trying to resurrect him?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t speak before because his body itself was a corpse? His back was covered with cold sweat at the thought. Sure enough, Randy was a psychopath. Normal people couldn\u2019t do such a thing!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about it and finally got a clue. He followed the rhythm of the dream and said, \u201cRandy, what happened to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he felt cold liquid dripping onto his neck. Randy was crying.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t see it but he felt a bit sad. If Randy still remained after Xie Xi left the world, he couldn\u2019t imagine how much pain and despair Randy had felt as he held his dead love.</p><br/><p>The certain thing was that it was impossible for Sein to survive. Randy carefully took care of a corpse. How bleak and lonely would it be to spend all day in this castle that was a tomb?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is going on\u2026\u201d Xie Xi made a dazed expression and asked softly, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps this was Randy\u2019s heart knot. The experience of the last world was mapped onto this world, making him suffer from a lack of emotions.</p><br/><p>The appearance of Xie Xi triggered his sporadic memories in the form of dreams haunting him.</p><br/><p>Was it possible to collect all of Randy\u2019s love as long as this knot from the last world was released?</p><br/><p>Butler Randy was unquestionably in love with Sein Hall. However, the eldest prince repelled this memory. Was it okay to have him accept it?</p><br/><p>How could he accept it? It must not be a tragedy and should have a successful outcome.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was still slightly perturbed. The last world contained more than Randy. The second prince and third prince were also there. Did they also have memories of the previous life?</p><br/><p>What happened to Aix-en and Gars after the ending? The housekeeper Randy was so miserable that the two of them must be no better.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know and in fact, Jiang Xie didn\u2019t know either. He would only know once the soul returned to his body.</p><br/><p>Now it was the eldest prince\u2019s dream. Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to worry about those two and would finish this dream first.</p><br/><p>Randy\u2019s body stiffened at his question and he calmed down. He released Sein. His face was still pale and his eyes dark, but he was no longer as lifeless as before.</p><br/><p>He whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. You have come back and I won\u2019t let you suffer any more harm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Randy didn\u2019t want to say anything else and Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare stimulate him. He only nodded with a tired appearance.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to eat these internal organs and it was better to go to sleep.</p><br/><p>Randy instantly felt his exhaustion and asked, \u201cIs there any discomfort?\u201d Xie Xi replied, \u201cI\u2019m somewhat tired. I want to go back to my room to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll carry you back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hurriedly said, \u201cI can do it myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>He stood up as he spoke, only to find that his legs were stiff. It was hard to take a step.</p><br/><p>Randy\u2019s eyes were pale as he whispered, \u201cYou just woke up and haven\u2019t adapted. I\u2019ll carry you back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really couldn\u2019t control this body and he nodded in reply.</p><br/><p>Randy picked him up and sent him back to the bedroom.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t sleep right away and thought it was due to the glaring candlelight. \u201cPut out the light.\u201d</p><br/><p>Randy was startled but he put out the candle without saying anything. The room instantly became covered with darkness.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to sleep but he had to close his eyes and pretend to be asleep.</p><br/><p>Randy stayed for a while before getting up and leaving.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t feel sleepy at all as dawn arrived. His body was still stiff and he couldn\u2019t bend his knees while walking. How strange did he look?</p><br/><p>Randy opened the door and saw him. \u201cYoung Master must be hungry. Let\u2019s go eat breakfast first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really did feel hungry. Last night\u2019s internal organs made him lose his appetite but today should be normal food.</p><br/><p>Randy took Xie Xi to the dining room again, put him down and went to prepare the food.</p><br/><p>The plate was uncovered and the steaming roast lamb chops made his fingers move!</p><br/><p>He was very relieved at finally being able to eat a normal meal. Xie Xi\u2019s fingers moved to hold the knife and fork but he couldn\u2019t grab them.</p><br/><p>Randy\u2019s eyes flashed and he whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi waited and saw him cut a small piece. He was handing it over when\u2026</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun yelled \u201cDaddy, that is a human heart. It is still steaming!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked closer.</p><br/><p>Where was the roast lamb chop? It was a heart that was bright and bloody, as if it had just been taken. It also gave off a strange heat\u2026</p><br/><p>What was going on? He had clearly just seen normal food. It was delicious lamp chops so how did it suddenly become a heart?</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun cried, \u201cBoo hoo, so terrible\u2026\u201d He shrank back into Xie Xi\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t take it anymore. The thing that made him feel incredulous was that he actually thought this heart was roast lamb chops. The fragrance was still floating through the air, making his fingers twitch.</p><br/><p>He patted the little kitten quietly. It was fortunate that the kitten yelled and let him recognize that the roast lamb chops were actually a heart.</p><br/><p>Why was this happening?</p><br/><p>Should he eat this in Randy\u2019s dream? Xie Xi looked up and accidentally caught a flash of hostility in Randy\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi reacted to this! Yes\u2026 Sein Hall of the last world used magic and pretended to be the summoned demon.</p><br/><p>Then Randy was currently trying to test him?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It is too bad.\u201d The red fox smiled, his emotions changing quickly. It was really amazing.</p><br/><p>Red Two glanced at Xie Xi and Xie Xi nodded, motioning for him to hold on.</p><br/><p>The red fox said, \u201cCome quickly, Lord Rose. Our ancestor is waiting for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew that he couldn\u2019t conceal it this time from Red Two. It couldn\u2019t be hidden and in any case, he was a slag flower. He had to get used to others knowing it sooner or later.</p><br/><p>Who would\u2019ve expected the red fox to say, \u201cThe Nine Tailed Fox Palace is cold and I only have on Warm Pill here. I\u2019m afraid not everyone can enter.</p><br/><p>He was very tactful but the rose family heard his unfinished words.</p><br/><p>The ice palace was made of thousands of years old ice. It was truly very cold. Those with a natural protection around their bodies weren\u2019t afraid of this cold but the roses could even be bullied by worms. It was likely that they couldn\u2019t stand this cold.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi immediately seized the opportunity. \u201cLet me go meet Lord Nine Tails.\u201d</p><br/><p>Red Two was worried and Xie Xi deliberately said, \u201cThere is no need to worry. We are here to deliver the betrothal gifts. How could the lord embarrass us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Red Two received the hint and nodded. \u201cYes! There is such a thing!\u201d In any case, it was unknown where they could hide from the trouble. They insisted on returning the betrothal gifts so they had to return it!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi followed the red fox into the palace. Xie Xi was very familiar with this palace. After all, it was a place where he died for seven days. How could he not have an impression of it?</p><br/><p>However, this castle made of ice and snow didn\u2019t have a magnificent beauty. It seemed abandoned and was covered with fog, like they were walking on clouds. The ice palace was similar to the fairy palace in the highest heavens.</p><br/><p>The red fox lowered his voice. \u201cYour Excellency, the situation of the ancestor isn\u2019t very good so I have deliberately sent away outsiders.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was most afraid of hearing that the \u2018situation isn\u2019t good!\u2019</p><br/><p>Why didn\u2019t the souls want to live one by one!</p><br/><p>The red fox\u2019s eyes were red. \u201cHe is very weak. The other day, the ancestor went to Rose Mountain to see you and when he came back\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi demanded, \u201cTake me to see him.\u201d His words were sincere and the fear inside him wasn\u2019t false.</p><br/><p>The red fox nodded and told him into a cold and foggy room.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t feel the cold because he was carrying the Warm Pill. He just thought this room was like an ice cave.</p><br/><p>Through the thin fog, he saw the silver-haired man leaning against the couch.</p><br/><p>He seemed to be napping, his silver hair scattered against the ice jade-like couch. The white shirt on his body moved freely, revealing a large chest. His arm was hanging to one side and the white sleeves dragged on the ground, making him look decadent and powerless.</p><br/><p>He had to say\u2026</p><br/><p>There was nothing to be said about the seductive temperament of the second child. He was elegant and charming in the past and became more breathtaking now that he was sick.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t felt much previously but now he was shocked. In particular, once the silver fox opened his eyes, the slightly confused silver eyes made his heart tremble.</p><br/><p>\u201c99.\u201d Nine Tails was stunned and sat up. \u201cHow did you come?\u201d</p><br/><p>The red fox was replied and told him, \u201cAncestor, move slowly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails frowned. He looked paler but he gritted his teeth and moved close to Xie Xi as he asked, \u201cAre you cold?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed in his heart and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails said, \u201cWe will go outside the cold palace\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The red fox couldn\u2019t help interrupting, \u201cAncestor, your body needs to rest. If you move away from this cold palace, you will\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails\u2019 eyes narrowed and his voice was cold. \u201cGo!\u201d</p><br/><p>The red fox\u2019s lips tightened and he glanced at Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>It was impossible for Xie Xi to not understand. \u201cI am warm with this pill and don\u2019t feel cold. Let\u2019s stay here?\u201d</p><br/><p>His gentle voice eased Nine Tails\u2019 expression. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to their nonsense. How can I be so fragile?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI\u2019m not weak, not to mention that your palace is very beautiful. I want to see more of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails\u2019 eyes lit up. \u201cWhere do you think looks good? I will ask them to move it to Rose Mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He reluctantly said, \u201cEverywhere looks good so you will have to dismantle the whole thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails paused. \u201cI will build a cold palace for you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Can\u2019t I just stay here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails smiled, his pale lips curved with a breathtaking beauty. \u201cYes, your words are good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was inevitably distressed.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what setting Nine Tails gave himself but in short, it was life-threatening. Xie Xi couldn\u2019t stand him pretending to be pitiful but the worse thing was him refusing to pretend to be pitiful.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was very contradictory. He could do anything shameless. Pretending to be weak to get a hug or kiss\u2026 he had done it all.</p><br/><p>However, once he was really in poor health, he refused to show weakness. He pretended that nothing was going on so that other people were unaware.</p><br/><p>In Dream Come True, Jiang Xie once had a fever of nearly 40 degrees. He was confused but still pretended to be normal. If Xie Xi hadn\u2019t felt his hot hands, Xie Xi would\u2019ve been tricked by him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked why Jiang Xie hadn\u2019t told him. At that time, Jiang Xie had replied, \u201cYour husband is strong. He won\u2019t feel sick from a cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, Xie Xi knew that Jiang Xie was afraid of worrying him. Maybe he was afraid that Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t feel worried.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was such a contradiction. He had excessive overconfidence as well as an excessive lack of confidence.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was mixed while Nine Tails gave him all this strange stuff to try and make him happy.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi whispered, \u201cIf you are physically uncomfortable then rest now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails hesitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will stay here and accompany you, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was soft but Nine Tails was clearly aware of his own situation and could rest well.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke again, \u201cI just want to be alone with you for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails immediately agreed. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiting foxes were sent away and Xie Xi stared at Nine Tails.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails\u2019 eyes slowly became a different colour. Jiang Xie smiled and asked, \u201cAre you fascinated by your husband?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t have Nine Tails\u2019 cautious attitude. He took Xie Xi into his arms and kissed him. \u201cHow is it?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to push him away but saw the pale lips and his heart softened. He let Jiang Xie kiss him for a while until a bit of blood returned.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sighed beautifully and praised his soul.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t not know what he was thinking and snapped out, \u201cWhy are all of you dying?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke a half truth. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to live without you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat nonsense!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie laughed. \u201cIt really is nonsense. In fact, it is a bitter trick. How can you feel distressed if I\u2019m not miserable?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi exposed him. \u201cHow do the souls know that I feel bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>According to the final ending of Atlantis, the souls wouldn\u2019t believe that he loved them. If he didn\u2019t love them, how could he feel distressed for them?</p><br/><p>Then he thought about the sentence that Jiang Xie just spoke and really doubted the souls\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t bear to see him feel bad and changed the topic. \u201cWhat is happening these days?\u201d Nine Tails hadn\u2019t met Azure Dragon and Vermilion Bird and didn\u2019t know these memories.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gave him a brief explanation. Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t help laughing again. \u201cIt is really dancing on a wire rope.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Whose fault was it?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie opened his mouth, \u201cAccording to this point of view, you should\u2019ve met Houqing first and then Nine Tails pried you away. Something happened that you made seriously injured and Azure Dragon rescued you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought the same thing and asked, \u201cWhat about White Tiger and Vermilion Bird?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVermilion Bird is definitely after Azure Dragon. As for White Tiger, it is hard to say. Maybe he is earlier or maybe he is the latest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing words about cheating from Jiang Xie\u2019s mouth\u2026 Xie Xi felt weird.</p><br/><p>Then he asked about the little tiger.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about this. It is probably something like the white tiger\u2019s baby spirit and isn\u2019t really his son.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBaby spirit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie nodded. \u201cThe white tiger has the highest combat power and cultivation. It is normal for him to develop a baby spirit. This low-level spirit is stupid and only follows instincts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was curious. \u201cHis instinct is to recognize me as a parent?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cHis instinct is to see you. Arguably, the baby spirit should most want to see his master but White Tiger is full of thoughts about you and the baby will see you first.\u201d Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Everything was about love with him!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe little tiger disappeared and he probably returned to the white tiger. You don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had been a bit worried before and now he felt relieved.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked him, \u201cHave you seen the roster after returning to Rose Mountain?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew what he was thinking and replied, \u201cI haven\u2019t had time to look but I brought it over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded and opened the roster.</p><br/><p>He had previously seen Azure Dragon\u2019s body and repaired a scale. It was reasonable to say that\u2026</p><br/><p>Sure enough, the first page of the roster wasn\u2019t blank! There was a new task prompt in the lower right corner of his vision.</p><br/><p>[Main Task: Found the Azure Dragon illustration, the collection progress is 1%, the name is missing.]</p><br/><p>\u2026The name was missing? Xie Xi asked Jiang Xie, \u201cDo you know Azure Dragon\u2019s name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have no names.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cAzure Dragon and Nine Tails are just code names. They didn\u2019t know their names and it is presumably the same for White Tiger, Houqing and Vermilion Bird.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at the vague outline of the dragon and thought, \u201cTo be honest, many creatures in this world have no name.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be that only the flower god has a name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about it and it really seemed true\u2026</p><br/><p>The roses only had code names. He didn\u2019t have much contact with other families but Azure Dragon\u2019s attendant was called Black Dragon because his body was a black dragon.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie started to act poor again. \u201cThis world is only Xie Xi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him. \u201cYes, you were too lazy to think of names when designing the world!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cI wasn\u2019t too lazy. I just couldn\u2019t think of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie released his words of love again. \u201cMy mind is so full of Xie Xi. How can I think of other names?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t believe in this person\u2019s evil!</p><br/><p>He asked, \u201cDid you know who Xie Xi was when designing this world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d He had fallen into the pit.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was actually quite puzzled. \u201cThe souls don\u2019t know my name\u2026\u201d It was reasonable to say the flower god should be called Sein.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe I interfered in this quasi-world when I entered.\u201d</p><br/><p>He could only think of this. During the time when Jiang Xie knew these worlds, he definitely didn\u2019t know Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi might not have even been born!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked, \u201cDo you want to look at Nine Tails\u2019 god\u2019s wisdom?\u201d</p><br/><p>The god\u2019s wisdom was very important and perhaps the name might be found inside.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll go and see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails had a fragment of the god\u2019s wisdom and it was once again a painting. He asked Jiang Xie, \u201cCan you see it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie shook his head. \u201cIt is a blank sheet of paper.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at the scroll painting. \u201cThe painting is of Nine Tails\u2019 palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, in his eyes, the image depicted Nine Tails\u2019 cold palace. It was a magnificent ice palace that was bleak and lonely.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cGo and check. This time pay attention to the name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded and approached the painting. He touched it and was drawn into the painting.</p><br/><p>This should be the place where he and Nine Tails first met. Xie Xi thought he would see Nine Tails but who knew that he would actually see Sirius\u2026</p><br/><p>In this world, Sirius was Houqing. Why did the god\u2019s wisdom show Houqing?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was wondering this when he saw Nine Tails standing at the entrance of the palace, wearing a silver cloak.</p><br/><p>Oh, it seemed that his meeting with Nine Tails began with him being seduced away.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

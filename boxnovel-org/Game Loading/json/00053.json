Thus, he spared no effort to blacken him in front of Xie Xi. This blackening continued for 20 minutes. There were so many lines that only the attendant could compete with him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was chewing on the crescent fruit when the third prince belatedly arrived.</p><br/><p>He killed his second brother without any effort. After fighting in a fancy way, the evil dragon crashed to the ground and spoke hatefully, \u201cI lost to you. I acknowledge it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He felt that the real second prince wouldn\u2019t acknowledge his brother and would probably want to kill his brother.</p><br/><p>The third prince anxiously stepped forward and hugged Xie Xi. \u201cIt is my bad. I didn\u2019t arrive in time and Your Highness was wronged\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The attendant emerged from an unknown place and shouted, \u201cWarrior Gars defeated the dragon. He received all of the dragon\u2019s wealth and he will give this huge wealth to our prince. The Galin Kingdom won\u2019t have to worry about food and clothing for 100 years!\u201d</p><br/><p>Was he someone in a theatrical program?</p><br/><p>In addition, what did he mean by the Galin Kingdom? Gars and Colin?</p><br/><p>One hundred years without worrying about food and clothing, this dream was too simple!</p><br/><p>Forget Xie Xi, even Roast Pork Bun was laughing like a silly cat, \u201cThe third prince called Gars, he is a stupid fool!\u201d</p><br/><p>A prompt appeared in the lower right corner: [The dream is about to end. Please be prepared to leave.]</p><br/><p>It was truly over. The third prince was successful and now he had to wake up to face the cruel reality! Xie Xi didn\u2019t stop and immediately left the dream. He knew that the third prince had been fighting all year round and was extremely vigilant. He woke up faster than ordinary people and combined with the five senses that he trained, it was likely he could discover Xie Xi if Xie Xi was too slow.</p><br/><p>The third prince might be a fool in the dream but in reality, he was a famous commander of the army.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi quickly left and returned to his place of residence, ready to get more sleep.</p><br/><p>The average person\u2019s dream was quite short. Meanwhile, the third prince\u2019s dream was very long and lasted the whole night, not letting Xie Xi sleep.</p><br/><p>Dreaming itself consumed a large amount of mental energy, meaning Xie Xi was very sleepy at the moment.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the overall style of this dream was very relaxed and Xie Xi didn\u2019t hate it.</p><br/><p>After returning to the bedroom, Xie Xi washed up and fell asleep.</p><br/><p>Before going to bed, he looked at the progress of the task. The red progress bar belonging to the third prince reached 16.5% and was almost full.</p><br/><p>The third prince\u2019s dream was much simpler than the fifth prince. It was basically smooth and filled with teasing.</p><br/><p>Looking at them in reality, the third prince was filled with more \u2018bitterness\u2019 than the fifth prince. By all accounts, the dream of the fifth prince should be easier yet Xie Xi ended up dying.</p><br/><p>This was probably due to a psychological problem.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince seemed free and unrestrained but in fact, he was uneasy to the depths of his heart. He was uneasy about his position, uneasy about the future and had no confidence in his ability to grasp happiness.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the third prince was very different. He came from a humble background. His mother was the laughing stock of the masses but his childhood was better than the sixth prince. He threw his life onto the battlefield and hit the world.</p><br/><p>He was confident and held his own fate. This meant he would be happy in his dream.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had left too fast. If he stopped in the third prince\u2019s palace for a while, he would\u2019ve heard the third prince talking in his sleep, \u201cSein, Hall\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi only slept for three or four hours before his communicator woke up him.</p><br/><p>A message from the third prince appeared. \u201cEat breakfast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was so sleepy that he didn\u2019t completely emerge from his dream and he spoke casually, \u201cNot hungry, won\u2019t eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was hoarse and he was still dazed from not waking up.</p><br/><p>The third prince was sitting in the dining room, surrounded by soldiers who accompanied him for the morning exercise. The voice spread from the communicator.</p><br/><p>Saul and the others were stunned.</p><br/><p>The third prince immediately froze and cleared his throat. \u201cHe is proud and pampered.\u201d</p><br/><p>The lieutenant blinked.</p><br/><p>The third prince raised his eyebrows. \u201cWhat are you doing? Go and wake up him. It is unseemly to still be sleeping at this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The lieutenant got up and hadn\u2019t taken a step yet when the third prince spoke again, \u201cForget it, let him sleep. If he doesn\u2019t eat breakfast then he will remain hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>It might sound harsh but it was dignified. It would be more believable if he didn\u2019t keep playing back the voice.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi got up in the afternoon and was looking for something to eat when he received a message from the third prince, \u201cIf I sleep like you, I would\u2019ve already died from the enemy\u2019s guns.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Why did he sleep so long? Wasn\u2019t it because the third prince\u2019s dream was too long?</p><br/><p>The cute dream of the stupid fool, the awkward third prince was only good at fighting.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi slowly replied to him, \u201cYour Highness, this subordinate has just woken up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow you are talking with respect? Impudent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi who had no expression on his face: ^_^</p><br/><p>The third prince\u2019s heart was flying. \u201cHurry up and wash. I will take you to eat something good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi only just realized that the prince\u2019s vehicle was parked outside his door.</p><br/><p>After lunch, the third prince had something to do. Xie Xi became his little follower again and followed the prince wherever he went.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi still had a sense of urgency. The second prince\u2019s progress was 6% and he should find a chance at night to use Dreaming. He should fill the progress as quickly as possible and then get to know the eldest prince and the fourth prince.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, the third prince went to the elder prince\u2019s palace to discuss the task of guarding the capital.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was waiting outside but he wasn\u2019t idle.</p><br/><p>He took the opportunity to collect many faces in the eldest prince\u2019s palace. He would reserve them first so he could use them in the future.</p><br/><p>The two brothers were busy all afternoon and the eldest prince stayed for dinner.</p><br/><p>At this time, Xie Xi was brought inside by the third prince and introduced the eldest prince. \u201cBig Brother, this is my little sidekick.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saluted to the eldest prince.</p><br/><p>The eldest prince\u2019s gaze fell on him and seemed to pause for a long time.</p><br/><p>The third prince said, \u201cHis name is Colin Hall. Now he is just a small guard but he is very smart. He can make a lot of progress after more experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s lips curved. Sure enough, he still couldn\u2019t adapt to the third prince\u2019s style of praise.</p><br/><p>The eldest prince told him, \u201cGet up. There is no need to be polite.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi got up and stood beside the third prince. He didn\u2019t know why but he always felt that the eldest prince was looking at him.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t being self-confident. He just didn\u2019t want to underestimate the housekeeper Randy.</p><br/><p>This soul in the last world was so bad. Who knew what this world would be like?</p><br/><p>Did the eldest prince like the second face as well? This face had already been allocated to the second prince and third prince. He couldn\u2019t provoke another person.</p><br/><p>Two people were already a struggle. He would be exhausted if there were three of them.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t look at the eldest prince throughout the meal. The third prince thought he was being polite and coaxed him \u201cIt\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t need to worry about making mistakes since Big Brother won\u2019t punish you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t comforted.</p><br/><p>The third prince\u2019s coaxing skill didn\u2019t match his ability to provoke people. \u201cYou must know that not everyone will be used to you as I am. I can indulge your small temper.\u201d Sleepy, picky eater, loved being spoiled\u2026 well, really cute.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to punch him.</p><br/><p>All night, Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare look up in fear that he would accidentally provoke the eldest prince.</p><br/><p>The good thing was that the progress bar was steady and no new colours appeared.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed with relief but there was something even more urgent.</p><br/><p>He had to find a chance to imprint his first face on the eldest prince before things became troublesome.</p><br/><p>Of course, tonight he would go to the second prince\u2019s dream and fill up the progress as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had experience from last night. Today he got up early and blended into the second prince\u2019s palace.</p><br/><p>He yawned and found no one was present when he arrived at the palace.</p><br/><p>The second prince hadn\u2019t slept yet?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi strolled for a while and saw the second prince working in his study.</p><br/><p>He was still working at this late hour? It wasn\u2019t easy for the second prince.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hid in a corner, rubbing Roast Pork Bun while waiting for the second prince to finish working.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun was used to this rubbing and also quite enjoyed it. His different coloured eyes narrowed and he fell asleep.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was also sleepy. After waiting half an hour, he planned to find a place to nap while checking on the second prince every hour or so.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the second prince was busy all night. Once the day brightened, he headed off to the hall of official business\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi waited all night and thought about how he would be \u2018tormented\u2019 by the third prince during the day. He suddenly wanted to forget about love and just sleep on the bed.</p><br/><p>As he was returning to his room, Roast Pork Bun cried out, \u201cIt\u2019s the sixth prince!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned but didn\u2019t see anyone.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun especially liked the sixth prince because of his eyes. \u201cHe is in the place where Daddy used to sleep. There is also the fifth prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cat could fly in the air and no one could see him, so his angle of view was much broader.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mind worked as he wondered what these two brothers were doing together.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince was going to leave soon. It was normal for him to go to Sein\u2019s residence. Then what was the fifth prince doing?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t feel comfortable. He changed to a reserve face and secretly followed.</p><br/><p>It was early in the morning and the whole undersea world was quiet. Most people hadn\u2019t woken up yet.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t afraid to be found by the fifth and sixth prince because he was wearing someone else\u2019s face. He leaned forward and eavesdropped on their conversation.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince said, \u201cI will cooperate with you. You must capture the state teacher of the Haiqui Kingdom alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince\u2019s voice was cold. \u201cIs the message reliable?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince retorted, \u201cIsn\u2019t it worth a try?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince glanced at the sleeping quarters and stated, \u201cI will do anything, as long as he can live again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d What was this situation?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

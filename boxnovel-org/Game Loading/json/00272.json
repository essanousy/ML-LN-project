Then he wouldn\u2019t have the opportunity to understand the situation.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was crossing the river by feeling the stones and also needed a bamboo pole. National Teacher, please hand it to him!</p><br/><p>The national teacher spoke. \u201cI wasn\u2019t much older than you when I knew His Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi listened very carefully. Was he really an antique this time and was much older than the national teacher?</p><br/><p>The national teacher used a light voice to tell a story of reliance in a war-torn era.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi guessed wrong. In fact, he wasn\u2019t much older than the national teacher. The two of them were a similar age and they were orphans who lost their families in the war.</p><br/><p>The national teacher\u2019s experience was more tragic. He lost his family and was almost eaten by monsters.</p><br/><p>The newly adult Xie Xi appeared, took him away from the monsters pursuing him and they hid in a cave.</p><br/><p>The little lion listened and interjected, \u201cHe was in a cave when I met him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a coincidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion questioned, \u201cYou knew each other in adversity and it was a mutual dependence. Then why did he leave the palace?\u201d In fact, Leo wanted to ask why the national teacher betrayed the beast king.</p><br/><p>After all, this was the rumour among the common people.</p><br/><p>The national teacher sneered. \u201cHe was so good to me, you couldn\u2019t imagine it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leo\u2019s tone was sour. \u201cHe is also very good to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The national teacher didn\u2019t care about these childish words and continued, \u201cIn the years when the eight countries were in chaos, the most pained ones were the people. His Majesty saw many displaced people and more tragedies. The thing he desired most was to end the war.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe did it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the national teacher replied. \u201cHe did it. He did the great work that wasn\u2019t possible for anyone else. He unified the eight countries, ending the war and bringing about a world of peace and prosperity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he whispered sharply, \u201cBut do you know how much he paid? How many painful ordeals he went through? How many times he barely survived?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Leo was stunned and couldn\u2019t answer.</p><br/><p>The national teacher continued, \u201cI was by his side, watching his efforts and his hard work. I watched him move towards that elusive ideal, watched him walk through the blood again and again until he finally met the moon in the sky!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moon was a distant dream that others only dare to look up at timidly yet the beast king met it.</p><br/><p>There was some depression in Leo\u2019s voice. \u201cI have never seen such a king.\u201d</p><br/><p>The national teacher was still calm and quiet. \u201cThus, you can\u2019t imagine how good he was to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leo clenched his voice.</p><br/><p>The national teacher\u2019s soft voice contained gentleness as he became immersed in the memories. \u201cIn the chaotic times, he indulged my bad habits. He didn\u2019t hesitate to rush into the enemy camp just to bring back a bucket of water for me. He slept on the hay pile and took off his clothes to make me a mattress. He used his fists to teach all the people who mocked my hair colour. He always gave me the best things, was afraid that I would be hurt, always\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Leo listened attentively while the national teacher\u2019s voice started trembling more and more.</p><br/><p>No wonder why he said that Leo couldn\u2019t imagine it. This was indeed the case. If he didn\u2019t live in such an era, he wouldn\u2019t understand how good and precious it was.</p><br/><p>The two men paused for a while and Leo was a bit uncomfortable. \u201cHe was like this to you. What did you do that he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The national teacher stated, \u201cI confessed to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The national teacher\u2019s next words seemed to split his soul. \u201cIt is because his kindness to me had nothing to do with love.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leo didn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>The national teacher spoke slowly. \u201cI told you this because I hope you can calm down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t good to you because he loves you. He is purely taking care of the weak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leo was stunned. \u201cI am different from you. I\u2019m not weak!\u201d</p><br/><p>The national teacher didn\u2019t refute him and only smiled sarcastically. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see you follow the same path as me and blindly give him trouble. He will be soft-hearted and cater to you but remember, this isn\u2019t love.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, Leo was young and he cried out, \u201cI can tell if it is love or not!\u201d</p><br/><p>The national teacher was still calm. \u201cOnce you can tell, you will go crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone contained no ups and downs, causing chills to go down Xie Xi\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wrapped himself tightly in the quilt.</p><br/><p>The conversation between the two men was over and Xie Xi pondered on it.</p><br/><p>The encounter between the national teacher and the beast king was very romantic. The two young people were dependent on each other and rose shoulder to shoulder to the peak of power. This was really enviable.</p><br/><p>However, Xie Xi wasn\u2019t a young lion. He knew that the national teacher concealed many things.</p><br/><p>He was good to the national teacher. Xie Xi definitely treated him very well.</p><br/><p>Still, there must be another secret involving the troubles between the two men.</p><br/><p>Could a simple confession make the wonderful beast king leave the national teacher?</p><br/><p>This didn\u2019t make sense and definitely wasn\u2019t what happened.</p><br/><p>The little lion suddenly asked, \u201cThe wound on his chest\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this question, Xie Xi quickly suppressed his thoughts and listened carefully.</p><br/><p>He wanted to know how he got this injury!</p><br/><p>The little lion actually asked, \u201c\u2026Was it obtained during the war?\u201d</p><br/><p>Such a terrible wound, as if the heart was dug out, was really shocking.</p><br/><p>The national teacher paused for a moment before calmly answering, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s ears trembled. His instincts told him that the national teacher was lying.</p><br/><p>Even if he couldn\u2019t see the person, he could tell that the national teacher was concealing the truth from the voice alone.</p><br/><p>Leo definitely couldn\u2019t hear it and he looked slightly sombre. \u201cHe suffered a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>The national teacher told him, \u201cSo don\u2019t toss him any more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d Leo exclaimed before realized that he sounded very childish. \u201cHis injury, can you cure it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will take time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The lion was visibly relieved and said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t early. He should be waking up soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi quickly took off the miniature amplifier and hid it under his pillow.</p><br/><p>He heard the sound of the door and opened his eyes to see the national teacher in a white robe.</p><br/><p>The national teacher stared at him and spoke warmly, \u201cYour Majesty, good morning. The medicinal bath is ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sat up and nodded. \u201cI slept a bit deeply.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is good to sleep well for recovery.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi inwardly thought, \u2018Leo is really young and inexperienced. If this injury was due to the war, the Rose Dynasty lasted for so long? Why didn\u2019t the national teacher cure him during this time?\u2019</p><br/><p>After taking the medicinal bath, Xie Xi felt better and his appetite improved significantly during breakfast.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t care about what he thought about in private. The two Jiang Xies saw him drank more than half a bowl of porridge and their hearts were comfortable.</p><br/><p>The meal ended and the national teacher went to attend a meeting. Xie Xi mentioned yesterday that he wanted to talk to the little lion and this was an excellent opportunity.</p><br/><p>Leo was actually somewhat uneasy after listening to this morning\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>The national teacher\u2019s words clearly dug a hole for Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi cared for Leo not out of love but because of his soft heart.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t treat Leo as unique because he was truly good to the national teacher.</p><br/><p>These flat words hid a lot of thunder.</p><br/><p>If Xie Xi hadn\u2019t been eavesdropping, he would\u2019ve fallen into the pit without knowing why he was buried!</p><br/><p>The two of them went back to the back garden. Due to the dream last night, Xie Xi paid attention to Leo\u2019s attitude.</p><br/><p>If Leo also dreamt of what they did in the garden, there would definitely be a slight change when seeing the garden.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Leo was completely absent-minded.</p><br/><p>This didn\u2019t mean that he didn\u2019t have sexual dreams. After all, it wasn\u2019t the first time coming to the garden and not reacting was normal.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi temporarily suppressed this problem and concentrated on the \u2018talk.\u2019</p><br/><p>They sat in the pavilion and Leo spoke first, \u201cIn the morning, the national teacher told me what previously happened between you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also heard it and didn\u2019t ask. \u201cI have known him for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leo glanced at him. \u201cHe said you were so good to him that other people can\u2019t imagine it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cHe was younger than me and we were both orphans. I regarded him as my only family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut he isn\u2019t your family.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cFamily members don\u2019t necessarily need to have a blood relationship.\u201d</p><br/><p>A lover was also family in the end. Xie Xi was really a clever ghost.</p><br/><p>Leo definitely couldn\u2019t understand this and wondered, \u201cDo you think of me as your family?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>He only had one love (home) but he had thousands of tricks for love.</p><br/><p>Leo paused before saying, \u201cThe national teacher said that you left after he confessed to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was really a straightforward young man. He shook everything out!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had something in mind and pretended to be stunned by these words. \u201cThat\u2026 those things are all over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leo stared at him. \u201cI also confessed to you. You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled wryly. \u201cThings aren\u2019t as simple as you think.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Leo was most afraid of being considered a child by Xie Xi. \u201cI can\u2019t think in such a complicated manner. I only know one thing. I like you and I want to be with you. IF you don\u2019t like me, just tell me and I will leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>This straight ball was really lethal and too unfriendly for a \u2018slag!\u2019</p><br/><p>Slag Xie had a manuscript in his heart and he sighed. \u201cHave you considered the real problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is your problem with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence struck Xie Xi. If there weren\u2019t too many Jiang Xies, he would catch this straight ball and fly away with it.</p><br/><p>What was the real problem?</p><br/><p>Everything was shit in front of two people who really loved each other!</p><br/><p>Poor Xie Xi fell in love with a man with more than one soul\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi questioned, \u201cWhat type of future do you think I can give you with this body?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leo was stunned.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had long been brewing a bitter plan. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long I can live\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished when Leo exclaimed, \u201cThe national teacher said he could cure your body!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 can you wait for me to recover?\u201d</p><br/><p>This hint caused Leo\u2019s eyes to brighten. \u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie XI shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t give you any promises. You are still young and I am an adult. I can\u2019t say words that I can\u2019t be responsible for.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he returned to Central, Xie Xi decided to anonymously public a book called \u2018A Scum\u2019s Quotes.\u2019</p><br/><p>Leo was a bit excited. \u201cI will wait for you. I can wait a long time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cDidn\u2019t you always want to learn martial arts? Stay in the palace and I\u2019ll arrange people to teach you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leo was finally stabilized. \u201cGood!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sorrow in his heart was swept away.</p><br/><p>It was because Xie Xi gave him hope.</p><br/><p>It was just a bit of hope but this allowed Jiang Xie to see an infinite dawn!</p><br/><p>He wanted to become stronger, strong enough to get revenge. He also wanted to be strong enough to get the approval of the man who once unified the eight countries.</p><br/><p>Thus, Leo stayed in the palace.</p><br/><p>The national teacher didn\u2019t say anything about this. He didn\u2019t look for Leo or mention it to Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s instructions were arranged properly and the best masters were found to teach Leo.</p><br/><p>The national teacher was calm but Xie Xi found it hard to feel at ease.</p><br/><p>The national teacher\u2019s previous words, \u2018Once you can tell, you will go crazy\u2019 always lingered in Xie Xi\u2019s heart, making him uneasy.</p><br/><p>The wonderful thing was that from this day onwards, Xie Xi\u2019s sex dreams stopped.</p><br/><p>He sighed with relief too early. More than a month later, the lion entered his estrus period.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Xie Xi wasn\u2019t standing with one foot in two boats. It was four boats! (TL: having two lovers at the same time or in Sein\u2019s case, four)</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He became even more indifferent.</p><br/><p>This happened to calm down the gloomy Gars. It was Greenton who took the initiative to kiss him. Not only did Xie Xi show no response, indifference was also on his face. This greatly calmed down Gars who was drinking a jar of vinegar.</p><br/><p>If Xie Xi showed panic then Greenton probably wouldn\u2019t live to see the moon tonight.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to save Greenton. Based on the previous inference, this person was probably the only one who wasn\u2019t abnormal. However, this person killed him once. Upholding the basic courtesies and sending him away was already beyond reproach.</p><br/><p>Still, he didn\u2019t want Gars to kill Greenton. Didn\u2019t another problem occur when the housekeeper committed suicide? Who knew what out pits there were in this game.</p><br/><p>As soon as Gars appeared, Greenton took two steps back and distanced himself from Sein. Of course, he didn\u2019t know the relationship between Gars and Sein. He was just a gentleman and unwilling to do intimate things in front of others.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw Gars\u2019 eyes soften at a rate that was visible to the naked eye.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Gars didn\u2019t show any sincerity or fright at all. \u201cMy hands weren\u2019t steady and I broke the tea set.\u201d</p><br/><p>Greenton unexpectedly wasn\u2019t angry. Instead, he said to Xie Xi, \u201cI will find you next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare reprimand Gars and replied to his cousin, \u201cCousin, your heart is enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said this but he didn\u2019t think he had a higher position. It was because Sein truly was scum.</p><br/><p>Gars focused on the title of \u2018cousin\u2019 while Greenton focused on the second half of the sentence.</p><br/><p>The result was the maid\u2019s eyes gentled and his cousin smiled sweetly.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had a question mark. What did he do?</p><br/><p>The shocking fifth day passed and he welcomed the night.</p><br/><p>Greenton said goodbye to him, reluctant to leave. Xie Xi blinked innocently at Gars.</p><br/><p>His cousin was moved and ashamed. \u2018Sein is so shy that he is embarrassed to look at me in front of his servant. I can\u2019t imagine how much courage he had to muster to confess to me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Greenton\u2019s eyes were sweet again.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Cousin, what were you thinking about?</p><br/><p>Gars\u2019 feelings were very useful. He couldn\u2019t stand Xie Xi\u2019s anger or fear. Gars wanted to hold Sein in his hand, in his mouth and in the softest part of his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master.\u201d Gars said. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you to undress.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hurriedly nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d He hurried to separate from the two people. He didn\u2019t do anything but he was inexplicably tired.</p><br/><p>Damn person stepping on X number of boats, you should live well and not toss yourself!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi washed up, changed into pyjamas and got into bed.</p><br/><p>Gars was full of tenderness. \u201cSweet dreams.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was afraid Gars would give him a good night kiss and replied honestly, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gars whispered, \u201cYoung Master, don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t hurt him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi blinked. What did this mean? Gars wouldn\u2019t hurt Greenton? Why?</p><br/><p>Gars arranged his quilt. \u201cHe might be rude and too affectionate but I know your intentions and won\u2019t disturb your plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gars knew what he was trying to do?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought that he needed someone to tell him his intentions. The key was this person still had things he wouldn\u2019t say. This made him anxious to death.</p><br/><p>Gars didn\u2019t explain his meaning to his master. \u201cGood night.\u201d Then he kissed the back of Xie Xi\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Okay, it seemed this person wasn\u2019t going to say it.</p><br/><p>After Gars left, Xie Xi lay down for half an hour. Then he lightly got out of bed and walked barefoot through the house.</p><br/><p>The castle was covered with thick carpets and there was no need to be afraid of the cold when walking with bare feet. It was just that nobles were well-dressed and would never be like him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had Gars follow him during the day and couldn\u2019t act alone. He could only sneak out at this time to investigate.</p><br/><p>He was very curious about his situation.</p><br/><p>The man who tried to assassinate him said he was a devil who climbed out of hell. Greenton advised him to stop and said he was willing to be a sacrifice. There was also a lot of information hidden in Gars\u2019 words.</p><br/><p>He always felt that Sein Hall was doing something big. If he didn\u2019t understand this matter, the game wouldn\u2019t end so easily.</p><br/><p>Survive for seven days, this task must have a lot of traps buried. If he acted perfunctory in the last few days, wouldn\u2019t he usher in a must-die ending? Xie Xi had played many games and knew a lot of routines. It was impossible to clear this game when the fog of the story wasn\u2019t completely resolved.</p><br/><p>The biggest mystery right now was the original owner of this body. What was Sein Hall planning?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to go to the study but he heard a conversation as he walked past a guest room. The castle was beautifully decorated but it was old and the soundproofing was ordinary.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi quietly moved back and stopped at the door.</p><br/><p>The wooden door was closed but there was a glimmer of candlelight coming from the gap. Sound also leaked out because of this gap. Xie Xi didn\u2019t have to stand too close to hear.</p><br/><p>It was Gars and Greenton. The two of them didn\u2019t fight during the day so they were fighting at night?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi held his breath and listened.</p><br/><p>Greenton opened his mouth first. \u201cWhere did Randy go?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no humility and respect in Gars\u2019 voice. \u201cMaster Greenton shouldn\u2019t ask about matters regarding our house.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was so arrogant yet Greenton still wasn\u2019t angry. \u201cAre you taking over for Randy now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Greenton paused before saying, \u201cSein can no longer go on like this. The church can\u2019t bear it any longer and they will\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gars scoffed. \u201cWhere were they when the young master was wronged? That woman had a violent nature and killed Young Master\u2019s mother. She also abused Young Master. Why shouldn\u2019t he retaliate?\u201d</p><br/><p>Greenton exclaimed, \u201cPrincess Xilin is dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if she\u2019s dead?\u201d Gars questioned. \u201cThe queen is still there, the duke is still there and the whole empire is still there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Greenton\u2019s voice was tense. \u201cWhat do you mean?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gars smiled. \u201cNo matter what Young Master does, I will accompany him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Greenton was angry. \u201cYou are harming him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gars\u2019 feminine voice replied, \u201cMy only wish is to make him happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The conversation between the two men stopped abruptly. Xie Xi was afraid to expose himself and quickly left. He returned to bed, drank from his cup and replayed the conversation he had heard.</p><br/><p>What did it mean? Sein wanted to retaliate against the whole empire? How would he retaliate\u2026</p><br/><p>This world had vampires so wouldn\u2019t there be even more deadly things?</p><br/><p>The sixth day.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s right eye twitched after he woke up. His intuition told him that today definitely wouldn\u2019t be simple. The current calm was definitely a precursor to the storm.</p><br/><p>Gars waited for him to get up and change clothes. Xie Xi had only slept for four or five hours last night and was a bit confused.</p><br/><p>Gars told him, \u201cYoung Master, if you are sleepy then sleep for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a hindrance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gars didn\u2019t say anything else and helped him wear his clothes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi noticed that today was a new black and white outfit. It was very cold with a fierce touch. However, the complicated style and embellished black roses made it 70% feminine and 30% charming.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stood in front of the mirror and looked at himself. The medieval outfits were based on beauty. Most of his previous clothes were dark blue, light blue, green, light green, etc. There were some dark colours but it wasn\u2019t like today. The polite neckline, the cuffs and the black rose on the chest gave it an oppressive feeling.</p><br/><p>Sein Hall\u2019s complexion was extremely white and his facial features were filled with a delicacy that walked between youth and adulthood. Then there was the pale lips and dark\u2026</p><br/><p>Wait.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finally noticed the abnormality.</p><br/><p>How did Sein Hall have black eyes? Xie Xi was Asian and having black eyes was very normal. However, Sein was European. Why would he have black eyes?</p><br/><p>Gars brought him a ring with a black pearl and kissed his white fingers. \u201cYoung Master, you are so beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi recovered and gathered the doubts in his heart.</p><br/><p>He felt that today wasn\u2019t simple.</p><br/><p>But it was actually okay\u2026 for the whole day, the three people were inseparable. Greenton kept his promise and accompanied Xie Xi everywhere. Gars didn\u2019t give Greenton a chance to get close to Xie Xi by also following.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was happy. The two of them were competing with each other and he had time to think carefully about what might happen.</p><br/><p>Evening arrived and nothing happened.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very puzzled. He could pass this way? In 30 hours, he could complete the mission?</p><br/><p>Would it be that simple? This damn broken game wasn\u2019t so easy.</p><br/><p>It was when they were saying goodnight that this abnormal game was finally broken.</p><br/><p>There was a loud bang and Xie Xi jumped. Gars immediately moved in front of him.</p><br/><p>Such a big move was like setting off a mine at home!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stabilized his heartbeat and stared\u2026</p><br/><p>The door of the castle was smashed to pieces and a silver figure plummeted through.</p><br/><p>Dust scattered. Under the moonlight, the silver-haired Aix-en\u2019s clothes were messy but everything else was the same. He strode forward, looking like ice.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t good. The creditor had come looking for him!</p><br/><p>The vampire ignored everyone and stared straight at Sein Hall. \u201cRandy has betrayed you. I will take you out of here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A dark shadow followed behind the vampire and revealed himself. Randy\u2019s neat tuxedo had obvious scratches but this didn\u2019t obscure his temperament. It just added a bit of wildness to his elegance.</p><br/><p>Randy sighed. \u201cI won\u2019t let you hurt him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019m going to give him eternal life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Randy\u2019s thin lips slightly curved. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en sneered before glancing at Xie Xi, his eyes deeply affectionate. \u201cYou don\u2019t want it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie XI: MMP (TL: Abbreviation for a swearing phrase)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It had only been a few days? He repelled the invading Haiqiu Kingdom and also caught the state teacher?</p><br/><p>Haiqiu, what was going on with you guys? Weren\u2019t you supposed to be fierce and brutal?</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t be easily beaten back to the abyss by the prince!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was full of curses and really wanted to beat up the Haiqiu state teacher. Couldn\u2019t he protect himself better? Why was he so easily caught?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was furious!</p><br/><p>The eldest prince raised an eyebrow and asked, \u201cResurrect a person?\u201d</p><br/><p>The secretary reported, \u201cI heard that it was a guard of the royal family. Previously when the sixth prince was attacked, the guard sacrificed himself to save the sixth prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe asked to repel the Haiqiu Kingdom for this small guard?\u201d</p><br/><p>The secretary whispered, \u201cThe sixth prince seems to love him dearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi prayed in his heart, \u2018Don\u2019t ask for the name, don\u2019t ask for the name, don\u2019t ask for the name!\u2019</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, this wasn\u2019t Xie Xi\u2019s dream and he couldn\u2019t shake the eldest prince.</p><br/><p>The eldest prince asked, \u201cWhat is the guard\u2019s name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSein Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun declared that his daddy was already a salted fish.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this name, the eldest prince\u2019s eyes slightly widened and a wave appeared in his calm eyes. \u201cWhat was he called?\u201d He repeated the question.</p><br/><p>The secretary had been following the eldest prince for a long time and knew the temperament of the prince. The eldest prince was forever calm and never moved by anything. Now\u2026</p><br/><p>He thought this in his heart but his mouth was honest. \u201cSein Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>The eldest prince\u2019s thin lips trembled. \u201cIs there any information about him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The secretary had naturally gathered information on Sein Hall. After all, the sixth prince was desperate to resurrect this person. The secretary naturally had to investigate and report to the eldest prince.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis subordinate will give it to you.\u201d The secretary opened his own communicator to transfer the information on Sein to the prince.</p><br/><p>The eldest prince couldn\u2019t wait for the transfer time and ordered, \u201cShow me directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>The secretary was surprised for a moment.</p><br/><p>The eldest prince frowned and his expression became abnormal. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The secretary\u2019s spirit returned due to this voice and he hurriedly said, \u201cI-I will.\u201d</p><br/><p>He opened Sein Hall\u2019s information.</p><br/><p>The photo showed a very good-looking person. His hair was like black ink while his white skin was like a pearl lying on black velvet, radiating a soft light. His facial features were beautiful and his eyes were bright. When he looked straight ahead, it seemed that the scenery of the seabed was reflected in his eyes.</p><br/><p>The eldest prince looked stunned.</p><br/><p>He thought it was nothing more than a ridiculous dream, an unrealistic illusion of a midnight dream. He thought there wasn\u2019t anyone in this world who could make him pay everything.</p><br/><p>Yet the dream had become reality.</p><br/><p>His name was Sein Hall. This was exactly the same as the dream.</p><br/><p>The prince also felt the desperation and pain of the dream.</p><br/><p>Losing him, obtaining him, suffering from loss\u2026 the ecstasy that couldn\u2019t be believed at the end.</p><br/><p>It was really all true. The person in the dream was real.</p><br/><p>Sein, Sein, Sein\u2026</p><br/><p>The eldest prince inwardly called out the name and couldn\u2019t remember where he was.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness?\u201d The secretary\u2019s voice called back his mind. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>The secretary had never seen the eldest prince look so strange. It was as if the prince was in an ice cellar, as if he had lost everything, as if his soul had been taken away\u2026</p><br/><p>The eldest prince jerked, his dark eyes hollow as his voice trembled uncontrollably. \u201cHe\u2019s dead, he..,\u201d died trying to save Sirius.</p><br/><p>The secretary\u2019s heart was beating quickly and he wasn\u2019t sure about the situation. Did the eldest prince and Sein Hall have a relationship? Wasn\u2019t the eldest prince lacking in emotions?</p><br/><p>The secretary replied, \u201cYes, Your Highness\u2026 The ship that the sixth prince took to the land was blown up and Sein Hall along with it. No traces of his bones are left.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were no bones left\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The eldest prince\u2019s head was buzzing as he muttered, \u201cIt was Father who did it, Father killed him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The secretary was shocked and paled. \u201cYour Highness, you\u2026 you\u2026\u201d This was too much. Still, he didn\u2019t dare say it out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe always had an interest in the land and wanted to be king of the world. However, Aix-en and I wouldn\u2019t fight and he couldn\u2019t help it\u2026\u201d Thus, he used the special guards to attack the sixth prince in order to arouse public outrage and stimulate Gars to go to war with the land.</p><br/><p>In fact, the eldest prince had long known this but he never acted due to his lack of emotion. Secondly, Sirius wasn\u2019t dead and he wouldn\u2019t let the old king do whatever he wanted.</p><br/><p>Now\u2026 the eldest prince felt a pain he had never experienced before. His heart seemed to be a messy mass of mud.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t surprised to hear this. There were only a few people who could mobilize the special guards.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t the princes then it could only be the old king.</p><br/><p>Originally, Xie Xi felt that the old king didn\u2019t have enough motives. He only understood after hearing the eldest prince\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>An ordinary father who had so many excellent sons wouldn\u2019t be able to shut his mouth from the joy.</p><br/><p>An ambitious emperor wasn\u2019t necessarily happy. In particular, things became more difficult once his sons came to power and took key positions.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince wasn\u2019t favoured so it was natural for the old king to sacrifice him for private desires.</p><br/><p>The secretary was scared. \u201cYour High, Highness, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The situation of the eldest prince was truly frightening. He was as pale as paper and his lips had lost all colour. His dark eyes were eerily black and the veins on his forehead revealed how much pain he was in.</p><br/><p>The emotions that had been missing for 20 years were rising up again and it was enough to drive a person crazy.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt very anxious but he didn\u2019t dare appear. He could only hide here nervously.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Randy\u2019s mental strength went against the sky. He gritted his teeth for more than a minute and finally calmed down.</p><br/><p>The secretary was covered in cold sweat as he asked, \u201cYour Highness, I will bring a doctor.\u201d</p><br/><p>The eldest prince waved his hand. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The eldest prince stood him. He was quiet but no longer as cold and ruthless as before. He said, \u201cI will go and see Sixth Brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>They left and the anxious Xie Xi also followed.</p><br/><p>The previously empty sixth prince\u2019s palace was now bustling. He won a big victory and there were streams of people coming to congratulate him. The old king also gave him countless rewards.</p><br/><p>The eldest prince drove away the outsiders as soon as he came, giving a reasonable justification. \u201cSixth Brother is still recovering. You should go back first.\u201d It was a big victory but the sixth prince had been injured. This was inevitable. After all, Haiqiu weren\u2019t vegetarians.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was also worried about the sixth prince. He just sneaked in when he smelt a faint cold aroma.</p><br/><p>It was the fourth prince\u2019s medicine.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought of the wonderful effects of the medicine and sighed with relief. The injuries of the sixth prince wouldn\u2019t be a problem and he just needed a good rest.</p><br/><p>He thought this but couldn\u2019t help feeling guilty after seeing the sixth prince\u2019s pale face.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince dove alone into thousands of enemy forces, killed the other side and captured the important state teacher. It sounded light but it would be really hard to describe the price that the sixth prince paid.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>Why were they so persistent?</p><br/><p>The eldest prince, the sixth prince and also the fifth prince\u2026</p><br/><p>The sixth prince could do things so smoothly because the fifth prince was behind him. The fifth prince might be alienated from the political centre in recent years but he had the power of his mother. He helped the sixth prince and the sixth prince managed to return triumphantly.</p><br/><p>The person was dead. Why didn\u2019t they give up?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t understand it. He never had such blazing feelings.</p><br/><p>The eldest prince came over and waved his hand when he saw the weak sixth prince. \u201cHave a good rest. There is no need to be polite.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince stayed in bed and described his experience. He understated it but Xie Xi was still shocked and terrified by his words.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun rushed over and rubbed his small head against the sixth prince. \u201cYou worked hard, worked hard. Fortunately, your eyes weren\u2019t hurt\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really wanted to pull this little bastard back. Was the focus the eyes? The actual person didn\u2019t matter?</p><br/><p>After the explanation, the eldest prince opened his mouth. \u201cWhere is the Haiqiu state teacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince replied, \u201cHe is with Fifth Brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>The eldest prince was surprised. \u201cFIfth Brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, the teacher was injured and Fifth Brother took him to be treated. They should be back soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the fifth prince came back with a middle-aged merman.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hated this state teacher. If looks could kill, this state teacher would\u2019ve been torn to eight pieces!</p><br/><p>The state teacher of Haiqiu looked like an ordinary merman on the seabed. If there was a difference with the merpeople of the underwater kingdom, it was the webbing between his fingers.</p><br/><p>The state teacher had been treated but his face was still blue and purple. It had presumably eaten a fist. The eldest prince stared at him and asked, \u201cCan you really let a dead person live again?\u201d</p><br/><p>The state teacher didn\u2019t reply. Then the sixth prince\u2019s eyes looked over him and he immediately shrank back with fright. \u201cI-I can but there, there are a few conditions\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The eldest prince\u2019s lips thinned and he clenched his fists. \u201cWhat are the conditions?\u201d</p><br/><p>The state teacher didn\u2019t dare speak and just stared at the sixth prince.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cSay it!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was unknown what he experienced but the state teacher was completely terrified. \u201cT-The death time can\u2019t exceed 15 days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s teeth really hurt. They just needed to hold on for two or three more days. The Haiqiu were really weak!</p><br/><p>The state teacher added, \u201cYou must have something belonging to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was too simple. Sein Hall\u2019s residence had long been sealed by the fifth and sixth princes.</p><br/><p>Finally, the state teacher gave the third condition. \u201c\u2026There must be the blood of at least three people who love him deeply.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun exclaimed, \u201cThree? That\u2019s easy. Daddy has six people madly in love with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to murder a cat.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince and sixth prince had obviously known these three conditions. Now that they listened again, they started frowning and looked slightly depressed.</p><br/><p>The state teacher added, \u201cIf you can\u2019t find three people then he can\u2019t be resurrected.\u201d The fifth prince looked at the sixth prince. \u201cSein\u2019s family won\u2019t work. The third person\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They finally caught the state teacher only to have their hope cut off at the last step.</p><br/><p>Three people, where were they going to find this third person?</p><br/><p>Then the eldest prince abruptly opened his mouth. \u201cUse my blood.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince and sixth prince stared at him with astonishment.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince explained, \u201cBig Brother, you must love Sein\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The eldest prince interrupted him. \u201cJust try it.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He needed some time to think. He needed to think about him and Jiang Xie\u2026 um\u2026</p><br/><p>Too many sweet memories surged in. Xie Xi could only desperately think about the souls and Jiang Xie\u2019s identity in order to calm down.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t the simple Teacher Jiang in his dreams but a designer who made countless worlds.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie lost all his memories in the dream. However, designer X had experienced countless years, had many experiences and memories and knew countless things\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know him. The 60 years might\u2019ve been a lifetime for Xie Xi but they were just a few fingers for Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, Xie Xi believed in Jiang Xie\u2019s words. He believed the two people in the dream were real.</p><br/><p>Without Jiang Xie, he wouldn\u2019t be able to imagine such a beautiful dream.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that Jiang Xie was the one who pulled him out of the past and gave him a new life, giving him new possibilities and a life he couldn\u2019t imagine.</p><br/><p>It was really great.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi whispered, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHrmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>After 60 years, Jiang Xie still remembered his \u2018setting\u2019. He asked, \u201cWhat did you just say? My ears are still buzzing.\u201d They were previously shocked by the big rooster\u2019s scream.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi remembered this and approached with a smile. \u201cThank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie suddenly bent his head and the two people almost kissed. Xie Xi\u2019s heart was tense. They had done everything in the past but after waking up\u2026</p><br/><p>The old rascal actually didn\u2019t take advantage of this opportunity. His eyes fell on Xie Xi\u2019s lips before he moved away. \u201cThere is no need for thanks. I should be the one thanking you for letting me experience such a dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi quickly got back to the topic. \u201cThe dream was about my life and you helped me emerge from my past.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis dream was also full of what I longed for.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned and asked Jiang Xie, \u201cTeacher, before\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cMy parents have been dead since I was born. Before I came to the Central World, all the people I knew had died.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt a tug on his heart.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie continued, \u201cThe only thing I wanted was for someone to grow old with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>They met at the best age and went together towards the end of their lives. Jiang Xie always remembered that when he was about to die, Xie Xi pretended to be calm but his heart had already gone with Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t even tell Xie Xi to live well. He didn\u2019t want Xie Xi to be alone, nor could he bear it if Xie Xi wasn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie opened his mouth. \u201cI just said it wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had decades of getting along with this person and instantly felt that he was going to speak nonsense. Sure enough, Comrade Old Jiang had a calm face as he stated, \u201cTo be precise, my only desire is to grow old with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes curved. \u201cTeacher might be disappointed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Teacher Jiang in the dream wouldn\u2019t panic if he heard this. He would definitely say, \u201cChild, you are very greedy. Do you want to be young with me forever?\u201d</p><br/><p>Now\u2026 he looked at the -365 goodwill and didn\u2019t dare say it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi continued, \u201cThe Central World has eternal youth. Wanting to grow up together is a very rare thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned before he couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cThen we will be young forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled at him. Jiang Xie retreated and cut it even shorter. \u201cWe will be together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi laughed. \u201cLet\u2019s leave the world first and wait until you remember everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was very concerned about this. \u201cWhat happened between us previously?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t try to fool him and only told him, \u201cDon\u2019t think about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a tacit understanding caused by the dream. If Xie Xi had said these words previously, Jiang Xie would only be more curious and then cranky as he wanted to find out the reason.</p><br/><p>Now\u2026 he felt it instinctively.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was still worried about his thoughts and diverted his attention. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much time has passed in reality.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie answered, \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be too long. The sleeping pod has no nutrition equipment. If the dream is too long, we would\u2019ve starved to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>The game field was limited to 72 hours and they probably hadn\u2019t exceeded this time yet.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suddenly had a thought. \u201cWould we have woken up if our bodies feel hungry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur spirit would be dead before our body became hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought it was wonderful. \u201cThe decades in the dream felt very long.\u2019</p><br/><p>In fact, after waking up from the game, many things about the 60 years of life were hazy. Most things were remembered but in front of reality, the dream truly became dreamlike.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked him, \u201cHow do you understand the concept of time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had come into contact with some philosophical books and wondered, \u201cIs it a human feeling?\u201d The concept of time was created by humans. Humans always felt that time was real and constantly moving forward. In fact, this might only be derived from human thoughts.</p><br/><p>Humans couldn\u2019t understand different forms of time so time could only be like this. Like little bugs running across the ground, it was impossible to understand with a human mind.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cYou have to remember that your time isn\u2019t equal to other people\u2019s time and the truth of others isn\u2019t necessarily your truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned. He understood some parts but not others.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled at him. \u201cWhen you have a chance, you should try and upgrade to a designer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about Love to the Left or Right and the six princes and had no interest in being a designer. \u201cExplain it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce you become a designer, you will be able to see more possibilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>This warmed Xie Xi\u2019s heart. \u201cWill I understand more about time and reality?\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Jiang Xie shook his head. \u201cThere will be even more things that you don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is because beyond the light, the darkness is infinite.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned. Jiang Xie changed the topic. \u201cLet\u2019s go, it\u2019s time for us to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had many questions he wanted to ask but also felt he couldn\u2019t. A designer? A role close to a god, wouldn\u2019t he be able to see further? Xie Xi\u2019s heart rate somewhat increased.</p><br/><p>The rest area of \u2018dream come true\u2019 was quiet beyond words.</p><br/><p>In the previous two projects, everyone who survived was thankful. They might\u2019ve lacked an arm or leg but they were vibrant.</p><br/><p>There were very few people in this rest area and those who were present were sitting apart while looking like they lost their souls.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned and could understand their mood.</p><br/><p>Waking up from such a dream would indeed make the person lose the ability to face reality. So what if they could tell the falsehood of the dream? The reality of waking up was even colder.</p><br/><p>They might think that staying in the dream was a better idea and regret waking up.</p><br/><p>After all, in the beginning, Xie Xi thought it would be nice if he didn\u2019t have the fatal injury immunity.</p><br/><p>It was Jiang Xie who pulled him out of those thoughts.</p><br/><p>It was a dream but the two people were the truth.</p><br/><p>These words woke Xie Xi up.</p><br/><p>At this time, a pale women who Xie Xi knew came out. She was the young woman who survived the I love you VS shameless game.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi remembered that her name was Tan Lei.</p><br/><p>In the cruel game, Tan Lei had always been calm and she was unscathed at the end. Xie Xi\u2019s impression of her was a strong and calm woman.</p><br/><p>Now she was haggard to the extreme.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi vaguely felt that something wasn\u2019t quite right\u2026</p><br/><p>He turned to look at Jiang Xie and Jiang Xie shook his head.</p><br/><p>Tan Lei stopped walking and stared up at the dark sky.</p><br/><p>There was no light in the game field and it was as dead as an underground grave.</p><br/><p>She stared at the sky in a dazed manner and it was unknown what she was thinking. Perhaps it was the beauty of the dream, the cruelty of the past or the confusion and despair of the future\u2026</p><br/><p>Finally, she closed her eyes, pulled out a sharp dagger and stabbed her own heart.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi called out, \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie raised his hand. Xie Xi knew Jiang Xie\u2019s meaning but\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cShe is already dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t die under the dagger just now but died a long time ago. Jiang Xie stopped Xie Xi because he knew that no one could save a person who was already dead.</p><br/><p>Tan Lei walked out of the game but lost her faith in living and didn\u2019t have the courage to continue.</p><br/><p>There was a bitter taste in Xie Xi\u2019s heart. Jiang Xie knew how soft Xie Xi was and comforted him. \u201cFor her, death is a good thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suddenly grabbed Jiang Xie\u2019s hand. Jiang Xie was surprised. Xie Xi didn\u2019t say anything and only gripped the hand tightly.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie became as soft as cotton as he thought that Xie Xi had seen Tan Lei and thought of himself.</p><br/><p>This type of game was very tormenting to people\u2019s spirits. The stronger the person, the more they couldn\u2019t help thinking about it.</p><br/><p>Trying to wake up and break the dream, trying to get out of the game alive, but it was actually better not to come out.</p><br/><p>This type of loss and despair, Jiang Xie knew it better than anyone else.</p><br/><p>He said, \u201cDon\u2019t think too much, you are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished saying \u2018very strong\u2019 when Xie Xi opened his mouth. He looked up at Jiang Xie and asked, \u201cHow did you endure it previously?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned. He hadn\u2019t expected Xie Xi to be worried about him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was filled with pain. \u201cYou have encountered this type of game many times. Teacher, how did you endure?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was shocked for a while before laughing. \u201cDon\u2019t you know how powerful your husband is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Okay, in this matter, Old Jiang was second to none. No one would dare to rob the throne from him!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie and Xie Xi settled the dead Tan Lei but couldn\u2019t do anything for the rest. A mental problem wasn\u2019t easily fixed.</p><br/><p>After completing three projects, they could leave the game field. Xie Xi still had the side task of repairing 100 people.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t anxious about this. Instead, he was more concerned about his main task.</p><br/><p>Main task (1): Admire the newly born sun.</p><br/><p>They were entering the underground labyrinth but he still had no clue about this task.</p><br/><p>The main task was also a guiding task. He had more than one side tasks and it was estimated that there were several main tasks, yet he still hadn\u2019t completed the first one.</p><br/><p>He was thinking about the newborn sun when Xie Xi and Jiang Xie exited.</p><br/><p>There was an announcement. \u201cCongratulations on passing the trial of the game field. You have received the key to enter the underground labyrinth! Please go to the underground labyrinth and find your way home.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a lot of information and it seemed that the underground labyrinth was the last stage. It was estimated that most people\u2019s main tasks were aimed here and it was just the method of clearing it that was unknown.</p><br/><p>At the end of the announcement, Xie Xi and Jiang Xie were sent somewhere else.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his eyes and was shocked.</p><br/><p>After spending decades in a normal life, Xie Xi\u2019s mood was very complicated after he saw the zombie arms and legs!</p><br/><p>He was a student and doing research. Why did he have to dance with zombies?</p><br/><p>The group of four half zombies rushed over, like motherless children seeing milk. \u201cBoss! We missed you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d There were so many people here. He didn\u2019t want to be treated as a psychopath!</p><br/><p>The one-legged Zhu Li hopped over, \u201cBoss, I want legs! I want to be a two-legged beast!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t ask anything else. It had probably happened in the third project.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gave him a leg and Cao Yan and Zhuo Liu also came over. Their situation was basically the same. They were missing an arm or leg and sought him out.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi repaired them one by one and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s with these arms and legs?\u201d The zombie arms and legs were piled up like a mountain. It could probably last the group of four for a few years!</p><br/><p>Zhu Li hesitated before saying, \u201cThat\u2026 we found a few compatriots\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know that while he was dreaming, he had become the mysterious leader of a large organization\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

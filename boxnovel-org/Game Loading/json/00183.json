A little look would tear apart this lie. Not to mention, this was an alumni party and there were many acquaintances who could ruin Xie Xi\u2019s lie.</p><br/><p>Strangely enough, none of the students came near Xie Xi and they didn\u2019t hear what he said.</p><br/><p>There was a clear line between Xie Xi and his classmates, as if he was invisible to them.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the alumni gathering was across generations and classmates didn\u2019t stay together.</p><br/><p>For example, Jiang Xie had already graduated when Xie Xi entered school and was Xie Xi\u2019s senior.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew Jiang Xie\u2019s name because he was often compared to Jiang Xie in school.</p><br/><p>Compared to the taciturn Xie Xi, Jiang Xie was humorous and good at talking. It was difficult for people to refuse his closeness.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was surprised after hearing that Xie Xi majored in law. \u201cHow can an emotional person like you learn such a rational occupation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled at him. \u201cNo wonder why you are estranged from your classmates.\u201d An emotional person studying an occupation that was all rational, there was bound to be some distance.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard this and his mouth tightened even further.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cThey are also protecting you. After all, rational people are dangerous for an emotional person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled and glanced up at Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled at him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi became warmer. He wasn\u2019t isolated because of his gender but Jiang Xie found his sense of loss and thought of such a warm reason to comfort him. If Xie Xi was really emotional, he would be really happy at this moment. But he wasn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was somewhat lost. He didn\u2019t know why his mood had improved.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie liked wine and asked Xie Xi, \u201cCan you drink?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had never drunk alcohol before. \u201cI can try it.\u201d A rational person rejected alcohol. Something that confused the brain had no value in existence.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled at him. \u201cHow can we be emotional if we don\u2019t drink?\u201d Then he took Xie Xi\u2019s hand and went for a wine tasting.</p><br/><p>The alumni meeting had ordinary food that was more good-looking than delicious but the wind was good. It didn\u2019t have a bad style and the taste wasn\u2019t the same.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie drank seven or eight different types with Xie Xi and Xie Xi became drunk.</p><br/><p>As a rational, he still sat up straight and looked serious. It was only his big eyes that showed people he was drunk.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was only slightly drunk and waved a hand in front of the other person\u2019s eyes. \u201cAre you drunk?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke seriously, \u201cArticle 221, serious casualties caused by accidents in production and business units\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie laughed. \u201cThere are thousands of reactions to being drunk but this is the first time I\u2019ve seen someone recite laws and regulations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was still earnestly going through them and reached Article 222. This number 222 was cute enough.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie raised him up. \u201cI\u2019ll send you home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was still seriously reciting\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie suppressed a smile. \u201cWhere is your home?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had started to recite Article 224.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t ask him and went to find Xie Xi\u2019s classmate. The rational classmate was very cold. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>In this way, Xie Xi quickly placed himself on Jiang Xie\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes were full of laughter. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to my house first.\u201d This person was accidentally drunk and couldn\u2019t be left alone.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had reached over 300 when he fell asleep in the aircraft.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sat beside him and couldn\u2019t suppress the curve of his lips. This was a very interesting junior, serious and cute.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s residence wasn\u2019t far away and they soon arrived. \u201cWake up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his eyes. They were black and shining but unfortunately, they weren\u2019t focused.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked him, \u201cCan you get off on your own?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s head fell and he continued to sleep. Jiang Xie chuckled and simply picked up this person sideways, bringing him inside.</p><br/><p>He knew this was a bit overdone but there was no way. Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t leave this person alone and didn\u2019t want him sleeping in the aircraft. Even if his aircraft was spacious enough to be comfortable.</p><br/><p>After going upstairs, Jiang Xie placed this person in his bedroom.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t think crooked thoughts. Jiang Xie didn\u2019t have a bad mind. It was just that his spare room hadn\u2019t been used for a few years and wasn\u2019t cleaned up. Nobody could sleep in there.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi slept on the bed while Jiang Xie brought out a cleaning ball and placed it on Xie Xi\u2019s clothes. This way, the person and clothes could be washed clean without water. Then Master Jiang Xie went to sleep on the sofa.</p><br/><p>The next day, Xie Xi woke up to find himself sleeping in a strange bed and was completely shocked.</p><br/><p>For a rational, a one-night stand was a common thing and there was nothing to worry about.</p><br/><p>However, Xie Xi never had one. He was a rational person but he was incompatible with rationals. He never succumbed to desire and placed strict demands on his body and mind. He hated the rational people\u2019s so-called obedience to physical desires.</p><br/><p>Now\u2026 He didn\u2019t even know who he slept with.</p><br/><p>Then Jiang Xie emerged, his hair still wet from the shower. Xie Xi\u2019s head buzzed. He slept with an emotional person and actually ruined such a gentle, funny and excellent senior.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t like rational people and deliberately hid his gender, yet he ended up doing such a stupid thing.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw his expression and smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t think too much. You were drunk last night and kept reciting laws and regulations. I became impotent after hearing these things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up with dazed eyes.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t keep teasing this person and explained, \u201cI slept on the sofa last night. You can connect to the indoor monitoring if you don\u2019t believe me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finally let go of his worries and he was glad and afraid.</p><br/><p>He could no longer be close to Jiang Xie or he would hurt this person.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi got up. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI should be the one to apologize. I gave you too much wine last night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cNo, it was my fight. I can\u2019t drink and also became drunk, troubling Senior\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t wait for him to finish. \u201cThen both of us are clear. Let\u2019s eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eat? Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare stay long and hurried out of bed, head hanging low. \u201cNo, I shave to leave first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi rushed out of the bedroom, entered the living room and went out the door without even changing shoes.</p><br/><p>Then Jiang Xie\u2019s senses returned. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a pity that the other person had already disappeared. He smiled for a long time. Had he scared this person? Well, it was normal to be afraid after getting drunk and waking up in a stranger\u2019s bed.</p><br/><p>Then Jiang Xie remembered something and hit his head with annoyance. \u201cI forgot to get his contact details!\u201d</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t just this then Jiang Xie wouldn\u2019t remember this person for nine rounds.</p><br/><p>The second encounter was at the wedding of a common teacher.</p><br/><p>The 70 year old emotional professor lived with his own style. At such an old age, he met his true love, a 60 year old emotional painter. The two quickly fell in love and insisted on holding a wedding so that their names would be engraved into the other person\u2019s lives.</p><br/><p>In this sacred church, Jiang Xie saw Xie Xi. Xie Xi stood in the crowd but it was like he was standing on an isolated island. He was so lonely that it made Jiang Xie distressed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t help walking through the crowd to this person\u2019s side. \u201cWe meet again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned for a moment to see Jiang Xie before his eyes obviously lowered. \u201cSenior\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie made an \u2018shhh\u2019 sound. \u201cThey are making their wedding vows. We have to be quiet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi solemnly nodded and focused on the elderly couple in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you willing to be a companion to him in this round, to love him and be loyal to him. whether he is poor, sick or disabled until he walks into reincarnation. Are you willing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two elderly men replied in unison, \u201cI do.\u201d</p><br/><p>They finished speaking and applause that represented heartfelt blessings rang out, infecting everyone present.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie whispered, \u201cThey are so good.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, Xie Xi didn\u2019t understand it. This cycle was almost finished. Why did they get married? In a few short years, they would forget each other.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie suddenly asked him, \u201cIf I meet a person I like, no matter how long it takes, I want to spend the rest of my time with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi expressed his doubts. \u201cIs it good even if you don\u2019t meet again in the next reincarnation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis type of heart beat, I don\u2019t want to miss it for even a minute or a second.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned because he couldn\u2019t understand. Jiang Xie smiled and leaned close to him. \u201cYou sometimes behave like a rational.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi straightened his back and thought he had been seen through. After all, a rational disguising as an emotional must be as funny as a clown to true emotional people.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Jiang Xie just sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t try to learn from rationals. They are boring and rigid. Don\u2019t change yourself to cater to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s frown deepened. He knew Jiang Xie\u2019s meaning. Jiang Xie thought that as an emotional studying law, Xie Xi was with rationals for a long time and became like a rational in order to socialize with them.</p><br/><p>In fact, Xie Xi was a thorough rational. He wanted to tell the truth.</p><br/><p>Then Jiang Xie said, \u201cDon\u2019t question your gender. An emotional is never worse than a rational.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi swallowed back his words. He couldn\u2019t say it because he vaguely felt that Jiang Xie had an aversion to rational people. Thus, Xie Xi couldn\u2019t mention his gender.</p><br/><p>What was this? Xie Xi didn\u2019t know why he wasn\u2019t the same as others from birth. He wasn\u2019t accepted by rational or liked by emotional. He studied hard and tried to get good grades, but this was in exchange for his classmates\u2019 indifference and alienation.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt more than once that it would be good if he was an emotional. An emotional like Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>This time, Jiang Xie got a contact method.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hesitated for a long time before becoming friends with this person.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to have any more contact with Jiang Xie s that Jiang Xie would always think he was an emotional. If they got too close, he wouldn\u2019t be able to pretend.</p><br/><p>There were too many flaws and places that couldn\u2019t be understood. Even if Xie Xi didn\u2019t speak, his behavior was obvious enough for an emotional.</p><br/><p>If Jiang Xie knew that he was pretending to be an emotional\u2026 He was bound to hate Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very uneasy but he couldn\u2019t find a suitable opportunity to confess to Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>How could Jiang Xie know any of this?</p><br/><p>He had long been fascinated by this school junior. Whether it was a direct confession or slowly boiling a frog, he had to catch this person. Then he would hold a wedding that was more romantic than Old Liu (the 70 year old professor)!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie took the initiative and Xie Xi didn\u2019t have an opportunity to refuse. He tried to figure out how an emotional would react. He remembered the \u2018formula\u2019 with his super memory and tried his best to act as an emotional.</p><br/><p>In fact, this was really flawed. If it wasn\u2019t for Jiang Xie\u2019s filter, he would quickly see Xie Xi\u2019s gender.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the filter was too thick. Jiang Xie only thought that Xie Xi was a pitiful person who had been polluted by rationals. He tried to \u2018purify\u2019 this person and even found the super-rational remarks cute.</p><br/><p>Then three months later, Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t help himself. They sat in a romantic and beautiful wedding and he asked, \u201cWhat do you think of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked down and asked, \u201cSenior, do you want to fall in love with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>This stunned Jiang Xie and he smiled. \u201cYou are really a very rational emotional person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s lips thinned and he looked at the food and drinks in front of him like he was seeing monsters.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at him with gentle eyes and a soft smile. \u201cI am thinking about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke bluntly and laid his heart out before the other person.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was afraid to scare this person and reassured him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I thought hard about it. I want forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his mouth. It was extremely difficult to speak and his heart was pulled, causing pain to surge through him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart cooled as he thought he had been rejected.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi explained in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have been lying to you\u2026 I\u2019m actually a rational person.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

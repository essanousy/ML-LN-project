Xie Xi insisted, \u201cYou will feel easier if I help you fix it.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, the more he didn\u2019t care about going to Vermilion Bird palace, the more at ease Azure Dragon felt. In particular, Xie Xi was thinking about his injuries and this made Azure Dragon feel unparalleled warmth.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really cared about him. Azure Dragon realized this feeling couldn\u2019t be faked.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon held his hand and told him, \u201cCome this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded and followed.</p><br/><p>There was an empty space outside the palace. Azure Dragon stood in the middle of it and closed his eyes. Mist rose and then a dragon more than 10 metres long appeared in the open space.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared. The dragon shone with a faint light and his heart turned, eyes like a heavy ocean. Beautiful\u2026</p><br/><p>It was an extremely magnificent beauty\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was speechless for a long time.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon\u2019s eyes were very gentle because he was afraid of frightening Xie Xi. He asked in a low voice, \u201cAre you afraid?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi marvelled for a long time before replying, \u201cSo beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stretched out his arms and asked, \u201cCan I touch?\u201d</p><br/><p>The dragon bowed his head and sent himself to the little palm. He was very hard but gave off a warm temperature. Xie Xi smiled, eyes full of love. The body of Azure Dragon was enough to cause a little monster to faint but Xie Xi\u2026</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon was in a particularly good mood.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi woke up from the \u2018beauty.\u2019 \u201cYes, where are you hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon was too big and Xie Xi could only see parts of him. The dragon moved his body and Xie Xi saw the bloody tail.</p><br/><p>For a moment, Xie Xi\u2019s heart rose in his chest. He ran a few steps and looked at the bloody flesh with a pale and distressed face. There was this much pain from the scales falling off. To endure such pain every day\u2026</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon moved back his tail, not wanting Xie Xi to stare at it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi calmed down and declared, \u201cI\u2019ll try to repair it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>The scales were collected and the doctor quickly sent it over. He watched Xie Xi anxiously.</p><br/><p>They all sincerely admired Sage Azure Dragon. If he recovered, they would dedicate their lives to Xie Xi, not to mention he would soon become their master!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi used Repair after determining the location.</p><br/><p>The moment he did, Xie Xi felt the strength of his body being exhausted.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t the first time he used Repair and he had used it countless times to save countless people. It had never been like this. He repaired only one scale and exhausted all his strength.</p><br/><p>The doctor shouted, \u201cIt worked! Lord Azure Dragon\u2019s scale is really repaired!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was unsteady and staggered, almost falling. Azure Dragon turned into a human form and hugged him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi leaned into his arms and gasped. Azure Dragon immediately gave him medicine. The moment he ate the medicine, Xie Xi felt his strength rapidly recover.</p><br/><p>He was soon able to stand up.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon asked him, \u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cWhat did you give me?\u201d If there were more of this tonic available, he could repair the dragon\u2019s scales in one go.</p><br/><p>The doctor had a big mouth. \u201cLord Xie Xi, it has gathered the spiritual aura of the world for 500 years before forming a pill. There are only 56 of them in this world!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He felt like he had swallowed 500 years!</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t give him a rare treasure like it was a jelly bean! Jiang Xie, how could this unlucky person be so wasteful?! Xie Xi thought of the stingy second prince and suddenly felt that he had realized a type of truth.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon told him, \u201cThis spell is too big for you. Don\u2019t use it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine if I can repair all your scales.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon smiled at him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him. \u201cYou\u2019re always hurting so isn\u2019t it urgent?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel pain when I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was in the mood to save words of love\u2026 it seemed that his pain was really lighter!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi estimated that the power of the soul was too strong and the repair consumed too much, causing him to become physically exhausted. He had to upgrade his own cultivation so he could repair Azure Dragon\u2019s scales as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was no longer tired but Azure Dragon didn\u2019t mention the matter of going to Vermilion Bird Palace.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had an idea in his mind. If he didn\u2019t make things clear, no one could feel at ease.</p><br/><p>He suggested, \u201cLet\u2019s go to Vermilion Bird Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon paused.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>He took the initiative but Azure Dragon actually hesitated. \u201cActually\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt must be clarified.\u201d Xie Xi insisted. \u201cThe misunderstanding should be cleared. The more things drag out, the deeper the misunderstanding will be. Thus, it is good for everyone to speak as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon felt ashamed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI actually doubted you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go. I will go directly to Vermilion Bird and clear things\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was scared to death!</p><br/><p>He quickly interrupted, \u201cWhat is the point of you going there alone? He won\u2019t believe your words. Let\u2019s just go together to Vermilion Bird Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Who would thought that the calm and sensible Azure Dragon would suddenly change his mind and blame himself for doubting Xie Xi?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really didn\u2019t know what to say!</p><br/><p>However, this was only temporary. In order for the two people to have peace of mind, they needed to talk face to face!</p><br/><p>The more Xie Xi was determined to go to Vermilion Bird Palace, the happier Azure Dragon became. On the way, the smile on his face couldn\u2019t be suppressed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cDon\u2019t say anything after we arrive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi explained, \u201cIn order to leave enough face for Sage Vermilion Bird, we should talk when there are only the three of us left.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon understood. \u201cIt makes sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>They both lived on the Holy Mountain and too many things would be involved if there was an incident.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are still thoughtful.\u201d Azure Dragon praised and Xie Xi almost couldn\u2019t act anymore!</p><br/><p>Fortunately, they finally arrived at Vermilion Bird Palace.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon and Xie Xi came back together, causing the birds to feel surprised.</p><br/><p>The man with the colourful tail feathers greeted them. \u201cHello Sage Azure Dragon and Lord Xie Xi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cHas Lord Vermilion Bird woken up yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe just woke up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed with relief. \u201cI\u2019ll go see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man with the colourful tail feathers looked at Sage Azure Dragon.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned his back to Azure Dragon and spoke to the bird, \u201cWe have to meet and talk about business.\u201d</p><br/><p>The male bird was stunned and fell into Xie Xi\u2019s pit. Indeed, breaking off an engagement was something they needed to have a good talk about.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw that the colourful bird was hooked and said, \u201cDon\u2019t come over. It is better if we talk in private.\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, no one should listen to this type of private matter that involved the sages. Rather, it would be a disaster if they heard it.</p><br/><p>As for Vermilion Bird\u2019s safety, they weren\u2019t worried. The sage had been restored and with his physique, he couldn\u2019t be injured.</p><br/><p>The people were sent away and Xie Xi went to see Vermilion Bird with Azure Dragon.</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird was stunned when the door opened and they entered together. Xie Xi said nothing and closed the door when he entered the room.</p><br/><p>It was a room with only the three of them. As he expected, the eyes of Azure Dragon and Vermilion Bird changed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed with relief and opened his mouth. \u201cDo you know what to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie could stimulate the memories depending on the situation. He could give Azure Dragon a set of memories and Vermilion Bird another set of memories, making them think that Xie Xi had rejected the other person.</p><br/><p>It was for this reason that Xie Xi didn\u2019t fear them meeting.</p><br/><p>How could they have any thoughts after seeing the other person be \u2018kicked away?\u2019</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was silent and Xie Xi glanced at him. Azure Dragon and Vermilion Bird both came over to hug him!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He pushed them away!</p><br/><p>The dragon and bird\u2019s arms were empty but they weren\u2019t angry. \u201cI forgot that I had two bodies. I just wanted to hold you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at the Jiang Xie to one side and then the Jiang Xie on the other side. He guessed that Jiang Xie would appear in both bodies and share the memories but it felt strange actually seeing it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked him, \u201cWhat is your situation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie used Azure Dragon\u2019s body to speak shameless words. \u201cYour husband can control two bodies and give you doubt the love. Are you happy?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

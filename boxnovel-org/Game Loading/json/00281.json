It seemed that his prayer didn\u2019t take effect. The little lion was 100% considered him a slag.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Xie Xi was prepared. He naturally left a back hand for himself before daring to act as a slag. It felt really good to write his own emotional summary!</p><br/><p>Now there was only Leo in this small world and he didn\u2019t need to panic.</p><br/><p>He just had to coax this lion!</p><br/><p>The current situation was estimated to be after several years had passed. Xie Xi glanced around and felt it likely that his Rose Palace had been burned. Leo was like a god of war from the heavens who came to destroy his sinister ambitions.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help sighing. He not only learned to write his own emotional summary but he saw Jiang Xie\u2019s continuation with one glance!</p><br/><p>It was great\u2026 bah!</p><br/><p>Who wanted this ability?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie looked down at him condescendingly, the golden pupils reflecting the blazing fire. The original bright and innocent boy was eroded by hardships and transformed into a cold adult.</p><br/><p>There was a bang as Jiang Xie slammed the spear into the jade floor in front of Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>The jade was hard but brittle. Cracks instantly appeared in an unsightly pattern, like skin cracking.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s golden eyes under the eyelashes were filled with deep hate. \u201cXie Xi, when you tricked me, did you ever think this day would come?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d The thought of today was why Xie Xi dared to act as a slag.</p><br/><p>Of course, his face was disheartened and he didn\u2019t speak a single word.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie grabbed at his collar and almost lifted him up. \u201cI was really blind. I thought that this violent tyrant was the gentlest person in the world!</p><br/><p>\u2018Little lion, you really have a lot of private set up. The wise Beast King Rose became a tyrant?\u2019</p><br/><p>Okay, there must be sufficient reason to dethrone the king.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi still didn\u2019t say anything, his sorrow greater than his fear of death.</p><br/><p>This apparently irritated the lion who wanted revenge. He broke his outward appearance and despised Xie XI. \u201dWhy? Your national teacher is dead and you don\u2019t want to live anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi received the signal. It seemed that the fake national teacher was dead. This was better!</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I will let you die so easily?\u201d Jiang Xie was cold. \u201cYou deceived me, teased me and insulted me. I will repay you twice over!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could only silently vent in his heart, \u2018Little lion, if you really catch a villain, please don\u2019t talk nonsense with him. Killing is the best way. You will be killed like this!\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course, how could Jiang Xie be willing to kill him? These harsh words were because of love and hate.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was imprisoned in a vehicle.</p><br/><p>He was imprisoned but it wasn\u2019t filled with the sentimentality of Houqing. He was really chained around the neck and wrist and forced to stay in the prison vehicle.</p><br/><p>There was also a group of soldiers watching over him like they were escorting a major prisoner.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, they didn\u2019t go along the main streets and he didn\u2019t get any tomatoes or rotten vegetables thrown at him.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Xie Xi\u2019s body had been restored. As one of the strongest people on this land, the potholes on the road didn\u2019t make him vomit out his internal organs.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi never saw Leo along the way.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, he was a prisoner and Leo was the crowned king. For what reason would he see Xie Xi?</p><br/><p>After arriving in the Lion Country, Xie Xi was finally brought along the streets.</p><br/><p>There were six rows of soldiers holding weapons so the onlookers didn\u2019t dare to throw vegetables.</p><br/><p>However, their yells were endless.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill the tyrant! Kill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a thousand knives to him. Let him pay with blood!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was also a good voice. \u201cLove live the lion king! A brilliant god!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s lips pursed. This shameless demeanour was really Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was thus locked in the dungeon of the Lion Country.</p><br/><p>How harsh were the conditions? If 18 layers of hell were dug in the ground, he was at the bottom.</p><br/><p>The iron chain was as thick as an arm and would probably take a while to cut.</p><br/><p>Thanks to Xie Xi\u2019s physique fitness, dragging such a chain didn\u2019t make him feel tired.</p><br/><p>In contrast, Xie Xi missed Virgo\u2019s imprisonment. After all, he got delicious food and a comfortable place to sleep. Leo was too rough.</p><br/><p>It was dark and damp. If he didn\u2019t have the god\u2019s wisdom then he would already go on strike!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi counted the days. For three or four days, Leo didn\u2019t look for him.</p><br/><p>This kid\u2019s anger wasn\u2019t small. It was very strong.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pondered if he was eating too much using the god\u2019s wisdom. Would a poor complexion attract attention?</p><br/><p>Did he have to act hungry again?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about the robot that he planted.</p><br/><p>The world might\u2019ve changed but the previous situation was well laid out. According to logic, the robot\u2019s role should still be present.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tried to contact it and it was working!</p><br/><p>Sure enough, things were continuous. This would make it easier.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi manipulated the robot to find Leo.</p><br/><p>The palace of the Lion Country could be called a golden brilliance. It was different from the plain elegance of the Tiger Country. This was a golden system and it made Xie Xi inexplicably feel that he had come to Thailand.</p><br/><p>Cough, the palace might be a bit flashy but the lion king was handsome!</p><br/><p>He was blond and tall. He sat there in a daze but the melancholy added countless charms to him.</p><br/><p>Once the robot arrived, Leo got up and said, \u201cTeacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>The robot bowed and Leo told him, \u201cThere are no bystanders here. Teacher doesn\u2019t need to be polite.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt awkward. \u2018You place me in jail but act so respectfully to a robot\u2026 okay, I was the one who was a slag.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gave the robot instructions and the robot soon shifted the topic to the imprisoned beast king.</p><br/><p>The lion king\u2019s expression suddenly sank. \u201cI have my own opinion on this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>The robot spoke according to orders, \u201cI heard that the beast king had a disease in his early years and his body isn\u2019t as good as before. If he continues to be locked up then he will die in prison\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The lion king was furious. \u201cHow can he die?\u201d</p><br/><p>The robot paused before saying, \u201cSince he has been captured, we should use him to deter the other tribes by beheading him in public\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words poked at the little lion. \u201cTeacher, please come back. I have my own plans regarding him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The robot was tactful. \u201cThe beast king is along in the dark and damp dungeon. He hasn\u2019t eaten for several days and I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The lion king was cold. \u201cWithdraw!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw the fire and had the lion go back.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi waited in the prison for around two hours before he heard the sound of footsteps.</p><br/><p>This could be regarded as calling for someone!</p><br/><p>The guards were shocked when they suddenly saw the lion king and hurriedly bowed.</p><br/><p>The lion\u2019s expression was heavy. \u201cEveryone, go out.\u201d</p><br/><p>One guard hurriedly said, \u201cYour Majesty, this sinner\u2019s means are fierce. This subordinate is afraid that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The lion king ordered in a low voice. \u201cGo out!\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of people paled and withdrew.</p><br/><p>In this big cave, there was only the lion and the heavily chained Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up weakly.</p><br/><p>There was a flash in Leo\u2019s golden eyes but he was steady on the surface. \u201cDo you regret it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him without blinking and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Leo couldn\u2019t stand this gaze and squeezed the other person\u2019s chin. \u201cYou killed my family and wanted to train me into a knife in your hands\u2026\u201d He stared at Xie Xi. \u201cNow that you have fallen into this situation, do you regret it?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled and whispered to him, \u201cHave you been doing well?\u201d</p><br/><p>His originally warm and sweet voice was hoarse, as if he hadn\u2019t drunk water for a long time.</p><br/><p>Leo paused before replying, \u201cWhat do you think? I got revenge and I\u2019m very good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyelashes trembled before he smiled softly. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, there was no trace of happiness in Jiang Xie\u2019s heart. He hated this person for so many years and finally pulled this person down from the throne, locking up in the dungeon. He could kill Xie Xi for revenge but\u2026</p><br/><p>His heart was filled with indescribable powerlessness, as if he lost interest in everything.</p><br/><p>From the moment he saw Xie Xi, he wanted to see this person again.</p><br/><p>The nearly 10 years of hate all became absurd in that moment.</p><br/><p>So lowly and sad. He wasn\u2019t worthy of being a person!</p><br/><p>The self-blame and disgust shackled Jiang Xie, causing him to grab Xie Xi\u2019s neck as if to strangle him. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I\u2019m not the idiot of the past!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt real pain and was almost speechless, but his face still maintained the look of near-satisfaction.</p><br/><p>There was a hornet\u2019s nest in Jiang Xie\u2019s chest and he couldn\u2019t help exclaiming, \u201cIt is useless, I won\u2019t be fooled. You can use these tricks in Hell!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he loosened his hand.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi coughed for a while before requesting, \u201cCan you kill me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes shook.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gasped out, \u201cCan you kill me with your own hands? I want to die by your hands\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sneered. \u201cDon\u2019t dream about it. I want it to be in the eyes of the public. Following the will of the people, the tyrant\u2019s head will be cut off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suddenly grabbed Jiang Xie\u2019s hand with some anxiety on his face. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t do this, I think\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw the pale fingers and held back the impulse to hold this person. He was hard and stern. \u201cYou aren\u2019t qualified to talk about any conditions! I want you to experience the most brutal humiliation when you die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Jiang Xie left.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s performance was so good but there wasn\u2019t an audience. He really regretted it since there should be applause here.</p><br/><p>He thought he would see Jiang Xie again in a few days. Who knew hat the next morning, the lion king would angrily come to the dungeon.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared blankly when he saw Jiang Xie like this.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sent everyone away and stared at him. \u201cI told you not to play tricks on me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d He didn\u2019t do anything. The things he said yesterday were just a play to pave the way for bitterness.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie pulled him up, eyes sweeping down to his thin lips. \u201cDo you think I will still be bewitched by those dreams?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened and he couldn\u2019t react for a moment.</p><br/><p>Dream? Did Jiang Xie have another sex dream?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was inwardly amused. \u2018Little lion, what are you doing? This is your own sex dream but you are blaming it on me!\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cI can\u2019t use Dreaming if I\u2019m not asleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was surprised for a moment.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi whispered, \u201cDreaming also has a certain range. The dungeon is too far from your bedroom.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s face was hot. \u201cDo you think I will still trust your words?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled wryly. \u201cYou can ask the guards. I didn\u2019t sleep at all last night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fortunately, he left a hand for himself and pretended not to sleep in order to seem miserable.</p><br/><p>Who knew that it could be used here?</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t sleep then how could he use Dreaming?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was speechless. Xie Xi raised his eyes slightly and glanced at this person. \u201cDid you dream of me?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

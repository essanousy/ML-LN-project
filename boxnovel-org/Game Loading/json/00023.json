Although Xie Xi was young, he had seen many types of people and had extra vigilance towards strangers.</p><br/><p>To Zhong Jin, he was just a newcomer who didn\u2019t understand anything. The information of the person who cleared the S-grade world was unknown. It was impossible for Zhong Jin to know it, so what was his purpose in approaching Xie Xi?</p><br/><p>Now it was certain that he deliberately led Xie Xi to this D-grade world.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had thought there was a problem with this D-grade world but he had no choice. It was likely that X\u2019s next world was filled with even more traps. This was only a D-grade world and he brought a bunch of items that newcomers couldn\u2019t afford. Zhong Jin might be untrustworthy but it was definitely safer than that damn Lost Atlantis.</p><br/><p>In order to get rid of the X-designed game, Xie Xi worked very hard.</p><br/><p>In a way, Jiang Xie seemed to be worse than Zhong Jin in Xie Xi\u2019s heart since the -173 must be respected. Oh, it was already -175. After all, Xie Xi thought about X once again.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin\u2019s face sank and he was holding a short blade that flashed blue.</p><br/><p>Song Qi was shocked. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He was trying to buy time.</p><br/><p>How could Xie Xi not understand? He was always on guard and the moment he saw Zhong Jin\u2019s malevolence, he used the character freeze while Zhong Jin was off guard.</p><br/><p>Song Qi exclaimed, \u201cFuck, I was scared to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t say anything and just took Zhong Jin\u2019s weapon. This short blade didn\u2019t look special. In the eyes of modern people, a hot weapon might be better than a cold weapon. However, Central World couldn\u2019t be judged using conventional science. The short blade wasn\u2019t necessarily weaker than the gun.</p><br/><p>Song Qi untied the hemp rope around his waist and tied Zhong Jin up. This was taken from the dungeon. After all, he was a collector and naturally had to scrape every place he went clean.</p><br/><p>Song Qi said he didn\u2019t want to be a collector but he actually had a collection fetish.</p><br/><p>He was afraid of Zhong Jin waking up early so Xie Xi used the character fix on him twice to ensure they had plenty of time.</p><br/><p>Song Qi\u2019s movements were more skillful than expected and Zhong Jin was still frozen by the time he was done.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at Zhong Jin before saying to Song Qi, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi was surprised. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to ask anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to delay the time. \u201cThere is nothing to ask. We have less experience and asking him questions is too dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>He strode away and Song Qi had to catch up, blinking in a confused manner.</p><br/><p>As they were walking, Xie Xi asked him, \u201cHave you ever killed anyone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi immediately shook his head. \u201cNo!\u201d What killing people? He was too scared to even kill a chicken!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cZhong Jin is different from us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi vaguely understood and he tensed up. \u201cThe reason for your caution\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to take advantage of this time to find Sun Yunren.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was meaningless to question Zhong Jin. He wouldn\u2019t give them any clues about this game.</p><br/><p>Moreover, they knew too little about Zhong Jin\u2019s situation. Just now, they took advantage of when he wasn\u2019t prepared to freeze his body. If they delayed until the time limit of the freeze was over, who knew what would happen?</p><br/><p>As for killing Zhong Jin, Xie Xi wasn\u2019t going to try it.</p><br/><p>He was worried about the fatal injuries immunity.</p><br/><p>A newcomer was able to buy a fatal injuries immunity uniform for 50 silver coins. How could the veteran Zhong Jin be unprepared? If he was unprepared, why was he willing to give away \u2018one life\u2019 as soon as he entered the game? Admittedly, it was a crafty escape plan but if he only had two lives, he wouldn\u2019t be so casual.</p><br/><p>Besides, Xie Xi and Song Qi had no fighting experience. It was obvious that Zhong Jin\u2019s posture of holding the blade wasn\u2019t normal. If they couldn\u2019t kill him, they might be the ones killed instead!</p><br/><p>Thus, the smartest move was to run quickly!</p><br/><p>Song Qi asked while running, \u201cWhat is going on? Didn\u2019t he enter the game with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be precise, he led me in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god!\u201d Song Qi remembered. \u201cI was also pulled in by Liu Sheng!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them spoke about what they remembered.</p><br/><p>Previously, Zhong Jin was called Liu Sheng and he also pulled Song Qi into this D-grade assembly mission. Song Qi had just broken up with a slag man and was angry. Then he met a sunny and handsome person and chatted with him. After a few words, they decided to do the task together.</p><br/><p>They entered the game and spent a day in the forest. Song Qi was embarrassed by his task and didn\u2019t team up with anyone. He sneaked around by himself and was unexpectedly caught and locked up.</p><br/><p>Song Qi shivered. \u201cAn 80% death rate will reset the task\u2026 then out of the last batch of players, only Zhong Jin and I survived?\u201d The name was confusing so they decided to call him Zhong Jin.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cHe completed the main task and successfully left the world.\u201d That\u2019s how Zhong Jin entered the world again.</p><br/><p>Song Qi couldn\u2019t understand. \u201cWhy did he return to this world? What\u2019s the point of repeating D-grade tasks?\u201d The Central World\u2019s rules were clearly written. Repeating tasks in the same world would lead to a decline in rewards. In a low-level world where the rewards were weak, there would be no rewards after clearing it two or three times.</p><br/><p>Song Qi thought about it. \u201cIs it to clear the world?\u201d Clearing the world required completing the core main task and side tasks. Some players would enter the same world in order to get the special reward from clearing a world, gaining new tasks in the hope of reaching the conditions to clear the instance.</p><br/><p>Then Song Qi thought it was impossible. \u201cIt is just a D-grade world. The instance clearance reward isn\u2019t comparable to the general reward of a C-grade world. Isn\u2019t it a waste of time?\u2019 Zhong Jin\u2019s strength was sufficient to challenge a C-grade world.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>Song Qi asked again, \u201cWhy did he lead us into this world? Where are the others? Did he bring them in as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid he has entered more than twice.\u201d</p><br/><p>If the person in the photo was Zhong Jin then he hadn\u2019t entered the game only three days ago.</p><br/><p>Even if Sun Yunren didn\u2019t eat for three days, she wouldn\u2019t have the current thin appearance.</p><br/><p>Song Qi\u2019s scalp was numb. \u201cWhat the hell is he trying to do!\u201d It was too strange! The town\u2019s residents hunted the players and there were people like Zhong Jin with unknown intentions. What was going on in this world?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what he wants to do.\u201d Xie Xi stated, \u201cAs long as we clear this world, he can\u2019t enter again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi heard this sentence and realized the meaning. \u201cBrother Xi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go and see Sun Yunren first.\u201d</p><br/><p>They returned to Aunty Sun\u2019s residence and saw the girl standing alone in the yard.</p><br/><p>She was immersed in a fantasy, praying for the person in her dream to come and pick her up.</p><br/><p>Once Xie Xi appeared, her eyes brightened and her voice grew sweeter and softer. \u201cBrother Bai Xia, I knew you wouldn\u2019t leave Yunren behind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Bai Xia.\u201d Xie Xi stared at her. \u201cYou really can\u2019t tell?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Yunren seemed to freeze and a panicked expression crossed her face. \u201cYou are\u2026 no, you aren\u2019t Bai Xia. You just borrowed his body. I know, I know\u2026 I won\u2019t admit it. As soon as you came, Bai Xia will become different\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough.</p><br/><p>Sun Yunren couldn\u2019t distinguish between Xie Xiand Zhong Jin because they entered Bai Xia\u2019s body and became Bai Xia.</p><br/><p>In the eyes of the people of this world, there was no difference between the two Bai Xias. However, players weren\u2019t confined to the world and they clearly understood.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told Sun Yunren, \u201cI\u2019m not the person you know. I\u2019m someone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Yunren stared blankly.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s voice was a lot lighter. \u201cYou can tell right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tears fell from Sun Yunren\u2019s eyes and the girl seemed on the verge of collapse. \u201cWhy\u2026 why\u2026 don\u2019t you love me? You said you would marry me and take me away from this broken place\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi raised an eyebrow. Broken place?</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t spoken yet when a boy\u2019s voice was heard. \u201cSister Yunren!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Yunren trembled and unleashed amazing strength and speed to grab the boy who suddenly appeared. \u201cXiao\u2026 Xiao Feng, don\u2019t tell the mayor, don\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy shook with anger. \u201cYou are with outsiders again. You are crazy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Yunren\u2019s mental state was unstable and she held the boy\u2019s hand like she was a tree root.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told her, \u201cYou will hurt him like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy immediately looked up.</p><br/><p>The two people stared at each other with startled expressions.</p><br/><p>The boy didn\u2019t expect to see such a good-looking person and Xie Xi was surprised by the boy\u2019s golden pupils.</p><br/><p>The boy gritted his teeth. \u201cA pretty boy like you is bullying Sister Yunren! The dragon god will punish you!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

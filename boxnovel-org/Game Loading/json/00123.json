He\u2019s coming in person!\u201d A red-haired man with a good voice and appearance ran from outside. He probably shared a common language with Purple Nine. \u201cLord Azure Dragon really likes Xiao Xie. Xiao Xie has accumulated blessings for a few generations of happiness!\u201d</p><br/><p>Purple Nine\u2019s eyebrows gathered together. \u201cWe can\u2019t call the name of the flower god at will. Call him 99 for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man in red stated, \u201cOkay, I will call him that in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>He asked again, \u201cWhere is he? Don\u2019t make trouble due to premarital fear. Lord Azure Dragon has personally come to pick him up and won\u2019t go back without a justified reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>Purple Nine stated, \u201cRed Six, you go first. I will clean him up well. He can\u2019t be messy when seeing Lord Azure Dragon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Red Six hurriedly said, \u201cFine, move quickly. We can\u2019t let Lord Azure Dragon wait for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>After sending away Red Six, Purple Nine quickly told Xie Xi, \u201cHurry up, it is too impolite to see Lord Azure Dragon like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also wanted to see what type of soul Azure Dragon was. He hoped it was an old friend and not a new soul!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do I transform back?\u201d Xie Xi asked.</p><br/><p>Purple Nine was patience. \u201cYou might\u2019ve forgotten but you have previously adapted to the human form There should still be an illusion. Just think about\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She explained a bit and Xie Xi generally understood. The transformation basically relied on the brain and each part had to be successfully shaped.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had been a person for many years and was very familiar with the human body. He tried a few times before successfully transforming.</p><br/><p>A white light fell and Xie Xi could finally be regarded as a human.</p><br/><p>The Roast Pork Bun looking for his mother yelled, \u201cDaddy, where did you go? Did you give birth to a second child behind my back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He was too lazy to care about this silly cat!</p><br/><p>Purple Nine sighed and said, \u201cYou are really\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t catch her next words.</p><br/><p>Purple Nine didn\u2019t dare say, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to marry Lord Azure Dragon. Just this appearance alone is worthy of the name of the flower god.\u201d However, she was afraid of his tail rising into the sky and caused a great disaster. She changed her words and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t mess away or act too rudely in front of Lord Azure Dragon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded.</p><br/><p>They left the garden.</p><br/><p>Yes, Xie Xi had just been rooted in a small garden with many buds. They seemed to be unflowered roses.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi left with Purple Nine while wondering where Jiang Xie was.</p><br/><p>By all accounts, they entered this quasi-world and should\u2019ve landed in the same place. How did he disappear?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was a bit worried about what happened to him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie must\u2019ve lost something but what did he lose? Surely it wasn\u2019t Jiang Xie himself who was lost?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart jerked and he crazily shook his head. Impossible, absolutely impossible! This world\u2019s level definitely wasn\u2019t low and there shouldn\u2019t be such a high cost!</p><br/><p>Purple Nine was angry. \u201cWhy are you shaking your head? In a moment, Lord Azure Dragon will take you back. You should obediently follow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hurriedly replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to but if the soul was there, it meant there wasn\u2019t a problem with Jiang Xie. They were all one. If something had happened to the main body, the soul would have no supporting point and would scatter.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suppressed his worries and followed Purple Nine. His eyes widened as a dreamlike world appeared in front of him.</p><br/><p>In regards to flowers, people were always willing to give their best imagination.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was fond of roses and designed Rose Mountain to be a fairyland. The emerald vines, the crystal dew, the fluorescent fireflies and the beautiful petals that spread out meant that even Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help feeling the beauty.</p><br/><p>Purple Nine told him, \u201cThanks to Lord Azure Dragon, our Rose Mountain has such a prosperous beauty.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was also the blessing of Azure Dragon? This white rose really had to marry him!</p><br/><p>They walked up the jade steps into a white palace.</p><br/><p>This palace wasn\u2019t the traditional ancient style. The carved columns were full of nature\u2019s interest. White was the base and plants were the company. The echo of the sun and moon was really beautiful.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw a man in black clothes standing in the main hall.</p><br/><p>He wore a long gown with dark lines, wide cuffs and a tight waist that showed off his perfect figure.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you run back? If you missed home, you could\u2019ve told me. I would\u2019ve stayed with you for a few days on Rose Mountain.\u201d He opened his mouth, his warm voice containing some cold, like spring water falling into a mountain stream.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up and saw his clean and handsome features.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon was actually the fourth prince.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had a good impression of the environmentalist but at the end of the Atlantis world, he felt deeply sorry for this prince.</p><br/><p>Purple Nine pushed Xie Xi and he hurriedly opened his mouth. \u201cI was too capricious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Azure Dragon approached and took his hand. \u201cIt is my fault for being so busy that I made you bored.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very familiar with him and didn\u2019t feel restrained. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I was just a bit homesick.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon told him warmly, \u201cThen I\u2019ll stay with you for a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, you still have things to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon paused. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a problem. I\u2019m always busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi still wanted to say something but Azure Dragon patted the back of his hand. \u201cAfter the wedding, you can only live on the Holy Mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked a bit embarrassed. \u201cThat\u2019s why I want to spend a bit more time on Rose Mountain with everyone.\u201d It was necessary to grasp the details before knowing if the value of this marriage was worth it or not.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi experienced a lot and wasn\u2019t naive enough to think that marriage was always a good thing\u2026</p><br/><p>Who knew what the brains of the other souls were like. The end of Atlantis was hell mode. If the souls were deeply obsessed, it would definitely affect the world. The fourth prince wanted to marry him then what about the other souls?</p><br/><p>The most fearful thing was to agree without prior consultation.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s say he married this soul and provoked the others. Then he wouldn\u2019t be able to coax the souls!</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon obeyed him. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll finish up my busy work during this time and then take you everywhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon added, \u201cIt isn\u2019t early now. I won\u2019t go back. Can I stay to accompany you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Fourth Prince, what are you doing? Do you want to engage in premarital X behaviour?</p><br/><p>Purple Nine hurriedly said, \u201dI\u2019m going to clean up the house!\u201d</p><br/><p>She hurried away and Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare leave Azure Dragon.</p><br/><p>It was just\u2026 Jiang Xie might be naughty but he was very disciplined. In the dream, they\u2026</p><br/><p>In any case, they weren\u2019t married and shouldn\u2019t mess around.</p><br/><p>Purple Nine left and Azure Dragon spoke to the people around him. The server responded in a low murmur before turning to leave.</p><br/><p>Only the two of them were left in the huge hall.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was busy thinking when Azure Dragon\u2019s dark eyes changed.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun yelled, \u201cWho is this handsome man?\u201d The red and blue eyes were exactly the same as Roast Pork Bun.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon smiled and stated, \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cI didn\u2019t think the price I would pay was my body.\u201d</p><br/><p>Last time there were no memories and now he didn\u2019t have a body. It was hard to say which one was better.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood. \u201cThen you now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe state of my souls will attract me. I will stay in the body of a soul for the time being.\u201d Xie Xi spoke nervously, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t count as regaining your body?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t count since this isn\u2019t my original body.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt relieved. \u201cThat\u2019s good. If you\u2019re in this body, I\u2019m\u2026\u201d It would be a lot easier.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cIt is more than this body.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t understand. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie quickly explained, \u201cAll the souls are me. In theory, I can go to any body if they pull me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked anxiously, \u201cWill there be any danger?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart was hot but he didn\u2019t dare tease the child. \u201cThere is no danger but my brain isn\u2019t very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cWhenever we are alone, I can remember the Central World. However, if there are other people present, I can only remember the memories of the soul.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then the previous Azure Dragon was really Azure Dragon and not Jiang Xie?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie continued, \u201cI can\u2019t distort the will of the soul or else this quasi-world will become a mess.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was still in a daze.</p><br/><p>Footsteps were heard from outside. Jiang Xie seized this time and said, \u201cBe careful with Azure Dragon. He knows that you fled from the marriage.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

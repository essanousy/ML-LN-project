This was Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>A little lion that was a few months old\u2026</p><br/><p>Well, this was his world. If he wanted to be the king of beasts then it should be fine!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at Leo. This little guy wasn\u2019t big but he was born with a strong head. It was a bit strange but the round head, velvety ears and short and wide claws allowed a person to imagine how strong and powerful he would be when he grew up.</p><br/><p>Leo seemed to be very tired and his body was a bit filthy. It was unknown where he came from but he had fainted from tiredness in this place.</p><br/><p>The moment Xie Xi approached, his eyes opened and bright golden eyes were vigilant as he let out a low sound.</p><br/><p>He seemed to be threatening Xie Xi but because his body was too small, his voice wasn\u2019t scary at all but was very cute.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes curved, not afraid of this lion at all. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion cried out, \u201cAo!\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t an agreement but to make Xie Xi go far away.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi came closer and frowned slightly as he approached.</p><br/><p>The little lion was wounded and the hind legs, which he had hidden, were bleeding.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurt.\u201d Xie Xi strode forward with twisted eyebrows. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. I will treat your wounds.\u201d</p><br/><p>Despite the blood flowing from his hind legs, the little lion stood up and took a fighting stance.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s body was too weak and h was afraid both of them would be damaged if the lion rushed over.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at how I\u2019m so weak. How can I hurt you?\u201d Xie Xi felt that Jiang Xie could understand his words.</p><br/><p>After all, he always understood when he was a cat or a bird.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, the big lion\u2019s eyes turned around and he seemed to be examining Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi reached out and made a harmless gesture, \u201cLook, I don\u2019t have a weapon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion gave a low cry.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi slowly approached and first tried to touch him.</p><br/><p>The little guy was so vicious that he bit Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t hide and let this person hold his hand.</p><br/><p>The little lion didn\u2019t bite in a hard manner. He just stared at Xie Xi with golden eyes, which seemed to be somewhat doubtful.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi reassured him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion released the hand.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed with relief. If this was actually a little lion in the wild then he would\u2019ve already encountered an accident.</p><br/><p>The reason why he dared to do this was because he knew this was Jiang Xie and that Jiang Xie wouldn\u2019t hurt him. The second reason was that he had the space shield. He wouldn\u2019t be hurt if the little lion bit him.</p><br/><p>This obviously made Jiang Xie relax and Xie Xi slightly examined his wounds. Some of them are infected. Will you go with me so I can bandage them?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion gave a low cry.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took this as agreement. \u201cIs it okay for me to hold you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was afraid that he couldn\u2019t hold this lion so he gathered all up his strength and reached out\u2026</p><br/><p>The little lion bared his teeth and stood up without Xie Xi\u2019s help.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at the right hind leg and saw him drag it without much trouble.</p><br/><p>He turned back and found he was weaker than the little lion. This was shameful!</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Xie Xi\u2019s cave wasn\u2019t far away and they soon arrived after a few steps.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told Jiang Xie, \u201cWait for me, I will go and get the medicine box.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion cried out and lay at the mouth of the hole.</p><br/><p>He remained alert and his positioning was very clever. It was a place where he could escape if he was in danger.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi headed to the bedroom.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have a medicine box so once he entered, he summoned the sketch pen and drew a picture.</p><br/><p>In order to match his poor temperament, the medicine box was old and broken. The medicine inside was also inclined to Chinese herbal medicine, which could be more easily explained.</p><br/><p>He came out and spoke to Jiang Xie, \u201cCan you come over? I\u2019ll wash your wounds for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was too hard for him to carry the pot of hot water.</p><br/><p>The little lion hesitated, watched Xie Xi take a few steps where he swayed from the wind and became relieved.</p><br/><p>There was no other person in this cave and he could bite this man\u2019s neck with one bite.</p><br/><p>The little lion dragged his injured hind leg and was careful along the way, seemingly wary of possible traps.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw him like this and felt he was cute. However, there was also a bitter taste.</p><br/><p>Leo didn\u2019t have it easy. Such a small lion had such a vigilant heart, showing his hard life.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, Xie Xi\u2019s voice became gentler. \u201cIt might be a little painful but bear with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion snorted. Xie Xi couldn\u2019t understand the animal language but he could guess the general meaning from the tone. \u2018I\u2019m not afraid.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi carefully cleaned the wounds and gave him medicine. The little fellow shook as he was dressed.</p><br/><p>The pain was certain and the medicine was strong. It both sterilized and accelerated recovery but the pain was relative to the effect.</p><br/><p>It was the so-called good medicine was bitter and the external application was even more painful.</p><br/><p>However, the little lion didn\u2019t say anything. Apart from shaking, he didn\u2019t show any pain.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tied the bandages with a beautiful bow and praised him. \u201cReally brave!\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pretended not to see the disgust in the little lion\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>The medicine was mixed with some sleeping ingredients, mainly to relieve the little lion\u2019s pain.</p><br/><p>Who knew that the little guy could resist so much. He didn\u2019t sleep and just stared at Xie Xi with confused, big eyes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart softened and he gently patted the fur. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You will soon be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion didn\u2019t say anything but refused to speak as he stared at this person.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could only try to comfort him. \u201cThey say that long illness makes a doctor. Look at me, I\u2019m sick like this so I must be a good doctor.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion, \u201c\u2026\u201d He had obvious doubts in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t care and continued to boast. \u201cI am especially good at treating trauma. These herbs are used together.\u201d He didn\u2019t understand his setting but that didn\u2019t prevent him from creating his own setting.</p><br/><p>The little lion\u2019s ears trembled as he listened with the attitude of a few punctuation marks.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi continued to talk about herbal medicine\u2026</p><br/><p>This was probably hypnotic. The little lion trying not to sleep overlapped his front paws, small chin falling on top of it as his eyes squinted.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw this appearance and felt it was adorable.</p><br/><p>Big cat, this was really a foul!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi resisted the urge to rub this lion\u2019s head. He had to put Leo to sleep to ensure the lion didn\u2019t feel pain and also recovered quickly.</p><br/><p>Finally, the little lion fell asleep.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s physique meant he was tired on his own.</p><br/><p>He gasped as he carefully got up. He moved very lightly but the little lion\u2019s ears still shook.</p><br/><p>This vigilance was too high! Xie Xi could only maintain his current state and wait for the lion to sleep more.</p><br/><p>Maintaining this action was also tiring. Xie Xi simply sat down next to the little lion.</p><br/><p>He gently touched the furry head and the little lion trembled. Maybe he was too tired or he didn\u2019t feel any pain at last. The lion didn\u2019t wake up again and instead leaned against Xie Xi\u2019s side, his body attached to Xie Xi\u2019s legs.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to go\u2026</p><br/><p>He saw the mud under the small hind paws and the tangles in the beautiful fur. Xie Xi was very distressed.</p><br/><p>It felt like the little lion had suffered a lot.</p><br/><p>Did this little one leave his family?</p><br/><p>What happened to his parents?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew too little about this world and couldn\u2019t think of a reason.</p><br/><p>He gently smoothed the fur and slept with him for a while.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the night, Xie Xi heard a groan.</p><br/><p>The little lion had woken up. He was able to move on four feet and his spirit was much better.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi slept a bit and felt some pain from his waist. \u201cHow is it? It is fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion cried out, \u201cAo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t understand. He just thought it was very cute and touched the furry little heard.</p><br/><p>The little lion seemed to dislike people touching his head but Xie Xi saved him so he held back.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to stand him but his legs were numb. The itching from his head also made him feel pain.</p><br/><p>The little lion came close to him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi whispered, \u201dI\u2019m fine, my legs are numb.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion snorted.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t understand but knew the lion was caring about him. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ll be fine after being a bi more active.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion moved to his leg and licked the exposed foot.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s legs were numb but his feet was fine. He was itchy and couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cDon\u2019t lick\u2026\u201d There were small barbs on the tongue and it was too itchy!</p><br/><p>The little lion gazed at him, smiled and licked him again.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi slowly stood up. \u201cOkay, I can walk.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion held his head high with a \u2018don\u2019t thank me\u2019 expression.</p><br/><p>This was too cute! Xie Xi couldn\u2019t hold back and touched the little head. \u201cYou are really capable.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion wanted to hide but thought about this weak person. He didn\u2019t want to scare the person and tried to hold back.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help smiling. He said, \u201cJust wait, I\u2019ll go find you something to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>He only had a piece of rotting meat in his house and this obviously couldn\u2019t be eaten.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could only go and draw some meat.</p><br/><p>Did a lion eat raw meat?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t remember where he saw it but carnivorous animals needed a variety of vitamins in raw meat to maintain the balance of their body. Once cooked, they lost some important vitamins. Large carnivores didn\u2019t eat plants and raw meat was the best.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi drew some raw meat strips and the little lion\u2019s eyes lit up as he pounced with a whimper.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This should really be filmed. Once he returned to Central and showed it to God Yan, the depressed mood would be swept away and he would be happy for hundreds of years.</p><br/><p>Cough\u2026 forget it. It wasn\u2019t worth the loss if someone made a fuss to him 70 times a night.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi watched the little lion eating meat and thought about how the lion could become a human.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t think Leo would always be a lion. Becoming a human was certain. He just needed to find the method of the transformation.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t in a hurry. The little lion was really cute and Xie Xi really liked it.</p><br/><p>Perceiving Xie Xi\u2019s gaze, the little lion stopped moving his mouth and pushed a piece of meat over.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled and told him, \u201cI have already eaten. You eat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion didn\u2019t think much and kept eating.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know how long he had been hungry. There were a few pieces of meat left and Xie Xi was a bit hungry when he saw them\u2026</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, his body was too bad to eat barbecue.</p><br/><p>They slept for a while and the next morning, they were awakened by the sound of stones striking.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes were sleepy until the pain from his chest came and then he was completely awake.</p><br/><p>It was terrible\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi started looking for painkillers.</p><br/><p>The little lion had stood up and ran to the hole.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took painkillers to ease the pain and heard loud noises from outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cInvalid, invalid, the Tiger Country\u2019s most useless invalid!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMixed with dirt invalid, unlucky invalid!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe invalid hasn\u2019t come out for a few days. Is he dead?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then there were more sounds of sounds being thrown.</p><br/><p>They were children\u2019s voices but the contents were vicious.</p><br/><p>Children might not know much but they learnt quickly.</p><br/><p>The words must\u2019ve been said by adults and the children ran here after hearing it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was the invalid but he wasn\u2019t angry. He just wanted to go out to clean up these naughty children while also exploring the world background.</p><br/><p>However, someone was on fire.</p><br/><p>There was a roar and the little lion rushed out.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was anxious and he was afraid there would be an accident.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the children\u2019s screams were heard. \u201cThere is a big lion in the invalid\u2019s house!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>How was the little lion big?</p><br/><p>He came out and saw the lion confronting three boys who were seven or eight years old.</p><br/><p>According to common sense, children would either be afraid or curious when seeing lions but these children were special.</p><br/><p>There was some surprise but it didn\u2019t seem to be their first time seeing a lion.</p><br/><p>The next moment, Xie Xi was stunned.</p><br/><p>There was a bang and the three children became tigers.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t adults but they were obviously larger than the little lion.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Go and eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Was he hungry every time he meowed? Take time to study the fourth level of cat language! Still, he was a bit hungry.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at the table full of good food but had no appetite. Perhaps it was the characteristic of a cat\u2019s body that couldn\u2019t eat these normal things.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi jumped down and went to eat the cat food. Jiang Xie picked him up along with the food bowl and placed them on the table.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Meow.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cEat together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Okay, this person would eat his Kobe steak while he would eat the X brand cat food.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was in a particularly good mood and asked, \u201cHow did you obtain all these things?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his tail. \u201cI just draw them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cEat and we will talk after we finish.\u201d A laptop was necessary in order to communicate with Little Rose.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t speak nonsense. After all, this person didn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>The two people ate until full. Jiang Xie carefully cleaned the dishes and placed the things Xie Xi created in a very hidden place.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him. Jiang Xie noticed the kitten\u2019s gaze and said, \u201cThese are very unusual. it will be suspicious if others see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He might be young but he was cautious.</p><br/><p>There was no other way. The poor children lived alone from an early age. Not only was Little Jiang poor, but he was also unlucky\u2026</p><br/><p>After cleaning, the human and the cat went to the laptop for in-depth communication.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had a pile of secrets but there was no need to say them. As long as Jiang Xie returned to Central, he would know everything.</p><br/><p>The god\u2019s wisdom and sketch pen couldn\u2019t be explained so Xie Xi typed, \u201cYou have given me so much food. I wanted to make this for you to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned. \u201cThen\u2026 it just appeared out of thin air?\u201d</p><br/><p>Technically, it was right. It appeared from Cat Xie\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>How cute and lovely were his actions? Jiang Xie\u2019s blood tank was half empty and he didn\u2019t know what to say next.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi questioned, \u201cThis isn\u2019t good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie recovered and seriously told him, \u201cDon\u2019t create these things in front of people other than me.\u201d He highlighted the \u2018don\u2019t\u2019 part.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi definitely knew this but still nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d Meow.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t help touching him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi added, \u201cDo you have anything you want? I can make it appear for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lacking anything and don\u2019t use this ability easily. I\u2019m afraid it will be harmful to your health.\u201d</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter if there was no lunch in the world. Jiang Xie\u2019s worst fear was the kitten being damaged.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew it wouldn\u2019t happen but unfortunately couldn\u2019t explain it. He could only nod. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wanted to praise the cat but then thought about how the cat would become a teenager as old as him and was embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie gently patted his fur. This is the secret between us. We must not tell others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned and licked his fingers. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t go out all day and didn\u2019t go to the hospital. Xie Xi meant to go. After all, there was an appointment and it wouldn\u2019t be easy to explain to Kang Hong if they missed it.</p><br/><p>However, Jiang Xie insisted on not going and his reasoning was sufficient. \u201cWhat if the doctor discovers something during the check up?\u201d</p><br/><p>This made sense. The risk was greater compared to Kang Hong. Xie Xi was relieved by Jiang Xie\u2019s prudence but also distressed.</p><br/><p>The teenage years should be the most impulsive time. Jiang Xie developing such a personality showed that he had experienced too much pain and suffered too much.</p><br/><p>The two people didn\u2019t sleep much last night. After eating and drinking, they slept together and by the time they woke up, the sky was dark.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie looked at the sunset outside and obviously felt a bit nervous. Xie Xi knew what this person was nervous about. After dark, Xie Xi could become a person and the way to release this form was a kiss.</p><br/><p>In the daytime with Cat Xie, Jiang Xie could still communicate normally. In the evening, he could speak directly to Xie Xi with cat ears but he was too embarrassed to speak.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to become a person and tapped on the laptop. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t grasp his meaning. \u201cI will make something for myself in a while. You don\u2019t have to make something appear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you aren\u2019t hungry, can you wait for me to eat with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi blinked. \u201cOnce I become a person, I will have dinner with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were clearly typed out words but Jiang Xie seemed to hear the boy\u2019s soft voice.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026Okay.\u201d He wanted to have dinner with this youth, even if it meant starving to death.</p><br/><p>The sky was dark and the moon came out. Xie Xi couldn\u2019t wait to jump onto the window.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie followed and waited for the cat to do something. Then Xie Xi jumped up and kissed him on the lips.</p><br/><p>As Xie Xi thought, the elements for the transformation were having a name, a kiss and bathing in the moonlight.</p><br/><p>Once these three conditions were achieved, he could become a person. He might retain some characteristics of a cat but it was much more convenient than being a pure cat.</p><br/><p>Coolness burst through his body before Xie Xi came down to the ground.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at the young man.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to continue kissing but he thought of their age and held back. The age of the original Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t known but this white sheep in front of him was only 16 or 17. He couldn\u2019t be a beast!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi moved back and a trace of loss flashed in Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes. Xie Xi saw it\u2026</p><br/><p>Well, there was nothing wrong with kissing at the age of 16 or 17. No, he couldn\u2019t be unable to brake at the beginning! He had to consider the long-term.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t open his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll go and find you some clothes.\u201d The ones from last night were torn into strips.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cI can get them myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was afraid to wear Jiang Xie\u2019s clothes. Unsuitable clothes always felt strange\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie might be thinking about last night\u2019s image and nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about it, picked up the sketch pen and started drawing.</p><br/><p>The fitted clothes were much better but there was no other way for the tail. It had to stay outside. This thing was really a foul. As long as it was present, the more serious clothes became less serious. Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help shaking his tail with dislike.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard footsteps and looked up. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t reply and headed into the bathroom. Xie Xi found it strange until he discovered that someone had stuck a tissue in his nose.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie preserved a correct attitude. \u201cIt was dry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought, \u2018You are grown up.\u2019</p><br/><p>Dinner was made by Xie Xi but this time, he didn\u2019t add any fancy tableware. He made the simplest ones found in the supermarket. Of course, the food was carefully selected from Michelin star chefs and tasted delicious.</p><br/><p>Dinner finished and Jiang Xie could finally look straight at Xie Xi. Xie Xi was aware of his gaze and his ears shook.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d In order to adapt to such a Little Rose, he probably needed\u2026 he didn\u2019t know how long it would take!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi inwardly smiled and asked, \u201cHow will we sleep at night?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will sleep on the sofa again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you sleep on the sofa every day?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suggested. \u201cI\u2019ll draw another bed.\u201d This way, the two of them could sleep together.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned and shook his head. \u201cNo, I will buy another one tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about it and it made sense. They couldn\u2019t lock the door of the bedroom forever and suddenly having one more bed was strange.</p><br/><p>jiang Xie had the money paid by the driver and it was enough to buy a simple bed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi made a suggestion. \u201cChange it to a double bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart thumped.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t deliberately bullying him. It was a realistic consideration. \u201cIt is too strange to have two beds in a bedroom when living alone.\u201d A double bed had the spaciousness of a large bed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple moved. He knew it was reasonable but the thought of sharing a bed with Xie Xi\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi added, \u201cTonight, we will squeeze together. The sofa is too small.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t expect that he couldn\u2019t even survive tonight!</p><br/><p>It was really impossible to sleep on a bed, especially a single bed where the two people would have to sleep completely holding each other.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to let Xie Xi conjure things but he still proposed, \u201cConjure a mattress first. I will buy the bed tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Okay\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi listened to him and drew a double mattress. Then they settled down to sleep.</p><br/><p>The next day, Jiang Xie went with the kitten to buy a bed. In the evening, Kang Hong came and was startled when he saw it. \u201cWow, a new bed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cat Xie moved around before he was kissed and said, \u201cDon\u2019t pick me up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong only heard the meows and his eyes lit up as he went for a hug. Then Jiang Xie directly picked up the kitten. Kang Hong pounced on empty air. \u201cEh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cDon\u2019t always hug him. He doesn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or cry but he had to shoulder the blame and bared his teeth and claws at Kang Hong. Kang Hong was bleeding.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was still serious. \u201cYou see, he is angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong thought, \u2018Such anger, please give me 10 dozen of them!\u2019</p><br/><p>Kang Hong didn\u2019t hold Xie Xi but he couldn\u2019t control his hand reaching out to touch the cat.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw the hand descending and once again stopped it. \u201cYou can only touch the head.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong looked like he had seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie continued to shift the blame. \u201cHe only likes people touching his head.\u201d</p><br/><p>What could Xie Xi do? The kitten once again\u2019 scratched.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kang Hong couldn\u2019t find east, west, north and south and couldn\u2019t scold the insane Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Regarding the double bed, Jiang Xie explained that he wanted to sleep in a larger space.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong made an understanding face. \u201cWhen will you introduce your girlfriend to your brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glared at him. \u201cBoy, you dare to think this! A high school student shouldn\u2019t speak nonsense!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong opened his mouth. \u201cYou see, Little Rose is also helping me talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Sir, you should study the cat language again!</p><br/><p>The days passed smoothly like this. Xie Xi was a cat in the daytime and a person at night. The two of them were inseparable.</p><br/><p>A few months later, the final exam was ushered in. Jiang Xie took first in the school and Xie Xi was happier than him.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong was sour. \u201cIf I have a cat then I would also place first.\u201d He was quite good and was seventh in the class.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spat at him, \u2018You can\u2019t get a full score even with 78 cats!\u2019</p><br/><p>There were 78 people between seventh in the class and first in the school.</p><br/><p>In these past few months, Jiang Xie had experienced unprecedented happy days. Since Xie Xi came to him, no unfortunate incidents happened around him.</p><br/><p>The previous rumours were still present but Kang Hong\u2019s \u2018big fortune\u2019 and Jiang Xie\u2019s immediately leaving school when it ended meant the rumours didn\u2019t worsen.</p><br/><p>The environment was good and Jiang Xie gradually became more cheerful. This time, he took first in the school and the class teacher couldn\u2019t help praising him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change but his heart was happy.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw his clenched fist under the table and felt pained and happy for this person.</p><br/><p>The thing that erased all the rumours was the teacher diagnosed with cancer returning at the beginning of the new semester.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong told this to Jiang Xie and Jiang Xie was shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is really amazing! The diagnosis was late but suddenly he was fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wondered, \u201cHow\u2026\u201d Was it possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong explained, \u201cThe hospital is suspecting a misdiagnosis. I heard Teacher Sun say he saw the back of a teenager with cat ears and then he was fine when he woke up the next day!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart thumped.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi who was listening to the whole thing, \u201c\u2026\u201d Kang Hong, could you stop speaking before you die?!</p><br/><p>Kang Hong continued, \u201cI think Teacher Sun was teasing me. He knows that I want cats but can\u2019t raise them. Still, Teacher Sun is really lucky. I thought there was no hope but it is incredibly good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s fingers under the table trembled fiercely.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw it and sighed in his heart. He was still inexperienced and hadn\u2019t completed it perfectly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

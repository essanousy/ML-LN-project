He decided this was a red-feathered chicken and wondered where to start eating it. How could Xie Xi let Nine Tails eat himself?</p><br/><p>He hit the neck of Little Nine Tails, forcing the fox to loosen his mouth and the \u2018meat\u2019 in the mouth fell to the ground. Xie Xi hurriedly reached out to hug Little Vermilion Bird. \u201cOkay, it\u2019s fine.\u2019</p><br/><p>Little Vermilion Bird was in shock. He chirped while flapping his wings. From this perspective, Nine Tails was right and this really was a chicken!</p><br/><p>Unexpected, he had just saved Vermillion Bird when the silver fox glanced over. He finally couldn\u2019t stand his chicken being robbed and cried out miserably.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right\u2026 the vampire Aix-en, Minister of Finance, second prince and Demon Ancestor Nine Tails cried as the chicken in his mouth flew away.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t just shedding tears of grievances. He let go of everything and let out a heartbroken cry. Xie Xi suspected that this guy wouldn\u2019t cry so miserably even at Xie Xi\u2019s death!</p><br/><p>He hurriedly hugged the little fox and coaxed him, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a chicken. You see, he doesn\u2019t have a chicken crown.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little fox stopped crying and glanced at Vermilion Bird before complaining, \u201cHe is a chick. A chick doesn\u2019t have a crown!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was very logical. Little Nine Tails was really a reasonable little fox!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was silent. He stared at Vermilion Bird for a long time and really couldn\u2019t see the difference between him and a chicken. Eventually, he could only\u2026 \u201cOkay, as long as you don\u2019t eat this chicken, I\u2019ll give you three big chickens later!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was obviously much more powerful than clarifying Vermilion Bird\u2019s identity. The little fox raised his beautiful silver eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>This had been heard countless times but it was never as funny as it was now. Xie Xi replied, \u201cI absolutely won\u2019t lie to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little fox was coaxed while Little Vermilion Bird shrank back. \u201cI\u2019m really not a chicken\u2026 chirp.\u201d</p><br/><p>Based on the common nature of the souls, Xie Xi was afraid this chicken would cry too and had to hurriedly tell him, \u201cI know you\u2019re not. You are a vermillion bird\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish, the little fox\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cVermillion bird? I love sparrows the most!\u201d</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird and sparrow wasn\u2019t the same thing, Ancestor Nine Tails!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cVermilion Bird is a holy beast, not ordinary poultry!\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger heard the word \u2018beast\u2019 and became greedy. \u201cIs a holy beast delicious?\u201d</p><br/><p>Large predators disdained to eat poultry but a holy beast sounded good.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fortunately, there was a \u2018big brother\u2019 in the pile. Houqing earnestly told him, \u201cOf course, you can\u2019t eat him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very pleased and wanted to praise this child when he heard Houqing say, \u201cHe is only the size of the palm of a hand and will be bald once the feathers are taken off. What is left? It isn\u2019t worth wasting firewood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He would retract the praise. This big brother wasn\u2019t reliable! Vermilion Bird was small but knew a lot. After hearing this, he was scared and shrank into Xie Xi\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was afraid that this bird would fall into the tiger\u2019s (fox) mouth and hurriedly announced, \u201cHe is your brother. You can\u2019t eat your brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger made a disdainful noise. \u201cHe is too small and my mouth will be full of hair when eating him!\u201d</p><br/><p>The little fox blinked. \u201cWhat is a brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Houqing started his teaching again.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finished collecting everyone and felt very comfortable, but his mouth twitched crazily as he listened to their conversation.</p><br/><p>Who would think that this serious as an adult, violent, arrogant and hyperactive tiger, unmoving bracelet, crybaby who wants to eat chicken and a small hairball\u2026 were all Jiang Xie!</p><br/><p>No, Xie Xi\u2019s blood gauge was empty. He was stunned by his lover\u2019s colourful childhood.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t in a hurry to return to the flower world and strolled through the Holy Mountain and Demon Sea for a while.</p><br/><p>By the time they returned to the flower world, the children had become familiar with each other and even Little Azure Dragon, who couldn\u2019t talk, eavesdropped using his small head.</p><br/><p>He was lying around Xie Xi\u2019s wrist and Xie Xi poked him. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to play with them?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little head shook and rubbed against the palm of Xie Xi\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was ticklish and laughed. \u201cWhen will you grow up?\u201d By all accounts, the souls should be the same age. Perhaps it was because Azure Dragon had been living alone that he wasn\u2019t good at words.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails and Vermilion Bird had become enemies.</p><br/><p>Little Vermilion Bird was the most talkative. He sometimes chirped and was rarely bad to the flowers. They circled him and taught him how to crow\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hurriedly took back the chick\u2026 ah, Little Vermilion Bird, lest such a rare holy beast became a domestic chicken.</p><br/><p>Little Nine Tails stared at Vermilion Bird, the thoughts in his silver eyes extremely clear. \u2018This chicken, once I grab you, I will eat you in one gulp!\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about it and found White Tiger who had the highest combat force, telling him to always pay attention to Vermilion Bird\u2019s safety.</p><br/><p>The white tiger screamed, \u201cI\u2019m not free!\u201d However, his body was very honest and he took care of his younger brothers.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stilled painted for them daily. He vaguely felt that the problem with his body might be related to these paintings but he couldn\u2019t stop.</p><br/><p>The Holy Mountain and Demon Sea must exist. The more realistic it was, the better. After all, these five children had to live there many years later.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t let them see any flaws.</p><br/><p>The world under his pen was the real world, so that no confusion and absurdity would be created in the living. Whenever he painted, the five little ones were always quiet. They watched seriously and didn\u2019t dare ask questions.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had a good memory and drew everything he could imagine. There was Earth and also the worlds he had experienced.</p><br/><p>He found it strange and interesting. No wonder why players grew step by step from a collector, recorder or explorer to a designer. Without these experiences of countless worlds, how could a person design a unique world?</p><br/><p>Thinking and insight were indispensable. Perhaps a designer\u2019s job was far less boring than he imagined and it certainly wasn\u2019t as powerful and exaggerated as he thought.</p><br/><p>A designer wasn\u2019t god. Jiang Xie said it was more like the hand of god.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood a bit. If a god was above everything, then the designer was still in the mountains. This was the biggest difference.</p><br/><p>Designers designed worlds because they couldn\u2019t create anything that didn\u2019t exist. They brought together countless experiences to form a new world. It was natural, not deliberate and at the same time, uncontrollable.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was drawing when he heard Little Vermilion Bird\u2019s voice. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Xie Xi stopped his pen and glanced over.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird and Nine Tails hadn\u2019t seen the previous paintings so before he finished, they went to see the others.</p><br/><p>White Tiger wasn\u2019t happy. \u201cHow can you not understand? Aren\u2019t you looking at a new painting?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had a fierce nature and everyone knew this.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi quickly finished painting before glancing at Little Vermilion Bird. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Vermilion Bird was holding the picture book and he pointed to the word on the cover. \u201cI don\u2019t know this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi examined it and his pupils shrank. This was a line on the originally empty space of the cover.</p><br/><p>God\u2019s Wisdom \u2014 Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thoughtfully rubbed these words.</p><br/><p>Little Houqing mentioned, \u201cThey weren\u2019t there before.\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger stared at the three children. \u201cThis is a very precious thing. How can you scribble on it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Nine Tails protested. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do it. It appeared on its own!\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger refuted, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t there before. Why did it appear in your hands if you didn\u2019t do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the past, Houqing would try to stop White Tiger\u2019s arrogance. This time, he didn\u2019t open his mouth. It was because this book was too important for them. It was their spiritual sustenance during Xie Xi\u2019s five years of sleep.</p><br/><p>They might know that the flower god was sleeping but in the eyes of ordinary people, sleeping for so long was really worrying.</p><br/><p>This magical picture book seemed to tell Houqing and White Tiger that the flower god wasn\u2019t a mortal. A god was different and there was nothing abnormal about sleeping for a long time.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke softly, \u201cGod\u2019s wisdom, Xie Xi.\u201d</p><br/><p>The five little ones stared at him, understanding yet not understanding. Little Vermilion Bird asked, \u201cWhat is god\u2019s wisdom? What is Xie Xi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi explained, \u201cThe book is the god\u2019s wisdom. Xie Xi is my name.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was interesting and their attention was grabbed. \u201cThe name of Lord Flower God?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cYes, my name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon cocked his head. He couldn\u2019t speak so he could only wait for others to ask the questions. Fortunately, Little Nine Tails had similar thoughts and wondered, \u201cWhat is a name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing also asked, \u201cLord Flower God\u2019s name isn\u2019t Flower God?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a name. It is a title.\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger opened his mouth. \u201cWhat is the difference between a title and a name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cA title doesn\u2019t belong to me alone while the name does belong to me alone. Even if there is the same name, in the eyes of acquaintances, this name is unique to that person. It is the most special self-existence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi never understood why people in this quasi-world had no real names.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird, White Tiger, Houqing and Nine Tails, these titles weren\u2019t unique. They were inherited and passed down.</p><br/><p>Purple Nine, Red Two, White 99 on Rose Mountain\u2026 this concept was the same. It was rough and simple.</p><br/><p>It was true that a name wasn\u2019t purely unique but for one person, it was their true self. Xie Xi was Xie Xi, an existence that had been recognized since birth.</p><br/><p>Little Vermilion Bird\u2019s heart was tickled. \u201cLord Flower God, can you give me a name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled. The other four also glanced at him. They were obvious or hid it but they were all looking forward to a name.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>He just agreed when he felt dizzy.</p><br/><p>This was a situation that occurred when he wanted to sleep because he was too tired. What happened? He had only woken up for a few months this time. Why was he sleeping again? Was it because he painted too many images?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to give them names but the words on his lips couldn\u2019t be spoken. It was as if there was a force stopping his tongue from moving.</p><br/><p>Then a blank voice filled his mind.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon, lifespan of 500 years, died from thunder tribulation.</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird, lifespan of 300 years, died from a fire tribulation.</p><br/><p>White Tiger, lifespan of 90 years, died in battle.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails, lifespan of 300 years, died from his divinity being extinguished.</p><br/><p>Houqing, lifespan of 80 years, died from aging.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shocked. How could this be? They should live for a long time with heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>The blank voice was heard again. \u201cGive them names, acknowledge their existence and God will disappear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi found that this voice belonged to him. It was just calmer and knowledgable.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Don\u2019t harm me!\u2019</p><br/><p>This was definitely a real cry from Xie Xi\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>He had no idea what he used to be like but thinking of the succubus, an unscrupulous creature, he estimated that\u2026 it probably wasn\u2019t very good.</p><br/><p>This sentence reminded Xie Xi to think more.</p><br/><p>Without waiting for Xie Xi to open his mouth, Jiang Xie spoke coldly, \u201cWe have been flying for 20 hours and we\u2019re tired.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hurriedly echoed, \u201cRight, very tired.\u201d</p><br/><p>The demon brother looked disappointed as he gazed at Xie Xi. \u201cThen I will come to you tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie helped him refused. \u201cTomorrow we have to report, we\u2019re very busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>This bad attitude and bad tone didn\u2019t annoy the demon. He just scratched the back of his head. \u201cYes, I am too anxious. You\u2026 rest first. I will wait for you to settle down.\u201d His polite tone was obviously towards Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s expression became more difficult to see.</p><br/><p>The demon brother left.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was innocent. He really didn\u2019t do anything but\u2026 this was coming from the mouth of the succubus who didn\u2019t like to wear clothing. It was like a cat saying it didn\u2019t like fish, a dog saying it didn\u2019t like bones, a bee saying it didn\u2019t collect honey\u2026</p><br/><p>In any case, he couldn\u2019t explain it clearly! It was all from this person\u2019s imagination!</p><br/><p>The two people were still in the same dormitory and this was for certain. Jiang Xie was unfamiliar with the Demon World and needed someone to guide him. Xie Xi had slept in the same room as him for a year and was very qualified.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Xie Xi also didn\u2019t know much about this Demon World and basically relied on guessing.</p><br/><p>The dormitory environment of the Demon World and Heaven were completely different.</p><br/><p>Heaven was bright and light while this side was darker.</p><br/><p>From tables to chairs and bedding\u2026 they were different colours but they were all dark tones such as dark red, dark blue, pure black and deep purple. The only bright colour was grey, which was also symmetrical.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked the jealous Jiang Xie, \u201cCan you adapt to this style?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suggested, \u201cOther things aren\u2019t easy to change but the bedding can be changed.\u201d They had beige bedding in Heaven, which was warm and bright. This place was pure black and had a velvet texture. It felt weird.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cI should do the same as the people in this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was what Jiang Xie used to tell the succubus. Now he was in the Demon World and it was his turn to say it to himself. It could be said that his heart was full of bitterness. If he really wanted to do the same as the people of this world, he shouldn\u2019t stop Xie Xi tonight\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew at a glance what this person was thinking and quickly changed the topic. \u201cWhat would you like for dinner?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s senses returned. \u201cLet\u2019s go out to eat. I want to eat the dishes of the Demon World.\u201d</p><br/><p>Who knew what there was to eat in the damn Demon World but Xie Xi had to say, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go out to eat. I will treat you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie nodded, settled everything and went out with Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi used this time to go to the bathroom to do his homework, using a food app to look up a good restaurant.</p><br/><p>It not only had to be good to eat, it should be clean and have private boxes. Xie Xi was really afraid to meet someone he knew who would invite him again. Then someone wouldn\u2019t eat because he would be full of vinegar.</p><br/><p>The situation in the First Domain wasn\u2019t much different from First Heaven. It was also a bustling city scene.</p><br/><p>If there was one thing different, it was the slightly different architectural style.</p><br/><p>Heaven had the classical white style while the Demon World had the dark gothic style.</p><br/><p>The people\u2019s clothing wasn\u2019t much different. It was modern and they wore everything.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi did his homework ahead of time and reluctantly brought Jiang Xie to a restaurant.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked, \u201cYou used to often come here?\u2019</p><br/><p>This was Xie Xi\u2019s first time but he was a native succubus and could only respond, \u201cYes, the\u2026\u201d He tried to remember the name of the signature dish. \u201cThe carbon roasted Lulu beast isn\u2019t bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was a bit interested. \u201cLulu beast?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a specialty of the First Domain. They don\u2019t have it in Heaven so I will take you to taste it.</p><br/><p>Such a chat improved the atmosphere and Jiang Xie\u2019s mood became slightly brighter.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi came in and the waiter\u2019s eyes lit up when he saw Xie Xi. \u201cXiao Xie, you\u2019re back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He was a real celebrity!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s bright mood fell again.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the waiter didn\u2019t say much. \u201cGo to sit. I will help you place an order\u2026\u201d Then he saw Jiang Xie. \u201cIs there a friend? Oh, it is the exchange student from Heaven?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had to say, \u201cYes, I brought him to taste our specialty.\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter smiled. \u201cHe looks very handsome. An angel\u2019s face is truly good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi and Jiang Xie didn\u2019t know how to answer for a moment.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the waiter said, \u201cSince you want to try the specialty, I will have them kill a male Lulu beast to give you a good supplement.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said with a smile, \u201cI am troubling you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter was surprised. \u201cWhy are you so polite with me\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was afraid this person would say something and quickly interrupted. \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten it in a year and missed it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter was very happy. \u201cYes, you can\u2019t eat the delicious Lulu beast in Heaven. Wait and I guarantee you\u2019ll be full of strength after eating. There is no problem going 300 rounds\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really didn\u2019t know if it was the Demon World or if his own succubus was too dirty. Why did he keep encountering these things?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sat down without a word and Xie Xi didn\u2019t know what to say\u2026</p><br/><p>Then Jiang Xie opened his mouth. \u201cYou have many friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really didn\u2019t have many friends but if Jiang Xie wanted him to have more friends then he could only have more friends. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeaven is too rigid. You must\u2019ve lived a very restrained life.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a pit in these words and Xie Xi sharply jumped over it. \u201cNo, I am very happy with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words swept away the haze that covered Jiang Xie for the whole day, finally bringing a smile to his eyes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was relieved and the two people were finally able to chat.</p><br/><p>After a while, the waiter came to serve them.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had already seen the pictures so he could be stable when he saw the whole Lulu beast.</p><br/><p>It looked a bit like a sheep but was the size of a rooster. It looked quite fierce and combined with the Demon World\u2019s style of plating, it was a tough appearance.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned when he saw it.</p><br/><p>The waiter said, \u201cI will give the Lulu treasure to the angel brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>What was the Lulu treasure? Xie Xi didn\u2019t think too much.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was a true angel and didn\u2019t know what it was.</p><br/><p>The waiter cut the Lulu beast a few times. Then he cut off a certain part of it and placed it on Jiang Xie\u2019s plate.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood and almost laughed.</p><br/><p>The waiter winked. \u201cAngel brother, refuel. This thing is a special supplement. If you eat it, you can ensure Xiao Xie can\u2019t get out of bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter sent an \u2018Am I good?\u2019 expression to Xie Xi. Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to eat. He wanted to go under the table to calm down!</p><br/><p>The moment the waiter left, the atmosphere of the box became strange. Jiang Xie squinted at the plate of Lu Lu treasure. \u201cHave you eaten this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi vaguely replied, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to eat then don\u2019t eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie lowered his eyes and whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. If it is safe then I should adapt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Why was he so stubborn? In fact, he was thinking about the waiter\u2019s words!</p><br/><p>After eating, the two people went back. Xie Xi was able to control his clothes after becoming an adult and they wouldn\u2019t disappear anymore.</p><br/><p>Of course, Jiang Xie didn\u2019t know this. He thought that Xie Xi had been in Heaven for a year and finally adapted. He became a demon who loved to wear clothes.</p><br/><p>Back in the dormitory, Xie Xi started to arrange his things.</p><br/><p>One bed was on the east side and one on the west side, while the appliances were the same.</p><br/><p>A 1.5 metre bed was very crowded for two people to sleep. In Heaven, Jiang Xie secretly changed to a large bed and the two people slept comfortably.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was making the bed when he saw a button beside it and curiously asked, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>He pressed down and the two beds joined together with a loud sound.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Jiang Xie, what angel was he? This Demon World was his land of joy!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie also didn\u2019t expect it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his mouth. \u201cThis will save you from buying a bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, he saw that his side also had a button. He was from the Demon World and couldn\u2019t ask what it was. He directly pressed it, wondering if it would separate the beds?</p><br/><p>This there, there was a clear opening sound and Xie Xi\u2019s beside opened. There was a pile of things inside.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared and almost wanted to chop off his hands!</p><br/><p>This thing\u2026 it was full of sex supplies!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s ears turned red.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi slammed the lid shut and even wanted to lock it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie remembered that he was an angel and held back. \u201cShall we rest early?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a bath.\u201d</p><br/><p>During this time, Jiang Xie could be said to be thinking happily.</p><br/><p>In Heaven, he had never used a black bed. Thus, he didn\u2019t know that snow-white skin sleeping on black velvet sheets would be such a seductive scene.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared in a dazzled manner, as if he had seen the most beautiful pearl on the sea floor. He wanted to kiss Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>The Lu Lu treasure\u2019s efficacy was just a commercial gimmick and was actually useless. Still, if Xie Xi wasn\u2019t a pure-blood succubus then he really wouldn\u2019t be able to get out of bed the next morning.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi indulged him because Jiang Xie had come to a strange place and ate a few jars of vinegar. It was very pitiful, especially since there was a high probability that he would have to eat several more jars\u2026</p><br/><p>The welcome party in the Demon World was held directly at the bar. Xie Xi accidentally discovered that only a few demons didn\u2019t wear clothes.</p><br/><p>Well, the Demon World had seven races after all. The other big demons were a bit open but didn\u2019t see clothes as the enemy.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was still respected as an exchange student from Heaven. Just as the angels watched Xie Xi, the demons looked at Jiang Xie in a strange manner.</p><br/><p>A succubus took the initiative to hook him. \u201cTonight\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could finish, Jiang Xie declared, \u201cI have a lover.\u201d</p><br/><p>Miss Succubus shrugged. \u201cWhat about it? Come and try. The happiness here isn\u2019t something you can have in Heaven.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s demeanour was cold and he easily refused. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Miss Succubus didn\u2019t keep trying and went to play with other demons. There were people on Jiang Xie\u2019s side but Xie Xi was surrounded by a crowd.</p><br/><p>A group of big demons in a suit or leather held glasses of wine and told him, \u201cXiao Xie, my hair became white while you were gone for the year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Another said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back. I wanted to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Others said, \u201cNo one is as good as you. Xiao Xie, tonight\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t listen and hurriedly interrupted, \u201cI have something to do and will go first.\u201d</p><br/><p>A great demon wondered, \u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought that if he stayed longer, someone would become too sour!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie followed Xie Xi out and was silent on the way back to the dormitory.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI\u2019m in love with you and won\u2019t mess with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart warmed but he was still very uncomfortable. \u201cI\u2019m fine. They are in the past and I don\u2019t care.\u201d He spoke well but he was actually dying of vinegar.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Who made him a succubus? A succubus was such a creature.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, there was a person blocking the door when they returned to the dormitory.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s face sank in an instant.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was worried!</p><br/><p>The demon classmate opened his mouth. \u201cXiao Xie, please tonight\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t hear it. He opened the door and went inside.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hurriedly followed. Who would\u2019ve expected the demon classmate to be slippery and follow them inside? \u201cI know you have the angel brother but it is very difficult for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at Jiang Xie and said, \u201cI won\u2019t go out in the evening.\u201d</p><br/><p>The demon classmate replied, \u201cThat\u2019s fine. I can come to you here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mouth curved downwards. \u201cThis is a double bedroom. Jiang Xie is also present.\u201d</p><br/><p>The demon student was chagrined. \u201cAngels are really troublesome. They shouldn\u2019t be shy about this thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The demons were too open!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s face was as dark as the bottom of a pot.</p><br/><p>The demon classmate refused to give up and kept pleading, \u201cXiao Xie, you can do well. Only you have the most resources and only you can make the most accurate guess. You can\u2019t just take care of yourself and ignore us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d What was this situation?</p><br/><p>Not only was he stunned, Jiang Xie also froze.</p><br/><p>The demon classmate spoke through snot and tears, \u201cI really don\u2019t understand the preferences of the sex professor. I watched the movies and want to vomit. I finally handed it in and was scolded bloody. He said this wasn\u2019t a helper film but an impotence film!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s reaction was half a beat slow and his face was incredulous. This demon wasn\u2019t asking to sleep with him but was seeking resources?</p><br/><p>The demon classmate once again spoke, \u201cI really can\u2019t fail this year! I won\u2019t be able to get a job. I don\u2019t want to be a skeleton soldier!\u201d It was real.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

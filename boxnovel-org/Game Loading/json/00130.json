He was around the size of a cat with fur as white as snow and the fur was as soft as marshmallows. He had a pair of golden eyes and the gentle voice could really make a girl\u2019s heart burst.</p><br/><p>The roses were afraid of beasts but they saw this little guy and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cSo cute!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whose cub this is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is white, the Sage White Tiger\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible, the Sage White Tiger only has martial arts in his heart. It is impossible to talk about love, let alone have a baby.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Lord White Tiger is a man of war and has never been near a woman!\u201d</p><br/><p>A flower whispered, \u201cSpeaking of which, wasn\u2019t our Lord Azure Dragon also abstinent? Now isn\u2019t he going to be married?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was obviously something that shouldn\u2019t be said. The group of roses stared at him. \u201cWhat are you saying. Our Lord Azure Dragon loves Xie Xi and broke the ring of abstinence for him. This is his true heart and there are no regrets!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was speechless when he heard this.</p><br/><p>Could they stop acting crazy by themselves? There was no desire or getting close to a woman.</p><br/><p>Oh, it was true about the not getting close to a woman. It was because the third child was a big pervert who thought a male could give cubs!</p><br/><p>However, there was one person who was normal. The startled Purple Nine asked, \u201cYou killed all these worms?\u201d She asked the little tiger.</p><br/><p>The tiger looked at her purple clothes with a hint of disappointment and then raised his chin. \u201cOf course, no one can bully Mommy!\u201d</p><br/><p>The cub was small but rushed all this way with fearless strength. Xie Xi was sure this was Old Three.</p><br/><p>As for who Old Three thought he was born from\u2026 Xie Xi wanted to ask Mr. Jiang this question.</p><br/><p>Purple Nine was still talking to the little tiger. \u201cYou\u2026 beat the worms by yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was very shocking to the roses. If compared to human society, it was tantamount to a small cat killing a mountain of zombies. It was amazing!</p><br/><p>The tiger was very proud and held his head high. \u201cI am my mother\u2019s proudest baby, omnipotent!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had a toothache.</p><br/><p>Purple Nine asked again, \u201cThat\u2026 who is your father?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy father is naturally\u2026\u201d The little tiger raised his head and shook his back. There was no response and he shook it again\u2026 no response\u2026</p><br/><p>The little tiger was angry and swung its claws, grabbing a bug\u2019s wings and placing it on his back.</p><br/><p>He was satisfied and raised his head in a cool posture. \u201cOf course, it is the invincible in combat, mother\u2019s favourite white tiger of war!\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of roses, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t look. If this was his cub, he would throw the cub back into the furnace to be remade!</p><br/><p>The white tiger prototype had a pair of wings. This little guy had no ways so he gave himself wings!</p><br/><p>The yellow roses were worthy of being the family\u2019s well-known easily swayed members. \u201cIt turned out to be the sage\u2019s son. Really extraordinary!\u201d</p><br/><p>The roses looked at him and suspected he was blind. \u2018Old Yellow, how can you see the insect wings on his back as extraordinary?!\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mouth twitched as he felt humiliated and lost.</p><br/><p>The little tiger perfectly inherited his father\u2019s nature. He boasted with his tail towards the sky as he looked at the yellow rose. \u201cYou have good eyesight but unfortunately, only my mother really understands me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to slip away\u2026</p><br/><p>The little tiger had probably finished and stood up tall, only to suddenly cry out, \u201cMommy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t look back.</p><br/><p>However, the little tiger had already rushed over and steadily fell into his arms. \u201cMommy, Mommy, I found you!\u201d Please consult a tadpole to find your mother.</p><br/><p>The roses looked over with expressions of horror.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also wasn\u2019t happy as he held the milk white tiger. \u201cI\u2019m not, I didn\u2019t\u2026 I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t finish talking when the roses burst out laughing, \u201cHahaha, little tiger, you have the wrong person!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The tiger didn\u2019t care about them. He was excitedly rubbing his head in Xie Xi\u2019s arms as if going to become bald.</p><br/><p>Purple Nine couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cHe isn\u2019t your mother, he is a male.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, Xie Xi forgot that men couldn\u2019t be mothers!</p><br/><p>The little tiger wasn\u2019t stupid and quickly changed his words. \u201cDaddy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Purple Nine froze.</p><br/><p>The little tiger found a comfortable posture in Xie Xi\u2019s arms and said happily, \u201cTwo fathers are confusing so I just call him Mommy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Purple Nine was surprised. \u201cYour mother is a man?\u201d In ancient times, there were mothers called Mommy but they definitely weren\u2019t men!</p><br/><p>The little tiger cocked his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Then he turned around and asked Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026Daddy, are you a man?\u201d Xie Xi had no expression as he decided to send the two people into the sky as fireworks.</p><br/><p>Red Three came forward. \u201cLittle guy, you have the wrong person. This is a white rose but he isn\u2019t your mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was moved. He didn\u2019t grasp the situation himself yet the others believed him. Who wouldn\u2019t be moved?</p><br/><p>A white rose spoke up, \u201cYes, this little tiger just called me mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other white roses smiled and responded.</p><br/><p>The little tiger was angry. \u201cI\u2026 I just got it wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Red Three opened his mouth, \u201cThen aren\u2019t you mistaken now?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little tiger cried out, \u201cOf course not!\u201d</p><br/><p>The old chief calmly came to the scene and stated, \u201cUs roses are born in a nursery and we never have children. How can you be sure that your next of kin is a white rose?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little tiger shook his fur. \u201cThis white colour is from my mother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was silent and cruelly stabbed him, \u201cSage White Tiger is also white\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is because Daddy is so white that I can be this pure white! Have you seen any other tigers? They are black and yellow and hybrids of different colours!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Can you respect the king of the forest? This was tiger skin print and an authentic tiger colour!</p><br/><p>The roses also believed it. \u201cYes, a tiger is mostly two colours. A full snow white tiger like this is indeed rare.\u201d</p><br/><p>A white rose wondered, \u201cThere are many white creatures. Why must it be a rose?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little tiger had evidence. He turned around and showed his back. \u201cLook! There are two little petals here!\u201d</p><br/><p>The roses came around and examined him in detail. It was true\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThere really are petals\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre the petals so thick?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, it does look like rose petals!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe shape, colour and also location\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw it too and whispered, \u201cAre these your wings?\u201d</p><br/><p>The White Tiger had two wings. The little tiger shook himself for a long time because he was trying to get these wings out of the fur?</p><br/><p>The little tiger heard Xie Xi\u2019s voice and looked up with surprise. \u201cYes, the shape of my wings is in Daddy\u2019s petals!\u201d</p><br/><p>Could genetics still be like this?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was deeply convinced in his heart!</p><br/><p>The roses also believed it and glanced at Xie Xi with surprise.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t bear to fool them. \u201cThere might be some understandings. Let\u2019s wait for Lord White Tiger to come and then it will be clear.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was so stoic that he didn\u2019t look like a scum who was about to marry Azure Dragon while having a baby with White Tiger\u2026</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2026 they believed it again!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was afraid things would regress and stated, \u201cI will take him back to the house first. I will bother Chief to send Lord White Tiger a letter asking him to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old chief replied, \u201cYes, I just don\u2019t know if this letter can be delivered\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was adamant. \u201cIt won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger was Gars and Xie Xi believed he would come.</p><br/><p>The little tiger also said, \u201cHow can Daddy\u2019s letter not be sent? My daddy will read and read it again, loving\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t listen and rubbed the little tiger\u2019s head. \u201cAre you tired?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little tiger was bewitched by this gentle voice. \u201cSo tired!\u201d His voice was young and spoiled.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s lips curved downwards and he took the tiger back to his room.</p><br/><p>He did it on purpose since he suspected this little tiger was pretending like the silver fox.</p><br/><p>As for this silly fellow, wasn\u2019t Old Three stupid?</p><br/><p>A fool who dreamt about fighting a dragon!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi closed the door and the tiger didn\u2019t change. Instead, he shook his head as he looked around. \u201cDaddy, you\u2019re so poor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The little tiger quickly added, \u201cStill, it doesn\u2019t matter. Any place with Daddy is the best!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared for a while and finally had to admit that this little tiger was just a little tiger.</p><br/><p>Was this really the child of him and White Tiger?</p><br/><p>Then the question was, how did they have a baby?</p><br/><p>Wait a minute\u2026 plants seemed to have double\u2026 sex\u2026</p><br/><p>Damn! The little rose couldn\u2019t help letting out a crude outburst. Surely he wasn\u2019t a man and a woman? No, he had been here a few days and checked his body. There were no abnormalities!</p><br/><p>But who set the rules\u2026 could a pure male body have a child?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s scalp was numb and he wanted to learn Drunken Martial Arts and go hit the tiger after drinking a bowl of wine!</p><br/><p>It was unknown how long the little tiger had been searching for Xie Xi and he also killed a bunch of worms. He was really tired.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought of these things and the little guy in his arms had already fallen asleep.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw the sweetly sleeping tiger cub and his mood was very complicated.</p><br/><p>The world was really unusual. Who would think that one day he would wonder if a tiger was his child\u2026</p><br/><p>Wait, the White Tiger would definitely come and then he could ask Jiang Xie what the hell was happening!</p><br/><p>He put down the sleeping tiger and opened the roster.</p><br/><p>He had been busy all day and repaired flowers of various colours. He should\u2019ve collected enough illustrations.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, he opened the roster and prompts kept emerging in the lower right corner.</p><br/><p>[Promotion Task: The yellow/ blue/ white/ red rose have been repaired and the illustration is missing a name.]</p><br/><p>If he wanted the names then he had to look for the god\u2019s wisdom.</p><br/><p>Judging from the present clues, there were ten fragments of the god\u2019s wisdom under the care of the holy beasts and demon beasts. He had to go to the Holy Mountain and Demon Sea respectively.</p><br/><p>He had just closed the roster when he heard sad birdsong outside.</p><br/><p>The little tiger was really worn out and his movements were restrained.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi patted him on the back and smoothed out his fur, letting the little fellow sleep sweetly and comfortably again.</p><br/><p>He looked outside and saw the sky lighting up.</p><br/><p>The sound of the birds became much smaller and could only be heard intermittently, all of them full of sadness.</p><br/><p>Red Three turned pale. \u201cHundreds of birds singing\u2026 Sage Vermillion Bird\u2026 is falling.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t Vermilion Bird the fifth prince? How could his soul be dying?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Different choices will lead to different outcomes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cThey are players. Why is there a task assigned about them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cThis is a real world. Why can\u2019t players become tasks?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sobered up.</p><br/><p>A quasi-world was a real world and players were also real. There was no difference between then in the centre.</p><br/><p>Everything in the quasi-world could be used to publish tasks and players could also be assigned as tasks,</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at the four people in the distance and his mind worked quickly.</p><br/><p>The task was to save them or kill them. Xie Xi eyed these words.</p><br/><p>Who was the \u2018them\u2019 referring to? Chen Qing and Kong Rongliang? Or was it to save all four people?</p><br/><p>Based on the current situation, they were still safe.</p><br/><p>Chen Qing was bitten but hadn\u2019t become a zombie. Even if he did become a zombie, a zombie with no legs would have very low fighting power. Kong Rongliang might not act but the man and woman behind him wouldn\u2019t sit idly by.</p><br/><p>Then what was exactly the danger? Why was it \u2018save them\u2019 instead of \u2018save Chen Qing\u2019?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t see far with his current vision. He asked Jiang Xie, \u201cMaster, are there zombies behind them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will take a look.\u201d Jiang Xie looked around and couldn\u2019t see anything. Then his eyes narrowed and he stared at something in the back. \u201cThe black fog of the forest is spreading outward. If this continues, the zombies inside will be close to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood the words. It seemed that in order to save them, he had to take this group of people away from the black fog and zombies!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie knew that Xie Xi had made a decision but he still questioned, \u201cWhat will you choose?\u201d</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter if he saved or killed them. Jiang Xie had seen this multiple choice question and clearly knew what the focus was.</p><br/><p>The most important thing was to look at your heart and make a decision. There was no saviour or demon here. Not regretting was the true creed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cFirst save them if possible!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was an ordinary people. He couldn\u2019t kill people for no reason and it was impossible for him to ignore the life of strangers. All he could do was his best. If he couldn\u2019t save them then he would give up on the task. The side task wasn\u2019t impossible and there was no need to bear the guilt of killing for a small reward!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t surprised and his lips curved. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had an idea about how to save them. The zombies were numerous and fierce but they were also easy to deal with. They didn\u2019t have a brain and only knew how to follow the heat source. To save these people, they just needed to light a fire in the opposite direction.</p><br/><p>At this time, Kong Rongliang had already arrived by Chen Qing\u2019s side. He ignored the pus and rancid smell of the lower body and carried the person.</p><br/><p>Chen Qing still scolded him. \u201cYou damn mindless Kong Rongliang. Why are you saving me?</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t live. I have no legs and I can\u2019t use any props. I can only die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kong Rongliang was silent as he kept carrying the person.</p><br/><p>\u201cStupid, you are a big fool!\u201d Chen Qing scolded, tears and snot running down his face, making it even uglier.</p><br/><p>Then the woman screamed, \u201cZombies\u2026 zombies are coming again!\u201d</p><br/><p>The black fog of the forest suddenly accelerated. The zombies inside smelt prey and issued low roars.</p><br/><p>The last man was pale and couldn\u2019t endure it anymore. \u201cCheng Han, don\u2019t worry about Kong Rongliang. Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman named Cheng Han watched the approaching dark fog and then the body covered with pus and blood. Kong Rongliang wasn\u2019t willing to leave Chen Qing\u2026</p><br/><p>She gritted her teeth and finally succumbed to her heart. \u201cI can\u2019t control them. Tian Tao, we will go first!\u201d Then she followed the man and ran towards the brightness.</p><br/><p>They were well-qualified and their legs were extremely fast. They only ran a bit before disappearing. Kong Rongliang was focused on strength. He was holding Chen Qing and was probably afraid that too many bumps would aggravate his injuries. Thus, he ran very slowly.</p><br/><p>He saw the black fog approaching and the zombies nearing.</p><br/><p>Chen Qing\u2019s voice was hoarse. \u201cKong Rongliang, you are stupid. Those selected by the Central Government are wastes abandoned by their original world. I have long been damned and it isn\u2019t worth it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Kong Rongliang scoffed. \u201cYou aren\u2019t a waste. I would\u2019ve died in the last world if it wasn\u2019t for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Qing roared, \u201cThen cherish your damn life! I didn\u2019t save you for you to die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kong Rongliang didn\u2019t say anything and kept running.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was setting a fire and couldn\u2019t hear their words. He only vaguely heard Chen Qing\u2019s loud voice saying those selected by the Central Government were abandoned wastes.</p><br/><p>X also told him that he was selected because no one needed him and he no longer needed that world. Were all players like this?</p><br/><p>Then what about X? Sixth Prince Sirius flashed through Xie Xi\u2019s mind. It was impossible for Xie Xi to forget his words.</p><br/><p>\u2018Sein, there is no light at the bottom of the sea.\u2019</p><br/><p>The fire was lit and Xie Xi no longer thought about it as he focused on spreading the fire.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cGive it to me. You go first.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had lit the fire in the opposite direction of Kong Rongliang and Chen Qing, so that the zombies would give up on those heat sources and rush to this side. Jiang Xie urged Xie Xi to go to Kong Rongliang first since it was safer.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi answered, \u201cWe will do it together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you being polite?\u201d Jiang Xie\u2019s lips curved. \u201cI am your Master, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>His smiling appearance made Xie Xi feel guilty. X definitely knew that Xie Xi was lying to him and knew they weren\u2019t in a teacher-student relationship!</p><br/><p>However, Xie Xi couldn\u2019t let him think about it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cIt is because you are my master that we have to be together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it natural for an apprentice to follow their master?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie knew this little liar was trying to coax him and couldn\u2019t help smiling slightly. Then he looked at the goodwill value to wake himself up.</p><br/><p>There was a raging fire and the attention of the zombies was diverted. One by one, they came to this side, causing the dark fog to spread over here. Jiang Xie and Xie Xi immediately left and caught up with Kong Rongliang.</p><br/><p>Kong Rongliang wasn\u2019t stupid. Once he saw the fire, he knew it was artificially created. Then Xie Xi and Jiang Xie appeared at this time and he instantly understood. \u201cThank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cThe fire will soon go out. We have to quickly find a place to hide!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kong Rongliang nodded again while the Chen Qing in his arms started scolding him, \u201cPut me down! Stop dragging down other people!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him and quickly looked away. Sure enough, this appearance was terrible\u2026 there were pus and decaying flesh but Kong Rongliang didn\u2019t care.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie knew what Xie Xi was thinking and felt this person was funny and cute. He moved a bit faster, quietly separating Xie Xi and Kong Rongliang and blocking Chen Qing from view.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled and glanced at him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie winked with his left eye.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stiffened and turned away. He thought in his heart, \u2018Too flashy!\u2019</p><br/><p>Since this was disrespectful towards his teacher, he held back and didn\u2019t say it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie and Xie Xi\u2019s fire wasn\u2019t small. It burned for seven or eight minutes. This was enough time for them to distance themselves from the zombie tide and they temporarily hid at the foot of a mountain.</p><br/><p>Zombies chased after heat sources but they were afraid of the light of the world. It was relatively safe under this bright rock.</p><br/><p>Kong Rongliang put down Chen Qing and thanked Xie Xi and Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head and said, \u201cIt is nothing.\u201d He didn\u2019t do anything other than lighting a fire.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at him and didn\u2019t speak. Xie Xi knew he was asking about the progress of the task.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took a look and froze.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi directly shared the side task.</p><br/><p>(6) Find him a pair of legs.</p><br/><p>(6) Kill them.</p><br/><p>It was a multiple choice question again. What was searching for legs? Who were they for? Chen Qing? What about after finding them? Could they be restored?</p><br/><p>The other option was more toxic. If he didn\u2019t want to look for legs then he wouldn\u2019t look. Why did he need to kill someone? He still needed to kill them? Was it because Chen Qing would die and Kong Rongliang would retaliate? That\u2019s why he needed to kill both of them?</p><br/><p>How was this side task so unfair?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi watched Jiang Xie and Jiang Xie watched him back.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mouth moved, \u2018I want to look for legs.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u2018Wait, I will go quickly.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u2018I\u2019ll go.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u2018The apprentice should be obedient.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He suddenly regretted pretending to be teacher and apprentice. He should\u2019ve said that he was Jiang Xie\u2019s saviour and Jiang Xie accompanied him to pay him back. Then Jiang Xie would be obedient!</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, it was already too late.</p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t difficult to find a pair of legs. There were zombies everyone and Jiang Xie could easily find a pair of legs.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was somewhat disgusted by the zombies\u2026</p><br/><p>Kong Rongliang was saying, \u201cWhat should I do? How can I help you with this injury?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Qing cursed. \u201cWhat fucking help? I am dead. Even a god can\u2019t save me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can be cured as long as you go back to the centre.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can I go back when I can\u2019t accomplish the task?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kong Rongliang told him, \u201cI will help you do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Qing shouted, \u201cYou are dreaming. Wait for me to become a zombie and I will kill you first!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at Chen Qing. Chen Qing was fierce towards Kong Rongliang but he was more normal towards Xie Xi. \u201cThis little brother, quickly take this idiot and leave. I really will drag you down!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew that he would have to face more disgusting zombies in the future and forced himself to look at his half zombie. \u201cWhat will you do when we leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Qing told him, \u201cIt isn\u2019t a big deal to die.\u201d Xie Xi replied, \u201cDeath is easy. What if you want to die but can\u2019t die?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Qing was stunned.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi emphasized, \u201cSeeing you like this, you haven\u2019t lost your mind, which means you won\u2019t be a mindless zombie. If you become a new species, what if you still keep your mind but you\u2019re filled with a desire to eat people?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kong Rongliang and Chen Qing, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d Xie Xi\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cAt that time, you won\u2019t be able to die even if you want to.\u201d</p><br/><p>The foolish man and half zombie was stupefied.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s ears were so good that he heard this even when he was collecting legs.</p><br/><p>He smiled. \u201cThis little liar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie dragged back the legs where he saw that Kong Rongliang and Chen Qing were quiet and a bit stunned.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was cleaning his ears.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie thought he would be afraid of this disgusting thing and placed the legs behind him. \u201cI found it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes lit up and he flattered, \u201cMaster, you are really fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t he also quick to compliment? Jiang Xie placed the legs next to Chen Qing and took advantage of this to block the zombie.</p><br/><p>He motioned to Xie Xi to look at the next task.</p><br/><p>(7) Put the legs on him.</p><br/><p>(7) Kill them.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

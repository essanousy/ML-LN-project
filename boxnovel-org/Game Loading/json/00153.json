He must give them names or they wouldn\u2019t survive the hundreds of years to meet him again.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he had to acknowledge their existence.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird, White Tiger, Nine Tails or Houqing. They were\u2026 Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Xie Xi couldn\u2019t say anything at this moment. There was a burst of dizziness and he fell into darkness.</p><br/><p>There seemed to be someone talking in his ear as he experienced a long dream. The voice of a young child, a bird chirping, noisy bickering\u2026</p><br/><p>Later, these sounds slowly faded away. The tender and young voices became pleasing to the ear while the bird chirping became a charming teenage voice\u2026</p><br/><p>How long did he sleep? Xie Xi didn\u2019t feel relaxed when he woke up. He felt like he awakened from a deep nightmare and didn\u2019t know what day it was.</p><br/><p>The full adult daisy cried out in a choked manner, \u201cLord Flower God, you woke up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned to see a slender and graceful green daisy. He opened his mouth and spoke in a light voice, \u201cYou are an adult. How can you cry?\u201d</p><br/><p>The dairy wiped his tears and cheered up. \u201cYour Excellency, please wait while I tell everyone. They will definitely be happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Needless to say, the jasmine, magnolia and other flowers entered and had red eyes when they saw Xie Xi. The jasmine was speechless from crying.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told them, \u201cI was just sleeping. How can you all cry?\u201d</p><br/><p>The jasmine sobbed out, \u201cYou slept\u2026 for 15 years.\u201d</p><br/><p>He guessed that he had slept a long time but he was still startled when he heard this number.</p><br/><p>15 years\u2026</p><br/><p>They had all grown up. He promised to give Jiang Xie a brand new childhood but he slept like this. It was too shameful.</p><br/><p>The magnolia was the calmest and she reprimanded the jasmine. \u201cWhy are you crying? You should be pleased that Lord Flower God woke up!\u201d Even so, there were tears in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked around and didn\u2019t see the five little ones.</p><br/><p>The magnolia hurriedly explained, \u201cHouqing and the others are in the Holy Mountain and Demon Sea. I have sent people to inform them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi got out of bed. \u201cOkay.\u201d He didn\u2019t know how long he would be awake so it was better to see them as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>The first to come back was Houqing. 15 years ago, Houqing had looked around 8 or 9 years old. Now that 15 years had passed, he had gone through the youthful period and had grown into a handsome and extraordinary man.</p><br/><p>Light was shadowing Houqing so his face couldn\u2019t be seen clearly, but his clenched fists and trembling shoulders exposed his emotions.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was pained. He slept while they waited 15 years.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so big.\u201d Xie Xi opened his mouth, voice filled with nostalgia.</p><br/><p>Houqing adjusted his mood while coming over. The tension and uneasiness were buried in his heart. Xie Xi would be deceived by this calm appearance if he hadn\u2019t known Houqing too well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are still like a child.\u201d Xie Xi touched him on the forehead. \u201cShow it if you are excited.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing held his hand, countless emotions filled his eyes as he expressed only a bit of his shock. \u201cYou are awake.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a bang and the door directly turned into wood chips.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi blinked and saw the man standing in the dust. He was generally the same height as Houqing but his facial features were more refined. However, the delicate appearance was suppressed by his fierceness.</p><br/><p>Um.. the grumpy tiger had grown into a mad young man.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi helplessly wondered, \u201cDid my door provoke you? Why did you smash it?\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger appeared beside Xie Xi\u2019s bed in the next moment. His brow was wrinkled but his tone was pitiful. \u201cHow long do you want to sleep? Will you sleep until I get married and have children?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi found this funny. \u201cWhat? You already want to get married and have children?\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger suddenly looked up. His gaze was very fierce but his words became, \u201cDon\u2019t sleep in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing glared at him. \u201cWhat nonsense are you saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger muttered, \u201cThe more he sleeps\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing\u2019s eyes sharpened and White Tiger unexpectedly shut up. If it wasn\u2019t for his ears\u2019 absence, Xie Xi suspected that he would see two drooping tiger ears.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cHave you taken care of your brothers?\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Six was a responsible big brother and with Old Three there, Xie Xi could feel at ease.</p><br/><p>Houqing kept holding his hand and explained warmly, \u201cThey are all very good. 10 years ago, Azure Dragon transformed. After two years, Nine Tails and Vermilion Bird also gradually transformed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had long guessed it but he still felt some regret. The children had grown up but he couldn\u2019t see it!</p><br/><p>White Tiger opened his mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t know where they have run off to. I will go and bring them back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cThere is no hurry, wait for them\u2026\u201d He hadn\u2019t finished when he felt a gushing feeling and he couldn\u2019t stop his cough.</p><br/><p>By the time he stopped coughing, the handkerchief was bright red. Houqing and White Tiger\u2019s faces were frozen, as nervous as if they were facing the end of the world.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi put away the handkerchief. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cWhat is wrong with your body?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m old and a bit sick.\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger frowned. \u201cYou are a god. How can you be troubled by old age and illness?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gazed at him with gentle eyes. \u201cI am Xie Xi.\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger was stunned.</p><br/><p>The clearly panicked Houqing had no colour in his lips but he stayed strong and calm. \u201cIf you are tired, sleep for a while.\u201d This was very pitiful. Houqing preferred to watch Xie Xi fall asleep rather than be in greater danger.</p><br/><p>Even if this sleep lasted decades, he didn\u2019t mind as long as Xie Xi was still there.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not sleepy and there is still work to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing protested, \u201cHow can it compare to your body?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my body?\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing was silent.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told White Tiger, \u201cGo and bring the god\u2019s wisdom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He went and came back like the wind, bringing the god\u2019s wisdom with him.</p><br/><p>It was different from before. Since Xie Xi\u2019s name appeared on the cover, it seemed to be detached from time. It didn\u2019t become old no matter how much it was read.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was just a paintings book before and became the god\u2019s wisdom when it was given a name.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s lips curved and he told the white tiger, \u201cChange back to your body.\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger was surprised. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to see what you look like grown up,\u201d Xie Xi urged.</p><br/><p>The fierce white tiger was like a kitten towards Xie Xi. \u201cWe have to go outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, go to a spacious place.\u201d</p><br/><p>They went to the garden.</p><br/><p>In the large flower sea, Xie Xi leaned lazily on a bamboo chair, his thin body looking like it would turn into petals and fly away with the wind.</p><br/><p>Houqing couldn\u2019t help putting a blanket on his legs. Xie Xi glanced at him. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing didn\u2019t speak and gave him a pillow for his waist. Xie Xi smiled and didn\u2019t say anything more.</p><br/><p>White Tiger changed back. Xie Xi was psychologically prepared but his eyes still brightened. \u201cBeautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>The pure white tiger had extremely beautiful body lines. The unfolded white wings added elegance and dominance, making people marvel at the magic of the creator.</p><br/><p>White Tiger whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s handsome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi changed his words. \u201cYes, very handsome.\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger raised his tail.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi muffled a laugh. \u201cStay still and don\u2019t move.\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took out a pen and paper and drew him.</p><br/><p>Once he finished, White Tiger came over and became a slender young man. He looked over and asked, \u201cMy portrait?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a bit strange to hear but it caused White Tiger to raise his head like his tail. The painting was of a white tiger but the portrait belonged to Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>White Tiger\u2019s mood was particularly good. \u201cHow did you think of drawing me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at the portrait and smiled. \u201cBecause you are very handsome.\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger stared at him with hot ears.</p><br/><p>Houqing interrupted, \u201cGo back to the house. It is cold outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at them and asked, \u201cDo you want your own name that belongs to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Both of them were stunned. Xie Xi wrote the word \u2018White\u2019 on the portrait of the white tiger.</p><br/><p>The second word hadn\u2019t been written when Houqing suddenly grabbed his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Xie Xi didn\u2019t push them away this time. \u201cI said to roll!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cThis is rolling over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean\u2026 get out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no way. My legs have their own ideas.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi angrily cried out, \u201cShall I help you cut them off?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie cleared his throat. \u201cI have many legs and I\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t cut all of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d He wanted a divorce!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t inclined to keep teasing him. After all, the red goodwill showed him that even if there was a high of 999, it could also fall again to -999.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie temporarily placed Vermilion Bird away and spoke with Azure Dragon\u2019s body. \u201cOkay, don\u2019t be angry. I won\u2019t make trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him. This bastard knew that he was fooling around!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cI want to show my mental strength to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sneered. \u201cYou showed your mental illness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie gave a low laugh. \u201cChild, those words aren\u2019t right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Could a psychotic person have his self-esteem hurt? Xie Xi didn\u2019t think so.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, this guy spoke the following sentence, \u201cYou know that your husband is sick so you should quickly kiss\u2026\u201d What was love?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t listen and got up. \u201cI\u2019m going!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie surrendered. \u201cLet\u2019s speak about business!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t believe in this person\u2019s evil!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie quickly continued, \u201cI can only erase some of their memories. I can\u2019t create memories.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi became tense. \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d If this bastard failed, wasn\u2019t Xie Xi going to die badly?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t bear to scare him and replied seriously, \u201cIt is easy. Act out a corresponding memory for them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood. \u201cIt is necessary for me to say the words?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, say it and I will erase all the extra parts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was really time to test his acting skills.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome.\u201d Jiang Xie told him. \u201cAzure Dragon, play, action.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t act and laughed directly. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone was full of laughter, causing Jiang Xie to feel itchy and kiss Xie Xi on the cheek.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gave him a look. \u201cIs this part of the script?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Jiang smiled shamelessly. \u201cThis is the unspoken rule.\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn unspoken rule! Xie Xi\u2019s eyes curved. \u201cDon\u2019t delay me or\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t stand it. He grabbed the person for a kiss but Xie Xi pushed him away. Jiang Xie demanded, \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s cheeks turned red. \u201cNo:</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie looked very wronged. \u201cWe haven\u2019t kissed for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at Vermilion Bird sitting on the bed and his face became redder. \u201cWhat is he looking at?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m the one watching, no one else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi naturally knew this but\u2026 it was weird!</p><br/><p>\u201cI will let Vermilion Bird go outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Vermilion Bird\u2019s room.\u201d \u201cThen I\u2019ll let Azure Dragon go outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t the point! Xie Xi wondered, \u201cIf you let them go out, won\u2019t they angrily kill each other?\u201d As long as there were people outside, they would \u2018wake up.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie became even more wronged. \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat to do? Just\u2026 wait until later.\u201d In any case, he couldn\u2019t kiss in front of a person, even if the person was Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie regretted it. \u201cIf I had known earlier, I wouldn\u2019t have these two bodies together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean, there must be no confusion between the two bodies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m deaf? How are these two sentences the same?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s calculations were invincible. \u201cThe word count is the same.\u201d (TL: In Chinese).</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After staying with this person for so long, he refined the ability to rest pressure. Xie Xi\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change even if a mountain collapsed in front of him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi refused to be intimate in front of another body!</p><br/><p>No matter what tricks Jiang Xie attempted, Xie Xi refused.</p><br/><p>The perverted thoughts in Jiang Xie\u2019s head were purified. \u201cIt is hard to have so many bodies\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glared at him. Jiang Xie corrected himself. \u201cI mean, I love you with five hearts and I\u2019m just resting in other places.\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took a while to respond. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t fall for this. \u201cGet lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them went in a big circle before returning to business.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tried not to laugh and seriously told Vermilion Bird in front of Azure Dragon, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, the words I told you before were a lie. I only love Lord Azure Dragon and don\u2019t want to dissolve my engagement with him. I hope you can understand. Feelings can\u2019t be forced. Who likes who\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie nodded. \u201cYes, just like I will always like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi scolded him. \u201cDon\u2019t speak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke pitifully, \u201cYou used to listen to me before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were giving a lecture!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving a lecture now about our sweet love.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi exclaimed, \u201cWe\u2019re still recording!\u201d Then he realized that he was taken in by this guy. What was recording?</p><br/><p>After doing it again, he finally passed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cCome on, next.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was too lazy to correct him. In any case, this was almost the same as filming. Once he finished, Jiang Xie would also \u2018cut\u2019 it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told Azure Dragon in front of Vermilion Bird, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. My mind has been decided. I want to be with Sage Vermilion Bird. Our engagement\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This time it was better. Jiang Xie didn\u2019t interrupt and waited for Xie Xi to finish. Xie Xi asked, \u201cHow about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was also into the play. \u201cIf you really regret the marriage\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to shake his head and shouted, \u2018Wake up a bit! The ants have been moving for 10 years!\u2019</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cThere is still some time. Shall we take the opportunity to do something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hit him blankly but his heart was tugged.</p><br/><p>The brain circuits of the souls were basically a map of Jiang Xie. Two of them almost died and Xie Xi was actually worried.</p><br/><p>He always felt that the previous X was world-weary. This was despite standing at the peak of Central, becoming the greatest designer and creating countless myths.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was pessimistic and even despised himself. The more he understood, the more Xie Xi had to admit it. A distressed Sirius was actually hiding in this man\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>The trio couldn\u2019t be alone for too long. Once things finished, it was time to withdraw.</p><br/><p>Think about it. They came for a tense showdown so how could they have tea and chat?</p><br/><p>The time had dragged on long enough and Jiang Xie guaranteed something. \u201cThese old beasts have lived for too long. Their concept of time is poor and I can adjust it slightly.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was silent.</p><br/><p>A thousand year old dragon\u2026 a thousand year old bird\u2026 they were really old beasts.</p><br/><p>However, how could this person say it!</p><br/><p>For this Jiang Xie, Xie Xi really had a heart of stone.</p><br/><p>This guy was criticizing himself? How could Xie Xi not believe it?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie finally asked Xie Xi to make up the contents.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told Azure Dragon, \u201cI want to go back to the rose family and cultivate in the nursery for a while, so I will have the strength to repair your scales.\u201d</p><br/><p>He also mentioned the marriage. \u201cWe should wait regarding marriage. On the one hand, I don\u2019t want to stimulate Vermilion Bird again. On the other hand, I want to concentrate on repairing your scales. Can we hold the wedding once you are perfectly healthy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang nodded while holding his hand. \u201cMarriage isn\u2019t urgent. Can we hold the bridal chamber first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026Get lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he said to Vermilion Bird, \u201cI have to go back to the rose family and inform the elders. After all, cancelling a marriage contract isn\u2019t a trivial matter. Many things have to be carefully handled. Can we first conceal our relationship and then reveal it once the marriage contract is cancelled?\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, it was the Holy Mountain. If he was together with Vermilion Bird before the marriage was cancelled, it would be embarrassing. It was better to have a time buffer.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie agreed and then said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter about a public relationship. A private tryst\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he finished speaking, Xie Xi covered his mouth. \u201cI won\u2019t see you again next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie blinked. Xie Xi sneered. \u201cI think your souls are lovelier than you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was really a broken leg!</p><br/><p>Once out the door, Azure Dragon and Vermilion Bird were restored to their original states. They were inscrutable and stared at each other with generous eyes, letting bygones be bygones.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stood between them and realized what it was like to suffocate on the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>He was in a hurry to withdraw because he was afraid to stay any longer.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon earnestly told Vermilion Bird, \u201cRecuperate. The most important thing is your body.\u201d Losing love wasn\u2019t so terrible. If he was alive, he would always meet someone else.</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird told Azure Dragon, \u201cYou too. Keeping a good body is the biggest capital.\u201d Falling out of love was good. He could continue his cultivation path of no desires.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had a toothache!</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Director Jiang\u2019s editing technique was excellent. Both of them felt like they were the final winner and felt respect and compassion for the loser, not adding insult to injury.</p><br/><p>The three people came outside and Azure Dragon and Vermilion Bird spoke at the same time, \u201cI will send you back to Rose Mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon stared at Vermilion Bird and Vermilion Bird stared at Azure Dragon. The two people raised their eyebrows at the same time.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was caught in the middle and felt a bitter chill.</p><br/><p>Director Jiang, I just praised you on your skills. How could it go wrong?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

You don\u2019t want a future!\u201d</p><br/><p>A future\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi paled but his back was straight. He had nothing to fear! Even if he dropped out of school, he would study hard and continue to improve himself. University was important but not graduating from university didn\u2019t mean his life was over.</p><br/><p>In short\u2026 he would never give a person like Sun Muqing a chance!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi walked home and it was only after entering that his straight back collapsed.</p><br/><p>He leaned against the door and missed Jiang Xie. He wanted to see Jiang Xie, listen to him, kiss him and know how he was.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t regret his decision. In fact, he had been prepared to face everything after deciding to stay with Jiang Xie. Dropping out of school was nothing. As long as he had income, he couldn\u2019t be too greedy.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought very clearly but he was still upset. He couldn\u2019t even graduate from university. Was he worthy of Jiang Xie who was a professor?</p><br/><p>They might be fine now but what about later? Would Jiang Xie despise him? If there was such a day\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi became cold and the warmed up room felt unusually freezing.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie really rushed his work and it was one in the morning when he came home.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t sleep and was waiting on the sofa.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was afraid that Xie Xi was already sleeping so he opened the door very lightly and his footsteps were extremely slow.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt all his care and the chill in his heart instantly evaporated and drilled into his nose, bringing a burst of acidity.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was taking off his coat when he saw Xie Xi on the sofa and became startled. \u201cYou aren\u2019t asleep yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi got up and stared without blinking.</p><br/><p>There was only a strip of light in the room and the warm yellow light didn\u2019t allow them to see each other\u2019s faces. Jiang Xie smiled, \u201cWhy? I didn\u2019t come back so you couldn\u2019t sleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he walked over. Once he got near, he saw that the child was crying.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart was distressed as he immediately pulled Xie Xi into a hug. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Where are you uncomfortable?\u201d</p><br/><p>They knew each other for a while and Jiang Xie knew that Xie Xi had a strong heart far beyond his peers. He never showed his fragile side apart from when they first met.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi endured it but he finally couldn\u2019t resist anymore. He smiled a bit and said, \u201cI made a pot of porridge and I\u2019ll go get you a bowl.\u201d Jiang Xie definitely hadn\u2019t eaten properly.</p><br/><p>He was just turning to go when Jiang Xie pulled him back and asked, \u201cWhat happened? Did you encounter something? Tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s expression crumpled. He wanted to lower his head but he was afraid that tears would fall. \u201cTeacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie felt heartache. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke softly, \u201cIf I can\u2019t graduate from university, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished speaking when Jiang Xie frowned and interrupted, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you graduate?\u201d He had seen Xie Xi\u2019s efforts. This child was so persistent that it made people feel distressed but also reluctant to interfere.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi liked this profession so much. How could he not graduate?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t intend to conceal the matter with Sun Muqing. He sighed and repeated the words he exchanged with Sun Muqing today.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has photos in his hands. If it is released, it will be very troublesome for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, Xie Xi wanted to drop out? He would give up his studies to be with Jiang Xie?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned and stared at Xie Xi for a long time.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi barely managed to smile. \u201cIt\u2019s fine if I drop out. After all, this is Teacher and I can continue to learn. Didn\u2019t you always say that you want to teach me alone? Then later on\u2026 please.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s spirit finally returned. His eyes were distressed and full of love that could no longer be concealed. He whispered, \u201cYou little fool.\u201d How could there be so a lovely yet strong little guy?</p><br/><p>Such a good person actually gave his heart to Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was filled with words that he couldn\u2019t express!</p><br/><p>\u201cI was going to tell you on your birthday.\u201d Jiang Xie spoke in an incredibly gentle voice.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know what this had to do with his birthday and looked up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned over and kissed him on his forehead, eyes, nose and lips. \u201cI have resigned.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cI submitted my resignation application at the beginning of the semester but the procedure was a bit cumbersome. I had to continue teaching and it was dragged out until recently.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s face was instantly white and he tightly held onto Jiang Xie. \u201cWhy did you resign? How\u2026 how can you resign?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie touched his nose. \u201cAm I the type of person who will bully his student using his status as a teacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard the words but couldn\u2019t understand what they meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the moment I confessed to you, I made plans to resign. I want to be your lover instead of your teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>A teacher-student relationship was taboo and Jiang Xie wished to be with this child. How could he let Xie Xi bear this pressure?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was a freshman and it was several years before graduation? If Xie Xi hadn\u2019t accepted his confession then he could wait. Now that Xie Xi had given all of his heart to Jiang Xie, how could he let the child down?</p><br/><p>Four years contained too many variables. Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t let anything happen to Xie Xi and decided to resign as soon as school started.</p><br/><p>As long as he didn\u2019t have the identity of a teacher, no one could stop them from falling in love.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke urgently, \u201cYour career is rising and such a young professor is widely acclaimed. How can\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie touched their foreheads together and smiled, \u201cNothing compares to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are only 19 years old and you\u2019re tied to a 30 year old uncle. How can I let you be wronged?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s nose was sour and the tears he always suppressed fell down.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d Jiang Xie was suddenly a mess. \u201cI\u2019m most afraid of your tears.</p><br/><p>His beloved person was crying and he was so pained that he wanted to pick the stars and the moon.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi choked out, \u201cHow can you be so foolish\u2026 how can you resign\u2026 you are really\u2026 really stupid!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wiped his tears and coaxed him, \u201cOkay, scold me with angry words but don\u2019t drop these golden beans.\u201d</p><br/><p>How was Xie Xi willing to scold him? The taste in Xie Xi\u2019s heart was indescribable. It was sweet and sour and bitter.</p><br/><p>Falling in love with Jiang Xie was the happiest thing in his life. This happiness seemed to be a beautiful dream.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t bear to see him uncomfortable and teased, \u201cYou can rest assured that your improper husband will only make more money in the future. If you want the moon on the sky, I will blow it down for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Who wanted to mess with the moon?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw the corners of Xie Xi\u2019s lips curving and persisted, \u201cForget the stars. I will bring down something bigger than Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was dumbfounded. \u201cIf the moon falls, can the Earth survive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I will do whatever my wife wants.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want the moon!\u201d</p><br/><p>No, who was his wife?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked him, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi paused before whispering something. Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes brightened and he almost picked up the person. \u201cSay it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s face reddened. \u201cYou heard it already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jiang Xie protested. \u201cIf you don\u2019t make it clear, I\u2019ll really bring down the moon for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moon: ???</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt funny and soft. He opened his mouth again and clearly stated, \u201cI just want you.\u201d</p><br/><p>If this was an animation, Old Jiang would\u2019ve already lit up fireworks in the sky! He picked up the other person and went straight to the bedroom.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart jumped.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie placed him on the bed and took off the tie he was wearing. \u201cI\u2019m not your teacher anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi lay on the soft bed and stared nervously.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m your husband.\u201d Jiang Xie leaned over and bit Xie Xi\u2019s delicate neck.</p><br/><p>He endured for so long and Comrade Jiang Xie finally couldn\u2019t bear it anymore. He legally studied with Xie Xi all night.</p><br/><p>The next day was Saturday and the couple slept until the afternoon.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi woke up first. HIs eyes opened but he couldn\u2019t even move a finger.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke nonsense on the weekdays and now that this last window had been smashed through, he was even worse\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned red as he thought about it and wanted to die.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was still sleeping. He held Xie Xi tightly in his sleep, as if afraid this person would run away.</p><br/><p>Yesterday morning, he left the house and spent all day outside. He rushed back in the evening and hadn\u2019t even rice before eating his little rose.</p><br/><p>It would\u2019ve been okay of Xie Xi refused him. However, Xie Xi\u2019s heart was warmed by him and catered to him.</p><br/><p>Who could bear this? If it hadn\u2019t been Xie Xi\u2019s first time, Comrade Jiang would\u2019ve gone crazy for one night and one day.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi moved and the two different coloured eyes opened. He used to hate these eyes and now looking at them\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi just wanted to kiss them. The dark red and dark blue were actually close to black from a distance. After looking closely, he found that they had their own shine and were beautiful.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had always been insensitive to people\u2019s facial features but he was sure that Jiang Xie was the best person he had ever seen. Jiang Xie had the best facial features and everything was satisfactory.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d Jiang Xie asked him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t in pain. He just\u2026 felt very tired.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d He was shocked by his voice as soon as he spoke.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s lips curved. \u201cYou called out so loudly that your voice is hoarse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie rubbed his chin. \u201cStill, it\u2019s nice when thinking about it now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>How could the thin-skinned Xiao Xie be this old rascal\u2019s opponent? He would probably be eaten to death in this life.</p><br/><p>Sun Muqing didn\u2019t have an opportunity to send the photos. Jiang Xie directly hacked his phone, computer and other devices and deleted the photos.</p><br/><p>In fact, the photos didn\u2019t show anything. They didn\u2019t capture the faces and only had a vague back.</p><br/><p>The back view was just Jiang Xie holding hands with Xie Xi. So what if this photo was sent out? It would make no impact.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie naturally wouldn\u2019t be soft against such a person. He directly found evidence of Sun Muqing\u2019s guilt and sent him to jail.</p><br/><p>On the day of Jiang Xie\u2019s departure, all the girls were crying.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled at them. \u201cRest assured, I will come back often.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girls thought he was comforting them and didn\u2019t believe it at all.</p><br/><p>Later\u2026 they really did see Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Teacher Jiang drove a stunning vehicle and waited for Xie Xi to finish classes.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

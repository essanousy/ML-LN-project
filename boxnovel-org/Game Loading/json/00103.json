Jiang Xie told him half a month in advance, \u201cWait for your birthday and I\u2019ll give you a surprise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi never celebrated his birthday before. He didn\u2019t like birthdays or this word.</p><br/><p>Birthday, the day of birth. He hoped for a long time that he had never been born. If life was destined to be lonely and boring, what was the meaning of being alive?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t find the value in his birth so his birthday wasn\u2019t a day worth celebrating.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was different now. He had Jiang Xie, a tie to life who gave him warmth and the power of life. He wanted them to live together day after day, year after year.</p><br/><p>Once he heard Jiang Xie\u2019s words, Xie Xi was inwardly very happy but his mouth wondered, \u201cWhat surprise? I don\u2019t want to be surprised.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie changed his words. \u201cThen I\u2019ll give you unexpected joy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought, \u2018You are my unexpected joy.\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare say it, not out of shyness. It was because this person\u2019s nose was already high in the air. If he said this, Jiang Xie\u2019s tail would probably soar into the sky and not fall down!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cThen I\u2019ll be waiting for Teacher\u2019s unexpected joy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie kissed the corner of his mouth. \u201cMake sure you are happy enough to call me Husband.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t kill this person!</p><br/><p>March 17th was a Sunday but on the 15th, Jiang Xie had to go somewhere for a forum.</p><br/><p>In the early morning, Jiang Xie was very heated up. \u201cI want to accompany you on your birthday. No one can make me leave you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was held by him and couldn\u2019t move. \u201cTeacher, you just don\u2019t want to leave the bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>This guy\u2019s problem with leaving his bed was growing every day and he dragged Xie Xi into it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was a self-disciplined person who never slept past 8 o\u2019clock. Unfortunately, once he slept be Jiang Xie\u2019s side, he was forced to go back to sleep whenever he woke up. Once Xie Xi was almost late and didn\u2019t let Jiang Xie kiss him when leaving. He was also silently angry in the car.</p><br/><p>Teacher Jiang had coaxed him, \u201cIt isn\u2019t a big deal. I can give you a leave of absence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the reason?\u201d</p><br/><p>Teacher Jiang declared righteously, \u201cAccompany Professor Jiang, a well-known scholar who will change the world in the future, to go back to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Have some face!</p><br/><p>The meeting on Friday should be very important. Xie Xi was afraid of Jiang Xie skipping it and said, \u201cIf you go quickly, perhaps you will be able to return on Saturday?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sneered, \u201cAre they worthy of wasting my wonderful night? I\u2019ll be back tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pushed him, \u201cHow can you come back tonight? Get out of here!\u201d He thought it needed several days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t let go. \u201cI\u2019ll return late in the middle of the night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought of him running back and forth and felt very distressed. \u201cJust return Saturday morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at him. \u201cWhat are you talking about? I am already desperate at missing the hug and kiss before going to sleep. You still want to deprive me of my morning hug and kiss as well as breakfast filled with love?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He really believed in this evil!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie insisted on sending Xie Xi to school before going to the airport. Xie Xi was disgusted. \u201cGo quickly. How can you send an adult like me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Jiang Xie was really gone, Xie Xi\u2019s heart felt empty. He couldn\u2019t adapt to this silence.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was always active and enthusiastic. Xie Xi had thin skin and couldn\u2019t stand the nonsense, but he still liked to listen. He engraved every word into his heart. If he had to leave Jiang Xie\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shocked to find that he had long lost the courage to face the dark abyss.</p><br/><p>Morning classes ended and there was no one to speak to at noon. Xie Xi wasn\u2019t used to it. At this time, his phone rang and the caller ID was: Darling. Xie Xi\u2019s face was hot. It had randomly changed!</p><br/><p>He answered the phone and Jiang Xie\u2019s voice was particularly clear. \u201cBaby, have you eaten?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He wanted to hang up on the spot!</p><br/><p>\u201cDarling isn\u2019t here to make me tea and a meal. I miss you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi cried out, \u201cDon\u2019t touch my phone!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cMy hands never touched it. I pay great attention to the privacy between lovers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew that this person\u2019s hands hadn\u2019t made direct contact but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hack into my phone either!\u201d</p><br/><p>Teacher Jiang went online. \u201cThis is a test of your lessons. You should be able to set up simple security.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was able to do it but if he did, this person would come up with a new means of hacking. He\u2026 he couldn\u2019t fight this old man!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cIn fact, there is a solution.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish, Xie Xi gave a harsh refusal. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>He had no intention of seeing the name \u2018Husband\u2019 in his phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen there is no other way. We have to continue the class.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why was there such a class? However, Xie Xi\u2019s professional abilities were increasing every day and the ordinary students were inferior to him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie liked teasing the child and said, \u201cIf you want to eat well, don\u2019t think about me or you won\u2019t be able to eat anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s lips shook and his tone was sharp. \u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sounded melancholy. \u201cIt isn\u2019t good. I\u2019m a bit lost that you sound so happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi immediately softened and he whispered three words.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie clearly heard it but he pretended to be deaf. \u201cWhat? You said you didn\u2019t want me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi blushed. \u201cIt\u2026 I miss you.\u201d Then he hung up the phone.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at the phone and his heart was itchy. He couldn\u2019t wait to fly back and hold the child in his arms and kissing him.</p><br/><p>How could there be such a cute and lovely big child in this day and age? It was also his!</p><br/><p>Comrade Jiang thought this and felt that his footsteps were light enough for him to go to Heaven.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was due to this phone call but Xie Xi had a good lunch and was in an excellent mood all day as he listened seriously to classes. He wasn\u2019t too anxious to leave school because Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t home. He packed up his thoughts while thinking about what to cook.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie might come back in the middle of the night and Xie Xi had to prepare something for him. He was just thinking this when his phone rang.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought it was the shameless Darling. He was smiling and was about to pick up when he found the caller was Sun Muqing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stopped smiling as he accepted the call. \u201cBrother?\u201d</p><br/><p>They hadn\u2019t been in contact for a long time and hadn\u2019t seen each other since the supermarket last year.</p><br/><p>Sun Muqing sounded a bit anxious. \u201cDo you have time? Let\u2019s meet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi froze and asked, \u201cDid something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is important. Please meet me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Muqing sounded like it was really urgent and Xie Xi always remembered his care during the enrollment and hurriedly agreed. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>They met outside the school. Sun Muqing saw him and cried out, \u201cXiao Xie, you have to help me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked again, \u201cBrother, what happened to you?\u201d He wouldn\u2019t leave if he didn\u2019t get an explanation.</p><br/><p>Sun Muqing looked ashamed and remorse as he took a long time to explain. In fact, his words were very vague and he probably concealed a lot, but the information he revealed was enough to make Xie Xi pull his hair.</p><br/><p>Sun Muqing unexpectedly partnered up with people to steal the school\u2019s internal information! This included the attendance records, the dormitory records, the scholarship registration and even the final exam questions\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned. \u201cHow can you do these things!\u201d It was too confusing and daring!</p><br/><p>Sun Muqing replied, \u201cI was tricked for a while. A school senior who graduated taught me and told me\u2026 this is very profitable. I\u2026 my family situation is poor. I was bewitched and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked him, \u201cDo the teachers know about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026 they are still looking for accomplices and haven\u2019t released the information. However, once they draw in the net, I will be finished!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a crime and expulsion would be a light consequence! He only said that he stole information. Who knew what else he did?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned. \u201cBrother, telling me this is useless. I can\u2019t help you. You should go to the teachers and confess\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished when Sun Muqing became more anxious. \u201cYou can help me, only you can help me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was surprised. \u201cI\u2019m a student, how can I help you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Muqing didn\u2019t say anything. He just stared at Xie Xi as if forcing him to tell the truth.</p><br/><p>A bad feeling entered Xie Xi\u2019s heart. He really couldn\u2019t help Sun Muqing but Jiang Xie was different. Xie Xi felt sweat rolling down his back.</p><br/><p>Did Sun Muqing\u2026</p><br/><p>Sun Muqing was really desperate and could only think of the man with Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know the identity of the man but he was clearly expensive. People with money in this community always had better means. As long as Xie Xi asked his lover, Sun Muqing might be able to escape!</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Xie, I\u2019m begging you. Please help me! I know you have a way. Don\u2019t let me die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was cold. He never imagined that his trusted senior would do such a thing and use this to coerce him!</p><br/><p>Sun Muqing saw that Xie Xi was silent and spoke harshly, \u201cIf you don\u2019t\u2019 help me, don\u2019t blame me for revealing your dirty things!\u201d Xie Xi\u2019s back was tight and his voice was cold. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Muqing thought it was already a life or death struggle. \u201cOkay, you don\u2019t know. Then wait for me to send the photos to the school network and I\u2019ll see if you still don\u2019t know!\u201d</p><br/><p>He actually had photos!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s brain worked quickly. He was sure that he and Jiang Xie were careful outside and never left any traces, but what if?</p><br/><p>What if Sun Muqing intentionally tracked them and used fake photos to take advantage of Jiang Xie?</p><br/><p>If Xie Xi and Jiang Xie were nothing then Xie Xi was naturally fearless\u2026</p><br/><p>But\u2026 they\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took a deep breath and his voice was very calm. \u201cI can\u2019t help you with this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Muqing was standing on the edge of a cliff. \u201cI don\u2019t care. If you don\u2019t help me, I will drag you down!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s forehead vein bulged. \u201cI never offended me. Why do you want to drag me into the water?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Muqing replied harshly, \u201cWho told you to do such things and seduce\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished his words when Xie Xi punched him.</p><br/><p>Sun Muqing was shocked. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke coldly, \u201cI might be guilty but I\u2019ve never done anything that harmed the world. You committed a crime and should accept the punishment!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Muqing covered the side of his face was that punched. \u201cGood, since you have such hard bones, wait until I send the photos and see if you still have a foothold in the school!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t afraid for himself. He was only afraid that Jiang Xie\u2019s reputation would be damaged. However, it was absolutely impossible for him to help Sun Muqing!</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t leave Jiang Xie so there was only one solution. Xie Xi sneered at Sun Muqing. \u201cGo send it. What\u2019s the big deal? I\u2019ll just drop out of school!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Muqing\u2019s eyes widened and a disbelieving expression filled his face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

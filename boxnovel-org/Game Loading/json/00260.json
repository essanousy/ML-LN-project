Thus, there was nothing wrong with the tigers thinking they were father and son.</p><br/><p>It could be seen that the tigers didn\u2019t know much about Xie Xi. They probably only though he was an invalid who would die in the cave.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t deny this matter.</p><br/><p>The little lion\u2019s appearance was strange and explaining this was very troublesome. In order to prevent the tigers from thinking too much, Xie Xi reluctantly received this \u2018son.\u2019</p><br/><p>The little lion could understand and he bared his teeth, implying, \u2018He isn\u2019t my father!\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hit his head. \u201cI intend to make him transform as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he said this, the mother of Huyi and Huer enthusiastically cried out, \u201cThis matter should be handed to me! Mr Xie is the saviour of my family. I will do my best to make him transform!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was also eager for this. He didn\u2019t know how to make the little lion transform and it was best to have someone help.</p><br/><p>The female who had previously spoken added, \u201cHuer\u2019s mother, you should hurry. The star dyed grass and kuku juice have to be fresh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huer\u2019s mother had raised two children and was very experienced. \u201cThat is for certain. I\u2019ll go to the market tomorrow to buy the star dyed juice and the kuku juice! There is also the vine tree fruit. The one in my backyard ripened. I wanted to keep it for my third child but I\u2019ll use it now!\u201d</p><br/><p>It could be seen that the transformation of a child was done by females. The discussion between the mothers present was very hot.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also generally understood.</p><br/><p>Transforming required many materials and the quality of the materials affected the success rate.</p><br/><p>Huer\u2019s mother pinched the lion\u2019s thick paws. \u201cIt can\u2019t be dragged out for long. If too much time passes, he might be disabled for life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help his heart sinking.</p><br/><p>The family leader, Wang Dahu scolded his wife, \u201cWhat are you talking about? I\u2019m sure it will be a success!\u201d</p><br/><p>Huer\u2019s mother hastily cried out, \u201cYes! This little cub was born well and he will surely be a big and chubby boy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s tense heart slightly relaxed because of this sentence.</p><br/><p>A big and chubby Evil Jiang\u2026</p><br/><p>It was so magical!</p><br/><p>The concern of Huer\u2019s mother wasn\u2019t unreasonable. Tigers and lions were similar and had to transform earlier. IF it was too late then it will be difficult for them to transform into human form.</p><br/><p>In this world, beastmen who couldn\u2019t become human were permanently disabled. The terrible thing was that their minds wouldn\u2019t develop and they would become a beast with only an animal nature.</p><br/><p>Speaking of which, the ambitious Wang Huyi sighed.\u201dI heard that when the beast king was in power, the vine trees were everywhere, there were more star dyed grasses than the stars in the sky and the Kuku juice could pool into rivers\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Dahu had personally witnessed it and he also said, \u201cBeast King Rose was diligent in his work and loved the people. He especially paid attention to the development of the young. Even wanderer children could get the help of good-hearted people and be transformed in time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huer\u2019s mother said, \u201cYes, the materials were everywhere, unlike now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Dahu stared at her and Huer\u2019s mother shut up.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood the meaning of Wang Dahu\u2019s look. He didn\u2019t want Huer\u2019s mother to talk about lacking materials. After all, they were going to prepare for the lion\u2019s transformation soon.</p><br/><p>Wang Huer was full of yearning. \u201cBeast King Rose was really fierce. He was the most powerful white tiger in the world! He once tore the throat of the tyrant of the Bear Country, injuring his vitality so the was willing to bow down!\u201d</p><br/><p>The tiger cubs around him said, \u201cHe was even more awesome in the battle against the Wolf Country. One person fought against 10 wolves and completely won!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Leopard Country as well! I heard that the leopard king wasn\u2019t comparable to his speed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was embarrassed by the cubs\u2019 boasting.</p><br/><p>After all, he was likely to be the domineering Beast King Rose.</p><br/><p>Wang Huyi sighed, \u201cUnfortunately, the beast king\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd sighed and really missed the hero of the tiger tribe.</p><br/><p>The current wars and disputes where the countries didn\u2019t give into each other meant that all types of demons and monsters were running rampant. The ones who suffered the most were ordinary people.</p><br/><p>It could be seen from how the materials that used to be found everywhere were now a hot commodity.</p><br/><p>This was a vicious cycle. The materials were limited and there were bound to be many cubs who couldn\u2019t transform.</p><br/><p>If the cubs couldn\u2019t transform, there was a great probability they would become murderous beasts.</p><br/><p>This was really bitter for the people at the bottom\u2026</p><br/><p>If they didn\u2019t have children, they would lose their labour force and the village would gradually wither away. If they had children and couldn\u2019t buy the materials, they would be burdened by an animal.</p><br/><p>Such a vicious circle meant that society was in disorder.</p><br/><p>The sharp contrast made them miss the beast king.</p><br/><p>They missed the great unified kingdom he was in charge of where the beasts and people lived and worked in peace.</p><br/><p>The more Xie Xi knew about the Rose Dynasty, the more doubts he felt. Was it difficult to reunify the eight countries.</p><br/><p>There was another stinging sensation from his chest\u2026</p><br/><p>He quickly took a painkiller to relieve it.</p><br/><p>Based on their words, half the reason for the unification of the eight countries was the beast king\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>Since the tiger family still wanted to give birth to a third child, Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to occupy all their transformation materials.</p><br/><p>He thought about going to the market to see these types of materials and then draw them. It wasn\u2019t a cure but it was better than nothing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked the little lion, \u201cDo you want to go to the market with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion cried out and took the initiative to carry the basket.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re so powerful. You can carry such a big basket!\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion snorted and raised his head high.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gave himself a bottle of physical medicine and was barely able to reach the market.</p><br/><p>Huer\u2019s mother directly said, \u201cMr Xie, you can rest. I\u2019ll go back and forth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll take Little Xie to see.\u201d\u2019</p><br/><p>He was talking about the Xie in Jiang Xie\u2019s name but everyone thought it was the Xie in Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>This village liked to use the father\u2019s name to name the son. For example, Wang Dahu\u2019s sons were called Wang Huyi and Wang Huer. If Wang Huer hadn\u2019t been born then Wang Huyi was called Wang Xiaohu (Little Tiger).</p><br/><p>Wang Huer\u2019s mother replied. \u201cOkay, the cub likes to go to the market. If he is in a good mood, the chances of the transformation succeeding will be much higher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded.</p><br/><p>In fact, there were no rules behind the success of the transformation. It all relied on luck.</p><br/><p>Success could save a lot of money while failing more than three times was likely to mean never transforming. Thus, the beastmen were willing to sum up a variety of experiences.</p><br/><p>No matter the time and place, people were filled with calculations.</p><br/><p>The market was very lively. Xie Xi looked around and was surprised.</p><br/><p>The background of this world was ancient but it wasn\u2019t pure ancient. There was a certain degree of technological advancement and some mysterious things as well. It was a rather mixed background.</p><br/><p>However, this market was remote and it was likely that the big cities would have different scenes.</p><br/><p>Huer\u2019s mother was familiar with the road and soon bought transformation materials.</p><br/><p>In order to raise his experience, Xie Xi asked many questions about the materials.</p><br/><p>The store employee was very annoyed. \u201cSir, what do you want to buy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t afford anything.</p><br/><p>The store owner wasn\u2019t willing to wait for him. \u201cThen look again and call me.\u201d Then he went to another person.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t do it on his own. The sketch pen was equivalent to his heart and he had to understand the things to draw them well.</p><br/><p>Still, he couldn\u2019t eat and become a fat person in one breath. He would look slowly and remember many things today.</p><br/><p>On the way back, Huer\u2019s mother was embarrassed. \u201cThere is only enough for one attempt\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told her, \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huer\u2019s mother cried out, \u201cIf you pick a good time, Little Xie will definitely succeed at once!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d He touched the little lion\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Taking into account Xie Xi\u2019s body, they went to the tea stall to rest before continuing their journey.</p><br/><p>The weather was hot and quite a few people were resting after visiting the market. Xie Xi sat to one side and heard a lot of gossip.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Beast King Rose will come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe really made too many enemies while carrying out his decrees.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, he did it for the good of our people!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the use? We couldn\u2019t protect him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why the national teacher would betray the beast king\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to stop living?\u201d The man covered the other person\u2019s mouth. \u201cYou will be beheaded if you talk about the national teacher!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man snorted. \u201cWe could say whatever we wanted when the beast king was still here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe beast king is gone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe national teacher was the most trusted person of the king. How\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man didn\u2019t dare to speak anymore. Xie Xi listened to it and was full of thoughts.</p><br/><p>Who was the national teacher? He seemed like an important person.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi inexplicably felt a bit uneasy. Then he glanced at the little lion and his heart was steady again. The identity of the national teacher didn\u2019t matter. In any case, Jiang Xie was by his side.</p><br/><p>It was already night time when they returned to the village.</p><br/><p>Huer\u2019s mother told Xie Xi, \u201cTomorrow at noon is the best time. You must be sure to cheer Little Xie up. If he is a good mood, the success rate of the transformation would be much higher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was familiar with this heart and replied, \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait for your good news.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded.</p><br/><p>Transformation was best in a familiar environment in front of the most reassuring person. If the cub was physically and mentally relaxed after taking the materials then the success rate would be much higher.</p><br/><p>These were the experiences gained over the years and listening to them wouldn\u2019t be wrong.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t sleep well and was very nervous.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie could attempt the transformation at most three times. If he was unsuccessful then it was very dangerous.</p><br/><p>It was reasonable to say that the soul should be able to transform into a human but Xie Xi knew about Jiang Xie\u2019s unlucky physique. It was really terrible.</p><br/><p>Everything was ready. Xie Xi made sure the little lion had enough to eat and drink before asking him, \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion cried out loudly.</p><br/><p>He sounded good. Xie Xi smoothed the fur on his back and said, \u201cCome on, become a human so you can speak.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion was very excited. His golden eyes were round and bright.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gave a sigh of relief and followed the steps to feed him the materials.</p><br/><p>The materials were all handled well and just needed the cub\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi clenched his fists. Did it succeed?</p><br/><p>The fog disappeared. It was a little lion or\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned. The first attempt had failed.</p><br/><p>The little lion squirmed as he looked down at his paws before looking up at Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I have the materials and try again.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion got up and carefully ate the materials.</p><br/><p>There was a bang again and Xie Xi\u2019s heart tensed.</p><br/><p>The fog cleared and it was once again a failure.</p><br/><p>The little lion saw his body and the brightness in his golden eyes faded.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi cried out, \u201cTry it once again!\u201d Fortunately, he had drawn enough materials in advance.</p><br/><p>The little lion wasn\u2019t as enthusiastic as he was last time. He gazed at the materials and hesitated.</p><br/><p>He had heard the words of Huer\u2019s mother.</p><br/><p>His attempt at transformation was too late. There were only three chances or he would later\u2026</p><br/><p>Then a thin hand reached out and touched his face. \u201cAre you afraid?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion gazed into the pale eyes and was stunned.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi reassured him, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. There is nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>An unspeakable heat flowed through his blood and the little lion experienced an unprecedented peace of mind.</p><br/><p>He raised his head and cried out.</p><br/><p>The sound was clear and loud, filled with fearlessness and confidence.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled and gently kissed the lion\u2019s eyebrows. \u201cCome on!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a kiss to the hair but the little lion felt an unspeakable touch.</p><br/><p>It was very soft and there was a good fragrance, making people feel comfortable.</p><br/><p>The little lion completely broke free of the shackles of his heart and ate the materials.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t believe that he couldn\u2019t transform. He didn\u2019t believe he would lose himself even if he lost everything!</p><br/><p>There was another bang.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare blink until the fog dispersed. He saw a small Jiang Xie standing there with beast ears.</p><br/><p>Blonde hair and skin as white as snow.</p><br/><p>The handsome facial features in adulthood were currently so beautiful in childhood.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s more, he still retained the cute beast\u2019s paws and tail.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Leo was still sullen in the village. Why was he so bold when he came to the palace?</p><br/><p>Sure enough, a bit of stimulation was needed?</p><br/><p>This was a frustrating bold, spicy chicken character!</p><br/><p>Leo had to muster up great courage to say this sentence.</p><br/><p>He wanted to hide these words in his heart for a lifetime, he wanted to leave Xie Xi and never disturb this person\u2019s life.</p><br/><p>However, he wavered once he knew that males and males could be together.</p><br/><p>Since Xie Xi could accept it, why not confess?</p><br/><p>Even if he was rejected, at least he wouldn\u2019t be hated!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s brain was thinking about things but his mouth had his own idea. \u201cIs this right? I was good enough to raise you to adulthood. How can you hate me?\u201d There was still plenty of room to talk.</p><br/><p>However, Leo didn\u2019t give him any room. \u201cThe liking I\u2019m talking about isn\u2019t the admiration for a senior.\u201d He didn\u2019t use the word elder because the distance between them was big enough.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had to understand but the national teacher was right beside him. He had to pretend to be stupid. \u201cIs it a friend\u2019s feeling?\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, this wasn\u2019t appropriate but Xie Xi could only try to delay things for a while. He couldn\u2019t open up with Leo in front of the national teacher. It was like with the previous Big, Middle and Little Jiang where Little Jiang\u2019s confession was interrupted.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the national teacher\u2019s mind was very different from Big Jiang. He didn\u2019t say a word and stood there like white smoke that would be blown away at any time. There was no sense of existence.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Leo was about to throw a heavy bomb, Xie Xi glanced at the national teacher. \u2018You should act!\u2019</p><br/><p>The national teacher stared and still didn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>Leo sent a straight ball straight at Xie Xi, \u201cNot as a friend or a relative. It is like getting married.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d This was almost like love.</p><br/><p>Such a straight ball had nowhere else to go. The national teacher didn\u2019t say anything. He just stood respectfully behind Xie Xi, the words that weren\u2019t spoken written on his face.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t have any help and could only go out on his own.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are young\u2026\u201d He could only come up with such an excuse.</p><br/><p>The young person couldn\u2019t hear this sentence and Leo raised his eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019m not young, I have grown up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at the round ears that were upright because of the mood swings.</p><br/><p>Leo was exasperated. \u201cOnce my estrus period passes, I will be completely human!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed. \u201cYou said this but you haven\u2019t reached estrus yet. Thus, you\u2019re not really an adult.\u201d</p><br/><p>If he was really a decent man, he should either rebuff or make a promise to the little lion.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Xie Xi was forced to be a slag male in these worlds with several Jiang Xies.</p><br/><p>Leo was clever and asked with a deep stare, \u201cYou don\u2019t like me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d I like you to death.</p><br/><p>Leo was reluctant to give up. \u201cI am already an adult. The estrus period doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hastily cried out, \u201cDon\u2019t make trouble. This is very important for you. Do you want to destroy yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a clear hook in the words and the little Leo was caught by the hook. \u201cIn any case\u2026 in any case, I don\u2019t want anyone apart from you during my estrus!\u201d</p><br/><p>Having said this, he left angrily.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi certainly wouldn\u2019t chase him. He just sighed like an old father and glanced at the national teacher.</p><br/><p>The national teacher was steady and there were no waves of alarm in his pale grey eyes. It was as if he hadn\u2019t heard the conversation just now.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was beating quickly. He didn\u2019t believe that this person didn\u2019t care.</p><br/><p>This appearance was more dangerous than any anger!</p><br/><p>Either the national teacher had mourned and given up on him completely or he was calculating something in the bottom of his heart.</p><br/><p>Based on Xie Xi\u2019s understanding of Jiang Xie, the former was impossible and the latter was 100%!</p><br/><p>What to do?</p><br/><p>It was easy to dodge a spear in the open but hard to avoid an arrow fired in the dark!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t worried about himself. He was worried about the little lion\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke carefully to appear the national teacher. \u201cThe little lion is too lacking in love and confused family and love.\u201d</p><br/><p>The national teacher lowered his eyelashes slightly as he spoke. \u201cYou have no reservations with your kindness. It is normal for him to misunderstand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew he had stepped on a mine as soon as he heard this.</p><br/><p>Was he too kind to the national teacher previously? Then the national teacher became confused? He raised the courage to confess and scared away the beast king?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had no way of knowing the previous summary and could only guess. Fortunately, there were several benchmark principles to refer to. First, Jiang Xie would always love him. Second, he was always a scum male.</p><br/><p>With these two things as coordinates, how could it not become a dog blood drama? It was basically Designer Jiang\u2019s script.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help sighing. \u2018Professor Jiang, what designer are you? You are clearly a screenwriter!\u2019</p><br/><p>The Central Government might consider creating a special occupation.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suppressed these thoughts and continued, \u201cHow can I have the strength to be good to people. I picked him up accidentally and gave him a meal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou saved his life and gave him a new life. This was the greatest gift.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tried to downplay his relationship with Leo but the national teacher\u2019s words punctured through it. Xie Xi felt his IQ being suppressed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was very clever but this cleverness was rarely used against Xie Xi. Thus, Xie Xi often coaxed him.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what the present national teacher had experienced to be so vigilant.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi racked his brains. \u201cSince I saved him, I can\u2019t let him be in danger. Help me see if there are any lions of the right age and let him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t finish his words when the national teacher interrupted. \u201cHe said he didn\u2019t need anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered why things were going wrong. National teacher, which side were you on?</p><br/><p>A gust of wind blew and caused Xie Xi\u2019s chest to itch. He couldn\u2019t help coughing twice.</p><br/><p>The national teacher\u2019s eyes narrowed and he immediately blocked Xie Xi\u2019s side. \u201cYour Majesty, go back to your room first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had stayed outside for a while and it was time to go back.</p><br/><p>He nodded and walked with sore knees.</p><br/><p>The national teacher immediately held him up. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi simply leaned on him. \u201cI am really becoming increasingly useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>The national teacher raised his eyebrows. \u201cPlease don\u2019t take it to heart. After a few more days of soaking in the medicinal bath, you can recover.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really wanted to ask what the hell was wrong with himself but he could only endure it.</p><br/><p>The two people returned to the palace and the national teacher asked, \u201cThere is still some time until lunch. Your Majesty, do you want to rest?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded.</p><br/><p>The national teacher took him back to his room. Xie Xi took off his cumbersome clothing and changed into comfortable long robes.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t go to bed and just leaned against the soft bed for a moment.</p><br/><p>In light of the national teacher\u2019s self-abused, Xie Xi wanted to seize every opportunity to coax him. \u201cAre you busy right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi casually picked up a book. \u201cThen stay with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The national teacher paused for a moment before saying, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi leaned on the soft couch and listened to the national teacher\u2019s voice reading political papers written by an unknown person.</p><br/><p>It was hypnotic and it wasn\u2019t long before Xie Xi was a bit drowsy.</p><br/><p>The voice of the national teacher was becoming lighter. He saw Xie Xi breathing evenly and put down the book.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought that Jiang Xie would leave. He was still sleepy but still opened his eyes. \u201cYou aren\u2019t reading it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The national teacher\u2019s calm eyes flashed and there was some helplessness in his tone. \u201cYour Majesty, go to sleep peacefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi vaguely felt there was something in this person\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can rest assured that I won\u2019t do any more confused things. If you like the little loin, leave him around. I won\u2019t hurt him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled and was full of question marks and exclamation marks.</p><br/><p>What was this situation?!</p><br/><p>Was this Jiang Xie?</p><br/><p>What was this \u2018master of the palace\u2019 accommodating a new \u2018concubine\u2019 style?</p><br/><p>The national teacher spoke again. \u201cAs this subordinate mentioned, I won\u2019t be arrogant.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was very light but it made people feel endless sorrow, as if forced to the end of the world and having to jump into the abyss.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s senses returned. He could guess some things from these phrases.</p><br/><p>The national teacher\u2019s sense of possession was very strong and he interfered with Beast King Rose\u2019s private affairs. Was the beast king\u2019s leaving related to these aspects?</p><br/><p>Confession was one thing, wanting to monopolize the beast king was anything thing.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why he said he didn\u2019t want anything, kept using \u2018this subordinate\u2019 and kept serving Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>It was to keep Xie Xi here and prevent him from leaving.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had mixed emotions in his heart.</p><br/><p>Poor Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare kill himself by saying that he wasn\u2019t interested in the little lion. What if the national teacher clearly told him?</p><br/><p>What should he do?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could only be vague.</p><br/><p>This type of ambiguity was already acknowledged by the clever and skillful national teacher.</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t many changes in the national teacher. He only spoke in a low voice, \u201cYour Majesty, please rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted the national teacher to stay here in order to become closer to him, letting him relax. Xie Xi tried to be clever only to end up with egg on his face. It only made the national teacher mistakenly think he was an obstacle\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s brain was hurting and he should first sleep to refresh his spirit.</p><br/><p>Once he woke up, he heard the sound of a book being put down and the man\u2019s gentle voice. \u201cYou can keep sleeping.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his eyes and spoke. \u201cNo, I\u2019m a bit hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>The national teacher stated, \u201cThen I\u2019ll arrange lunch now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded.</p><br/><p>Leo was sitting at the dining table. This guy didn\u2019t hide his hostility for the national teacher and set up a flag to declare war!</p><br/><p>The national teacher didn\u2019t look at him and only carefully took care of Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know what to say and could only temporarily drag things out by eating.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the table was big enough and Leo was far away from him. There were many servants and Leo didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>It would be really hard to drag this out for much longer.</p><br/><p>Leo could be described as a newborn calf not afraid of tigers. Once he recognized something, he needed an answer.</p><br/><p>He got up and opened his mouth. \u201cYour Majesty, I have something to say to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s chopsticks weren\u2019t stable.</p><br/><p>The master glanced at Leo. \u201cPlease talk about it after the meal.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Xie Xi keep eating? He ordered, \u201cLet them go out.\u201d He was referring to the servants.</p><br/><p>The national teacher glanced at them and the servants left with a bow and lowered eyes.</p><br/><p>Leo raised his eyebrows and glanced diagonally at the national master.</p><br/><p>The national teacher\u2019s face didn\u2019t change colour. \u201cHis Majesty isn\u2019t well and there must always be someone waiting around.\u201d The implication was that he wouldn\u2019t leave.</p><br/><p>Leo stated, \u201cI\u2019ll take care of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take care of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Leo be satisfied? \u201cI have been around him for six months and I know how to take care of him!\u201d</p><br/><p>This made sense. Xie Xi thought that Leo was doing well.</p><br/><p>The national teacher raised his gaze. \u201cHe feels pain night and day and aches all over his joints. His beast spirit\u2019s breath is blocked. This is your care?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leo was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what illness he was born with and what his body is like?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leo didn\u2019t know and Xie Xi himself didn\u2019t know. He just wanted to know.</p><br/><p>However, the national teacher didn\u2019t seem to want to open Xie Xi\u2019s pain and bowed. \u201cThis subordinate was rude.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was anxious. \u2018No, no, no, you aren\u2019t rude. Continue to talk about my illness!\u2019</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the national teacher\u2019s mood was stabilized and it was impossible for him to talk about it.</p><br/><p>Leo frowned and looked at Xie Xi. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your body? Why can\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>How did the conversation turn around to him?</p><br/><p>The national teacher stood by his side silently with eyes lowered.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to say, \u2018National teacher, you tell him, what disease do I have?\u2019</p><br/><p>It was just that based on the attitude of the national teacher, he wouldn\u2019t open his mouth because he was afraid of Xie Xi\u2026</p><br/><p>Leo watched them and his expression was somewhat strange. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little lion, what do you understand?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t thought of a good response when Leo continued, \u201cYou think I am ridiculous. I dare to say that I like you even though I don\u2019t know anything about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Leo declared. \u201cIf it bothers you, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll leave tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>For those interested, I will have completed released all translated chapters of NOLMBW today.

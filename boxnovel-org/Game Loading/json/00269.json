This might be a strange place but the habit he maintained for so long couldn\u2019t be changed.</p><br/><p>In particular, he had such a dream again and felt a deeper guilt. He couldn\u2019t help wanting to see Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t have imagined that he would see such a sight when the door opened.</p><br/><p>The national teacher, who was usually covered up with a cloak, had a slightly open collar and he was holding Xie Xi who had messy clothes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s cheeks were red and there were pale pink marks on his neck. His clothes were messy and most of his shoulders and chest were exposed, while his long legs were covered. The rounded toes exposed to the outside were like dew covered flower bags. They were cute and sexy.</p><br/><p>Early in the morning, two people in the same bedroom\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s head buzzed and his fingers pierced his palm so strongly that he seemed to break his fingers.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xie Xi couldn\u2019t wash himself even if he jumped into the Yellow River.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t promised anything to Leo but they were certain to have a love affair in the future. The current opening method was like having an affair and parting ways!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was panicked even though the national master didn\u2019t let him go.</p><br/><p>The national teacher felt the tightness of his body and his eyes sank. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d He was asking Leo.</p><br/><p>The lion shifted his gaze away. \u201cNothing.\u201d It was spoken through gritted teeth.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi awkwardly spoke. \u201cYou go to the dining room first. I have to go to the medicinal bath.</p><br/><p>The lion was silent.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also told the national teacher. \u201cPut me down, I can walk by myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>The national teacher leaned down and whispered, \u201cYour clothes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d There were still the aftereffects of the dream!</p><br/><p>This dialogue had another meaning in Leo\u2019s ears. He felt sour and that it was stupid to stay here. He couldn\u2019t maintain the etiquette as he turned and strode away.</p><br/><p>The national teacher stared thoughtfully at his back.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t have time to guess what this person was thinking.</p><br/><p>The effect of the medicinal bath was very good. The taste was unpleasant and the skin felt a bit itchy when soaking in it but Xie Xi felt unprecedentedly light after coming out of it.</p><br/><p>He was like a plant full of water. His body was full of vitality.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mood was much better. \u201cThe medicinal bath is really comfortable.\u201d Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t know the herbs and couldn\u2019t draw them himself.</p><br/><p>The national teacher stared at Xie Xi\u2019s chest with sad eyes and whispered with lowered eyelashes, \u201cIt is this subordinate\u2019s privilege to worry after Your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, this national teacher was quite strange. He had a high position and could claim to be the minister. Yet he used \u2018this subordinate\u2019 and his identity was almost like a personal attendant.</p><br/><p>However, it was true that he was personally taking care of Xie Xi one-sidedly.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to ask a lot and could only temporarily speculate on their previous business. Did the national teacher start as the beast king\u2019s servant?</p><br/><p>The daytime clothes were grander than last night. They were black and Xie Xi\u2019s skin was white, making the black royal clothes especially stand out.</p><br/><p>This outfit had a waist section. Once the maid tied it well for Xie Xi, the eyes of the national teacher kept drifting to his waist.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gazed at him through the mirror. \u201cI don\u2019t look good, right?\u201d He was too thin and his waist was too weak.</p><br/><p>The national teacher retracted his gaze. \u201c\u2026It looks good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t care. \u201cOnce my body is better, I have to eat more food.\u201d Then he would match the clothing.</p><br/><p>The national teacher stared at him. \u201cYour Majesty\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cHrmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want you to be healthy and prosperous.\u201d</p><br/><p>This seemed a bit sudden? However, Xie Xi\u2019s body meant he really needed lucky blessings and he replied, \u201cI\u2019ll borrow your words.\u201d</p><br/><p>At breakfast, they saw Leo.</p><br/><p>The little lion was sitting at the end of a long table. Half the meat hadn\u2019t been eaten and he stared at the plate like the meat was a heinous sinner.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi inwardly sighed but it wasn\u2019t good to say anything in front of the national teacher.</p><br/><p>He ate breakfast but Leo didn\u2019t eat anything.</p><br/><p>The national teacher leaned closer to Xie Xi, almost attached to his ears. \u201cI have a meeting. Your Majesty, would you like to go and see it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leo\u2019s gaze shifted over but he took only one glance before retracting it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw the look but what could he do?</p><br/><p>He was such a slag\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t go.\u201d Xie Xi told the national teacher. \u201cYou can decide on your own.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want them to come to the small hall to see you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The meeting was in the main hall while the small hall was equivalent to the royal study room and was the king\u2019s own study.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was afraid that seeing more people would reveal something and he said, \u201cNo, you have been doing very well. I\u2019m relieved.\u201d</p><br/><p>The national teacher didn\u2019t insist and he glanced over at Leo.</p><br/><p>Leo\u2019s brain was on their intimate words and Xie Xi\u2019s trust in the national teacher.</p><br/><p>He clenched his fists again, as if it was the only way to stop the stinging of his heart.</p><br/><p>Of course, Xie Xi trusted this person. Two people who shared the same bed, what couldn\u2019t be trusted?</p><br/><p>Leo got up and made a polite bow. \u201cYour Majesty, I have finished. I will go back first.\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone was cold and hard, containing a fiery temper that a young person couldn\u2019t hold back.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cWait.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, Leo didn\u2019t leave. It wasn\u2019t because he was afraid of disobeying the king but because he didn\u2019t want to defy Xie Xi who raised him to adulthood.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke to the national teacher. \u201cYou are busy so go. I will take a walk with Little Xie to the back garden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d the national teacher replied. He glanced over to a maid and the maid brought a black cloak over.</p><br/><p>He accepted the cloak and gave it to Xie Xi. \u201cThe wind is big today. Be careful of the cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>The national teacher carefully tied it and arranged the neckline.</p><br/><p>The little lion watched from a distance and found it dazzling.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s cloak was different from the national teacher. One white and one black, one plain and one flashy, they stood next to each other and inexplicably matched. It was a beautiful picture that could accommodate no one else.</p><br/><p>The little lion gritted his teeth, a stone in his throat.</p><br/><p>Once the national teacher was sent away, Xie Xi went to Leo. \u201cWalk with me to the garden?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leo\u2019s beast ears were pulled and his thin lips tightened.</p><br/><p>If this time wasn\u2019t inappropriate, Xie Xi really wanted to rub the round ears!</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on, it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d Xie Xi steadied his restless hand and invited Leo.</p><br/><p>How could the lion not go? He asked, \u201cI heard the garden is full of roses?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t seen it but he had a guess. After all, he was Beast King Rose. Xie Xi deliberately told him, \u201cYou will know when you go and see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leo saw the smile on this person\u2019s face and his heart was full of bitterness. He was always regarded as a child and never as an equal adult! Actually\u2026 he really was far from Xie Xi. The little lion became even more bitter.</p><br/><p>The two of them went to the back garden together and were stunned by the sight.</p><br/><p>Leo\u2019s heart jumped violently. For a time, he was unclear if this was reality or a dream.</p><br/><p>In front of them was a very beautiful rose garden. It was filled with pure white rose bushes and grew vigorously, beautifully and persistently in the direction of the sun.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned because it was a bit like Central\u2019s garden.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was impossible for it to be exactly like Jiang Xie\u2019s garden. This place was more realistic and the pavilion couldn\u2019t change its size at will.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked Leo, \u201cIs it beautiful?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie turned to look at the other person and only felt guilty. He wanted to kiss Xie Xi like he did in the dream. He wanted to lay this person among the beautiful flowers and kiss every inch of skin, giving the same joy as if in the dream.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>Leo\u2019s eyes lowered as he whispered, \u201cYou and the national teacher\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help it. He wanted to know the answer. Even if it was a disaster, he would stare straight into the abyss!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t expect him to ask so straightforwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis morning\u2026\u201d Xie Xi paused. \u201cIt isn\u2019t what you think.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leo glanced at his neck where the black cloak didn\u2019t cover the hickeys on the white skin.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d There was evidence and it was really indisputable!</p><br/><p>Still, Xie Xi remained steady. \u201cDon\u2019t think about it. I can\u2019t do anything with this body.\u201d</p><br/><p>This remark shocked Leo.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi deliberately coughed and spoke ambiguously, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe after taking two steps. How can I have the strength to make love to people?\u201d</p><br/><p>Once upon a time, his face would be like a red rose when he heard these words. Now he could say it without changing colour!</p><br/><p>The person who was most shameless had red ears, \u201cBut\u2026 you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This person stuttered and didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare to say too much. What if he was caught by the national teacher?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi posed as an adult scum male. \u201cOnce you grow up, you will understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just\u2026\u201d Leo was guided to the right place and he blinked. \u201cYou are both males!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xie Xi inwardly thought, \u2018You were struggling with this?\u2019</p><br/><p>Well, this world\u2019s background was really different. After all, they had to serious breed in order to create future generations. If all male tigers and lions engaged in sex, they would probably be wiped out.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had to open this person\u2019s brain. \u201cSo what if we are males?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi explained, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to restrain yourself. If you want to find a male partner then it is also possible.\u201d Like me.</p><br/><p>Leo was silent as his three views were reshaped.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw this and his heart was full of amusement. The little lion thought that males couldn\u2019t be together? No wonder he had been arguing and refusing to get married.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought he had been euphemistic enough but he hadn\u2019t expected Leo to have such a straight character.</p><br/><p>They walked around the back garden and ate the refreshments prepared by the servants. Once they were ready to leave, they ran into the national teacher.</p><br/><p>The national teacher was followed by several ministers who all bowed when they saw Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi raised his hand and they all got up, but their heads were still lowered.</p><br/><p>The national teacher told them, \u201cGo back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The ministers respectfully replied, \u201cYes.\u201d They took three steps back before turning away.</p><br/><p>The national teacher asked Xie Xi, \u201cYour Majesty, how do you feel? Are you cold?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to reply when the silent Leo looked up.</p><br/><p>The national teacher noticed Leo\u2019s gaze and raised an eyebrow.</p><br/><p>Leo opened his mouth. \u201cSir, I don\u2019t want to marry anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a bad feeling in his heart. Sure enough, Jiang Xie always made people worried.</p><br/><p>Leo declared, \u201cI like you.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

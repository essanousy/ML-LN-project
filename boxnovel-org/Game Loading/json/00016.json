You designed that fucking world. Who wouldn\u2019t want to kill you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie paused before firmly saying, \u201cNo, it is just a game.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe\u2019s face was full of gloating. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that your little rose is just an ordinary person. He had to accept the baptism of your old rogue soul at the age of 19. He must be doubting life!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie refuted, \u201cHe isn\u2019t so fragile.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe dealt a blow to his heart. \u201cHe isn\u2019t fragile. He just holds a grudge!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe saw the rare scene of Old Jiang being stunned and his mood was very good. His footsteps were almost floating as he left. If his fans and sisters saw this, they would doubt themselves. Wasn\u2019t this their untouchable and high flower? Who was this stupid ass?</p><br/><p>Once Yan Zhe left, Jiang Xie stroked the air and the water curtain appeared. He opened the communication section and sent a message to Xie Xi: [Hello.]</p><br/><p>The word sank like a stone. There wasn\u2019t even a sound, let alone a reply.</p><br/><p>\u2026Was he really angry?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie thought this and the corners of his mouth rose upwards.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin had been talking for a long time. After his mouth became dry, he summed it up. \u201cWell, they are all characters in the sky. We can\u2019t see them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. It was best not to see them.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin saw that his little friend didn\u2019t speak much but didn\u2019t mind. He was still enthusiastic. \u201cLet\u2019s go, I will take you to change professions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi emerged from his thoughts and asked, \u201cDo I have to change it now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Zhong Jin replied. \u201cIt is a waste not to change professions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin patiently explained to him the rules of the Central World and Xie Xi developed a general understanding of his environment.</p><br/><p>The place they were currently in was called \u2018Central\u2019. Of course, everyone was used to calling it the Central World. Everyone who came here were \u2018players\u2019 selected by the central government. Their mission was obvious: achieve a certain goal in different quasi-worlds.</p><br/><p>Players also had a rating from beginner, intermediate, advanced and finally god. By continuously completing tasks, they would accumulate experience and improve their level.</p><br/><p>The difference between beginner and god level was huge. Thus, the time spent in the Central World was different.</p><br/><p>Beginner players could only stay for one or two days, intermediate players were one to two weeks, advanced players were one or two months and god players had no restrictions.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin explained, \u201cThat\u2019s why I suggest you don\u2019t touch the entertainment items. Many new players who come to the Central World eat, drink and have fun. They forget the time and after two days, they directly turn to ash.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned. \u201cTurned to ash?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, our physique isn\u2019t good and we can\u2019t bear too much of the force of the central government.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe force?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin knew he misunderstood and clarified, \u201cIt is their will. I don\u2019t really understand it. Just know that the central government is full of power and beginner players can\u2019t bear too much. If they stay too long, they will be swallowed up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cThen in two days, I have to start a new\u2026\u201d He wanted to say game but changed it into, \u201cTask?\u201d He noticed that although Zhong Jin mentioned players, he described the game as quasi-world.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin agreed loudly. \u201cYes! That\u2019s why we must hurry to change professions. It is only after changing professions that we can accumulate professional experience.\u201d If they wanted to move from beginning to intermediate, they must first have a job.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin asked him again, \u201cDo you have a profession you want to choose?\u201d</p><br/><p>He could only choose between explorer, collector and recorder.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was still thinking about it when Zhong Jin suggested. \u201cIn fact, you don\u2019t need to worry too much. As long as you have enough silver coins, you can change professions at will. The loss is just a bit of experience and our time is based on when we passed the Central World. Thus, don\u2019t be afraid. If you choose a profession you don\u2019t like, you can change it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just losing a little bit of experience? Xie Xi stared at Zhong Jin and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin continued, \u201cThink about it first. By the way, search for your next task as well. You can choose a profession based on the next task.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin\u2019s advice was good and Xie Xi told him, \u201cThank you, I will take a look first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t mention it. I\u2019m just learning how to show off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled back at him. Then he placed a hand in the water curtain and carefully took a look at his situation.</p><br/><p>He could only stay in Central for two days. This meant he had to familiarize himself with the situation as much as possible before proceeding to the next game.</p><br/><p>What about after finishing the next game? Would he be able to go back to his original world in the future?</p><br/><p>Xie Su flashed through Xie Xi\u2019s mind. She was pregnant and would have a new child. She didn\u2019t need him at all.</p><br/><p>In fact, she always regarded him as cumbersome.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed, controlled his thoughts and looked at the water curtain. The most urgent thing was to survive. This unknown place was far from the calm and stable appearance it showed on the surface.</p><br/><p>He observed all the buttons on the interface.</p><br/><p>He clicked on Quasi-World and the first line was in grey: [Love to the Left or Right, novice S-grade trial, designer X, has been cleared.]</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at the designer\u2019s name before feeling itchy. It was just that the level between them was too big. This matter wasn\u2019t urgent right now.</p><br/><p>The second line was in blue: [Search for a new task.]</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had already heard it from Zhong Jin. Every player could search for a new task every two days. Intermediate and advanced players could sty in Central World for a long time and could casually clear the tasks. The beginners could only search for one.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi touched it and the \u2018search task\u2019 interface turned into the row of small funnels. Then a sub-message popped up.</p><br/><p>[Quasi-world: Lost Atlantis, the difficulty is unknown, designer X, not challenged.]</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was lucky this water curtain didn\u2019t have a physical body. If it was a mobile phone or computer then Xie Xi would\u2019ve smashed it!</p><br/><p>He could only search for a task every two days and he couldn\u2019t stay in Central World longer than two days. Was it necessary to play this designer\u2019s perverted game?</p><br/><p>Lost Atlantis sounded more normal than Love to the Left or Right but the designer was X\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi rejected everything about X!</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, there\u2019s an assembly task!\u201d Zhong Jin\u2019s voice was heard beside him and Xie Xi pulled his hand out of the water curtain.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin quickly told him, \u201cMy luck is too good. I unexpectedly ran into an assembly task!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked puzzled and Zhong Jin explained, \u201cThe assembly task is randomly opened. The general difficulty is very low and we can team up for it. Let\u2019s go together!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cIf I go in and come out again, will the task be refreshed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Zhong Jin exclaimed. \u201cYou just searched for a task, right? Don\u2019t be discouraged. Us beginner players can choose too few tasks. They are generally E-grade tasks that are garbage. This assembly task is D-grade and the difficulty is just right. You can use this to get rid of the garbage task. It is really lucky!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Xie Xi nodded. It would be great to get rid of X\u2019s garbage task.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin didn\u2019t know what task Xie Xi had searched. If he did, his eyes would be green with envy right now.</p><br/><p>The designer was God X! Lost Atlantis It was the famous blue quasi-world. The difficulty was unknown but anyone with eyes knew it absolutely wouldn\u2019t be lower than B-grade. Perhaps it was S-grade!</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin excitedly said, \u201cGo and prepare. It will open in one hour and I will send you a message.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cA message?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin exclaimed, \u201cCome on, add me as a friend!\u201d</p><br/><p>It turns out that they could add friends\u2026 Xie Xi wasn\u2019t worried about his name. In any case, it was anonymous and no one knew that he had cleared Love to the Left or Right.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin added him as a friend and said, \u201cI wonder if the S-grade newcomer joined Yunge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t joined. He might be agitated but he wasn\u2019t going to bind himself because of a neuropath.</p><br/><p>It was true that there were many advantages to joining Yunge but XIe Xi wasn\u2019t good at dealing with people and didn\u2019t like to be controlled. He preferred a free and unfettered life.</p><br/><p>If it hadn\u2019t been for X\u2019s game popping up, Xie Xi would hesitate to do this assembly mission.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin was very warm and took good care of him but Xie Xi didn\u2019t like to act together with others. Of course, participating in the assembly task wasn\u2019t just to get rid of X. He needed to understand the difficulty of an ordinary player\u2019s game as well as the use of various props available in the mall.</p><br/><p>He had a lot of money to spend and bought one of all items in the mall.</p><br/><p>It was after he added Zhong Jin as a friend that Xie Xi saw a message.</p><br/><p>[X: Hello.]</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d When was this person added as a friend? Was it the designer\u2019s privilege?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi raised an eyebrow and replied: [Great God, hello.] It was followed with a ^_^ expression.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie thought this was cute. His lips curved and he felt that Yan Zhe was thinking too much. Xie Xi wasn\u2019t angry at all\u2026 the next moment, he saw his goodwill plummet to the negatives.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s goodwill towards you: -99.</p><br/><p>This was Jiang Xie\u2019s skill that had little value. He could see the goodwill of players below the intermediate level.</p><br/><p>This was the first time he had seen such a low score since gaining the ability.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie let out a laugh. \u201cVengeful little fellow.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

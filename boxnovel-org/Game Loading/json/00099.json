Forget, sweeping, if Xie Xi wanted to clean the whole Earth then Jiang Xie would accompany him!</p><br/><p>\u201cCough\u2026\u201d It was dangerous but Jiang Xie hadn\u2019t lost his head yet. \u201cI should also clean up our house.\u201d He couldn\u2019t help saying \u2018our house\u2019 with a beautiful heart.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also heard it. In fact, he had been slightly embarrassed when he said it and was afraid he was being too much.</p><br/><p>However, Jiang Xie replied to him using the same words. The warmth in Xie Xi\u2019s heart was something that even he couldn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>What was a family like? His mother Xie Su wasn\u2019t family. Jiang Xie must be.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi no longer insisted and cleaned up with Jiang Xie. Old Jiang was proficient in all types of things and started making a disturbance.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi picked up the vacuum cleaning and Jiang Xie took it. Apart from spending a while in his room, he spent a maximum of three minutes on the other rooms. Xie Xi picked up a mop and he grabbed it, going directly to Xie Xi\u2019s room, cleaning even the bottom of the bed. Xie Xi picked up a rag and Jiang Xie took the basin and directed, \u201cThere are a few books from your last place. Go find a place to put them.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Xie Xi returned to his room, he was almost blinded by the shiny floor! Amazing, this floor\u2026 he was reluctant to step on it!</p><br/><p>However, only his room was so bright. Compared to the outside, the floors of the other rooms in the house would probably cry out, \u2018It is the same floor. Why are you so good?!\u2019</p><br/><p>On the 26th of the 12 lunar month, Jiang Xie told him, \u201cLet\u2019s write the blessings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi blinked. \u201cShouldn\u2019t it be written on the 30th?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie hadn\u2019t spent the new year seriously but he knew this very well. \u201cAfter a small year, we need to do auspicious things on even days.\u201d This would definitely herald that they would be paired in the coming year!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi laughed. \u201cThe 30th is also an even day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie arranged a clear picture. \u201cWe will write blessings today, buy new year\u2019s goods on the 28th and not go anywhere on the 30th as we enjoy a New Year\u2019s dinner!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi particularly liked the feeling of a ritual and solemnly nodded. \u201cI will listen to Teacher!\u201d</p><br/><p>Very good. Jiang Xie didn\u2019t dare say it but love was overflowing from his eyes. The red paper was bought a long time ago. Jiang Xie brought them to his study and rolled up his sleeves to grind the ink.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hurriedly said, \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cI\u2019ll prepare the ink and you write it first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt ashamed. \u201cI haven\u2019t done this before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Write a blessing and then put up the blessing. Next year, the blessing will be fulfilled.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t used a calligraphy brush before but he liked Jiang Xie\u2019s words. He picked up the brush and wrote the blessing like he was using a pen.</p><br/><p>He smiled. \u201cSo ugly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie praised, \u201cIt\u2019s very cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s childish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was serious. \u201cIt\u2019s really very cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was warm. He picked up the brush and wrote carefully before\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really hard,\u201d Xie Xi opened his mouth. \u201cTeacher, you do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie picked up the brush and casually moved it. A big character that was a dragon flying and a phoenix dancing appeared on the red paper. Xie Xi\u2019s eyes lit up and he praised, \u201cGood-looking!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s mood was good and he changed the font. Xie Xi was gobsmacked. \u201cIs this a thin gold body? So beautiful.\u201d He knew the font since it was recognizable.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wondered, \u201cDo you like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cI like it. It seems simpler.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie handed the brush to him. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you how to write it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t think too much as he said, \u201cIt will take time. Don\u2019t teach\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He paused halfway through his words because Jiang Xie stood behind him and held his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelax your wrist and feel the gesture.\u201d Jiang Xie\u2019s voice entered his ears like a hot breeze and Xie Xi\u2019s red ears trembled.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi held his breath. He tried to look at the red paper but he simply couldn\u2019t concentrate.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is like this.\u201d Jiang Xie\u2019s arms move and Xie Xi moved along with him over the red paper. A beautiful thin gold character appeared on the paper.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was in a daze and could only feel that his back, ears, arms and harms that were being held was hot. Jiang Xie asked him, \u201cHow about it? Do you have the feeling?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s face reddened and his voice shook. \u201cT-Teacher!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHrmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi bit his lower lip to calm himself down and stated, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ll try it myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s lips curved. \u201cOkay, try writing it yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi kept his head down and lacked strength in the hand holding the brush. Jiang Xie said again, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. If you like it, I\u2019ll find time to teach you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need!\u201d Xie Xi put down the brush. \u201cThis is still too difficult. I won\u2019t waste red paper!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw the child\u2019s red ears and his heart itched, but he resisted. Take it easy\u2026 everything would come slowly\u2026 He was seeking eternity, not a momentary joy.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi needed to calm down. He moved away from the desk and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to the bathroom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you come back, please get me a glass of water.\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, Xie Xi wanted to make an excuse to not return to the study. Not that Jiang Xie said this, he had to go back.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi went to the bathroom and washed his face. He stared at himself in the mirror for a long time before finally giving his brain a slap.</p><br/><p>\u2018What are you thinking? This is a teacher! He\u2019s still a man!</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t be confused about your emotions just because someone is good to you!\u2019</p><br/><p>He gave himself a fierce scolding before finally calming down. Xie Xi sighed, dried his face and went to pour a glass of water.</p><br/><p>There were two cups on the table. They were identical porcelain cups with a half rose on them.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had long known that Jiang Xie especially liked roses. When he first brought the cup, Xie Xi had frozen. \u201cA couples cup?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cIf they are really couple cups, the flowers on these cups should be able to be joined together.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi worked hard for a long time before saying, \u201cNo, it is smooth\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two cups weren\u2019t a pair, they were just identical. Jiang Xie explained, \u201cI think they look good so I brought two back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi raised an eyebrow. \u201cHow will we be able to tell which is our cup when drinking water?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie \u2018suddenly realized. \u201cOh, I hadn\u2019t paid attention.\u201d</p><br/><p>As if he didn\u2019t pay attention! He held back from buying a couples cup because of this!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suggested, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019ll put a label on my cup.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s such a nice cup to place such an ugly thing on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hesitated. \u201cThat\u2026 Teacher can leave one at home and bring one to school.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie answered, \u201cThe school has a whole set that is cheaper. This is quite expensive and I\u2019m reluctant to take it there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard it was expensive and also felt reluctant.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie suggested, \u201cLet\u2019s use it like this. I\u2019ll place it on the left and you place it on the right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also liked this cup and nodded. \u201cYes! I\u2019ll try not to put it in the wrong spot.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was attentive and didn\u2019t make any mistakes, but Jiang Xie was sloppy and always misplaced it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi corrected him, \u201cTeacher, my cup is on the right and you have to put it on the left.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie blinked. \u201cI have to put it on the left? How do I remember it as you putting it on the left?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was originally a minor matter and Xie Xi didn\u2019t remember clearly.</p><br/><p>He wondered suspiciously, \u201cDid I remember it wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cYou remembered wrong. I always put it on the right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s like this\u2026\u201d It turned out that he was mistaken.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. From today, you put it on the right and I\u2019ll put it on the left.\u201d Xie Xi doubled checked. \u201cI am the right and you are the left?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day, Jiang Xie picked up the right cup to drink water. Xie Xi cried out, \u201cTeacher, you got it wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie hit his forehead. \u201cLook at my brain. How could I forget?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Today, Xie Xi went to pour water for Jiang Xie only to find that he couldn\u2019t tell who the cups belonged to.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He ignored Scorpio first and asked Aquarius, \u201cDoes it still hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s fingers drew in the air and a dark portal appeared out of thin air. He glanced at Gong Rui and the sharp Gong Rui followed while typing in the area channel.</p><br/><p>The words he typed were: Wait for me to live broadcast.</p><br/><p>The others also served a certain Jiang Xie according to the arrangement.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi came to Aquarius\u2019 room and found that the style of the world was completely different from Libra\u2019s world.</p><br/><p>Aquarius was an elf. He might be a dark elf that symbolized darkness but he was still very close to nature.</p><br/><p>As he approached the room, there was the feeling of coming to a night forest surrounded by fireflies.</p><br/><p>The tables and chairs were all wound and even the bed was a hole dug in a giant tree.</p><br/><p>The inside was filled with dark green clouds and looked quite comfortable.</p><br/><p>Gong Rui was self-sufficient and Aquarius only looked at Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t reject Gong Rui\u2019s presence because this was a mission arranged for them by Xie Xi and was an order.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was still very worried about Aquarius since the injury was painful. His medicine couldn\u2019t compare to God Yan\u2019s healing technique and couldn\u2019t restore the person immediately.</p><br/><p>Once the analgesic effect dissipated, it was very painful.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t care but it was impossible for Xie Xi to not care.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that God Yan\u2019s ability wasn\u2019t suitable for exposure or he could directly treat Aquarius.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought for a moment before saying, \u201cTake off your clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Rui\u2019s live broadcast: Was Xie Xi such an A?</p><br/><p>Nan Yi was curious: What\u2019s wrong? Little Rose couldn\u2019t stand Old Jiang and went to the training field?</p><br/><p>Gong Rui: No, the evil god ordered his servant to take off his clothes.</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This live broadcast that raised people\u2019s appetite wasn\u2019t as good as video broadcasting!</p><br/><p>There were many delusions in the words but the reality was quite serious.</p><br/><p>After all, there were outsiders so Aquarius wasn\u2019t inclined to \u2018seduce\u2019 the evil god. He had to pay attention to his face.</p><br/><p>However, the dark elf\u2019s body was beautiful, well-proportioned and smooth, with a wheat colour that longed for the sun.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie always had a good figure. After taking off his shirt, the strong back was enough to make all men envious.</p><br/><p>The only thing that Xie Xi saw was the huge wound that stretched from shoulder to waist.</p><br/><p>General Qin used heavy weapons so he could split people apart. An ordinary person would\u2019ve probably died long ago.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cDon\u2019t touch and I\u2019ll give you medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aquarius whispered, \u201cIn fact, you don\u2019t have to go to so much trouble. It will be fine if I sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could you sleep with such a wound?\u201d</p><br/><p>Aquarius\u2019 voice was light. \u201cI am used to it and can sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>The experience with Libra allowed Xie Xi to understand that the original days of these star signs were very bitter.</p><br/><p>Just as the dragons rejected the black dragons, the elves regarded dark elves as the devil. Aquarius had this wheat-coloured skin and was probably bullied and abused.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cThen you have to change your habits.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aquarius stared at him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cYou have to get used to your body being without injuries. You have to look after your health and well-being. Understood?\u201d</p><br/><p>Aquarius stared blankly before a handsome smile appeared on his face. He asked Xie Xi, \u201cThis is your command?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it is a command. It is what I expect of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aquarius made to bow but Xie Xi held him down. \u201cI told you not to move.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have given me such grace. How can I not thank you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cThanks have no meaning. Don\u2019t let down my expectations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aquarius\u2019 answer was immediate. \u201cAbsolutely not. I will engrave every word you say onto my soul and protect it with my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s lips curved as he carefully gave this person medicine.</p><br/><p>In the area channel, Nan Yi asked: What is happening?</p><br/><p>Gong Rui: Milk Yan, I\u2019m not very well.</p><br/><p>God Yan: \u2026</p><br/><p>He heard this title and knew the words weren\u2019t serious.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Gong Rui added: I am dying of dog food.</p><br/><p>After the medicine, Aquarius didn\u2019t want Xie Xi to go and deliberately delayed the time. \u201cIt isn\u2019t early, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw this person\u2019s mind instantly. \u201cI have something to ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>He glanced at Gong Rui\u2019s position, suggesting to Aquarius that he was going to Pisces to use the illusion to understand the situation of the foreign aid.</p><br/><p>Aquarius knew this but wasn\u2019t willing to let him go. \u201cLet Pisces rest for a night. Tomorrow is better.\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke vaguely because of Gong Rui but Xie Xi understood.</p><br/><p>Pisces used a lot of illusions and he was exhausted. It was really better to let him rest after a night but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThings should be done early, not late, so that he can have a long dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aquarius was stunned and could only watch Xie Xi leave.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him before leaving, \u201cHave a good rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDark elves don\u2019t need to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone needs rest. Don\u2019t use the previous rules to bind yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi declared, \u201cYou\u2019re not among the elves right now. You are here with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aquarius\u2019 long hair was loosened and flowed along his back, adding gentleness to his cold facial features. He bowed his head, \u201cThank you, my god.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi whispered, \u201cGo to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>The onlooker Gong Rui sent a \u2018war report\u2019 to the rear: I remember that Xie Xi was only 19 years old when he entered Central?</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe: Jiang Xie is his first love.</p><br/><p>Gong Rui: The facts tell us that the first love is the right person. He has become an old hand at this.</p><br/><p>Nan Yi wasn\u2019t as lucky as Pisces. He \u2018served\u2019 Pisces but was left outside the door because Pisces wanted to discuss the intruders with Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Nan Yi: Nothing can be seen, nothing can be heard!</p><br/><p>The lazy Gong Rui: You don\u2019t want to look at them alone. They are very unfriendly to single dogs. Wait for the group\u2026</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t finish his words but everyone understood.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had some selfish calculations for finding Pisces.</p><br/><p>He wanted to look at Pisces\u2019 illusions and see if he could use a higher level of magic.</p><br/><p>He had the god\u2019s wisdom and his status was now high. It would make things much easier if he could use the illusions.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked Pisces, \u201cHow do you feel mentally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cif you can, let me see the illusion when you capture the intruders.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pisces should come down. Once he got up, his long hair swayed like waves. Small stars spread from his body and it was soon like standing in a sea of stars. Below his feet was empty and above him was also empty. In the big, dark space, the sea demon closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew this was an illusion.</p><br/><p>He watched carefully but he wasn\u2019t watching how Pisces caught Zong Xia. Instead, he was watching how Pisces used the illusion.</p><br/><p>It should be possible\u2026</p><br/><p>The sketch pen could draw everything he saw. Even if Xie Xi didn\u2019t understand the principles, the sketch pen could draw it.</p><br/><p>In addition, the god\u2019s wisdom could create anything\u2026</p><br/><p>The illusion ended and Pisces opened his eyes. They were a bit dark and his mental state was poor.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pisces stood very steadily. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI basically understand everything. You can rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have a captain outside. We\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll come again. We just have to wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pisces should sleep.</p><br/><p>After using so many illusions one after another, Pisces was really tired. He wanted to talk to Xie Xi but his eyelids were constantly fighting.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t go but sat on the bed and looked at this person.</p><br/><p>Pisces leaned against the bed and tried to open his eyes to look at Xie Xi. \u201cMaster\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cHrmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are my only tribe.\u201d</p><br/><p>The stunned Xie Xi\u2026 tribe? He was a sea demon as well?</p><br/><p>Pisces paused before stating, \u201cMy only wish now is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was too light for Xie Xi to hear clearly.</p><br/><p>Pisces didn\u2019t say anything more. He bowed his head and kissed the black rose on his wrist before asking, \u201cCan you wait for me to fall asleep before going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pisces lay on the snow-coloured bed, his long hair spread out. His appearance was younger than the other star signs and after falling asleep, there was a hint of boyishness.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared, words hovering in his heart.</p><br/><p>You are my only tribe.</p><br/><p>My only wish now is\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s brain moved.</p><br/><p>This world\u2026.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the same as the previous worlds he had experienced.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi left Pisces room and was planning to go to Scorpio.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t forget the hint he previously gave. He didn\u2019t plan to do anything but he had to make a trip to coax Scorpio and save him from \u2018taking drastic measures.\u2019</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, he just came out of the room when he came face to face with Sagittarius and was hugged.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zong Xia, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe who was with Scorpio, \u201c!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sagittarius didn\u2019t see anyone else. He held Xie Xi and kissed the long and narrow neck, eyebrows raised provocatively as he watched Scorpio.</p><br/><p>He said to Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026You promised me, let me eat tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>When did Xie Xi promise him?</p><br/><p>He had his back to Scorpio and could feel this guy\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>It either poked a hole in him, poked a hole in Sagittarius or poked a hole in them both!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

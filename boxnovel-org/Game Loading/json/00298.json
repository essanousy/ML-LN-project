Isn\u2019t this inviting me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Previously in Libra\u2019s room, Sagittarius drank his blood. Xie Xi had angrily scolded him and he disappeared without a trace.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi still felt regret and was afraid he was really angry\u2026</p><br/><p>Then many things happened. Xie Xi had no experience with his blood being sucked. How did he know that he had to erase the tooth marks?</p><br/><p>Although this evil god body did have the ability.</p><br/><p>Sagittarius deliberately pulled down Xie Xi\u2019s collar, the tip of his tongue touching the two red dots.</p><br/><p>This was definitely for Scorpio to see but there were others at the scene.</p><br/><p>Zong Xia was following Sagittarius while Yan Zhe was following Scorpio. They both quietly bowed their heads.</p><br/><p>But their shoulders were shaking violently!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was mad and yelled at Sagittarius. \u201cI said, release me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sagittarius was even happier. \u201cIf you really want me to leave, why not use your pressure?\u201d</p><br/><p>What pressure?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was just dabbling as a god, how could he know so much?</p><br/><p>Sagittarius glanced at Scorpio. \u201cAre you worried about other people? It\u2019s nothing. You are our master and anything you want is fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was clearly implying that Xie Xi wanted to go with Sagittarius but he had to push Sagittarius away because he promised Scorpio. He was actually reluctant and hoped that Scorpio would take the initiative to leave.</p><br/><p>After all, Xie Xi just needed to release his pressure that Sagittarius couldn\u2019t approach him at all.</p><br/><p>In the area channel, Gong Rui asked: What is your situation?</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe: \u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Zong Xia: \u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Based on the ellipsis, Nan Yi and Gong Rui knew there was a good play: What are you doing? Live broadcast it!</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe scolded: Fuck, Old Jiang used a lifetime of good luck to meet Little Rose!</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Nan Yi became more excited!</p><br/><p>It was reasonable to be so excited. He was just afraid that he had to eat quick-acting heart-saving pills afterwards.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was worried about how to stabilize Sagittarius and Scorpio.</p><br/><p>Sagittarius was worthy of being an archer. His archery skill was really good and the arrow didn\u2019t miss. The heart was red.</p><br/><p>Scorpio stood silently but unfortunately, his heart was poked into a honeycomb.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was really innocent. How could he know that there were traces on his neck? How could he know that he could use pressure to break away from Sagittarius\u2019 arms?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know but who could believe this?</p><br/><p>Oh, Zong Xia and Yan Zhe would believe it but what was the use of that?</p><br/><p>At the critical point when Yan Zhe was worried for Xie Xi, Scorpio leaned over in a bow. \u201cSince Master has other arrangements, I will go first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone present was stunned, including Sagittarius.</p><br/><p>The cold face of the undead looked calm and his deep purple hair slid down his cheeks to outline his perfect side profile.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart thumped.</p><br/><p>Scorpio turned to leave without hesitation, heading straight to his room. The surprised Yan Zhe followed.</p><br/><p>Zong Xia also stared blankly and asked in the area channel: Scorpio just left?</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe felt doubts: His temper is so good? Is this really Old Jiang?</p><br/><p>This showed how inexperienced they were.</p><br/><p>Seeing this scene, Xie Xi didn\u2019t feel any relief. He only felt that his back was cold and he could faintly see a trick brewing!</p><br/><p>So many quasi-worlds and so many souls, not one of them had given up.</p><br/><p>Some just gave up on the surface while doing big things in the back!</p><br/><p>Poor Xie Xi was tangled up on Sagittarius and he couldn\u2019t use the communicator to contact Yan Zhe to tell him not to take things lightly!</p><br/><p>Sagittarius was in a good mood after getting rid of Scorpio. He leaned towards Xie Xi, deep voice ambiguous. \u201cThey all ate at dinner, only I have been waiting. Won\u2019t you please satisfy me? I will also satisfy you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zong Xia stared at his toes without blinking, as if he was superfluous. Oh, he was already superfluous\u2026</p><br/><p>Scorpio had already gone and if Xie Xi caught up know, it was estimated that Sagittarius would explode on the spot.</p><br/><p>There were no tricks yet. He might feel uneasy but he could only beware of Scorpio while seizing the time to stabilize this person.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told Sagittarius, \u201cOnly blood is allowed.\u201d There were people present and Xie Xi was really embarrassed to say the other thing.</p><br/><p>Sagittarius didn\u2019t care about these things and opened the door. \u201cIn the bloodkin family, it is very rude to suck blood without sex!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zong Xia, \u201c\u2026\u201d His knowledge increased.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s cheeks were hot but he didn\u2019t dare send Zong Xia away. Having one person here was better than having no one.</p><br/><p>If Sagittarius really messed with him, he was afraid he wouldn\u2019t be able to control himself.</p><br/><p>In any case, Xie Xi believed that Jiang Xie wouldn\u2019t let anyone see him\u2026 like that.</p><br/><p>Sagittarius leaned back and said, \u201cDuring the day, I was already very nervous. You are my most respected person. How could I do that to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had long been used to this person\u2019s nonsense but it was clearly the first time for the others.</p><br/><p>Zong Xia spoke in the area channel: Is there a question?</p><br/><p>Everyone pricked their ears.</p><br/><p>Nan Yi: Quickly say it!</p><br/><p>Gong Rui: Please enjoy it alone if it is dog food.</p><br/><p>Zong Xia explained the etiquette of the bloodkin species.</p><br/><p>This made Nan Yi very happy: Seconds!</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe: Really shameless.</p><br/><p>Gong Rui spoke lazily: I refuse to accept dog food.</p><br/><p>The serious Qin Ge was worried about something: In this case, Sagittarius did it with many people before\u2026</p><br/><p>Zong Xia also wondered this and at this time\u2026</p><br/><p>He directly copied Sagittarius\u2019 exact words.</p><br/><p>Sagittarius told Xie Xi, \u201cI didn\u2019t drink any blood before I met you. At that time, you promised me that you would never let me go hungry afterwards.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Qin was silent. It could still be like this?</p><br/><p>Sagittarius\u2019 eyes flashed. \u201cPlease meet me? My master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Rui: It seems that Little Rose will be with the lucky Sagittarius tonight?</p><br/><p>Zong Xia: Should I withdraw?</p><br/><p>Nan Yi: Hurry away! You shouldn\u2019t see what you shouldn\u2019t see or something big will happen when we return to Central!</p><br/><p>Then Yan Zhe suddenly said: Scorpio is gone!</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t say it on the area channel but through the communicator Xie Xi had arranged for them.</p><br/><p>Gong Rui and the others hadn\u2019t responded yet but Xie Xi thought in his heart, \u2018Sure enough, something happened!\u2019</p><br/><p>Sagittarius blocked Xie Xi\u2019s retreat.</p><br/><p>He said that he wouldn\u2019t let Xie Xi go tonight.</p><br/><p>Sagittarius brought Xie Xi towards his room while kissing Xie Xi on the neck. He whispered, \u201cPlease, I\u2019ve never really eaten enough. Can you bear to see your most loyal follower hungry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy god\u2026\u201d Sagittarius dragged Xie Xi to his room. \u201cPlease have mercy on your shoulder.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words had just ended when an ancient voice was heard. \u201cMaster trusts you so much. Is this how you pay him back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sagittarius saw Capricorn standing coldly at the door.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi still remembered Scorpio\u2019s sudden disappearance.</p><br/><p>Behind Capricorn, scattered black feathers floated. Xie Xi could see clearly that these feathers formed a transparent barrier, blocking the sound.</p><br/><p>It was in order to not let Qin Ge hear them.</p><br/><p>He told Sagittarius, \u201cPisces is sleeping and his servant is under my supervision. Aquarius is injured and his servant will be handed over to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sagittarius\u2019 eyes squinted. \u201cWhere is Scorpio?\u201d</p><br/><p>Capricorn replied, \u201cHe went to catch the escaped intruders.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

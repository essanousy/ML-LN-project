He tried to calm down. \u201cI\u2019m not joking.\u201d</p><br/><p>The smile on Jiang Xie\u2019s face froze.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi never made a joke. During the months where the two people met each other, Jiang Xie often teased that Xie Xi didn\u2019t tell jokes and that he was sometimes too serious.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie liked Xie Xi, thought he was good and found this rational behavior cute.</p><br/><p>Now\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi showed his earring, the calm and rational dark blue stinging Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Every person had an instrument that represented their identity and it could be loaded with various functions.</p><br/><p>Rational was dark blue and emotional was an orange yellow. Calm and passionate, two very different types of existences. Xie Xi was a rational person, a rational person who didn\u2019t understand love.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s body swayed. It felt like a meat grinder had been stuffed into his chest, the dark blue blade spinning wildly and stirring up his internal organs.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t concentrate and didn\u2019t hear the sadness in his tone. Jiang Xie walked away in a daze like an army deserter. If it was just like this then Jiang Xie wouldn\u2019t remember Xie Xi for nine rounds.</p><br/><p>Painful feelings were actually very good to forget. The truly unforgettable thing was the sweetness that went deep into the bones. It was like a gourmet eating inferior food after tasting the best food in the world.</p><br/><p>The reason why Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t forget was that he had an incredibly sweet reincarnation.</p><br/><p>The two people separated and Xie Xi sat at the table, staring at the empty cup for an afternoon.</p><br/><p>During this period, he didn\u2019t move and seemed to be thinking a lot. By the time he finally stood up, his hands and feet were numb and sharp sting like needles spread over his arms and legs.</p><br/><p>This type of paralysis couldn\u2019t be compared to the helplessness of his heart.</p><br/><p>Rational and emotional. Why did he want to hide his gender? He hurt Jiang Xie and lost such a good friend forever. Xie Xi, who had always been isolated, had no idea if he would encounter such a person later on in his life.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t go far. He sat on a bench 300 metres away for an afternoon.</p><br/><p>Compared to Xie Xi\u2019s ignorant pain, Jiang Xie felt a clear, straightforward and sharp sting.</p><br/><p>If he had been rejected then he wouldn\u2019t have felt as desperate as he did now. A rational who didn\u2019t understand love was similar to an indestructible stone for an emotional. Falling in love with one was like hitting a stone with an egg for the rest of his life.</p><br/><p>He shook as he couldn\u2019t withstand the torn body and crushed bones. Jiang Xie clearly knew that he had been played and tricked by a rational. The funny thing was that he couldn\u2019t hate Xie Xi. He couldn\u2019t forget this person.</p><br/><p>The sun set and as Xie Xi was about to leave, Jiang Xie suddenly stood up. There was only one sentence in his confused mind. Why did this person pretend to be emotional?</p><br/><p>Why did a rational pretend to be an emotional person? This was incredible Looking at the history that spanned thousands of years, he had never heard of such a thing.</p><br/><p>An emotional person was likely to pretend to be rational but rational people found it impossible to disguise as emotional and wouldn\u2019t have such an idea.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart thumped and he went back to the restaurant. He sat the wilted Xie Xi still sitting in place.</p><br/><p>Four hours, why hadn\u2019t he left yet? Jiang Xie came over and placed a hand on the table. His posture was condescending but the bulging veins on the back of his hand revealed his tension.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy like to me?\u201d He asked Xie Xi. Xie Xi looked up in a daze, seemingly not expecting this person to come back.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned forward and stared into his eyes. \u201cWhy hide your gender? Why tell me you are emotional?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked down and whispered words he thought he would never say.</p><br/><p>He hated rational people, he was isolated by rational people and he couldn\u2019t get along with them\u2026</p><br/><p>However, he was rational and couldn\u2019t get close to any emotional person because they disliked him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had been living with such a gap since he was a child. Rational people were hostile to him and emotional people were full of vigilance towards him.</p><br/><p>He walked on a wooden bridge while the people on the left and right didn\u2019t accept him. Thus, he could only be alone and keep moving forward as he risked falling.</p><br/><p>At this time, Jiang Xie appeared. Xie Xi longed for someone to reach out to him, hoping for breathing space or even a guardrail on the wooden bridge.</p><br/><p>Thus, he chose to lie when Jiang Xie took the initiative to approach him.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m an emotional.\u2019 He deceived Jiang Xie and got a moment of stability.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie heard this and was stunned. Xie Xi was even more lost after laying out his secrets. What qualifications did such a despicable villain like he have?</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you hate me?\u201d Jiang Xie asked him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up at him and replied almost without hesitation. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t ask anything else. He just showed the same gentle smile as before. \u201cLet\u2019s be together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie held his hand. \u201cI like you and you don\u2019t hate me. Let\u2019s be together, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tried to withdraw his hand. \u201cBut I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t let go, \u201cI love you no matter your gender.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>It was because Jiang Xie kissed the back of his hand and said something Xie Xi would never forget. \u201c\u2026Even if you don\u2019t love me.\u201d</p><br/><p>-I love you, even if you don\u2019t love me.</p><br/><p>This humble but unusually hot love seemed to be able to burn up both people.</p><br/><p>After the confession, the two people were together. It was strange yet not strange. At first, Xie Xi was cautious. He was always afraid of doing something wrong and that he wasn\u2019t a qualified lover.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie found out and poked the tip of his nose. \u201cDon\u2019t disguise yourself or cooperate with me. Just be yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gazed at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAsk your heart,\u201d Jiang Xie\u2019s voice was very gentle. \u201cIt can do whatever it wants.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up at him before glancing away, ears red. Jiang Xie\u2019s heart jumped.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi whispered, \u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d</p><br/><p>At these words, the \u2018bystander\u2019 Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help his mouth thinning. In fact, Xie Xi felt a lot when he saw the pre-existing background of the soul.</p><br/><p>The main Jiang Xie\u2019s entry had affected the souls.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t people were schizophrenia but their souls were shared the moment contact was made. Some things were restricted because of the world but the fundamentals were the same.</p><br/><p>In Dream Come True, Jiang Xie discovered Xie Xi\u2019s past and knew that he grew up alone and isolated by society.</p><br/><p>It was like this less rational and less emotional Xie Xi. Professor Jiang was Xie Xi\u2019s saviour and J was the saviour of the rational Xie Xi. Jiang Xie\u2019s hot and unreserved love warmed Xie Xi, whether it was the soul or the master.</p><br/><p>Even if Xie Xi didn\u2019t love him\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. How could he not feel love? He was really a stone that had been baked by Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help fast forwarding through the next few memories. It was tiring. Even if he had been with someone for more than 60 years, he couldn\u2019t help feeling tired.</p><br/><p>The rational setting was too bad. Xie Xi was indulged by Jiang Xie and the two people weren\u2019t ashamed or impatient.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until Jiang Xie was 35 years old and Xie Xi was 30 that there was a small twist in their lives.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was dismissed from his job. He didn\u2019t say anything at first but Jiang Xie spent his time at home due to his painter occupation and soon discovered something was wrong. He asked Xie Xi about it.</p><br/><p>A rational person rarely lied and Xie Xi revealed the truth.</p><br/><p>It turned out to be because of their relationship. Jiang Xie was becoming famous and more people discovered he was an emotional person. He occasionally went to pick up Xie Xi from work and the people over there knew their relationship.</p><br/><p>No one blamed the emotional Jiang Xie. They just considered it Xie Xi\u2019s misconduct and thought he was playing with Jiang Xie\u2019s feelings.</p><br/><p>Rational could find reasons and could do anything with reason, but they shouldn\u2019t provoke emotional people. Once discovered, they would be severely criticized by moral opinion.</p><br/><p>This was probably like Xie Xi\u2019s Earth age where men and men and women and women received disapproval.</p><br/><p>Whether it was a heterosexual society or gay society, anything that broke the routine would be rejected. This chain of contempt always existed in social society.</p><br/><p>How could Jiang Xie let Xie Xi experience such things? He suggested, \u201cWe should get married.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t an exciting, beautiful or heartfelt proposal that made people blush but it did make them excited.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was surprised. \u201cI\u2019m a rational. You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked him, \u201cWill you betray me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cThen that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>The wedding was finalized and they walked into the church where everyone wasn\u2019t optimistic.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t mention anyone else, even the priest couldn\u2019t help asking three times,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you willing to be a companion to him in this round, to love him and be loyal to him. whether he is poor, sick or disabled until he walks into reincarnation. Are you willing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled and said \u2018I do\u2019 three times.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi vowed, \u201cI will be loyal to him and he will be my only companion.\u201d</p><br/><p>The oath of a rational and emotional was different. Emotional people required love and loyalty while rational people only required loyalty.</p><br/><p>The priest had presided over countless emotional and emotional or rational and rational weddings. This was the first time experiencing an emotional and rational getting married. He took into account the characteristics of a rational, chose the rational vow and concealed the word \u2018love.\u2019</p><br/><p>This didn\u2019t prevent Jiang Xie from confessing. \u201cI love you.\u201d No matter how many cycles, I will fall in love with you as long as I meet you.</p><br/><p>The two people with an SSS-grade physique lived a long life, living for almost 230 years. They made countless contributions to the United States and fulfilled the vows of marriage.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi became the Chief Justice while Jiang Xie was the most passionate, creative and influential painter of the era.</p><br/><p>Their combination became a curious thing that sparked many emotional tinkers to explore the emotional issues of rational and emotional.</p><br/><p>Of course, there was no result in the end. They always believed that Xie Xi was loyal. It was loyalty to his partner, not love.</p><br/><p>Even Jiang Xie thought this but his life was very sweet, just like living a beautiful dream.</p><br/><p>This lasted until his deathbed. Jiang Xie was older than Xie Xi and entered reincarnation first. As they were separating, Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi held his hand and didn\u2019t say a word for a long time.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie kissed the back of his hand and repeated the vow he made over 200 years ago. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finally spoke in a hoarse voice, \u201cI\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie watched him gently. Xie Xi\u2019s lips trembled like he was suffering tremendous pain. His face was pale and his eyes cloudy. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be separated from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart jerked.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, who never shed a tear, was now crying as he choked out, \u201cDon\u2019t leave me, don\u2019t leave me, don\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t forget me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie used the last of his strength to hold the other person\u2019s hand. \u201cXie Xi, do you love me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026.\u201d Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what love is but I want to be with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to be like this for a lifetime, forever together in eternal life. Jiang Xie\u2019s lips curved and he spoke his last words to Xie Xi. \u201cThis is love.\u201d</p><br/><p>His Xie Xi, the rational Xie Xi who didn\u2019t understand love, was in love with him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

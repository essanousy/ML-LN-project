You are a grey wolf!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had thick skin. \u201cI am your grey wolf and only eat this kitten.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had thin skin and how could he compare with this old hooligan. He became angry. \u201cStop talking nonsense! I am furious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s mouth was like a train but he had a sense of proportion. \u201cOkay, I was just making a joke. You look good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He really missed the honest souls!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie still had a countdown above his head so Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare speak nonsense. He quickly asked about business. \u201cYou woke up because you have recovered six souls?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cIt should be that after the recovery of most of my souls, I have enough mental strength to break through the prohibition set by the Central Government.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was nervous when he heard the word \u2018prohibition\u2019 and asked, \u201cShould you wake up like this?\u201d He was afraid of a backlash.</p><br/><p>Looking at Xie Xi this way, Jiang Xie\u2019s heart became as sweet as honey. \u201cRest assured, this is within the rules. As long as you are strong enough\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He paused and stopped.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi waited for the follow up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie acted cheap. \u201cAs long as you are strong enough, you can marry such a beautiful and charming baby\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was expressionless. \u201cGet lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it correct? I am a living example?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew Jiang Xie too well. This man could talk nonsense day and night without being tired but once it came to something dangerous, his mouth was as tight as a river and couldn\u2019t be pried open!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sneered. \u201cIf you don\u2019t say it then rest. I am going to the next world.\u201d</p><br/><p>After packing up so many souls, Xie Xi already moved from being bronze to a king. How could he not handle this bad thing?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke quickly. \u201cI\u2019ll say it, I\u2019ll say it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s thin lips were slightly raised and the rogue smile on Aries\u2019 clean face made a sharp contrast, causing a person\u2019s heart to miss a beat.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to see him!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cI was afraid that you would dislike me for talking too big.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi unceremoniously poked up. \u201cWhen do you never speak big?\u201d</p><br/><p>His credibility was low and Jiang Xie didn\u2019t care. After so many worlds, Xie Xi even knew his underwear. What was so awkward?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cMaybe we are strong enough to surpass even the Central Government.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie shook his index finger in front of the beautiful eyes. \u201cChild, please return.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned and asked, \u201cHow can we go beyond Central?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? That\u2019s why I set a small goal for myself before meeting you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him blankly.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s ability to talk about love was excellent. \u201cNow that I found you, my only purpose is to be with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It sounded false but it was actually full of sincerity.</p><br/><p>The more contact Xie Xi had with the souls, the more he understood Jiang Xie and the more he knew the sad heart his person had hidden.</p><br/><p>People always needed a goal to love.</p><br/><p>Before Xie Xi came to Central, Jiang Xie found many goals for himself. For example, he didn\u2019t hesitate to cute himself to pieces to design quasi-worlds and maintain the balance of the Central Government. He also guarded his friends living in Central while exploring the secrets of the Central Government. Perhaps by surpassing Central, he would find the value of his existence.</p><br/><p>Life was loss. In particular, if the heart was empty then it was most at a loss.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was lucky enough to encounter Jiang Xie early but Jiang Xie had been lonely for many years.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart softened when he thought of this and he snuggled into the other person\u2019s arms. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay with a man who is lacking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie laughed. \u201cLacking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at the six light groups. \u201cLacking a lot!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was dissatisfied and moved Xie Xi\u2019s hand. How can I be lacking? You try it. It is so big\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d This guy\u2019s brain was full of trash!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t help pressing the hand to his body. \u201cCome, feel it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mess around. There is only an hour and a half.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie pointed above his head. \u201cDo you see it moving?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up and found\u2026 the countdown was still!</p><br/><p>They had been talking for five or six minutes. How could it stay on the same time?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cRest assured, while I am awake, the countdown won\u2019t change.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cWhat does this countdown really mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will know once you bring the souls back.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were too few clues. Blindly guessing would only mislead themselves.</p><br/><p>Since the countdown didn\u2019t change\u2026 Xie Xi couldn\u2019t push this guy away.</p><br/><p>The two people were intimate and Xie Xi was so tired he couldn\u2019t raise his arms. He had to draw a bath using the god\u2019s wisdom.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie opened his mouth. \u201cThis is the bath of the Lion Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shi glanced at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, you deceived me so badly.\u201d He spoke using Leo\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still have the face to say this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie also pretended to be Houqing. \u201cYour Majesty, do you truly love me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glared at him. \u201cShall I take out my heart and show you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie hugged him tightly. \u201cBaby, I was wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>These previous emotional summaries\u2026 looking back, they were as thick as a wall and a bit unbearable.</p><br/><p>Too broken, what were these messy things!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was angry but was afraid Jiang Xie was really bothered. He quickly said, \u201cThese things are all because of you.\u201d\u2019</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s response was immediate. \u201cYes, they are the fault of the brain-dead souls!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mouth twitched. He was scolding himself? Oh, this was a guy who could kill himself.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cIt has nothing to do with the souls. If my world was collapsing, I would also think more pessimistically.\u201d</p><br/><p>On Earth, Xie Xi lived alone in a dilapidated building for months without going outside. If his emotions could affect the world, it would probably be darker and more pessimistic.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart was sweet but his hands weren\u2019t obedient.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was angry again. \u201cYou are finished!\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking of which, he thought many times in the small worlds that he should make this guy suffer abstinence!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie said, \u201cI won\u2019t do anything. I just want to hold you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hugging wasn\u2019t enough. He had to hold Xie Xi close to feel the heart.</p><br/><p>This was Jiang Xie\u2019s rich vocabulary.</p><br/><p>It was probably only by hugging the person you love that you could realize it.</p><br/><p>The two men were tired for a while and also exchanged information about these worlds.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI was too careless and met two souls at once.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two together was really terrible. It gave the souls fertile soul to abuse themselves and they swallowed a knife.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cMaybe it wasn\u2019t that you were careless\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie indicated to the light groups. \u201cThere is a certain connection between the quasi-worlds and this place. Perhaps Virgo couldn\u2019t wait and deliberately made you fall to meet him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThis is possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not? Houqing\u2019s state\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He paused and didn\u2019t say anything else.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood. Houqing\u2019s state was too serious and the quasi-world was collapsing too much, so he hoped that Xie Xi would bring him out first?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help his heart tensing. \u201cThere are still six light groups. Will there be another quasi-world in a serious state?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes flashed.</p><br/><p>Previously, Xie Xi might\u2019ve ignored it but he had experienced too much. The character of this person when his life was threatened was clear.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cWhat you said before\u2026 that the Central Government won\u2019t release the tasks of erasing your collapsed worlds. That is false!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie noticeably stopped.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was anxious. \u201cWill it be released?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sighed. \u201cThe Central Government probably won\u2019t take care of me because I am your husband\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He was still shameless!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his mouth. \u201cIf any collapsed worlds have an erasure task released then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Erasing meant completely obliterating the quasi-world. If the souls didn\u2019t survive then\u2026 what would Jiang Xie do?</p><br/><p>A chill went down his neck and Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help shivering.</p><br/><p>If Jiang Xie died then he didn\u2019t have the courage to live alone.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie felt heartache and hugged Xie Xi. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, even if someone receives the erasure task, they won\u2019t be able to complete it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe lowest level of the quasi-world I designed is S grade. The level of the quasi-world grows with the erasure tasks and it might grow to super god level. There are few people in Central capable of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t believe it. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need many people. One person is enough!\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew the N of Yunge was a god level player like X!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie cleared his throat. \u201cThat old N, he rarely courts disaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t fooled by him. \u201cEven if it is the only super god mission in Central, a mission that even X hasn\u2019t cleared?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d The child was really becoming more difficult to fool.</p><br/><p>There was nothing wrong with Xie Xi\u2019s thoughts.</p><br/><p>The higher the task level, the higher the rewards.</p><br/><p>The master of Yunge didn\u2019t lack anything but X was always standing in front of him.</p><br/><p>Whoever won the position was good? Who was willing to be crushed?</p><br/><p>No to mention that Jiang Xie was arrogant. The master of Yunge would want to win against him once.</p><br/><p>If the Central Government released the erasure task, the master of Yunge wouldn\u2019t know that this was the quasi-world designed by Jiang Xie but he would be certain that Jiang Xie hadn\u2019t completed such a high level task\u2026</p><br/><p>He would see it was worth a try!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought of this and Jiang Xie naturally already knew it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie comforted him. \u201cEven if Old N really went, it is impossible to kill the souls. Don\u2019t forget, the souls are me. If the quasi-world is upgraded to a super difficult level, the souls will break free of their restrictions and this is equivalent to the peak me.\u201d Jiang Xie blinked. \u201cIn a fight, N has never once won against me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sneered. \u201cDo the souls have skills and items equivalent to several lives?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In Central, Jiang Xie and N fought one on one but there was no fairness in a collapsed world.</p><br/><p>It was like a full level player fighting the highest level boss. Even if the player was much weaker than the boss, the final winner was the player!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was panicked. He wanted to hurry into the quasi-world and bring the souls out!</p><br/><p>The so-called fear of what was coming\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was feeling uneasy when the remaining six light groups suddenly changed colours.</p><br/><p>The light groups that originally represented the colour of their respective constellations became black.</p><br/><p>The mirror-like light groups became spiral shaped and the deepening darkness gave an unknown feeling.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi grabbed Jiang Xie\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie held him and his voice was still calm. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s voice trembled. \u201cHas the erasure mission been released for them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>In such a dangerous moment, Jiang Xie\u2019s psychological quality was fully revealed. He had experienced too many life and death situations and wandered on the edge of a cliff countless times. The more violent the situation and the more danger he was in, the calmer his mind became.</p><br/><p>This infected Xie Xi. His panicked heart calmed down and he gently breathed out. \u201cWe still have the repair task. We must take the souls ahead of them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>As if listening to Xie Xi\u2019s voice, the six black light groups fused into a single huge vortex.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

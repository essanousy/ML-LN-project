Why dream of this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was something the little lion also wanted to understand. The first time he came to the palace and saw the garden, he couldn\u2019t figure out why he dreamt of it when he had never seen this place before.</p><br/><p>Now he had an answer.</p><br/><p>Houqing watched the garden and sighed. \u201cHe likes this place the most. He entered my dreams a long time ago and showed me this garden.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leo\u2019s head was buzzing. \u201cHe entered your dreams?\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing directly asked him, \u201cI met him when I was as old as you. How did you think we spent our estrus?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no doubt that Leo thought about this issue. He even vaguely knew that Xie Xi and Houqing\u2026</p><br/><p>Still, it was difficult to accept when he actually heard it.</p><br/><p>Houqing knew the art of attacking the heart. His experience meant it was easy to clean up the little lion. \u201cThis garden was what I recreated from the dream. I don\u2019t know what type of dreams he gave you but presumably with his love for the garden\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Leo couldn\u2019t listen anymore. \u201cEnough!\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing saw the fire was almost stoked and intended to end it. \u201cI told you these things to wake you up. Xie Xi doesn\u2019t love you and is just using you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>His anger wasn\u2019t able to calm Houqing, who was still calm and slow. \u201cI\u2019m said all this but you are still obsessed\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Leo didn\u2019t believe it. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. I\u2019m going to ask him!\u201d</p><br/><p>REPORT THIS AD</p><br/><p>On the way, Xie Xi thought, \u2018Little lion, you are good. Listening to others isn\u2019t as good as listening to me!\u2019</p><br/><p>Houqing had expected this and sneered. \u201cDo you want him to coax you to be his puppet for all your life?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leo was stunned.</p><br/><p>Houqing told you, \u201cYou can ask him and continue to be blind and deaf. In any case, you have nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words struck the heart, suggesting that his home was broken. The little lion\u2019s eyes widened.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi rushed over and once he saw the garden in the distance, he saw the two Jiang Xies standing among the flowers.</p><br/><p>The two men didn\u2019t look similar but their figures were equally slender.</p><br/><p>The little lion\u2019s ears and tail had completely faded and he didn\u2019t have a juvenile appearance. The blond hair and golden eyes shone in the midday sun, making it impossible for people to look straight.</p><br/><p>The national teacher wore a white cloak. His temperament was cool but not weak. He stood in front of the little lion, who was shining like the sun, and still had an outstanding air.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned for a moment. It wasn\u2019t because of praise for his lover but because he suddenly thought of something.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t the same as the collapsed god\u2026</p><br/><p>If the national teacher and Leo weren\u2019t souls of the same world then\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about it and decided it was worth a try!</p><br/><p>The situation was already like this and it couldn\u2019t be worse!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi no longer paused and strode towards them.</p><br/><p>With their five senses, they didn\u2019t notice his arrival. This was deliberately done by Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>He wanted to hit them directly so they had no chance to cover up.</p><br/><p>Houqing froze when he saw Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Leo wasn\u2019t much better. He was emotionally complex and his honest love was like a dusty jewel, making people feel bad.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at this and then at that.</p><br/><p>Leo opened his mouth first. If Xie Xi hadn\u2019t arrived then he would\u2019ve been convinced by Houqing\u2019s words and not have the courage to ask separately. Now Xie Xi was in front of him and he didn\u2019t have time to think about it. Thus he directly asked!</p><br/><p>REPORT THIS AD</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he telling the truth? My father was a rebel and tried to kill ou. You have the ability to manipulate my dreams. You\u2026 you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He asked intermittently, standing beside Houqing who was an ice sculpture in the cold wind.</p><br/><p>The bone-chilling cold passed from the tip of his finger to his heart. His blood solidified and his brain was very active. Xie Xi knew. It was over. Xie Xi would never forgive him.</p><br/><p>Houqing stood in the beloved garden while his soul was in physical hell. The overwhelming despair and craziness tore at his mind.</p><br/><p>He lost Xie Xi, he would lose Xie Xi forever\u2026</p><br/><p>Just as he was feeling desperate, he heard Xie Xi\u2019s quiet voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was apologizing to the lion beastman.</p><br/><p>Houqing felt like he had been pulled from the water. Air filled his chest cavity as he turned to look at Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi lowered his eyes and was cruel under his calm. \u201cHouqing\u2019s words are true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing was shocked.</p><br/><p>Leo\u2019s eyes turned scarlet and he cried out, \u201cWhy? Why are you teasing me like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had long been eavesdropping and naturally knew the script. \u201cYou are the only member of the Lion Country\u2019s royal family left. As long as you listen to me, the entire Lion Country\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Leo swung his fist and Houqing caught it.</p><br/><p>Leo was mad. This moment was really filled with ups and downs for him.</p><br/><p>Yesterday was full of affection and he slept happily because of Xie Xi\u2019s promise. Today, he fell from Heaven to Hell. He went from being wrapped in clouds to burning in his heart. Leo felt an indescribable pain.</p><br/><p>Not only did he lost love, he lost his life.</p><br/><p>His close person, the person he trusted, the person he loved most, had been deceiving him from beginning to end.</p><br/><p>The warmth that supported his growth turned out to be false.</p><br/><p>In front of the person who felt longing and attachment, Xie Xi was actually so hard-hearted.</p><br/><p>Leo was really blind and deaf. He had been deceived like a clown.</p><br/><p>Leo thought he was already in Hell and didn\u2019t expect to experience more cruelty.</p><br/><p>The familiar yet unfamiliar man in front of him declared, \u201cNow that you know this, I can\u2019t let you go.\u201d</p><br/><p>REPORT THIS AD</p><br/><p>Leo stared at Xie Xi with shock. \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2019re going to kill me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up, his eyes still. \u201cYou should know where this is. You can\u2019t escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>The posturing Xie felt fortunate. He didn\u2019t have the heart to be emperor and quietly drew some robots to pretend to be guards.</p><br/><p>He came along this path and knocked unconscious many of Houqing\u2019s confidants. It was his robots who came to chase the lion beastman.</p><br/><p>The robots naturally listened to his signals. He just had to stop Houqing from doing anything. Then the robots would make the scene look tragic while leading Leo along a certain path and it should be fine!</p><br/><p>Fortunately, there was the god\u2019s wisdom!</p><br/><p>Leo was filled with grief and anger, all the love transforming into a deep hate in an instant. \u201cXie Xi, I hate you!\u201d</p><br/><p>He jumped up and smashed the guards surrounding him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t need to distract Houqing since this person had already collapsed.</p><br/><p>How could this be?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2026 was really just using the lion? He wanted to borrow the lion to settle the Lion Country? Really\u2026</p><br/><p>He felt it was wrong but\u2026</p><br/><p>The guards stabbed at the lion and Xie Xi\u2019s heart thumped. \u2018Fuck, be careful. If you poke a hole in him then I will smash all of you!\u2019</p><br/><p>The \u2018guards\u2019 were very stable. After all, they were robots. There would be zero errors.</p><br/><p>Then Houqing\u2019s senses returned and he ordered, \u201cHe must be caught!\u201d</p><br/><p>The guards obeyed the orders but the person really controlling them was Xie Xi. Xie Xi ordered them to drive him to the border.</p><br/><p>Leo\u2019s training during this time wasn\u2019t in vain and his skills were amazing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw that Houqing wanted to act and hurriedly pulled at him. \u201cLeave it to them. If they can\u2019t even catch a young lion then what is the use of the guards?\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing was surprised and turned to look at him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi put on a tired expression. \u201cI\u2019m a bit hungry. Let\u2019s go back.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi intentionally took Houqing\u2019s hand because he was afraid that Houqing would ask, \u2018How did you come here?\u2019</p><br/><p>REPORT THIS AD</p><br/><p>Regarding this question, Xie Xi hadn\u2019t thought of a proper answer yet. He could only take advantage of Houqing\u2019s confused state to take him away from the scene.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Houqing suffered a much larger impact than he imagined.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t remember to ask the reason that Xie Xi came here. His brain was full of the changes that occurred just now.</p><br/><p>For Leo, it was a moment of ups and downs. For Houqing, wasn\u2019t it escaping death?</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until after breakfast, the medicinal bath and the guards reporting that the lion was seriously injured and fled into the Beast Forest, with no possibility of survival, that Houqing slowly recovered.</p><br/><p>The lion beastman died\u2026</p><br/><p>He turned to watch Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed and looked a bit uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>Houqing finally spoke to him, \u201cYour Majesty, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at him and smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t you know everything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing\u2019s heart humped and he kneeled down.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi got up and put on a cloak before saying, \u201cYou are really becoming more and more confused. Jiang Yuan attacked us so many times. How can I have any feelings for his child?\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing\u2019s body tensed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cIt was an accident to pick out the little lion. Since I discovered his past, I decided it would be a good thing to train him into the lion king.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing\u2019s brain was a mess. He heard everything Xie Xi said but the words were incomprehensible.</p><br/><p>Indeed, once he returned to the palace, Xie Xi had Houqing check the background of the lion beastman.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi added, \u201cI have no intention of unifying the eight countries again. I just want to do something within my power. If I could train this little lion into a good king then it is also very good.\u201d The reason was far-fetched but he was asking for Houqing\u2019s filter to fill in the loopholes himself!</p><br/><p>Houqing was intelligent and at this moment, he understood everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cI..\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you. It is my fault. The feelings that started out of deception will collapse sooner or later.</p><br/><p>Houqing didn\u2019t know what to think. His chaotic mood reached the peak and in the end, he could only squeeze out a sentence. \u201cI thought you returned to the palace for him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him.</p><br/><p>Houqing bowed his head and asked in a quivering voice, \u201cYour Majesty, why did you come back?\u201d</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for the lion beastman then why?</p><br/><p>Why return to a palace that he abhorred? Why meet Houqing?</p><br/><p>Why\u2014 this thought might be too good and Houqing didn\u2019t have the courage to think it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi bent over to help him up and spoke in a helpless voice, \u201cI miss you\u2026 Houqing, I missed you very much.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

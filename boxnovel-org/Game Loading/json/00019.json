Song Qi was really talented.</p><br/><p>Due to the previous world, Xie Xi had a psychological shadow against the word \u2018gay\u2019 and moved far away from Song Qi.</p><br/><p>Song Qi was quick sensitive and thought it was disliked for his perverted task. \u201cI also don\u2019t want to do this. The system assigned me such a task. What can I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Thinking about it, he was quite pitiful.</p><br/><p>Song Qi asked him again, \u201cWhat about you? What is your main mission?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi paused. This crybaby gay person looked harmless and pitiful and his main task was terrible, but these were all based on his words. There was no way to judge if it was the truth or not.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had been alone for a long time and had basic vigilance towards everyone.</p><br/><p>Song Qi looked stupid but he wasn\u2019t that foolish. He tinkered with something and Xie Xi saw a line appear in his lower right corner: [Name: Song Qi, the main mission is to collect a town girl\u2019s underwear, has sent you a friends application.]</p><br/><p>It turned out they could prove themselves like this. Xie Xi accepted the friends application.</p><br/><p>Song Qi exclaimed, \u201cMy god, your main task is to collect the dragon heart!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw his expression and wondered, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Song Qi seemed to know something, based on his expression.</p><br/><p>Song Qi quietly explained, \u201cMy side mission is to collect a dragon heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was confused but Song Qi was still talking. \u201cThis is the blue task that I refreshed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The main task didn\u2019t have a rating. Whether it was collecting a dragon heart or a girl\u2019s underwear, everyone had to complete it before leaving the game. Thus, the rating wasn\u2019t meaningful. However, the tasks associated with the world were similar. Often, the side mission of one person would be the main mission of another person, so the rating of the main mission could be inferred.</p><br/><p>This was a D-grade world and the highest task level was only blue. Song Qi worked hard to refresh his side mission yet it turned out to be Xie Xi\u2019s main mission.</p><br/><p>If someone\u2019s side mission was to collect underwear then Song Qi would be able to see the grade of his main mission. There was no need to think. It was 100% grey and probably wasn\u2019t even the lowest level white colour!</p><br/><p>The one who was harmed by the comparison, Song Qi spoke in a grievous manner, \u201cYou are so lucky\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t open his mouth.</p><br/><p>Song Qi asked again, \u201cWhat is your side mission? What is the rating? I\u2019m telling you, I spent a full 30,000 silver coins in order to gain the task of collecting the dragon heart!\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, side quests could be repeatedly refreshed. Xie Xi didn\u2019t know this because he got the highest blue grade in the first place. The best two tasks in the game were given to him. The system automatically determined that he didn\u2019t need to refresh the side mission and didn\u2019t give him the prompt.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi listened to Song Qi, who had kept talking. \u201cMy first quest was to collect the stinky socks of the second child of the Wang family, the second was to collect Aunty Sun\u2019s mace, the third\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He babbled a whole bunch. Xie Xi sympathized with him while pondering on things. Why did he feel that the collector profession was full of stupid things?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is 300 silver coins for one attempt. I refreshed it a full 100 times before gaining the task of collecting the dragon heart\u2026\u201d Song Qi wanted to cry again.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Song Qi exclaimed, \u201cThe 30,000 coins were given to me by a slag man as the breakup fee!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi couldn\u2019t help crying like a silly dog. \u201cWhy am I so miserable?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mouth moved but he couldn\u2019t comfort people. He had to stay silent.</p><br/><p>Song Qi took the initiative to be abused. \u201cBrother Xi, what is your side mission? Come and comfort me!\u201d The two of them added each other as friends and naturally knew the other person\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hesitated for a moment.</p><br/><p>Song Qi didn\u2019t think too much. According to the law of conservation of luck, the main task was so explosive that the side task must be rotten.\u201d</p><br/><p>The longer Xie Xi remained silent, the more curious Song Qi became. \u201cIs it even worse than my task of collecting underwear?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course not\u2026 Xie Xi thought about it and realized he probably didn\u2019t have to say the rating. He answered, \u201cTrack the tornado.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The next second, the little gay Song exploded. \u201cA blue task, it is another blue task\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201c\u2026How do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi had a dazed expression on his face. \u201cI met a buddy before who got this task. He was so proud that his tail shot up into the sky.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cDid he finish it?\u201d This task was a bit mysterious.</p><br/><p>Song Qi replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 I was locked up the day after I entered the game.\u201d</p><br/><p>The day after? Xie Xi captured the key point. \u201cHow long have you been in the game?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree or four days? I have been locked up so long that I\u2019m going crazy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned. He had just entered the game but Song Qi had been in the game for three or four days? What was going on?</p><br/><p>Weren\u2019t they from the same group of players? Or had players come in at different time points?</p><br/><p>Song Qi still couldn\u2019t accept it. He asked Xie Xi, \u201cHow many coins did you spend to get the blue task?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to hit him again but couldn\u2019t lie. Xie Xi was a newcomer and only cleared one game. It stood to reason that he should only have 10 silver coins left, not enough to refresh the task.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the second quasi-world I entered.\u201d Xie Xi answered vaguely.</p><br/><p>Song Qi went crazy. \u201cYou got a blue side mission for free?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Crybaby Song went online and his tears almost flooded the cage. \u201cWhy\u2026 why did God give birth to an unlucky person like me and a lucky person like you\u2026\u201d People who are better than others should die QAQ!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi then saw a prompt in the lower right corner. [If you have a good friend then you can send a team application.]</p><br/><p>Team application? Xie Xi looked at the pathetic Song Qi and sent the team application.</p><br/><p>Song Qi instantly stopped crying. Teardrops stayed at the corner of his eyes as he made a startled expression. \u201cBrother Xi\u2026 you want to\u2026team up with me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cIs it inconvenient?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d Song Qi screamed. \u201cBrother Xi, ah Emperor Xi, this younger brother won\u2019t hesitate to follow you everywhere!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xie Xi knew why Song Qi was so excited. It was because teammates would share tasks.</p><br/><p>There was the team information in the lower right corner.</p><br/><p>[Temporary Team: Xie Xi, Song Qi.</p><br/><p>Team Tasks: Collect the dragon heart, track the tornado, collect the female underwear.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Was there still time to withdraw from the team?</p><br/><p>Song Qi was moved to death. \u201cYou are my parents\u2019 reincarnation, my saviour\u2026 I really didn\u2019t expect a living emperor of luck to be on my team. Ohh, life is worth it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi slightly frowned. \u201cYour mission\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can rest assured!\u201d Song Qi hurriedly said, \u201cI will take care of my own mission. I can\u2019t leave the team but I will never drag you down!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi teamed up with this person because he felt Song Qi wasn\u2019t dangerous. In addition, he had something to ask his teammate.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see other players when you entered the game?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi replied, \u201cOf course. We landed at the same time and spent a night in the forest\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He trailed off and then reacted, \u201cI never saw you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Were they really from different groups of players?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI entered the game today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi paled. \u201cAll of my group are dead?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA quasi-world will re-release the task if the players mortality rate is over 80%.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cIt has only been three or four days yet eight people died?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi was also stunned. \u201cIsn\u2019t this a D-grade world? A D-grade shouldn\u2019t be so difficult!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked him another question. \u201cWhat did you get caught for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi was embarrassed. \u201cWhat else could it be? It is because of stealing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood. Song Qi wasn\u2019t familiar with stealing underwear and was arrested. Song Qi cleared his throat. \u201cWhat happened outside? I have been locked up for days and don\u2019t know anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was due to being locked up that he survived. In a sense, this damn mission saved Song Qi\u2019s life.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told his story. \u201cI just arrived here when someone attacked. A player I was with died on the spot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi was stunned. \u201cDied on the spot? Wasn\u2019t he wearing a uniform?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe he was immune to the fatal injury but the villagers thought he died. I was arrested by them and locked up here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi sighed. \u201cHe must\u2019ve been afraid of occupying his items bar and didn\u2019t wear the uniform. Then he is dead\u2026\u201d He was really dead.</p><br/><p>Multiplayer games generally didn\u2019t have the option to load a file. They had to buy items that were immune to fatal injuries, have a medicine to survive or a resurrection skill\u2026 without any of this, they were really dead.</p><br/><p>This was a game but it wasn\u2019t a game.</p><br/><p>The two of them had just finished speaking when they heard footsteps outside.</p><br/><p>Song Qi immediately whispered. \u201cIt is the person who brings food! Brother Qi, smile at him and he will let us out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him. \u201cSmile?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Song Qi exclaimed. \u201cYou are so beautiful that young people won\u2019t be able to bear it!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi spoke with a wronged expression again. \u201cIf I had 30% of your good looks, that scum male wouldn\u2019t have dumped me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t think Song Qi was ugly and told him, \u201cDon\u2019t undervalue yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi was moved. \u201cBrother Xi, you are really beautiful. No wonder why your luck is so good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t think he was good looking. Secondly, he didn\u2019t feel he was lucky. His luck was better than ordinary people but it was limited to game related things\u2026 His life in the past 20 years hadn\u2019t been very lucky.</p><br/><p>At this time, a young man in his early 20s came over. He was very thin, like a bamboo pole, and the linen cloth was hanging from his body.</p><br/><p>He was startled when he saw Xie Xi and then revealed a ferocious light. \u201cKill\u2026 I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d He was holding something in his hand.</p><br/><p>Song Qi was scared to death. \u201cA gun!\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t go clear the land. Yan Zhe was too lazy to go and waste time with others. Thus, he dragged Qin Ge to the garden.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Xie really likes roses. The big garden was filled with all types of roses.</p><br/><p>Qin Ge stated, \u201cIt looks good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it is beautiful. That little rose is even more beautiful.\u201d The person worthy of fitting with Old Xie\u2019s soul was really beautiful.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe saw Old Xie and quipped, \u201cThe little rose hasn\u2019t summoned you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wondered, \u201cWhat is so urgent?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe said, \u201cI just feel that you are waiting for nothing. He won\u2019t summon you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d It was highly likely Yan Zhe had a crow\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe thought about how Xie Xi\u2019s good feelings were at 170 points and had a thought. \u201cPerhaps he is too embarrassed to bother you with such a low level task?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie thought that Xie Xi wasn\u2019t embarrassed, he was disgusted. Of course, he had to maintain his face. Jiang Xie said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to summon me when it is dangerous. He could also miss me.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

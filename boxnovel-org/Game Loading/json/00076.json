Who would\u2019ve expected the master to change into a chicken? Xie Xi needed to stay calm.</p><br/><p>He stared at the task information board. Unlike the previous quasi-world, there was no name for the game. It directly welcomed him to the open world and told him to read the following information carefully.</p><br/><p>The next line startled Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Note: Disabled all skills, disabled the items bar, disabled any pets.</p><br/><p>All of them were forbidden. At this moment, Xie Xi hated his teammates even more. He couldn\u2019t use skills or props while his teammate didn\u2019t have a brain. In the end, what was the use of his teammate?</p><br/><p>Poor Roast Pork Bun was placed in the pets column and couldn\u2019t come out.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart ached. He placed the kitten into the pet space in order to not be irritated after returning to the Central World. Now he couldn\u2019t be taken out.</p><br/><p>In fact, the open world wasn\u2019t better than the quasi-world in this regard. There were still many players. The people of the quasi-world couldn\u2019t see the kitten but fellow players could see him. There was no way to let Roast Pork Bun out.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t afraid of Roast Pork Bun making trouble but the kitten himself was too precious. He treated the kitten like a poor high school student carrying tens of thousands of yuan.</p><br/><p>As for the ban on skills and items, Xie Xi could still accept it. After all, his level was low and he couldn\u2019t use too many powerful items.</p><br/><p>In regards to his skills, X lost his memory so he didn\u2019t dare to summon X\u2019s body. It was too cumbersome to explain and the latest skill to take away an item wasn\u2019t a combat skill and couldn\u2019t be used!</p><br/><p>After this analysis, Xie Xi felt that there was no need to team up!</p><br/><p>He continued to read the main task: (1) Admire the newly born sun.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s face was stunned. What was this main task? He couldn\u2019t see the rating for the main task but Xie Xi believed that his luck in this area generally wouldn\u2019t give him a bad task.</p><br/><p>What was admire the newly born sun? Was it difficult to see a newly born sun in this open world?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t ignore the serial number 1. Did this main task have a follow-up?</p><br/><p>He was temporarily unsure and could only continue looking at the side task. The side task needed to be searched. Xie Xi searched and quickly got: (1) Collect a bundle of branches.</p><br/><p>Was it that simple? He could see the rating of the side mission. It was bright purple so Xie Xi couldn\u2019t take it lightly.</p><br/><p>The difficulty level ranged from grey to gold. It was estimated that it was difficult to get a gold rating with this open world. Purple was probably the highest.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s task of collecting branches turned out to be purple. Was it hard to collect branches? Or was the system off?</p><br/><p>The latter wasn\u2019t possible and the former didn\u2019t make sense. Xie Xi stared at the number \u20181\u2019 and felt there was a secret in it.</p><br/><p>It would take time to admire the newly born sun. Collecting branches was different so he could try it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi continued to look down. There were no loading files in the open world and skills and items couldn\u2019t be used. Thus, a player only had one life.</p><br/><p>Dead was really dead and he couldn\u2019t be resurrected. Xie Xi\u2019s nerves were tight and he didn\u2019t dare be careless.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take much time to review the information board but many thoughts flashed through Xie Xi\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>It was only a moment in reality. Jiang Xie was still watching him with a hard to read expression. It wouldn\u2019t be shocking if Xie Xi didn\u2019t know that Jiang Xie lost his memory.</p><br/><p>Now\u2026 keep pretending!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi ignored him and first looked around quietly at the environment\u2026</p><br/><p>They were on a high slope while wild grass grew freely under their feet. There was an endless forest in front of them and a towering mountain behind them.</p><br/><p>It was difficult since the mountain was bare and the exposed rocks were covered with unscientific vegetation. The forest in front was also strange. The trees all seemed from the same model but the thickness was different.</p><br/><p>The wild grass under their feet spread out densely, seeming like they were copied and pasted.</p><br/><p>So perfunctory! A world opened by the Zone should have more effort in it!</p><br/><p>In comparison, Xie Xi thought that the quasi-worlds designed by X were very advanced.</p><br/><p>It was probably the difference between a 2D pixel villain and a well-prepared 3D masterpiece.</p><br/><p>Apart from some roughness, he temporarily couldn\u2019t see any danger. Xie Xi retracted his gaze and glanced at the master by his side.</p><br/><p>He pulled out the acting skills trained from the two worlds and look at him doubtfully. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes slightly narrowed. Xie Xi smiled and made a familiar expression. He had to test what Jiang Xie had forgotten.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at him with a penetrating gaze. Xie Xi felt awkward and his smile was very stiff.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie approached him. \u201cWhy are you feeling guilty?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>So sharp! Shouldn\u2019t he be more naive with his brain gone?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t stand the feeling of oppression and opened the distance. \u201cWhy are you asking me who I am? We\u2019re on the same team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes drooped and he appeared to be checking the system panel.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi observed him and his heart sank. It seemed that this person still remembered the Central World. He just forgot Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>It was unknown how long Jiang Xie had been in the Central World and memories were a complex thing. It couldn\u2019t all be taken away.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt a little relieved. This guy had lost his memory and become a fool but he was still useful.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Jiang Xie\u2019s next words were, \u201cWhy would I team up with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d How could he answer?</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t tell the truth because Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t be reminded of his lost memories. Otherwise, these memories would be completely taken away once he left the open world.</p><br/><p>Well\u2026 this was okay? Jiang Xie forgot him but they didn\u2019t have much to do with each other. If he forgot, he forgot.</p><br/><p>No!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi realized that he couldn\u2019t let Jiang Xie forget him. Jiang Xie needed to go to the next world to face the crazy souls with him!</p><br/><p>Forget about it. What would happen if X no longer teamed up with him?</p><br/><p>Moreover, Xie Xi wasn\u2019t sure what Jiang Xie had forgotten. What if it wasn\u2019t just him?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie entered this world to help him. He might not like Jiang Xie but he couldn\u2019t do such a thing to a person who wanted to help him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned his head and had an idea. He blinked and glanced at Jiang Xie. \u201cMaster, have you forgotten me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned and his ears felt like they had been scratched by a kitten.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you wanted to take me to the open world to see the world? Did you forget all about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie frowned and he seemed to be thinking.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had an idea and he didn\u2019t feel guilty. The best way to prevent Jiang Xie from thinking was to make a false memory.</p><br/><p>In any case, Jiang Xie had forgotten him. Xie Xi just needed to talk nonsense and fool him!</p><br/><p>Um\u2026 it didn\u2019t matter if he wasn\u2019t fooled. Jiang Xie\u2019s doubts would just get him further and further from the truth. Thus, there was no risk of him retrieving his memories.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi used the superb acting that deceived six souls. \u201cWhat can I do? Have you forgotten everything about us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was worthy of being the \u2018ancestor\u2019 of the souls. He paused and asked, \u201cThere is something between us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xie Xi spoke with some embarrassment. \u201cIt is incredible when thinking about it now. I\u2019m just a newcomer and was accepted as your apprentice. I\u2019m really flattered.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at him for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m your master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded seriously. \u201cYou have also taken me to the garden. The roses were extremely beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes shone slightly at the words and he asked softly, \u201cWhat colour was the roses?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luckily, Xie Xi had really been there. \u201cOnce they were white and another time they were blue. They were very beautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi answered well and Master X\u2019s watchful expression decreased. He whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi showed a brilliant smile. \u201cHow can I deceive you?\u201d</p><br/><p>He rolled his eyes in his heart. \u2018I can\u2019t deceive you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi barely steadied his heart and didn\u2019t forget his task as he asked Jiang Xie, \u201cMaster, what is your task?\u201d</p><br/><p>The master called Jiang Xie\u2019s heart thump and he replied, \u201cThe main task is to explore the underground labyrinth. The side task is to collect branches.\u201d</p><br/><p>They might\u2019ve teamed up but they couldn\u2019t see each other\u2019s tasks unless they were shared.</p><br/><p>Explore the underground labyrinth? It didn\u2019t sound easy. However, the side tasks seemed to be the same?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cIt is just collecting branches?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie directly shared the tasks with him. Xie Xi saw that the rating of the main task wasn\u2019t visible while the branch collection task was grey.</p><br/><p>It was the same branches collection but Xie Xi\u2019s one was a serial task and it was purple, the world\u2019s highest rating. Meanwhile, Jiang Xie was the minimum rating of grey.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi coughed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cMy task doesn\u2019t matter. Didn\u2019t you say that I am here to accompany you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xie Xi replied. \u201cMaster would never go to such a low rated world and there is no reward for clearing it.\u201d</p><br/><p>This sounded good. Jiang Xie asked, \u201cWhat is your main task?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also shared his tasks. Comrade Old Jiang, who had been unlucky for half his life, was silent. Xie Xi wondered, \u201cIsn\u2019t it too simple?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie answered, \u201cYou are lucky. Most guiding tasks have rich rewards.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was curious. \u201cGuiding tasks?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFinish one task and the next will appear in a sequence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough, there was a follow up task!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi casually flattered him. \u201cMaster knows a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cDon\u2019t be happy too early. The difficulty of guiding tasks will gradually increase. If you can\u2019t finish the last task, you can\u2019t leave this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid. There is Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked again, \u201cMaster won\u2019t leave me, will you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stiff as he moved his gaze and strode forward. \u201cGo collect the branches.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw his reddish ear tips and couldn\u2019t help smiling. He was slightly reminded of Third Prince Gars. Sure enough, the souls reflected the personality of the original!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi followed him down the slope and went to the forest to collect branches. The branches were really easy to be found. They were everywhere. Jiang Xie just needed to randomly pick them up and he completed his side task. It was really lucky.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi soon picked up a large bundle. Jiang Xie\u2019s task was directly completed while Xie Xi received a follow up task: (2) Find a cave nearby.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie opened his mouth. \u201cWhat is the next task?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi froze. \u201cYou can\u2019t see it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained. \u201cSharing tasks will only share the current task. Once a new task refreshes, it needs to be re-shared.</p><br/><p>It was like this. Xie Xi whispered, \u201cSo troublesome. Then I have to share it every time it refreshes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. You don\u2019t have to share it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had already shared it but he thought that it would indeed be more troublesome in the future and nodded. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll tell you directly next time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes twinkled. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was aware that Jiang Xie still doubted him. It was understandable. An amnesiac suddenly met a stranger who said he was Jiang Xie\u2019s apprentice. Who wouldn\u2019t doubt it?</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s take it slowly since Xie Xi wasn\u2019t planning to scam him anyway.</p><br/><p>Finding the nearby cave was also simple. This task was completed and there was a third task: Make a bonfire.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t make a fire but Jiang Xie had a wealth of field survival experience. He had no trouble lighting a fire. Xie Xi quickly searched for hay as ignition material and soon finished the third task.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi praised him. \u201cMaster is really good.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sky outside was dark and the light of the bonfire shone on the teenager\u2019s white face, highlighting the beautiful lines.</p><br/><p>His voice was particularly pleasant and melodious, while his words were as were as honey.</p><br/><p>If Jiang Xie hadn\u2019t seen the -365 goodwill, he would\u2019ve believed that this person was really his apprentice.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

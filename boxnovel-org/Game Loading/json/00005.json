If Sein Hall had been loyal then these two abnormal people wouldn\u2019t have gone crazy like this.</p><br/><p>It was very meaningful to look at the name of the game again. Love to the left or right, was it to have him choose between the housekeeper and the vampire? However, the mission goal was simply for him to live for seven days. Would there be other traps? Xie Xi simply couldn\u2019t trust this damn game!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was busy thinking when the vampire fervently said, \u201cI will go back first. Small Sein, see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew the housekeeper was coming and the vampire wanted to avoid Randy. His brain worked and he said, \u201cI\u2019ll go directly to you tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>The vampire\u2019s eyes lit up and he licked his lips. \u201cI will pick you up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cWait for me. I want to give you a surprise.\u201d</p><br/><p>The vampire replied sincerely, \u201cYou are going to be my bride. That is my greatest joy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cI should prepare for such a special day.\u201d</p><br/><p>The vampire was very imaginative and said softly, \u201cYou are the most beautiful person I have ever seen. You don\u2019t need any embellished clothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Who the hell would wear embellished clothing for him!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very patient. \u201cTomorrow will be the start of a new life. Give me some time to say goodbye to the past.\u201d He was a good young man who was forced to talk nonsense because of this game.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d The vampire was very excited. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of Xie Xi\u2019s lips curved as he tried his best to smile. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>The footsteps outside got closer. The silver-haired vampire reluctantly said, \u201cSmall Sein, I have been waiting for you for too long. Please be sure to satisfy me tomorrow.</p><br/><p>The child Xie Xi was stunned by the second half of the sentence. Satisfy? What was the satisfaction method? How as this game coded?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled stiffly but fortunately, the vampire Aix-en had love on the brain. \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous. I will definitely give you the sweetest and happiest night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t listen and vaguely replied, \u201cOkay, okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>The vampire was fascinated by him and thought he was just shy. \u201cThen I\u2019m leaving first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi demanded, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to peek at me tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en was stunned.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi awkwardly explained, \u201cIf you peek then will it be a surprise?\u201d The situation was stronger than a person and Xie Xi felt that his integrity was being broken.</p><br/><p>The vampire smiled sweetly. \u201cTomorrow I won\u2019t go anywhere. I will wait for you at the earl\u2019s house.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t reassured. \u201cPromise me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The vampire suddenly held his hand. \u201cIf you do this again then I really can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d What was this? What did he do?</p><br/><p>His words fell into the vampire earl\u2019s lovestruck brain and became\u2014spoiled, cute, reluctant to let go and lovely.</p><br/><p>The vampire sighed. \u201cThese five years have been very long for me. Fortunately, you will completely belong to me tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard important information. Five years? They had known each other for five years?</p><br/><p>The vampire gently picked up his hand and placed a pious kiss on the back. \u201cSein Hall, I love you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He might\u2019ve been killed twice but when he thought about it, he might shoot the scum Sein thousands of times in the heart.</p><br/><p>The vampire had just left when the door opened and the housekeeper Randy entered slowly with a candlestick.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t pretend to be sleeping. The two of them said the same words as before but this time Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare mention anything. He just looked at Randy anxiously.</p><br/><p>The housekeeper whispered, \u201cYoung Master, are you worried about something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes flashed and he gently shook his head.</p><br/><p>The housekeeper put down the candlestick and worried over him. \u201cYoung Master, no matter what you have to tell me, Randy will swear eternal loyalty to you, even if there is a raging fire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought, \u2018I would\u2019ve believed you if you hadn\u2019t cut off my head twice.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very cautious and didn\u2019t say much. He always felt that the vampire hadn\u2019t gone far. The reason why he fired the arrow without giving Xie Xi a chance to say anything might have something to do with tonight.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had acted too coldly to the vampire the night before loading the file. Then after the housekeeper came, he was very attached to the housekeeper. The vampire who liked to peep and had a lovestruck brain didn\u2019t know what to think. The next day, the vampire deliberately wrote an excessive invitation and let the housekeeper see it.</p><br/><p>The invitation letter between nobles was a public document read by the housekeeper before they notified their master. Aix-en definitely wrote about the wedding and stimulated the housekeeper.</p><br/><p>The thing between Sein and the vampire had definitely been kept from the housekeeper or else Aix-en wouldn\u2019t have gone away when he heard Randy\u2019s footsteps. Sein had obviously already agreed to be with the vampire.</p><br/><p>Aix-en avoided Randy tonight so why did he write an invitation like that tomorrow? The changes were due to tonight.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi made up his mind and prepared to make it through tonight. \u201cRandy, I\u2019m a bit sleepy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The housekeeper immediately replied, \u201cThen have a good rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Randy didn\u2019t say anything else. He carefully tucked Xie Xi in and left with a \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><br/><p>The slender figure of the housekeeper illuminated by the candle went away and Xie Xi sighed. He felt that the problem wasn\u2019t too big and he could hopefully pass tomorrow.</p><br/><p>Just in case, Xie Xi closed his eyes and pretended to sleep for half an hour before calling out the name \u2018Aix-en.\u2019 He planned to say a bit more but unfortunately he wasn\u2019t a professional actor. He couldn\u2019t pass the hurdles in his heart and really couldn\u2019t say such things!</p><br/><p>The next day, the housekeeper came to help him wash and Xie Xi looked tired. He didn\u2019t have to pretend. He had been thinking all night and didn\u2019t sleep well.</p><br/><p>Randy was distressed. \u201cYoung Master, didn\u2019t you sleep well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him and didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>Randy also hadn\u2019t slept well. He had faint dark circles under his eyes and his voice was anxious, \u201cYoung Master, please tell me your unhappiness. Randy\u2019s life is to solve all your problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt he was scum but in order to live well, he could only say, \u201cRandy, how long have you been following me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Randy was startled and knelt down in front of him. \u201c10 years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not one year or five years, but 10 years? Xie Xi scolded the scum in his heart and continued, \u201cFrom today, you are free.\u201d</p><br/><p>Randy jerked up, his blue eyes full of fear through his always meticulous hair. \u201cYoung Master, you don\u2019t want me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d His neck felt a bit cold.</p><br/><p>Randy was pale and his lips had no blood. \u201cAre you finally tired of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was afraid he would be killed but the plot was more unreasonable than he imagined.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need me anymore? I\u2019m not worthy of your love?\u201d The housekeeper smiled and a knife appeared out of nowhere in his hand.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi jumped. Then these two were in love? That\u2026 let\u2019s talk! What was he doing with the knife?</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master, I have never been greedy for your love nor did I dare to overstep. However, why did you give me the light of heaven only to take it away?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you are tired of me\u2026\u201d The housekeeper\u2019s handsome face was full of despair. \u201cThen there is no meaning in my survival.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned\u2026 the silver knife didn\u2019t go through his head but stabbed the housekeeper\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Suicide? The housekeeper Randy was dead? What the hell was this damn plot?</p><br/><p>Was this a normal direction of development? Then there was no need to make a choice?</p><br/><p>Impossible! Xie Xi didn\u2019t believe this fucking game would be so simple!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

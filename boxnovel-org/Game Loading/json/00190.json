It was a 30 minute journey using an aircraft. He walked for seven hours and by the time he arrived, his whole body was frozen.</p><br/><p>The doorman guard was a bit surprised. \u201cAssistant Xie, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi entered the warm building but he only felt a biting cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he replied softly before returning to his office. He worked overtime to finish the work he had delayed and stayed even when the rational working overtime went home to rest.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t go home. He lay on the table and took a nap. His body shrank back in his sleep and it was unknown what he was dreaming as tears fell quietly from the corners of his eyes.</p><br/><p>Big Jiang saw this and his body swayed uncontrollably. J gritted his teeth and Little Jiang clenched his fists.</p><br/><p>If the memories weren\u2019t still continuing, Xie Xi would be surprised if these two killed Big Jiang\u2026</p><br/><p>The last memory was after Jiang Xie left. This was something that wasn\u2019t in the movie.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi became president and Jiang Xie had been away for a long time. However, due to the collapse of the universe, the United States needed his help.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tried to contact this person but once Jiang Xie answered, his emotions that had been crushed by countless work surged up. He couldn\u2019t say a word and he could only transfer the call to Li Su.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie heard Li Su\u2019s voice and was slightly startled. \u201cWhat about Xie Xi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Su didn\u2019t dare say that the president had suddenly transferred the call to him and had to find an excuse. \u201cThe president is working\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned and his voice was faint. \u201cYou are using his channel to contact me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Su hadn\u2019t done this but he couldn\u2019t dismantle Xie Xi. He could only shoulder the blame. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t hesitate to cut off the connection.</p><br/><p>Li Su, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi listened to all of this and was numb. \u201cKeep contacting him with my channel later on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Mr. Jiang doesn\u2019t want\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI am very busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Su could only reply, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he was about to leave, Xie Xi suddenly whispered, \u201cHelp me prepare the eraser.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Su was surprised. \u201cMr. President, do you want to erase your memories?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Su thought about it and said, \u201cDon\u2019t we need to hold a cabinet meeting?\u201d This wasn\u2019t a trivial meaning.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, they are just some personal memories.\u201d Xie Xi spoke in a hoarse voice. He couldn\u2019t bear these memories and didn\u2019t want to think of this man again.</p><br/><p>Emotions were a virus for a reason. Even if he worked hard, even if he reached such a supreme position, even if no one looked at him strangely\u2026 even\u2026 even\u2026</p><br/><p>It was useless. He had never been happy since leaving Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Looking at the presidential palace where Jiang Xie once lived, drinking his favourite black tea, looking through the documents he had reviewed and carrying out his development path for the United States\u2026</p><br/><p>All of this caused Xie Xi to feel endless loneliness. Why would he do that? Why wasn\u2019t he a pure rational? Xie Xi couldn\u2019t find the answer and chose to erase all of it.</p><br/><p>The memories came to an abrupt end. There was no doubt that Xie Xi was in love with Jiang Xie. He didn\u2019t know when he fell in love and only knew how to work hard.</p><br/><p>The one time that could salvage things was rejected. Xie Xi carried the shackles of a rational person while suffering from emotional pain. Finally, he chose to forget.</p><br/><p>He had a vague guess but after seeing this, Big Jiang was remorseful and couldn\u2019t wait to kill himself!</p><br/><p>What did he do? What did he take for granted? He kept saying that he loved Xie Xi yet he gave Xie Xi such despair and pain. He\u2026</p><br/><p>J raised his hand to punch Big Jiang. \u201cYou bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Jiang was also angry. Xie Xi saw that they really wanted to fight and hurriedly stopped them.</p><br/><p>J blew up. \u201cHe hurt you like that, he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The person he took care of for over 200 years was bullied by this bastard. J hated Big Jiang when he thought about it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cHe didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>In this environment, the odds of a rational understanding love might be similar to a stone on Earth understanding love. This was a rare thing that could only be seen in textbooks and movies.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie glanced at Xie Xi, who was protecting him, and spoke in a hoarse voice, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard his voice and his heart was filled with pain. He didn\u2019t blame this person at all, let alone hate him.</p><br/><p>The so-called memories were all thought out by Jiang Xie. Xie Xi had never experienced it and wouldn\u2019t experience such a thing.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t rational or emotional. He couldn\u2019t be determined by any framework. There wouldn\u2019t be such a thing between him and Jiang Xie. It would never happen.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the souls in front of him didn\u2019t know this.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned his head and saw Jiang Xie give a light cough, blood spilling from his mouth. He hurriedly jumped forward and helped this person.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie held his hand and Xie Xi asked anxiously, \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>J and Little Jiang watched with cold eyes, wishing this person would die like this! Jiang Xie shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Xie\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could only say calmly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I forgot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The implication was that even if he watched those memories, they didn\u2019t resonate with him. He had wiped them all away.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was pale and his trembling lips lost colour.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to poke Jiang Xie\u2019s heart but there was no other way. In this situation, he couldn\u2019t do anything or the other two would also cough blood. How could he coax them? If he didn\u2019t coax them, what about the universe?</p><br/><p>He knew the three of them were in love but he had a job to do! Fortunately, J and Little Jiang didn\u2019t stop them. Xie Xi sent Big Jiang back to the bedroom and settled him down to rest.</p><br/><p>By the time he came out, J and Little Jiang weren\u2019t there. Xie Xi didn\u2019t know where they had gone. He could only silently pray that these two didn\u2019t partner up to kill Big Jiang. Beating yourself up was bad enough but killing yourself was terrible.</p><br/><p>After all, death was death, even for Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>There was something he needed to discuss with the cabinet. Xie Xi told the guard captain to look after these three dangerous people and went out with Li Su. He was too busy to eat dinner with them.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sat on the aircraft in a tired manner and asked about the situation in the presidential palace.</p><br/><p>Li Su replied, \u201cMr. Jiang, Mr. J and the young master met at dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi raised an eyebrow. \u201cDid anything happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Su was very rational and wasn\u2019t curious. \u201cNothing, it was very calm as they chatted to each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart started drumming. \u201cPass on the video to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The presidential palace was completely surveilled and everything they did was recorded.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw the three Jiang Xies sitting in the dining room.</p><br/><p>The three people were identical. They just had different ages and experiences so their temperament wasn\u2019t the same. Still, it was quite strange.</p><br/><p>The staff of the presidential palace were all rational people. If there was a normal human then they would definitely feel that the president had some strange collection fetish.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nervously watched the video, thinking he would hear the three people hate each other. He didn\u2019t expect for them to have a very sensible conversation.</p><br/><p>J spoke first. \u201cDon\u2019t confuse him again. I\u2019m sure that he is a special rational.\u201d</p><br/><p>Big Jiang had recuperated some strength. His eyebrows were still wrinkled but his colour was better. \u201cHe understands. We all understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Jiang was full of a bitter taste. He had previously told Big Jiang, \u201cAn emotional pretending to be rational is the stupidest behaviour.\u201d Now it was returned to him and Little Jiang was bitter and unable to say a word.</p><br/><p>J was relatively calm. He might want to kill Jiang Xie but he knew that if this man was dead, the universe would collapse.</p><br/><p>Once the universe collapsed, everything would be gone. He didn\u2019t care previously but now it was different. This was quite ironic and the United States owed a big thank you to Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Still, people were like this. The heart that was the size of a palm only had one person in it. This person was the driving force behind everything they did.</p><br/><p>J added, \u201cDon\u2019t let him get confused again. The most important thing right now is to get through the storm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s voice was quiet. \u201cThis mission must be successful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Jiang sneered, \u201cOnce the mission is over, we will compete fairly.</p><br/><p>After seeing this, Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help muttering, \u201cLittle Jiang, this doesn\u2019t seem fair to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then again, he thought it wasn\u2019t necessarily the case. Little Jiang didn\u2019t have a previous background with Xie Xi because the soul was pulled away but this wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. Xie Xi personally cooked for him and didn\u2019t refuse his sleepwalking. Maybe he was a real new beginning for Xie Xi who forgot everything.</p><br/><p>This should be Little Jiang\u2019s brain circuit.</p><br/><p>The three men reconciled and even had three rules. After the mission was successful, they weren\u2019t allowed to trouble Xie Xi, stimulate Xie Xi or make Xie Xi confused.</p><br/><p>Everything that followed had to be gradual. Once he liked someone, the other two must voluntarily withdraw.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi listened to these three people and felt a strange heartache. No matter how many grievances they had or how unwilling they felt, they always put Xie Xi in first place.</p><br/><p>No matter what mistakes were made, they thought the next step was to make Xie Xi happy.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help smiling as he patted Roast Pork Bun in his arms. The kitten was sleeping and his little ears trembled.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi poked his small head. \u201cGet up and work.\u201d</p><br/><p>The kitten was confused and his beautiful eyes were dazed. Xie Xi told him, \u201cI will use Dreaming for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>He would leave the world after completing the mission and was unwilling to leave the souls with disappointment. Besides, they all reconciled and Xie Xi couldn\u2019t bear to let them feel sad.</p><br/><p>This world was doomed to have an unhappy ending but happiness could be achieved in the dream.</p><br/><p>Giving each of them the desired ending could also give them motivation to find the Creator.</p><br/><p>Under normal circumstances, Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t dare to use Dreaming on three people with SSS-grade physiques.</p><br/><p>However, before the mission happened, they needed to enter the sleeping cabin to maintain their bodies. In such a strong sleeping state, Dreaming could be attempted.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi prepared everything and entered J\u2019s dream first. As he thought, it worked!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was relieved but he wasn\u2019t surprised that J would dream of him. After watching such memories, it would be strange if he didn\u2019t dream of Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>What type of dream would it be?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his eyes and found himself enlisting in the army. Yes, the starting point was very accurate in order to not let him meet Big Jiang.</p><br/><p>There was a commotion in front of him. \u201cMr. J, you are an emotional and not suitable for joining the army.\u201d</p><br/><p>J raised his eyebrows. \u201cWhat is wrong with an emotional? You are just being sexist. The United States had no rules about an emotional joining the army!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

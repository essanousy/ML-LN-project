One month after reaching adulthood, they would enter the estrus period.</p><br/><p>The so-called estrus period literally meant their sexual desires would soar and they would be restless for seven days.</p><br/><p>According to the parenting expert, Huer\u2019s mother said, \u201cThis is a golden seven day period. It is guaranteed to give birth to the next chubby boy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s scalp was numb when he heard this.</p><br/><p>In particular, Huer\u2019s mother told her son for a long time, \u201cYou can rest assured that you don\u2019t have to go out in those seven days. I will give you the best tonic soup, make the best good and ensure you keep up your strength!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d If he wasn\u2019t trying to inquire about the situation then he wouldn\u2019t be able to listen to half a word!</p><br/><p>The end result was that the estrus period might come later but it would never be absent.</p><br/><p>Thus, Jiang Xie was bound to usher in seven days of estrus!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was more worried about what would happen if he didn\u2019t do it in the seven days.</p><br/><p>Without him asking, Huer\u2019s mother took the initiative to remind him, \u201cMr Xie must hurry up with Little Xie. If he doesn\u2019t have a wife then the child can\u2019t stand it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really wanted to ask what would happen! However, he couldn\u2019t speak the words.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Huer\u2019s mother was enthusiastic and it was unknown if she was trying to solve Xie Xi\u2019s confusion or frighten him, \u201cEven if you are skilled in medicine, Little Jiang\u2019s madness won\u2019t be able to be cured.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d He would become crazy? What type of crazy? A murderous beast?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help thinking of his own physique in Gemini\u2019s world.</p><br/><p>\u2026Old Jiang, how much desires did he have to be so dissatisfied?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare rely on luck. After all, this was a broken world. Who knew how the souls would pit themselves?</p><br/><p>What if Xie Xi really \u2018died?\u2019 How would he cope for seven days? Don\u2019t talk about seven days. Xie Xi felt like he would die in bed after only once.</p><br/><p>\u2026Would the lion go crazy? This image was too ferocious and Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare think about it.</p><br/><p>Was he really going to give the lion a wife? Xie Xi thought, \u2018Oh, it is better to die.\u2019</p><br/><p>A veteran of 100 battles, he had danced on the tip of a knife and passed through a rain of needles, yet Xie Xi felt an unprecedented sorrow.</p><br/><p>What the hell was he going to do?</p><br/><p>For most of the year, he had tried to restore his body but it wasn\u2019t possible.</p><br/><p>If Jiang Xie hadn\u2019t been with him all the time, he would\u2019ve drawn a portable CT machine to see what was going on with his heart!</p><br/><p>The medicine he drew was enough to bring someone back to life yet he couldn\u2019t cure his broken body.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Jiang Xie\u2019s question brought Xie Xi\u2019s mind back.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gazed at the young person in front of him and his mood became more complicated.</p><br/><p>As Huer\u2019s mother said, Jiang Xie was really handsome after growing up.</p><br/><p>He had blonde hair, slender brows, a tall nose, sexy thin lips and his body was very strong. His abs were perfect and he had a pair of long legs. One of his steps was equivalent to two of Xie Xi\u2019s steps.</p><br/><p>It had only been half a year\u2026</p><br/><p>His child had grown into a big adult. Old Father Xie\u2019s mood was very complicated. \u2018Asking me about my thoughts? How can I dare tell you those things?\u2019</p><br/><p>The \u2018old father\u2019 picked up the cup next to him and wanted to drink something to slow down.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie took the cup away first. \u201cThis tea is too cold. Don\u2019t drink it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Three or four months ago, the paws had turned into slender fingers that fit the youth\u2019s thin beauty.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had to sip the soy milk he handed over.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke again, \u201cThis is a bit sweet. Don\u2019t drink too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded and put down the cup.</p><br/><p>They were at Huer\u2019s wedding and many acquaintances were sitting next to them. One quipped, \u201cLittle Xie really takes care of people. Whoever he marries in the future will be really blessed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was grabbing some fish for Xie Xi and didn\u2019t answer.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard this and wasn\u2019t in the mood to eat!</p><br/><p>The tigers weren\u2019t malicious. They were speaking kindly and playfully.</p><br/><p>Then he heard a female say, \u201cIf I was a few years younger then I would definitely marry him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her husband wasn\u2019t happy. \u201cYour oldest child is older than Little Xie!\u201d</p><br/><p>The female hit her husband. \u201cCan\u2019t you have some consideration when speaking? I will burn incense!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her husband let her hit him. \u201cThat isn\u2019t the same. Little Xie is filial to his father. Do you want me to be filial to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The female smiled. \u201cLook at this messy person!\u201d</p><br/><p>The people on the table laughed and Xie Xi\u2019s lips thinned.</p><br/><p>Yes, he was still Jiang Xie\u2019s \u2018father\u2019 and this made him more worried.</p><br/><p>From beginning to end, Jiang Xie didn\u2019t say anything. He picked out the fish bones and gave Xie Xi a cut of meat, carefully looking after him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cDon\u2019t get me too much. I can\u2019t eat it all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at him with narrowed eyes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t eat much in the morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very worried about the estrus period these days and how could he have the appetite to eat. He stated, \u201cI don\u2019t like to eat these fishy\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie interrupted before he finished. \u201cI will go see the cook and ask if there is a bowl of porridge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was just casually finding an excuse and didn\u2019t want to trouble this person. Thus, he pulled at Jiang Xie\u2019s hand. \u201cDon\u2019t trouble the people. I will wait and eat some green vegetables.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at the thin hand and frowned. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t feeling well, we will go back first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi patted him on the back of the hand. \u201cRest assured, it doesn\u2019t matter. Today is Huer\u2019s happy day. How can we go back first?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Wang Family took great care of them. How could they miss such an important day?</p><br/><p>The people at the table heard the conversation and were worried, \u201cIf Mr Xie isn\u2019t feeling well\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hurriedly waved his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to this child. He is always making a fuss. How can I be so delicate?\u201d</p><br/><p>The big guys looked at his white porcelain-like face and slender neck. \u2018You don\u2019t look delicate, you might really be delicate!\u2019</p><br/><p>In order to appease Jiang Xie, Xie Xi ate a few green vegetables and only then did the little lion\u2019s tense eyebrows relax.</p><br/><p>Then a handsome girl from the next table came over.</p><br/><p>The tigers poking fun at each other on the table closed their mouths and winked at her.</p><br/><p>The little girl\u2019s face was red and she must be very nervous as she stuttered, \u201cL-L-Little Xie!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie glanced at her. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little girl was afraid to look at him. She left an envelope and fled.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d A love letter???</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie glanced down at the letter in his hand and didn\u2019t know what to do. He looked at Xie Xi and Xie Xi\u2019s liver ached.</p><br/><p>The tigers at the table smiled \u201cOh, Susu likes Little Xie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it more than Susu? The little flower of Old Li also likes him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it Old Sun\u2019s Nini?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Lily as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>The tigers mentioned almost all the school-age girls in the village.</p><br/><p>Finally, someone concluded, \u201cIt seems that our village is going to usher in a lion and tiger beast!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t interfere in the conversation and could only bear it\u2026</p><br/><p>What could he do? If he had a slightly better body then he would seduce Jiang Xie and help him solve the estrus period. However, Xie Xi\u2019s current body really wasn\u2019t enough!</p><br/><p>The people on the table started to discuss the issue of lions and tigers.</p><br/><p>The village was relatively small and none of them had combined with a lion before.</p><br/><p>Still, there were many cases in the big cities. \u201cDon\u2019t be prejudiced. Lion and tiger beasts are very powerful. As long as their parents are strong, the child won\u2019t go wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy second aunt\u2019s classmate is a half lion and tiger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is a half lion and tiger?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis mother is a lion and his father is a tiger. Thus, he is half.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is half a lion and tiger? That is called a lion tiger!\u201d</p><br/><p>The group burst out laughing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s guess was right. There was no reproductive segregation in the world. When Huer\u2019s mother mentioned a lion and tiger beast, Xie Xi thought that if a lion and tiger couldn\u2019t produce offspring together, it wouldn\u2019t be acknowledged and mentioned so happily.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, beasts could become humans so perhaps they all had the same ancestor.</p><br/><p>The customs here were very interesting. The bride was holding flowers in her hand to throw towards the party members.</p><br/><p>It couldn\u2019t be deliberately grabbed and had to be left to fall into a person\u2019s arm. arms.</p><br/><p>The married tigers stated, \u201cRest assured, I will avoid it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their wives sneered. \u201cWhat avoidance? If you marry someone else then it has nothing to do with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The tigers weren\u2019t afraid and sweet talked the women. It was very interesting.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t take it seriously. What should he do if he wanted to marry Jiang Xie?</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t marry this person. Instead, he would kill this idiot!</p><br/><p>Then a shadow flew over and fell steadily into his arms.</p><br/><p>The people on the table laughed. \u201cIt is Mr Xie, Mr Xie lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>The new wife came over and toasted Xie Xi, speaking many auspicious words. Xie Xi reluctantly laughed but he was actually in pain from the flowers.</p><br/><p>Huer\u2019s mother suggested, \u201cSpeaking of which, Mr Xie is still young. Why don\u2019t you find a partner to live with?\u201d They all thought Xie Xi was a widower.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned. What was today? First it was Jiang Xie and now it was him.</p><br/><p>The words of Huer\u2019s mother woke up the group and they started discussing it again.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr Xie is a good man and a master of medicine. The little girls in the village really like him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be a little girl. She should be mature and steady\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They spoke in a similar way and Jiang Xie\u2019s heart inexplicably fell.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi interrupted. \u201cI can\u2019t drag others down with my body.\u201d</p><br/><p>He struggled to raise the flowers in his hand. \u201cThese bunch of flowers alone made me sore when they hit my back. How can\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished when Jiang Xie leaned forward to grab the flowers. \u201cWhere did it hit you? Was it hard?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s body was fine now. It was actually his brain that hurt. He gazed at the worried Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew the situation. To tell the truth, the reason why no one gave Xie Xi a love letter in the past six months was because his body was a big problem.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, with his talent and appearance, it was unknown how many girls would be following him.</p><br/><p>Huer\u2019s mother was worried. \u201cMr Xie, this body\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The people on the table sighed. Xie Xi had healed so many people in the village but unfortunately couldn\u2019t heal himself. It was really regrettable.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to ruin such a happy day. He got up and said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t early. I\u2019ll go back first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at his pale face, the tigers didn\u2019t dare keep him for long.</p><br/><p>Regarding the love letter, Jiang Xie told Xie Xi when the left the banquet, \u201cI have returned it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>What could he say? He could only give a light response.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie glanced at him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to marry someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t want Jiang Xie to marry anyone else!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke again, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about me and should look after your body well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also wanted to keep his body well but he couldn\u2019t!</p><br/><p>The thing he was worried about was coming.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie completely became an adult and couldn\u2019t hide from the estrus period.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had kept an eye on Jiang Xie and could feel it when Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes kept sticking to him.</p><br/><p>However, he had to pretend not to know.</p><br/><p>Adulthood was fine and so was the estrus period. Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t too concerned.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t interested in these love matters. He just wanted to take care of Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>After that, he would travel all over the countries to become stronger before going home to get revenge!</p><br/><p>With this idea, Jiang Xie ushered in the instincts of life.</p><br/><p>It was very abrupt but it seemed natural. When he saw the outside sun resting on Xie Xi and illuminating his transparent skin, Jiang Xie\u2019s heart seemed to burst.</p><br/><p>He always knew Xie Xi was good-looking but had never looked at him like this.</p><br/><p>After all, he was adopted by Xie Xi\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

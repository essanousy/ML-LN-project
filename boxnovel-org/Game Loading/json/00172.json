How could he have no impression of it, not to mention he never had any sleepwalking experience before. Suddenly, he had such a bad habit.</p><br/><p>All doubts came to an abrupt end the moment he saw his current situation.</p><br/><p>The president of the United States, the commander of the armed forces, the supreme commander that all cosmic civilizations adored and respected\u2026</p><br/><p>He was lying underneath Jiang Xie with messy clothes, red cheeks and pale lips moist from a kiss.</p><br/><p>There was a bang and Jiang Xie\u2019s head exploded. Did he kiss Xie Xi? Did he kiss Xie Xi on the lips?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie quickly got up and almost jumped under the bed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw this person crawling and coughed. This was a bit exaggerated. After all, Jiang Xie\u2019s skill was very good and the body lines of the youth were also charming. He was handsome but he couldn\u2019t hide the tragedy of discarding his dignity.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tidied up his pyjamas and sat up to look at this person.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie raised his head and exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Then he rushed into the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tried to endure it and only laughed out loud after the door closed.</p><br/><p>\u2014Too bad, the big Jiang did evil and the little Jiang shouldered the blame.</p><br/><p>However, Little Jiang\u2019s reaction was also very interesting!</p><br/><p>After a long time, the fire on Xie Xi\u2019s side was extinguished while Jiang Xie rushed out of the cold shower.</p><br/><p>This cocky wolf cub wilted and didn\u2019t dare look at Xie Xi. Xie Xi still had some scruples about the young man and no longer scared him. \u201cGo and eat breakfast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie cocked his head and couldn\u2019t help moving away when Xie Xi neared. Xie Xi glanced at him. \u201cWhat are you doing so far away?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMove closer. I\u2019m not a beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, at this time, the president was more terrible for the \u2018little monk\u2019 than a wild beast.</p><br/><p>There were many things happening during the day and Xie Xi didn\u2019t have time to care for him. Jiang Xie was unsettled the whole morning. He finally calmed down only to see the president busy working using the light brain and he started boiling again.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked Secretary Li, \u201cCan I wait outside?\u201d</p><br/><p>Secretary Li was very wary. \u201cYoung Master, you can\u2019t leave the president or he will worry about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps he received a message from Secretary Li because Xie Xi suspended his work. \u201cWhat is it? Are you bored?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t look at him. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi got up and walked over to him. \u201cWould you like to help me do something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was slightly startled and looked up at the tight collar. There was a small red dot near the chin\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stiffly moved his gaze away. Xie Xi told him, \u201cYou are bored staying here so come help me with some documents.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s voice was muffled, \u201cAren\u2019t you worried about me seeing things?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cYou aren\u2019t a child of no importance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyebrows twisted. \u201cI\u2019m not a child.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi deliberately set him up, \u201cHow many rounds have you been through?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie shut up again. Xie Xi didn\u2019t ask again and extended his hand. \u201cCome on, time is urgent. I can do more with your help.\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke lightly but Jiang Xie thought of the current situation and scolded himself. A disaster was coming. How could he still think about these small love matters?</p><br/><p>As a rational person, he should always distinguish between priorities. Jiang Xie didn\u2019t hold this person\u2019s hand and got up. \u201cWhat do I need to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gave a few orders to Secretary Li. Secretary Li looked at Jiang Xie with hesitation. Xie Xi told him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Secretary Li sighed before responding. Xie Xi noticed the subtle facial expressions.</p><br/><p>It was reasonable to be suspicious. Xie Xi\u2019s reasons were sufficient but his closeness to Jiang Xie in the past few days was obvious. Secretary Li was his number one fan and didn\u2019t mention anything. He didn\u2019t even show surprise and knew to be tactful\u2026</p><br/><p>Well, he always felt there was something wrong but Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to know.</p><br/><p>Once people were busy, they didn\u2019t have time to think. Jiang Xie was saved by the tedious work.</p><br/><p>He finally didn\u2019t have to desperately restrain his gaze or worry about wet lips. Finally, he didn\u2019t need to be burnt by an evil fire.</p><br/><p>The two of them were busy at night and once they stopped, Xie Xi felt a huge sense of tiredness.</p><br/><p>The head of the country wasn\u2019t a relaxed job, especially as a leader facing a huge crisis. The burden on him was enormous.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was understanding the information but also making plans.</p><br/><p>This world was desperately trying to save himself while Xie Xi was the \u2018doctor.\u2019 He had to understand the patient\u2019s condition, find the crux and then solve the pain.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare look in an obvious manner and couldn\u2019t fully trust his own confidants. He could only investigate clues about the \u2018god\u2019 in a concealed manner.</p><br/><p>To have a collapsed god, there must first be a god. What exactly was the god?</p><br/><p>There were many beliefs in the United States. The legendary creator, the creator god of the universe\u2026</p><br/><p>There were many people who believed in the first president of the United States, an emotional person who believed in the theory of freedom.</p><br/><p>Yes, the first president of the United States was an emotional person and the first emotional president in history.</p><br/><p>Since then, none of the presidents and even members of the cabinet weren\u2019t emotional.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t society\u2019s discrimination against emotional and rational. It was more that emotional people had a dislike of politics. Going to the civil service was no different from putting them in prison.</p><br/><p>Emotional people advocated freedom, had a wide range of hobbies and pursued all types of beauty throughout their lives. They were poets, writers, romantic artists, etc., but not politicians.</p><br/><p>Rational people didn\u2019t understand them but respected them. Without emotional people, society might become a machine. Thus, even if emotional people didn\u2019t have any real power, they weren\u2019t discriminated against. They were the freest souls of the United States.</p><br/><p>Under these circumstances, the emotional president was very eye-catching. Xie Xi was curious about this person and looked through the information but didn\u2019t find any clues.</p><br/><p>There was his birth date and many life stories but because there were too many things, Xie Xi couldn\u2019t tell which was real.</p><br/><p>There were even a variety of opinions on this person\u2019s name. The only thing Xie Xi could determine was his freedom theory and gender.</p><br/><p>An emotional president who told the United States in a charming voice:</p><br/><p>We are free, independent and don\u2019t accept any restrictions. We aren\u2019t slaves, we aren\u2019t tools, we aren\u2019t puppets without ideas.</p><br/><p>We exist, we are real, we are free from the shackles of destiny. We are reborn citizens of the United States!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi read the manifesto carefully, especially the last sentence.</p><br/><p>Existence, real, shackles of destiny, reborn\u2026 These were worth pondering but it was difficult to locate anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. President\u2026\u201d Secretary Li quietly woke him up.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had fallen asleep in the aircraft. He opened his eyes and spoke to Jiang Xie, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Secretary Li had called Xie Xi on a special channel, which was a tiny communicator placed in his earring.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t say he had been staring at this person for one hour without seeing enough. He gazed out the window and replied, \u201cI also slept for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi chuckled. \u201cYou should sleep well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The words caused the stuffy Little Jiang to have red ears.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had a better spirit after sleeping and asked, \u201cWhat do you want to eat at night?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are tired. You don\u2019t need to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi interrupted him. \u201cMy cooking is a secret. Don\u2019t tell anyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>He suddenly came close, leaning towards Jiang Xie while speaking. Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xie questioned, \u201cDo you hear me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie moved away and hummed like a mosquito. \u201cHmm.\u201d Why didn\u2019t he ask why Xie Xi only cooked for him?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t ask and Xie Xi took the initiative to say it, \u201cI only cook for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Jiang felt like he ascended to heaven and he couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s throat was tight and he couldn\u2019t say anything else. Was Xie Xi really rational? Even if he was emotional, Jiang Xie was afraid there wasn\u2019t such a\u2026 confusing person.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was in a good mood and made a few dishes that Jiang Xie loved to eat while accompanying him for a drink. Once it was time to sleep, Jiang Xie started worrying again.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cIsn\u2019t it just sleepwalking? It won\u2019t happen every day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie nodded and the strong guy went to bed with a stiff wrist.</p><br/><p>Compared to his tenseness, Xie Xi was very comfortable. If he didn\u2019t know, he would think the one being indecently assaulted was Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was tired and soon fell asleep. Before going to bed, he still thought about what to communicate with Jiang Xie in the morning\u2026</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, he wasn\u2019t disturbed and woke up naturally. Xie Xi was still a bit uncomfortable when he opened his eyes. Then he turned and saw Jiang Xie lying flat on the bed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw he was awake and immediately leaned away.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke lazily, \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this situation? Where was Big Jiang? Jiang Xie\u2019s voice was slightly hoarse. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you that you wouldn\u2019t sleepwalk every day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about all the things he had to do today and cried out, \u201cLet\u2019s go to work!\u201d</p><br/><p>Three or four days passed and Xie Xi wasn\u2019t woken up. He was a bit puzzled so on the fifth day, Xie Xi set an alarm clock and deliberately woke up at four in the morning. Sure enough\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at the boy. \u201cYou haven\u2019t slept?\u2019</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t asleep. He didn\u2019t dare close his eyes for four nights. Xie Xi understood what was going on. This person was so afraid of sleepwalking that he didn\u2019t even sleep?</p><br/><p>What sin! Xie Xi felt distressed. \u201cSleep!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had found chances to sleep in the daytime but he was also at his limit. \u201cIf I fall asleep, I will\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what? Who doesn\u2019t have a quirk?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s Adam\u2019s Apple moved. \u201cBut it is too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI don\u2019t mind&gt;\u2019</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s expression slightly dimmed. Indeed, a rational person wouldn\u2019t care about this type of thing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi continued, \u201cI don\u2019t mind if you do something but you are underage, so I\u2019ll stop you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart felt like it was going to jump out of his chest.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was afraid the development was too fast and would scare the other person, so he changed the topic. \u201cThe sleepwalking can be overcome. I will cooperate with you to observe it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie whispered, \u201cOkay.\u201d His voice was so light that it was shaking.</p><br/><p>Normal men would have a little reaction in the morning, especially when it was their sweetheart. Xie Xi was a normal person\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSleep!\u201d Xie Xi rolled the quilt around himself like a cocoon.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was because Jiang Xie was too tired but once he fell asleep, Big Jiang didn\u2019t come out. Xie Xi also followed him into sleep.</p><br/><p>After nearly a week, Big Jiang came out and Xie Xi forbid him from doing any nonsense. The two people hurriedly exchanged some words and pulled away before Little Jiang woke up.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t sleepwalking anymore. Jiang Xie\u2019s worries were removed but he couldn\u2019t help feeling a bit lost. Sleepwalking wasn\u2019t right. It was more like he lost something important\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was repulsed by his own emotions. A rational person wouldn\u2019t be bothered by these things.</p><br/><p>Why wasn\u2019t he a rational? If he was rational then he wouldn\u2019t be obsessed with a man who couldn\u2019t be possessed. Once March arrived at the capital, the Third Institute of the United States brought exhilarating news.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe found the pole!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hurriedly convened a cabinet meeting to analyze the good news. This was one of the United State\u2019s plans to evade the collapse of the universe.</p><br/><p>The universe collapsed from outside to inside, with a very obvious trajectory. If they could calculate this trajectory, there should be a final collapsed pole. This pole was likely to be the birthplace of the new universe.</p><br/><p>As long as the United States could immigrate to the pole, there was a great chance of starting a new life in this new universe.</p><br/><p>They originally thought the pole would be difficult to find but it was found under the efforts of the researchers! The Third Institute\u2019s president couldn\u2019t hide his excitement. \u201cWe still need some data. We have to go to the field to collect it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Minister of Space said, \u201cFrom this location, the fastest airship will take two years to go back and forth. It is difficult to guarantee the data in this timeline.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Third Institute\u2019s president exclaimed, \u201cPeople with an SSS-grade physique can get them in one jump and we can get the data in one month!\u201d</p><br/><p>The size of a starship was too large and there was a limit to its speed. A small starship for a single person could reach unimaginable speeds but the physical requirements for that person were too high.</p><br/><p>The Space Minister hit the table. \u201cAbsurd! At present, only the president has an SSS-grade physique. Do you want the president to collect the data?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The vice president frowned. \u201cAt a time like this, the president can\u2019t leave the Capital Star.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Third Institute\u2019s president frowned. \u201cIt still isn\u2019t possible to contact Mr. Jiang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi captured this detail. Mr. Jiang?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe former president has cut all ties with the cabinet since he left office. We suspect that he has been reincarnated.\u201d The Intelligence Minister replied.</p><br/><p>Mr. Jiang was the former president? Xie Xi really hadn\u2019t discovered this information.</p><br/><p>At this time, Jiang Xie\u2019s clear voice was heard. \u201cI also have an SSS-grade physique.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

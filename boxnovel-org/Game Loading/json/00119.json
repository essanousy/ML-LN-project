In fact, speaking loudly was fine since this was more like a playback.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie deliberately leaned close to Xie Xi and whispered. \u201cNo, you\u2019re the cute one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie patched up a bit of his brain. \u201cWhat did you look like when you were a child?\u201d</p><br/><p>He must\u2019ve been the loveliest baby in the world.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi laughed. \u201cTeacher, this carries a minimum of a three years prison sentence or the maximum death penalty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Teacher Jiang winked. \u201cWhat are you thinking, little friend? I only have a fatherly heart towards the underage you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi unceremoniously dismantled him. \u201cFatherly? What damn father?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough\u2026\u201d Jiang Xie cleared his throat.\u201dBaby, you have a deep misunderstanding of me. I think it is necessary for us to talk in depth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t adapted to this messy name even after 60 years and cried out, \u201cDon\u2019t call me that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes Dear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi raised his eyebrows and glared at him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie compromise. \u201cI was wrong. We are married and I\u2019m your legal husband. I should call you\u2026 wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shouted angrily, \u201cIf you want to see me leave then keep calling me that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had no lower limit but had to say, \u201cOkay, you are my husband.\u201d It was still marriage!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he would\u2019ve lost, Xie Xi would\u2019ve killed him by now! The green 999 goodwill became 998.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie instantly sobered up while his heart dripped blood like a boss experiencing a 50 billion yuan loss.</p><br/><p>He tried to turn the tide by making a pair of shining silver things appear in his palm.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was staring at the plot when he felt something cold on his ring finger. He looked down and froze.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked, \u201cCan you help me put it on?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a pair of rings. The larger one was engraved with Xie Xi\u2019s name while the smaller one had Jiang Xie\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at it while the tip of his nose became sour. This pair of rings was bought by Xie Xi and were their wedding rings. He and Jiang Xie and engraved the words together, doing their best to write each other\u2019s name on the ring.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t taken it off for 60 years and Jiang Xie was the same.</p><br/><p>Until the end of their lives, this pair of rings were worn on their fingers. Their bodies turned into dead bones but these rings, engraved with the names of the two people, always shone beautifully.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at the ring and wondered, \u201cIs there a rope?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHrmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi repeated, \u201cA rope.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie took out a thin black rope.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glared at him. \u201cOne more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie took out another one and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cCan\u2019t you wear the ring on your finger?\u201d</p><br/><p>He lost a goodwill point. Did the child not want to stay with him forever? Jiang Xie didn\u2019t lose 50 billion yuan. It felt like he was bankrupt and owed 50 billion yuan.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi ignored him and carefully put the ring on the black rope, placing a fixed bar to prevent it from slipping. Jiang Xie was opening his mouth again when Xie Xi interrupted. \u201cCome over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie hesitantly didn\u2019t move. Xie Xi felt amused and angrily as he got up and tied the black rope with the ring around Jiang Xie\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie reluctantly said, \u201cThis is a ring. Why do you want to make it a neckla\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi handed the black rope to him. \u201cHelp me put it on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d He honestly helped Xie Xi while taking the opportunity to touch his white neck.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s body trembled slightly and he shifted his gaze. \u201cOkay, watch the plot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at the black line again the fair skin. \u201cThis isn\u2019t suitable as a necklace. I have\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared straight ahead. \u201cIt was a game.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart throbbed. The tip of Xie Xi\u2019s ears were slightly red but he spoke earnestly, \u201cDon\u2019t you want a real wedding?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt that his entire body was boiling and gulped. \u201cI mean\u2026 we\u2026 well\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t speak because Jiang Xie kissed him. How could he endure this? How could this be endured? Jiang Xie felt that if he didn\u2019t do anything, he would be stimulated until he was sick.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had given him a proper stimulation and couldn\u2019t push him away\u2026 he also didn\u2019t want to push it away.</p><br/><p>After wearing the ring on the black rope, Xie Xi stared carefully. It was their rings and Jiang Xie had completely restored them. Even the most subtle scratches and the way it adjusted to the shape of their fingers after many years were still there.</p><br/><p>60 years, it was like looking back on their past. Xie Xi had many things he couldn\u2019t remember but he remembered every moment with Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>The appearance of Xie Su, his childhood memories and the cold and lonely nights had all become faint. The nightmare he was entangled with had long disappeared without a trace due to Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to understand the whole Jiang Xie and he also wanted Jiang Xie to understand the new Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>This pair of rings was a dream of the past and they had an infinite future.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie released Xie Xi and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll go now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi covered his mouth and exclaimed, \u201cI haven\u2019t graduated yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie blinked. Xie Xi spoke helplessly, \u201cDo you want to be with me for a day or\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be born from age to age.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes curved. \u201cThen we should know more about each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t Professor Jiang and I\u2019m not your student.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had understood each other for 60 years in the dream but that was the Jiang Xie and Xie Xi in the dream.</p><br/><p>In reality, Jiang Xie was a designer with \u2018eternal life\u2019 and Xie Xi was a beginner collector.</p><br/><p>The gap was so big. How could they be together? Hadn\u2019t Xie Xi always been dependent on Jiang Xie? Xie Xi couldn\u2019t allow that. Being needed without losing himself, he knew exactly what he wanted. It was walking side by side and mutually supporting each other for a long time.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart was a soft mess as he whispered, \u201cOkay, I am waiting for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he grew up and became stable, they would be together for a long time. Xie Xi put it out of his mind right now. He turned his head away with embarrassment. \u201cDon\u2019t disturb me from watching the plot!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie nodded. \u201cI won\u2019t disturb you.\u201d</p><br/><p>His big hand stretched out like a thief. Xie Xi wanted to take it off but Jiang Xie had already clasped their fingers together.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He allowed his hand to be held.</p><br/><p>The plot of the sun and moon wasn\u2019t a continuation of when they departed from the world but an earlier time.</p><br/><p>The open world did have residents who were normal humans. They weren\u2019t developed in science and technology and were a farming society.</p><br/><p>At this time, the sun was an adult and the moon was a child. It was unknown how they were born but they contained a powerful force.</p><br/><p>To be precise, the sun had a powerful force.</p><br/><p>At first, he only helped a group of people who were going to starve to death. The moon was unhappy and thought he was meddling.</p><br/><p>The sun just smiled and kissed his forehead. \u201cI\u2019m just helping them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moon frowned and told him, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be troublesome.\u201d The sun told him, \u201cYou can\u2019t be so indifferent.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moon didn\u2019t overdo it. \u201cHmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sun hugged the little moon in his arms. \u201cOkay, Big Brother won\u2019t care about them. Shall I just stay with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little moon grabbed his clothes and spoke disdainfully. \u201cYou aren\u2019t my older brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sun told him, \u201cYes, you were born earlier than me. Shall I call you Big Brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little moon looked at his hand and then the sun\u2019s big size. \u201cHow are you so big?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sun poked him in his small chest. \u201cWho told you to be so picky and not eat well? That\u2019s why you\u2019re not growing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little moon held his finger and exclaimed, \u201cYou grew too fast!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sun smiled but there was a faint hint of worry in his eyes.</p><br/><p>They were born together but the moon always maintained the body of a young child and showed no signs of growing up. The sun didn\u2019t know the reason but he was really worried. He had left the Holy Land to find the cause.</p><br/><p>The little moon frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t like it here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s look again. Once it is boring, we\u2019ll go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little moon was silent and lay quietly in his arms.</p><br/><p>The two brothers were actually very simple. In particular, the sun had a \u2018divine power\u2019 but also a friendly personality. He soon attracted a group of people.</p><br/><p>The moon\u2019s personality was cold and didn\u2019t like to talk to people. However, people didn\u2019t care because he was just a child and they circled around the sun.</p><br/><p>At first, the sun only helped them a bit. Then more and more people came and the help became more troublesome.</p><br/><p>The little moon scolded, \u201cThey can build a house on their own. Why are they asking for your help with everything?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sun replied, \u201cIt takes them a few months to build a house while I can do it in a day.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little moon said, \u201cSo what? While you\u2019re building it, they\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce I come back, I\u2019ll bring you some sugar to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little moon hugged his chest. \u201cI won\u2019t eat!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sun suggested, \u201cTwo?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moon, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little moon shouted, \u201cGet out of here!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sun left and the little moon stayed inside the house. He was afraid to go out. Since the sun wasn\u2019t here, he couldn\u2019t even leave the room.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t want to go out, it was that he couldn\u2019t. The light outside was so great that he would be burned without the sun.</p><br/><p>The little moon was bored in the house. Whenever he heard a bit of movement, he would stand up to look and then be disappointed when he didn\u2019t see anyone.</p><br/><p>After waiting a long time, he slept with the quilt in his arms and then the sun came back.</p><br/><p>The little moon\u2019s eyes brightened and his lips curved. However, he had a straight face once the sun entered. \u201cYou are so noisy when coming back, you woke me up from my sleep!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, his face was too soft to frighten people.</p><br/><p>The sun smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll take a shower first.\u201d He was dirty and afraid the little moon wouldn\u2019t be happy.</p><br/><p>The little moon didn\u2019t like looking at his back since he always felt the sun would leave again. The small moon was very panicked but bit his lower lip and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>After a while, the sun came back with three candies.</p><br/><p>The little moon told him, \u201cI don\u2019t like this type of thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sun said, \u201cIt is very sweet. I had them wrap it with extra sugar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like sugar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to eat\u2026\u201d The sun asked, \u201cShall I eat it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little moon grabbed the sugar. \u201cThis is mine. I will throw it away but I won\u2019t give it to you to eat!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sun smiled, \u201cOkay, don\u2019t eat too much. It won\u2019t last long.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was unknown which pot was opened but the little moon bit the sun\u2019s arms. \u201cI will eat you once I grow up!\u201d</p><br/><p>The little moon often bit him when losing his temper. The sun wasn\u2019t hurt at all and was just afraid of the teeth falling out.</p><br/><p>The next day, the sun went out early in the morning and tried to coax the little moon with candy again, only for the moon to shout angrily, \u201cIf you go then don\u2019t come back!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sun explained, \u201cThere\u2019s always something hanging around the woods lately. I have to check it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little moon asked, \u201cWhy is it your business? That thing can\u2019t hurt us!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sun stated, \u201cThe town is finished if it comes out.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little moon wondered, \u201cWhy does it matter if it is finished? We can just return to the Holy Land.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sun told him, \u201cIt will kill a lot of people.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little moon was speechless.</p><br/><p>The sun left and the little moon looked at the two remaining pieces of candy with anger.</p><br/><p>\u2018It will kill a lot of people\u2026 so what? You haven\u2019t slept for a long time.\u2019</p><br/><p>The little moon woke up again when he heard movement from afar. He thought the sun was back and jumped out of the bed with joy, only to find it was a few strangers.</p><br/><p>He was stunned and could perfectly hear the low voices.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it that child?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we take him away, we can really make the sun go to our city?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, he might be a god but even he has a soft spot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce we take his son away, the sun won\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can we tie him up? We are just taking him to play. He is a little kid and is easy to trick.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If he was going to buy clothes, why mention how hot the house was?</p><br/><p>Aix-en explained, \u201cI mean that the house is hot so you won\u2019t be cold staying here. I will go out and buy clothes for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It sounded reasonable but there was still the taste of something being covered up.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi filled up his progress as he said, \u201cIt is already troublesome for you. Don\u2019t spend any money. I\u2019ll just wear it like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en said, \u201cMy clothes aren\u2019t suitable for you to wear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe pants aren\u2019t suitable but the shirt is good. Since the room isn\u2019t cold, I will wear it like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en froze.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi let go of the belt and the pants fell down with a clatter. He came out with bare legs, carefully picked up the pants, folded it and gave it to Aix-en.</p><br/><p>Aix-en only recovered after a while. He took the pants and turned his head quickly, \u201cThe cow\u2026 the milk is hot. Drink it carefully.\u201d Then he left with the pants.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at the lower right corner and was very satisfied with the rising purple progress. Sure enough, he had to use the trick of saving money to deal with the second prince and the progress would rise quickly.</p><br/><p>Was that really the case? Wasn\u2019t it because he only wore a shirt and his bare legs were too attractive?</p><br/><p>In front of the curtain, Jiang Xie stood up suddenly and his high-backed chair shook.</p><br/><p>He clocked on the address book. [Old Qin.]</p><br/><p>Qin Ge appeared directly in the garden and asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked, \u201cWhat level is your equivalent exchange?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ge replied, \u201cIntermediate. The experience is just over 50%.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a prefecture level task. Let\u2019s team up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tasks about the SSS grade had a hierarchy. There was prefecture level, heavenly level and holy level.</p><br/><p>Qin Ge was slightly surprised. \u201cYou aren\u2019t\u2026\u201d Jiang Xie had been staying in the garden for a while, concentrating on the only child who chose him. Why was he suddenly leaving for a task?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cI will help you raise the level of your equivalent exchange.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ge still didn\u2019t understand. \u201cWhat are you going to do with it?\u2019</p><br/><p>This skill was very evil. It seemed to be able to do everything but in fact, nothing could be done. The so-called equivalent exchange actually wasn\u2019t equivalent. The person often paid far more than what was exchanged.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie said, \u201cI want to team up with him in the next world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ge, \u201c\u2026\u201d This was definitely due to the child. Jiang Xie\u2019s current strength was so high that the Zone forbid him from entering lower quasi-worlds. The highest world he designed was SS so he couldn\u2019t enter worlds that were lower than SS-grade.</p><br/><p>Of course, the rules were dead and people were alive. As long as they wanted to do it, they could, although there would be some losses.</p><br/><p>Equivalent exchange could theoretically exchange anything, as long as the price was paid.</p><br/><p>If Jiang Xie wanted to go to a lower quasi-world, he could indeed do it with equivalent exchange. However, the trap regarding this skill was that the price paid was random.</p><br/><p>Even Qin Ge had no control over it. Thus, he rarely used this skill.</p><br/><p>Qin Ge reminded him, \u201cIs it worth it? The price won\u2019t be small if you want to enter a lower quasi-world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst upgrade the skill. Then I will study its mechanisms.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ge didn\u2019t say anything else. He had known Old Jiang a long time and understood his personality.</p><br/><p>If the person who made the request was Yan Zhe then Qin Ge wouldn\u2019t care. However, Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t the same. For many years, this man had been bold, courageous and the most reliable person.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew that he had taken off his pants (he didn\u2019t know) and gave someone a sense of emergency.</p><br/><p>He was just trying to act thrifty to fill up the purple progress. Wearing only a shirt might sound unseemly but it was actually okay.</p><br/><p>The second prince imagined him too small. This shirt was the basic type that should be stuffed into the waistband. The hem was long so it looked like a nightgown when he wore it. It wasn\u2019t a big problem.</p><br/><p>Aix-en finished putting away the pants and returned to see that Xie Xi was washing his clothes.</p><br/><p>Aix-en told him, \u201cPut it away. An auntie will come by later and wash it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. If I wash it now, I can wear it tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en didn\u2019t say anything and just praised Xie Xi in his heart. This feedback was transmitted to Xie Xi through the progress bar flashing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered if it would\u2019ve gone up more if he hand washed it instead of using the washing machine.</p><br/><p>Forget it, there was a washing machine so there was no need for hand washing. Thrifty was thrifty but he couldn\u2019t have a stupid head.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi put the clothes in and sat quietly on the couch. He thought for a moment. He had just divorced so he should be sad. Thus, he started to stare blankly.</p><br/><p>Aix-en said, \u201cYou are like this and it isn\u2019t convenient for us to go out to eat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t bother. I\u201dm not hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en sighed and sat across from him. \u201cWhat happened between the two of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also wanted to know what happened between him and the third prince. How did they get married? Why did they get divorced? Why did he have to go to the \u2018sister\u2019 and take off his pants for the night?</p><br/><p>Aix-en should know the answer better than anyone else!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s brow furrowed as he replied, \u201cIt is probably because I am too annoying that Gars can\u2019t stand it anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe grew up spoiled and has a bit of a temper. You have to work hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t think that the third prince was spoiled but this was the second prince\u2019s dream. However, this was the second prince\u2019s dream and the third prince was always at ease!</p><br/><p>\u201cHe and I are from two different worlds\u2026\u201d Xie Xi paused and spoke in a mortified manner, \u201cI\u2019m different from you. My family is very ordinary and I\u2019ve always been frugal. I can\u2019t learn this luxurious lifestyle.\u201d This should be in line with the second prince\u2019s thoughts!</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Aix-en frowned. \u201cWhat luxurious life? It is nothing but extravagance!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke softly, \u201cGars said that his money is endless. I am too thrifty and don\u2019t fit him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMoney is endless?\u201d Aix-en didn\u2019t have a good atmosphere. \u201cIs there still endless money in this age? He only knows how to eat, drink and play. He doesn\u2019t know the value of money. Doesn\u2019t he know there are people who can\u2019t even eat food!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was dejected.</p><br/><p>Aix-en glanced at him and felt pained. \u201cDid you argue because of these things?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cI talked too much because I cared too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe should have someone take charge of his bad habits.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cThe bottom line is that I\u2019m not suitable for him. Our thoughts are too different. I\u2019m really not poor. I just think that money shouldn\u2019t be squandered. It shouldn\u2019t be spent completely or we will become a prisoner of money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heartfelt words were enough to make the purple progress bar rise by 3%.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare look up for fear of being caught.</p><br/><p>Aix-en acknowledged his words and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t fit but that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t deserve him. He is the one who doesn\u2019t deserve you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Well, he was right about that.</p><br/><p>Aix-en asked him again, \u201cWhat are you going to do in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGars didn\u2019t like me working so I quit my job after we got married. Now I have to find a job again and rent a room.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you can stay with me first and wait for things to stabilize before finding another house.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi quickly said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t good\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en wondered, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Even if you\u2019re not Gars\u2019 lover anymore, we are still friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned his head and said, \u201cThen I can\u2019t live here for free. I will pay you rent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en\u2019s eyes were full of tenderness. \u201cMy house is already empty and it isn\u2019t a waste to have one more person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay here for free.\u201d Xie Xi refuted. \u201cHowever, I have no money now and can only owe you first. I will cook and do housework so I don\u2019t trouble you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cCan you cook?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was slightly nervous. \u201cOnly some handmade dishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. I don\u2019t like to eat outside and am too impatient to invite people to cook. It is too convenient if you can cook.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt probably doesn\u2019t taste that good\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe food will be very good.\u201d Aix-en told him, \u201cThen don\u2019t mention rent. I will be in a good mood as long as you cook the meals.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi got up and said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll go prepare dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hurriedly shook his head. \u201cNo, I can do it myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Aix-en didn\u2019t follow. He didn\u2019t dare look at Xie Xi since the white legs exposed under the shirt were too eye-catching.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could cook because he lived alone all the time. He couldn\u2019t starve to death.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t hate cooking. The fact that he could prepare a hearty dinner for himself was the best reward he gave himself.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi quite liked the second prince\u2019s kitchen. It was very clean and the decorations were simple. There wasn\u2019t anything that shouldn\u2019t be there.</p><br/><p>He fried a few dishes and placed them on the table.</p><br/><p>Aix-en was an underwater fish and only tasted a handful of land dishes. He was surprised by the taste and exclaimed, \u201cDelicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at the progress bar and laughed. \u201cIt is just decent food.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too modest.\u201d Aix-en added, \u201cIt\u2019s very tasty. I\u2019ve never eaten a dish like this before.\u201d</p><br/><p>The underwater people were obsessed with sashimi. They could be a rival for an empire of big eaters.</p><br/><p>By the end of the meal, the purple progress bar had soared to 13% and Xie Xi was in a good mood.</p><br/><p>Aix-en glanced at Xie Xi and whispered, \u201cNo wonder why Gars was desperate to marry you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t hear it. He turned around and asked, \u201cHrmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Rest early and I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. He didn\u2019t think he had a chance to sleep. He had used Dreaming many times and understood that time in the dream was determined by the dreamer. One night would flash past in an instant.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was still tidying up the table when the image changed and he was buying food in the supermarket.</p><br/><p>Aix-en wondered, \u201cWill this type of hard thing be tasty?\u201d He was referring to a potato.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi froze at this jump before saying, \u201cIt is delicious. There are many different ways to cook it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en stared at the price. \u201cThese potatoes are so cheap.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suppressed a smile. \u201cIt has a large yield and is practical to eat. It is a very cost-effective crop.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en mused, \u201cIf the crescent fruit can also be so cheap\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pretended not to hear. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing. Tonight we will eat potatoes.\u201d Okay.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to buy some ingredients for beef stew. Then he thought about how cheap this person was and gave up that idea. He intended to directly make salt and pepper potato nuggets.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Aix-en ate the pure potatoes and praised, \u201cIt is really delicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi silently added, \u2018It is also cheap.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was joking and sighed emotionally. \u2018The second prince isn\u2019t stingy. His heart is just too big. He was always thinking about the common people.</p><br/><p>It seemed that many days passed. Xie Xi cooked for the second prince every day. They were homemade dishes made out of crops with large yields.</p><br/><p>On this day, Xie Xi baked a sweet potato and the second prince tasted the sweet honey-like taste. \u201cVery delicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cThis is a sweet potato. The sugar content in red soil is high.\u201d It was estimated that there was a filter bonus. His cooking was actually very ordinary but he became a food expert in the second prince\u2019s dream. Every dish was amazing.</p><br/><p>Aix-en said, \u201cYou should keep making this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t hungry and just watched Aix-en eat.</p><br/><p>Aix-en glanced at him. \u201cAren\u2019t you eating?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had been eating constantly. How could he be hungry?</p><br/><p>He stared at Aix-en and suddenly said, \u201cYou and Gars are brothers but you are completely different. You have so much wealth. Why do you live so sparingly?\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, Xie Xi felt he should ask this but he really wanted to ask.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know what Aix-en did in the dream but in reality, Aix-en was the prince of an empire. He stood at the peak of power and wealth yet he was so frugal that even his brothers laughed at him.</p><br/><p>Aix-en actually answered him. \u201cIt is only by living this way that you can know the value of each piece of money. Experience it in real life and do things in a practical way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned.</p><br/><p>Princes were born in the royal family, surrounded by many flowers. They were golden spoons who were unaware of human suffering.</p><br/><p>Was such a person suitable to be the minister of finance of an empire? Was it appropriate for him to be in charge of other people\u2019s livelihood? Would the people think of it as a blessing?</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t suitable. Thus, Aix-en walked out of the flowers, put down the golden spoon and lived a restrained life in order to be down to earth.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled.</p><br/><p>Aix-en opened his mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll do the dishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He got up and went to get the plates on the table. Aix-en was also grabbing them and their fingers touched.</p><br/><p>The look in Aix-en\u2019s eyes became deeper.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was full of the \u2018people\u2019s livelihood\u2019 and forgot about their messy relationship. At least, until Aix-en held his hand.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up at him. Aix-en stared at him and whispered, \u201cColin, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a bang as the plate landed on the ground. Xie Xi was certain that he hadn\u2019t let go yet the plate was broken!</p><br/><p>He bent over to pick up the plate. He was even more certain that his fingers weren\u2019t cut by the fragments of the plate yet they were bleeding! It also didn\u2019t hurt at all!</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d The distressed Aix-en grabbed his finger and helped stop the bleeding.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them were very close. Aix-en didn\u2019t let go of Xie Xi, instead clasping one hand around his waist, eyes blazing. \u201cIf I had earlier\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, the front door opened and Gars voice was heard. \u201cBrother, are you home. I haven\u2019t eaten you. You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He pushed open the door and saw the two people\u2019s intimate posture.</p><br/><p>One was his brother and the other was his ex-husband.</p><br/><p>They were so close that his lover seemed stuck in the tall man\u2019s eyes, their heads raised like they were kissing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

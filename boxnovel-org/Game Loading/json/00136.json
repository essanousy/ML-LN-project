Xie Xi had liver pain.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon saw that Xie Xi didn\u2019t say anything and his eyes darkened.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was sensitive and instantly caught the signal. He just managed to coax the dragon and would cry if this was reversed!</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Xie Xi agreed. \u201cIt should be made clear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon\u2019s expression relaxed. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be delayed. Let\u2019s go now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d Why so anxious?</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hurriedly answered, \u201cI will go to Vermilion Bird Palace by myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will accompany you so I can make it clear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Four was very difficult to fool! It was fortunate that Jiang Xie brought the humanoid hanger on \u2018Jiang Xie\u2019 with him to be used here.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cYes, let\u2019s go together and say it face to face. I believe he will be able to understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy so urgent?\u201d</p><br/><p>The dragon\u2019s eyes sunk again. Xie Xi told him, \u201cHow can I feel assured going anywhere with you like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon thought about his pain and took a deep breath, releasing it and taking another deep breath\u2026</p><br/><p>Regardless of whether he was releasing or taking a breath, he was thinking about Xie Xi\u2019s words. Xie Xi couldn\u2019t bear to scold him and had to coax him. \u201cIn any case, take a break and don\u2019t worry about this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon held his hand, his quiet voice containing a distressed tremor. \u201c\u2026Go and tell him clearly, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s chest was stabbed and he couldn\u2019t help feeling angry. Why bother\u2026 why worry himself like this and why hold onto a person who betrayed and deceived him?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cVermilion Bird is currently unconscious right now. What can we say to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Xie Xi suggested softly. \u201cOnce the day is bright, how about we go to Vermilion Bird Palace together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon was finally persuaded. \u201cWe will go at daybreak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon released some of his worries. Azure Dragon\u2019s sleeping quarters were partitioned with a screen. They were in the room while people were guarding outside.</p><br/><p>It couldn\u2019t be helped. Azure Dragon\u2019s physical condition was so poor that they couldn\u2019t leave him alone with Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t in a hurry to see Jiang Xie. The most important thing was to make Azure Dragon emotionally stable.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon questioned, \u201cHave you eaten dinner yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you not eat? Your hungry body\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi interrupted his words. \u201cYou feel bad just because I\u2019m hungry. You are suffering from broken bones all day so how can I not feel bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon froze and flames seemed to burn in his indigo eyes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI am already very upset that you gave up your cultivation. If you suffer all day long, how can I bear it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi increased the sugar to the peak. \u201cYou like me and I like you as well. Thanks to our different statuses, you paid to be with me. We will face it together hand in hand rather than one person infinitely accommodating the other.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon\u2019s heart almost jumped out and a thousand words rushed to his lips, although none were spoken. He felt that anything he said would be inferior to Xie Xi\u2019s words. Every word settled in his heart and was deeply rooted.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi whispered, \u201cCan you tell me about your injuries?\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon paused.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI might not be able to help but I want to know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon\u2019s thin lips slowly moved. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to their nonsense. It isn\u2019t so exaggerated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how is it in the end? What happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon was unable to dissuade him and spoke evasively.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart bled at the words. \u201cYour scales are falling off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as there is no interference, surviving for 300 years won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was necessary to bear the pain for 300 years! Xie Xi\u2019s expression was serious. \u201cCan I look at your body?\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi insisted. \u201cI want to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will scare you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I only like you for your skin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon was startled and his eyelids drooped in an attempt to cover up his stirring emotions.</p><br/><p>He whispered, \u201cIt isn\u2019t convenient here. Wait\u2026 until we go to an empty place.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was true. Azure Dragon\u2019s body was so big that if he hastily turned, this small room would probably become a mess.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to see his body because of the Repair technique. \u201cDid you collect the scales that fell off?\u201d</p><br/><p>The scales were treasures so they were naturally collected. Azure Dragon nodded.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi relaxed. \u201cI will try to fix it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon was startled. Xie Xi explained about what he did with the rose family. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can repair your scales but I would like to try\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon wondered, \u201cYou said you repaired the injured roses\u2026 is it repair?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi remembered the old rose had said the flower god had repaired the scales of the dragon and nodded. \u201cYes, it was repairing. There had to be the petals or it wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon stared at him with complicated eyes. \u201cRepairing is the ability of the flower god.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard from the chief.\u201d</p><br/><p>The dragon asked, \u201cSince when did you obtain this ability?\u201d Xie Xi replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know clearly. After returning to Rose Mountain, I was unconscious for a while and then found myself able to fix some things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon frowned and whispered, \u201cWhy do you have the power of the flower god?\u201d</p><br/><p>He suddenly said, \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon got up too fast and seemed to pull at his wounds. Xie Xi quickly helped him and Azure Dragon took his hand. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was anxious and wanted to repair the scales right away.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon took him to the back room where Xie Xi rested previously. The outside followers also followed and still waited outside the screen. They were confidants of Azure Dragon and Azure Dragon didn\u2019t avoid them.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi once again saw the painting of the dragon\u2019s lonely back.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon questioned, \u201cCan you see anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was surprised. \u201cCan\u2019t you see it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon\u2019s pupils shrank. \u201cI can only see blank paper.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi blinked and sounded very certain. \u201cThis is a painting of the flower festival. In the painting, you are slowly walking away.\u201d He didn\u2019t describe the scene of the dragon gradually entering darkness.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon glanced at the painting and explained, \u201cThis is a part of the god\u2019s wisdom that only the flower god can read.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi instantly understood.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just a rose flower\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon shook his head. \u201cNobody knows what the body of the flower god is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke again, \u201cI don\u2019t have any memories of being a god.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have the ability of the flower god.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know the flower god?\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon replied, \u201cI was injured during the promotion to a sage and he treated me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him. \u201cDo you want me to be the flower god?\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon was stunned for a moment and then spoke when he recovered. \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t matter who you are. I just gave you the name of the flower god in the hope that you can live an extra 100 years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon was in a better mood and he repeated Xie Xi\u2019s words. \u201cDo I only like your skin?\u201d Xie Xi glanced at him and pretended to be sour. \u201cI\u2019m just a rose flower inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the best rose under the sun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was sweet but he still said, \u201cI\u2019m not as good as the flower god.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon hugged him. \u201cYou are wonderful and no one can match you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was just pretending to be jealous. He thought that in this quasi-world setting, he was likely the flower god. As for why he was reduced to a small rose, it was estimated that there was a reason.</p><br/><p>Perhaps the answer was in the god\u2019s wisdom.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cCan I look at this god\u2019s wisdom again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi walked over and placed a hand on it. This time, there was no special reaction. He didn\u2019t enter the painting but he found that something was flashing in the darkness of the painting.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi reached out and\u2026</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon pulled him away.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s senses returned. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon\u2019s eyebrows furrowed. \u201cYou just\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t describe the feeling. It was as if Xie Xi was far away from him and couldn\u2019t be touched.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m just tired all of a sudden. We should go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared into his eyes and replied, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>They returned to the front room with indescribable thoughts in their head.</p><br/><p>Only the flower god could understand the god\u2019s wisdom and the god\u2019s wisdom recorded everything in the mountains and seas.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood that what he saw was only a part of his encounter with Azure Dragon. It was very one-sided and short.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared a the dark paint, thoughts flashing in his mind. Did all this already happen and was recorded by the god\u2019s wisdom, or were things recorded in the god\u2019s wisdom bound to happen?</p><br/><p>If it was just a recording then it was fine. Then again, if it was only a record, how could the god\u2019s wisdom document everything?</p><br/><p>Everything represented the past and future.</p><br/><p>The god\u2019s wisdom that could record the future gave Xie Xi a strong feeling of discomfort.</p><br/><p>It might\u2019ve been reduced to a \u2018love game\u2019 once he entered Jiang Xie\u2019s world but it was undeniable that a high-order quasi-world had its own independent core.</p><br/><p>If Xie Xi hadn\u2019t entered the quasi-world, what would the clearance mission be like?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help thinking about it, not just because he needed to clear the world. He also wanted to understand Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>The quasi-worlds that Jiang Xie designed had his countless efforts and emotions poured into them.</p><br/><p>Just like reading a book written by the author, Xie Xi wanted to go between the lines and see the Jiang Xie hidden in them.</p><br/><p>To love someone wasn\u2019t a one-sided effort but a mutual understanding and tolerance.</p><br/><p>It was getting along forever.</p><br/><p>Of course\u2026</p><br/><p>He fell in love with a wild horse and there were all pits between the lines! He gingerly walked a bumpy road and wanted to tear this book apart!</p><br/><p>At dawn, Azure Dragon was full of energy. \u201cLet\u2019s go to Vermilion Bird Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Okay, it was time to stop hiding and make the two people feel at ease.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

How could the young Jiang Xie in front of him give off such an indifferent and cold feeling?</p><br/><p>Despite the sun shining, it was completely cold and chilly.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t forget about his strangeness. He raised his head and cried out, \u201cJiang Xie?\u201d but he only let out an embarrassing meow.</p><br/><p>How did he become a cat? Roast Pork Bun couldn\u2019t come out. How did he become Roast Pork Bun?</p><br/><p>A bit of temperature filled Jiang Xie\u2019s cold eyes as he patted Xie Xi\u2019s little head. \u201cSo dirty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt incredible dislike and it was fortunate that Cat Xie couldn\u2019t speak. Jiang Xie saw the drooping cat ears and smiled lightly. \u201cYou are so dirty that no one would want to raise you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi muttered, \u201cThere is no need for people to raise me.\u201d The sound was a pathetic meow.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t say anything else and held him. Xie Xi was quite concerned. Was he really that dirty? He bowed his head and only saw a pair of small paws.</p><br/><p>He seemed to be a black and white cat? The front paws were regular white gloves while the other fur was black. Just based on these little paws\u2026 well, he was pretty dirty.</p><br/><p>After all, he was a stray cat chased by wild dogs. It was normal to be dirty.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t adapted to the cat\u2019s body yet so it was quite comfortable for Jiang Xie to hold him. He used this chance to look around.</p><br/><p>They were walking along a small riverside path. The wind in early spring was still cold from winter and the trees by the river were dry. It seemed that hadn\u2019t yet woken up from a deep winter sleep.</p><br/><p>Naturally, there was no ice on the river. It was just that the water wasn\u2019t too clear and the flow was very slow. It was a type of river that every city would try to control but this wouldn\u2019t last long.</p><br/><p>There was a ramp on the left side of the trail and a road above. Vehicles passed by and the traffic wasn\u2019t blocked at all since it wasn\u2019t the peak period.</p><br/><p>It was around 10 o\u2019clock in the morning? Cat Xie looked up at the sun. If the teenage Jiang Xie was wearing a watch on his wrist then Xie Xi could directly tell the time.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that Jiang Xie looked very plain. Forget a watch, even the clothes were white from being washed too much. It seemed that Aries\u2019 situation wasn\u2019t too good?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t clear about it but it didn\u2019t matter. Xie Xi would definitely let him live well and have a blessed life.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could do such a little thing. Wait\u2026 Xie Xi became aware of a serious question. Could he really paint in the god\u2019s wisdom with his cat paws? He was afraid that he couldn\u2019t even hold the pen!</p><br/><p>The only golden finger couldn\u2019t be used. Don\u2019t talk about raising the teenager, Cat Xie might end up being the one raised.</p><br/><p>Well, don\u2019t be discouraged. It was best to wait and try it. Who said that cats couldn\u2019t draw? The paws might not work but he had his mouth. Couldn\u2019t he hold the pen with it? This problem wasn\u2019t big!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi still had some doubts about the scene in front of him. He agreed to the light group\u2019s invitation and entered the light group.</p><br/><p>Was the light group a boundary? Then the 12 light groups were 12 boundaries? Was this the structure of the world?</p><br/><p>What was he supposed to do after entering here? The true spirit must be Jiang Xie so had he found it?</p><br/><p>Of course not.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t in a hurry. He had done a few tasks and understood that anxiety wouldn\u2019t solve the problem. The clues needed to be gradually discovered.</p><br/><p>In this mood, Aries took him to an apartment. Xie Xi glanced around and found that the community\u2019s environment wasn\u2019t bad. It was much better than Xie Xi\u2019s previous home.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie used his access control card and went upstairs after walking through a neat garden.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Jiang Xie didn\u2019t take the elevator but walked straight up the stairs. Fortunately, there were only four floors. The youth\u2019s legs were fast and his breathing wasn\u2019t messed up at all.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t expect Aries to love sports. Sure enough, he was energetic inside despite looking indifferent on the surface.</p><br/><p>Later, Xie Xi knew that Jiang Xie didn\u2019t take the elevator purely because he didn\u2019t want to meet people.</p><br/><p>Inside the house, Xie Xi looked around again. Of course, this action turned into a cat sticking his head out and looking around.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie thought he was afraid and spoke softly, \u201cThere is no dog at home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Who would be afraid of dogs? Then the giant dog\u2019s head flashed through his mind and Cat Xie was silent. The big dog was a bit surprising.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi generally understood.</p><br/><p>This was a one bedroom single apartment. The decorations were okay and all the necessary furniture was present. It was quite good, apart from being a bit small.</p><br/><p>Still, it could be seen from this household that Jiang Xie was living on his own. A young man of 16 or 17 was living on his own?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t clear about Jiang Xie\u2019s family situation since he never asked in Central.</p><br/><p>This was the \u2018etiquette\u2019 between players. Only those who were abandoned by their original world and gave up on their original world would enter Central. For many people, they were unwilling to recall their original world.</p><br/><p>For whatever reason, being abandoned was a bad memory.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s more, Jiang Xie had been in Central for so long and had probably almost completely forgotten his original world. Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to ask him about it.</p><br/><p>It was good to put it down and look forward. It was very painful to pursue the past.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t sure about Jiang Xie\u2019s past but this was a simple new world. In any case, it didn\u2019t matter. It was considered to be true once he met and encountered it.</p><br/><p>As the summary stated, things weren\u2019t true because people believed in it. It was because they believed in it that it became true.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie placed the kitten on the sofa. \u201cWait for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw his dirty paws leave muddy prints on the grey-white sofa.</p><br/><p>He was really dirty\u2026 Xie Xi wanted to jump off the sofa and stay on the ground but Jiang Xie pressed on his small head and told him, \u201cDon\u2019t run away. Stay here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d This sofa was really dirty, wouldn\u2019t cleaning it up be troublesome?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie obviously couldn\u2019t imagine a cat would care about this and ordered, \u201cDon\u2019t run away.\u201d His tone was meant to coax the kitten.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was too lazy to take care of this person who was stupid enough to place him on the sofa. In any case, it was already dirty. Xie Xi lay down and didn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>There was a small smile on the youth\u2019s face, who clearly didn\u2019t laugh often. Jiang Xie\u2019s voice also warmed up a bit. \u201cGood, I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t a real cat. How could he run away? Not only would Xie Xi not run away, he would bring Jiang Xie to a happy life in the future.</p><br/><p>Cat Xie thought this and subconsciously took a very dignified posture.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was really fast and came back in around two or three minutes. Xie Xi saw him going into the bathroom and thought he was relieving himself. The problem wasn\u2019t too serious.</p><br/><p>Who knew that Jiang Xie would take him into the bathroom? It wasn\u2019t until Xie Xi saw the full basin of water that he understood.</p><br/><p>It turned out to be a bath for him. Okay, he was really dirty and couldn\u2019t lick his fur. It was best to take a bath.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie held him a bit tighter and his voice was gentle. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. It is just a bath.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cat Xie turned a blind eye. \u201cNonsense.\u201d Unfortunately, it became a meow.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke to himself. \u201cSure enough, it is afraid of water.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid, let me go into the water.\u201d</p><br/><p>The meowing became more intense\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie coaxed him. \u201cYou are too dirty and need to be washed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense and wash me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie muttered, \u201cIt seems to be even more tragic.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d A cat speaking didn\u2019t work!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was worried as he placed the kitten in the water. Xie Xi certainly wasn\u2019t afraid of water but perhaps it was the instincts of his body that made him shrink back. Jiang Xie immediately covered him with water.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was a bit ashamed. He really wasn\u2019t afraid of water\u2026</p><br/><p>However, this water didn\u2019t feel the same as before. A cat\u2019s fur was heavy and it was so uncomfortable when the fur stuck to the body. It felt like a person wearing a down jacket in the bath. It really wasn\u2019t comfortable!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi realized why pets were so resistant to bathing. Being afraid of water was one thing, the uncomfortable feeling was also an important factor! Fortunately, he wasn\u2019t a real cat and could hold back.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw the kitten shivering with fear and softly reassured him. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, it\u2019ll be good soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense and wash me quickly. It is uncomfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>The meows just sounded petulant. The teenager\u2019s eyes warmed but there was a lingering desolation in the depths of his eyes. He spoke like a child. \u201cGood kitten, it will soon be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very uncomfortable but he heard the gentleness in Jiang Xie\u2019s voice and combined with Jiang Xie\u2019s light hands, he adapted more and more.</p><br/><p>The danger of washing was over and then there was the blow drying. Jiang Xie told him again, \u201cI have to blow dry you or you will catch a cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really wasn\u2019t afraid and it was uncomfortable to be wet. It was better to blow dry him.</p><br/><p>He lay on Jiang Xie\u2019s leg and wet his clothes but the teenager didn\u2019t care. He just patiently blew Xie Xi\u2019s fur from left to right and inside and outside. It was very thorough.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi almost fell asleep. The hairdryer stopped and Jiang Xie stared at the kitten in his arms, whispering, \u201cYou\u2019re so cute after washing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi raised his eyelids and stared at this person. \u201cMeow.\u201d Nonsense.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie pressed a hand to his head. \u201cYou should suppress your temper.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d What type of joke was this? He was bad-tempered? Jiang Xie placed him on the sofa again. It was naturally the clean side.</p><br/><p>He said, \u201cI\u2019ll get some food for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was a bit hungry but he didn\u2019t want to eat cat food! Jiang Xie had no cat food at home. He went online and found that cats could eat rice and cooked chicken breasts. Then he made Xie Xi some food.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gazed at this \u2018rice\u2019 and reluctantly ate after feeling his stomach growling. After eating and drinking enough, Jiang Xie rubbed his furry head. \u201cAre you full?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow.\u201d He was full. Jiang Xie smiled but the desolation in his eyes was more obvious.</p><br/><p>At this point, Xie Xi didn\u2019t know what was going on. Jiang Xie picked him up and went out with a paper box.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was full after eating and he was a bit sleepy. He was warm in Jiang Xie\u2019s arm and felt quite comfortable. He was dazed the entire way and as he was about to fall asleep, Jiang Xie placed down.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cHrmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie carefully padded the box and placed him inside. What was this? How could Xie Xi expect that Jiang Xie would give him away?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie patted him again. \u201cThis family is great and they will surely take good care of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled at him. \u201cYou became very beautiful after washing. Rest assured, they will adopt you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he got up and left.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finally reacted. This person worked hard to bring him home, bathe him and feed it. It was just to make him fat for other hands?</p><br/><p>How could Xie Xi let him go? He rushed out and struck Jiang Xie\u2019s shoes. Painful! \u201cMeow, meow!\u201d</p><br/><p>This cry was very tragic and Jiang Xie\u2019s footsteps slowed. He turned around to see the little cat grabbing his leg. His eyes flashed slightly as he crouched down. \u201cBe obedient. You will be very happy to be their pet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho was going to be a pet?\u201d Meow meow meow!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie frowned. Xie Xi held this person\u2019s leg tightly, small claws hooked into the pants. It was an appearance that showed he didn\u2019t intend to let go.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at him for a while, voice full of difficulty. \u201cIf you follow me, you will suffer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cFollow me and you won\u2019t suffer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was still cruel and removed Xie Xi\u2019s claws, his face fiercely cold. \u201cI don\u2019t like cats and will never keep a cat. Don\u2019t haunt me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw the cat let go and immediately strode away like a flood of beasts was chasing him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi froze for a moment before running after him. Want to run! No way! Cat Xie chased after Jiang Xie but couldn\u2019t find him after a few steps\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stopped as rain poured on his head. He wanted to scent Jiang Xie but the rain blocked his smell.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned and stood in the rain in a daze. What should he do? He might know Jiang Xie\u2019s home but he didn\u2019t know how to find the community.</p><br/><p>He was unprepared when Jiang Xie brought him out of the house. He didn\u2019t expect to be thrown away and was completely confused about the route. He didn\u2019t even know how far he had been brought out.</p><br/><p>The originally washed clean cat fur was dirty again. It was also wet and sticky.</p><br/><p>However, Xie Xi couldn\u2019t care about this. He had to find Jiang Xie! The condition of the teenage Jiang Xie worried him and he couldn\u2019t leave this person alone.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi ran for a long time like a headless fly in the rain. Once he was tired, he was finally picked up by big hands.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt it was Jiang Xie and was a bit angry. \u201cHow could you run?!\u201d The sound that emerged was a weak and poor meow.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie held him and spoke in a hoarse voice, \u201cIf you are with me, you will die.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

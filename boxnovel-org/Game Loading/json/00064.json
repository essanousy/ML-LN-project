Thus, he was testing XIe Xi.</p><br/><p>Then here was the question. Xie Xi was sure that he wasn\u2019t a human so why did he think of the heart as tasty lamp chops? Moreover, he was becoming hungrier and the impulse to eat was increasing.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for Roast Pork Bun, he would\u2019ve taken this heart as roast lamp chops and eaten with relish.</p><br/><p>Then he would be killed by Randy in the dream and the progress mission reset to 0%. There also might not be another chance to use Dreaming!</p><br/><p>As for why he saw the heart as roast lamp chops, it must be because this was Randy\u2019s dream. Everything that happened in the dream was driven by his will.</p><br/><p>Randy felt that the person he resurrected was a demon, not Sein. Thus, he thought that Xie Xi wanted to eat this heart. Under his strong will, Xie Xi originally didn\u2019t want to eat and saw this heart as a roast lamb.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt this was too unfair. He was being wronged!</p><br/><p>From another point of view, this meant that \u2018past life\u2019 Randy did resurrect a demon. Otherwise, the memories wouldn\u2019t be so entrenched.</p><br/><p>When he thought about it, he felt that this damn pervert was really pitiful.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mood was quite complicated and he could only scold the stupid X to resolve it.</p><br/><p>Faced with the sometimes fragrant and sometimes blood thing, Xie Xi held back and frowned. \u201cWhy are you giving me this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Randy was slightly startled and his voice trembled. \u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Forget liking, who wanted to eat a heart?</p><br/><p>He just thought this when it became roast lamp chops. It was roasted just enough, the outside was crisp and tender and the aroma was delicious. He was so hungry\u2026</p><br/><p>He pinched Roast Pork Bun and the kitten called out. Xie Xi instantly calmed down and replied, \u201cIsn\u2019t this a human heart? How can I eat this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Randy\u2019s pupils shrank and an unbelievable ecstasy entered the depths. \u201cIt is my bad. I was confused and actually took out this type of thing for you to eat. I with take it back and make your favourite roast lamp chops.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He was so nauseous that he couldn\u2019t eat lamb chops!</p><br/><p>Randy took the hot heart and quickly returned. He smiled and his eyes were no longer so cold. \u201cYoung Master has been waiting.\u201d</p><br/><p>He opened the lid\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was silent.</p><br/><p>How was it still a heart? A completely red, still beating heart! Xie Xi had never seen a human heart but he had seen a pig heart. He heard that they were similar so\u2026 this was truly a human heart!</p><br/><p>What was going on? Did he show something? Was Randy still testing him? It came out twice!</p><br/><p>Randy told him, \u201cEat, you must be hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I will eat your big head, you damn demon.\u2019 Xie Xi looked at this bright heart and almost vomited.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun sniffed it and exclaimed, \u201cGood smell. Is this roast lamb chops?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun was greedy. \u201cCan a cat eat sheep? It looks so delicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thanks to Roast Pork Bun, Xie Xi looked at the plate again and the bloody heart had become roast lamb chops.</p><br/><p>This\u2026</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t move and Randy\u2019s voice lowered again. \u201cYoung Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard the suspicion in his tone.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t eat again, he would be misunderstood! However, he couldn\u2019t move his hand. As long as Roast Pork Bun didn\u2019t make a sound, he would see the lamb chops as a heart that gave off a pungent smell. It was too disgusting. He couldn\u2019t eat it even if he knew that it was really roast lamb chops!</p><br/><p>Sure enough, he was a demon in Randy\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Since Randy was so certain, what was with the test? Just kill him!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t understand this type of mood. If it wasn\u2019t the verge of despair, who would grab such a broken thing?</p><br/><p>The joy that welled up in Randy\u2019s eyes faded again. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to eat it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew that if he ate the lamb chop that looked like a raw heart, he would dispel most of Randy\u2019s suspicions.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 he couldn\u2019t do it!</p><br/><p>He would definitely spit it out if he took a bite of it!</p><br/><p>This type of physical resistance wasn\u2019t something that could be changed through willpower.</p><br/><p>Randy\u2019s lips curved, revealing a crazy smile. \u201cYou really wanted to eat the thing just now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe the smell from the heart just now was too heavy. I don\u2019t want to eat this greasy thing. Randy\u2026\u201d Xie Xi looked up with Sein\u2019s customary dependent expression. \u201cI want to eat snacks and drink black tea. Is it okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi remembered that nobles shouldn\u2019t have snacks for his meals but Sein was often a picky eater. Thus, Randy would sometimes \u2018spoil\u2019 him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi might have goose bumps at the words but fortunately it worked.</p><br/><p>Randy\u2019s atmosphere calmed down a bit and he said, \u201cOkay, I will prepare it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Snacks, snacks\u2026</p><br/><p>This type of non-meat food should be better!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gambled correctly as Randy brought hot tea and exquisite snacks.</p><br/><p>There was no demon in the snacks. They were actual snacks. Xie Xi was cautious this time and poked the kitten. Roast Pork Bun was still missing the lamp chops and turned around, \u201cI hate chocolate the most. It isn\u2019t delicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed with relief, knowing that he wasn\u2019t mistaken.</p><br/><p>He was really hungry and in order to make Randy feel at ease, he ate a piece of chocolate cake.</p><br/><p>This thing that should be sweet in Xie Xi\u2019s mouth was like eating dirt\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Originally a demon\u2019s taste was like a cat. He couldn\u2019t taste the sweetness!</p><br/><p>Randy asked him, \u201cHow does it taste?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Xie Xi was a human. He might not be able to taste the chocolate but he remembered it. \u201cIt\u2019s delicious.\u201d He made a contented appearance.</p><br/><p>Randy looked at him and said, \u201cSlow down, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t in a hurry. Who would be anxious to \u2018eat soil\u2019?</p><br/><p>Then he considered eating internal organs and the soil instantly became very delicious.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi made a look of happiness.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Jiang Xie harvested a number of -1 that were as red as the heart.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was relieved after finally passing the test of eating.</p><br/><p>Randy asked him, \u201cI\u2019ve prepared water. You should take a bath.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was unsure if there were any traps ahead but\u2026 the time skip meant it was time for a bath before getting ready for bed.</p><br/><p>A bath!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought, \u2018I should be careful and see if there are any tricks.\u2019</p><br/><p>Randy bent over and picked him up. Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to make a fuss and let himself be held.</p><br/><p>He was very desperate to fill up the progress!</p><br/><p>Once they arrived at the bathroom, Randy put him down and unbuttoned him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi responded naturally. After all, he had experience from the first world and there was nothing to panic about.</p><br/><p>His clothes were taken off and Xie Xi was just about to enter the bath\u2026</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun jumped into the water first. He was a kitten who was very fond of bathing. He had just jumped in when he shouted, \u201cIce, how is this water so cold?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Sure enough, there was a trap.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi quietly put one leg in to test it.</p><br/><p>The water temperature wasn\u2019t cold for him. It was very comfortable, like taking a bath on a hot summer\u2019s day.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey..\u201d Xie Xi took a fake breath and frowned. \u201cWhy is the water so cold?\u201d</p><br/><p>Randy\u2019s black eyes were slightly cold as he asked, \u201cThe water temperature isn\u2019t suitable?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was suitable, very suitable! If it wasn\u2019t for Roast Pork Bun then his head would\u2019ve probably been removed!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi showed the biggest acting of his life. \u201cIt\u2019s cold. Randy, didn\u2019t you say that you prepared the water? Why is it so cold?\u201d There was some blame in the words.</p><br/><p>Randy wasn\u2019t angry at his tone. His face filled with joy as he hurriedly said, \u201cWait a moment, I will immediately heat the water!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wrapped a piece of cloth around his waist. He wasn\u2019t cold but he knew to take the initiative to wrap himself up and make himself look cold.</p><br/><p>Randy was remorseful. He blamed himself as he quickly changed to hot water.</p><br/><p>Hot steam rose from the bath as Roast Pork Bun jumped in and swam happily. \u201cDaddy, come in. It is now comfortable!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi put on foot in and instantly felt a shock.</p><br/><p>Randy asked him, \u201cIs the temperature right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at the kitten swimming around and gritted his teeth. \u201cIt is suitable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn, it was too hot!</p><br/><p>Randy was relived. \u201cGo in. Be careful not to get a cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi slowing entered the tub while holding onto the determination that \u2018a dead pig doesn\u2019t fear scalding water.\u2019</p><br/><p>The body temperature of a demon was very low. Warm water for normal people was very hot for them. Xie Xi had to grit his teeth and also make a comfortable appearance. It was really\u2026</p><br/><p>Xi, get lost! Whip your body!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was furious. He was a living human. Why did he have to suffer as a demon?</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun was doing a backstroke. \u201cIt is comfortable, so comfortable. A hot bath is the most comfortable thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d It was too hot that he wanted to jump out QAQ!</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know how long he held on when he saw the black progress bar slightly rising. His eyes lit up and he felt the water temperature becoming normal. Had he finally passed the test?</p><br/><p>Randy no longer doubted that he was a demon? Randy finally believed he was human?</p><br/><p>Could he finally be a human?</p><br/><p>Hey, he was a human!</p><br/><p>Randy\u2019s doubts were released and Xie Xi was no longer so stiff. He took a bath and felt refreshed.</p><br/><p>Randy dressed him in pyjamas and Xie Xi finally took the initiative. \u201cRandy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm?\u201d Randy gently fastened his buttons. \u201cYoung Master, what do you have to tell me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked down. \u201cWas I wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Randy\u2019s hand paused. \u201cHow could Young Master be wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied softly, \u201cI took advantage of so many people in order to get revenge, no matter the cost. I even summoned a demon\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Randy\u2019s head jerked and he stared at Xie Xi with dark eyes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was sad. \u201cI have lost a lot and have almost nothing left. However, I still have you. Randy\u2026 sometimes I think that it would be good with just the two of us. I just want to be with you and not manage anything\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He stopped, not because he finished talking but because of a prompt that appeared in the lower right corner.</p><br/><p>[The dream is coming to an end. Please feel free to leave.]</p><br/><p>The countdown was three seconds.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare talk nonsense and hurriedly left the dream to return to reality.</p><br/><p>What was going on? This was the end of the dream? Had his words woken Randy?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi quickly changed to a reserve face and found a place to hide.</p><br/><p>At this time, there was a knock on the door.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed with relief while the eldest prince woke up.</p><br/><p>He felt a bit sorry. It wasn\u2019t a good time to wake up from the dream. He had just received Randy\u2019s trust and was going to fill the progress. How did he wake up?</p><br/><p>He could only use Dreaming in three days and\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned.</p><br/><p>In the lower right corner, the black progress bar that was originally at 9% unexpectedly became full, turning into a green 16.66\u2026%.</p><br/><p>It was full? He just said those words and it was full?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this too simple?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about it and vaguely understood.</p><br/><p>Randy had been waiting too long, struggling for too long in that abyss of despair.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t ask for much. As long as there was a bit of warmth and hope, he would pay everything.</p><br/><p>A bitter taste spread in Xie Xi\u2019s mouth. At this time, a voice recalled Xie Xi\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>A merman with a secretary-like appearance swam in. He saluted and hurriedly reported to the eldest prince, \u201cYour Highness! The sixth prince is great and repelled the Haiqiu people to the abyss of the sea!\u201d</p><br/><p>The eldest prince had just woken up and he said, \u201cGreat! There is another fierce warrior in our underwater kingdom.\u201d</p><br/><p>The secretary continued, \u201cThe sixth prince has captured the state teacher of the Haiqiu Kingdom. Haiqiu suffered such a big loss that they shouldn\u2019t launch another attack for a long time!\u201d</p><br/><p>The eldest prince frowned. \u201cHaiqiu\u2019s state teacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>The secretary lowered his voice. \u201cHis Highness seems to want to use the power of this state teacher to resurrect a person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

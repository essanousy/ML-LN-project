People could have several bodies at once!</p><br/><p>Oh, it wasn\u2019t possible to anyone else but it was certainly okay for Jiang Xie. After all, he had so many souls!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t worried about his safety. He just started to curse Jiang Xie in his heart. Didn\u2019t this person know what to focus on? Couldn\u2019t he mention how many souls were present and if these souls had any brain damage. Even if the time wasn\u2019t enough and he couldn\u2019t give the details, at least explain the last sentence.</p><br/><p>How was Azure Dragon so calm if he knew that Xie Xi fled from the marriage?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi remembered that the fourth prince was a positive young man!</p><br/><p>Well\u2026fine\u2026</p><br/><p>After experiencing the last scene, he was probably no better than the fifth or sixth prince.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe climate of the Holy Mountain can be adjusted. It is too hot for you to stay there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon suddenly turned to a climate problem and Xie Xi almost couldn\u2019t keep up with the rhythm. \u201cYes, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be so polite with me. We will be together in the future. If you are afraid of the heat or cold, I should consider it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finally reacted. It was probably because Jiang Xie emerged and there was a fault in the soul. Jiang Xie gave him and patch and pretended that the two people were discussing the living environment of the Holy Mountain.</p><br/><p>It seemed that although Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t distort the will of the soul, he could move his hands and feel to add insignificant small details.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cYour Excellency has thought a lot about me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon took his hand. \u201cIt isn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gentle words made it seem that Azure Dragon was fond of spoiling him but Xie Xi had a bad taste after thinking that this person knew he had fled the marriage!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cHow can that be? I am very happy with Lord Azure Dragon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon also smiled but his blue eyes were as cold as the deep sea. \u201c I am also glad to see you happy. I always want to put everything good under the sun in front of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought this was a love story and wanted to say thank you, but Azure Dragon\u2019s next sentence made him cold and his hairs stood up. \u201c\u2026Then you won\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was tense.</p><br/><p>This translated to: I will give you all the good things in the world so you won\u2019t be greedy for the outside world.</p><br/><p>Old Four, what are you doing? Don\u2019t blacken or learn bad things!</p><br/><p>He seemed to notice the small rose\u2019s shudder and Azure Dragon spoke warmly, \u201cI heard that liking a person meant I would suffer. I didn\u2019t understand it before but now it is clear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled reluctantly. \u2018This isn\u2019t suffering. You are crazy!\u2019</p><br/><p>Poor Xie Xi didn\u2019t know why he fled the marriage and couldn\u2019t coax this person. He could only barely say, \u201cOriginally Sage Azure Dragon has such an ordinary side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon replied, \u201cI can\u2019t afford the word Sage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi disagreed. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe so-called Sage is just a shackle I was born with. If I can get rid of it to be happy with you, I am satisfied.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare to answer because he felt there was a pit in front of him!</p><br/><p>By saying that he wanted to wander with Azure Dragon around the world, would this prove that he couldn\u2019t stand the boredom of the Holy Mountain and tried to escape the marriage?</p><br/><p>If Xie Xi said he didn\u2019t want to wander the world with Azure Dragon, did this mean he only valued Azure Dragon\u2019s status and escaped because it wasn\u2019t true love?</p><br/><p>He had too few information and Xie Xi couldn\u2019t figure out the direction!</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Azure Dragon himself didn\u2019t seem to want the answer. He threw the hook before releasing the little fish.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, you left in a hurry. How could you forget to bring this?\u201d Then the server came back like he had been waiting. He heard Azure Dragon\u2019s words and came forward while holding a red paint tray in his hand.</p><br/><p>How could Xie Xi know what this was?</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon told him, \u201cYou have inherited the name of the flower god and must guard this register. If you leave it for too long, it will damage your soul.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was in a hurry. \u201cI\u2019m confused.\u201d He forgot such an important thing in order to escape from the marriage. Did he want to die? What the hell happened for the setting to be like this?</p><br/><p>The current Xie Xi was well aware of the rules of the quasi-world where the souls were involved.</p><br/><p>Objectively speaking, it was only when he entered the quasi-world that the quasi-world would wake up. At that moment, the souls would spontaneously form their own will and integrate into the quasi-world, generating pre-existing summaries.</p><br/><p>In other words, before Xie Xi entered, there was nothing. The Baihua Mountain event, Azure Dragon saving the small rose and the engagement. All these things he didn\u2019t know about didn\u2019t exist.</p><br/><p>Once Xie Xi entered, the souls generated the corresponding setting and placed them on Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>As for this setting, it must follow logic but now there were too few clues and he couldn\u2019t fathom it.</p><br/><p>Of course, Xie Xi could understand why he was set up to escape the marriage. After all, the thing he did to the fourth prince in Atlantis\u2026 it was a much more serious betrayal than escaping marriage.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt a bit panicked thinking up to here. He couldn\u2019t have fled the marriage because he had a new love?</p><br/><p>This was really\u2026 it was too messy. Just look at Love to the Left or Right, also know as the Love is a Dead End quasi-world.</p><br/><p>The scary thing was that he could load the file in Love is a Dead End. What about here? There was no loading a file option!</p><br/><p>The only thankful thing was that there was the half Jiang Xie to help. He just wasn\u2019t sure if Jiang Xie would be a disservice or not\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tried to brush up his good feelings. \u201cI just came back to see for a moment before returning to the Holy Mountain. Thus, I didn\u2019t bring it.\u201d The implication was that he wasn\u2019t really escaping from marriage. If he was escaping, he would\u2019ve brought it with him.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon seemed to be appeased and said, \u201cThat won\u2019t do. I was really worried when I saw the roster but didn\u2019t see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stated, \u201cIt\u2019s my fault. I also bothered Lord Azure Dragon to send it personally to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are still childish and playful.\u201d</p><br/><p>This seemed to mean something. Xie Xi cautiously replied, \u201cIn the future, I will ask you to be more strict.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon\u2019s mood seemed to be much better. \u201cHow can I be willing to do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt sorry.</p><br/><p>The smile on Azure Dragon\u2019s face faded a bit and he whispered, \u201cAll I can do is wait for you to grow up.\u201d</p><br/><p>There seemed to be some helplessness in his words. Xie Xi\u2019s heart was stunned and he wondered if he really cheated.</p><br/><p>The cuckolded Azure Dragon not only held back his anger but chose to wait for him to wake up?</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon, you are really a bit green.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon put down the roster and told him before leaving, \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought it wasn\u2019t too late to show his loyalty. \u201cI\u2019ll go back to the Holy Mountain with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon\u2019s eyes became darker. \u201cYou want to go back with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d No matter what happened with the other souls, Xie Xi always felt that the fourth prince was a bit miserable and decided to comfort him first. Unexpectedly, Azure Dragon shook his head. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve come back here, stay for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was a bit stunned. What was this situation? Was he feeling Xie Xi out?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi continued, \u201cI want to go back with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon smiled but it didn\u2019t apply to his eyes. \u201cThere is no hurry. Wait for the day I come back to pick you up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon really didn\u2019t want him to come back? Why\u2026</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon drew him closer and kissed his forehead. \u201cWait for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>This words seemed filled with killing intent!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare provoke him and could only watch Azure Dragon leave while holding the roster.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon left and Purple Nine came over. \u201cOh my god, Lord Azure Dragon really loves you. He actually personally sent you the roster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was speechless. It was definitely love but who knew if it was good.</p><br/><p>Purple Nine warned him. \u201cDon\u2019t mess around anymore. Lord Azure Dragon thought you just messed him and came back to see it. If he knew that you regret the marriage, how sad would he be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was afraid that he was probably sad now while preparing the green hat!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told her, \u201cI\u2019m a bit tired.\u201d</p><br/><p>Purple Nine thought of his inexplicable amnesia and felt worried but also sad. \u201cYes, go rest and see if you can remember the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded.</p><br/><p>He left Purple Nine and checked the roster. After all, his life was at stake. Xie Xi went to the inner room and sat on the bed before opening the roster. The moment he opened it, a hint appeared in the lower right corner.</p><br/><p>[You have triggered the Beginner Repair Skill promotion task. Do you want to accept it?]</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie said that the promotion task for a skill would generally appear randomly in the quasi-world. It seemed that he now encountered it?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi definitely couldn\u2019t miss this and hurriedly accepted.</p><br/><p>In the lower right corner, the prompt for the promotion task appeared under the main task and side task.</p><br/><p>Was the promotion task related to this roster?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gazed at the roster and was surprised to find that it was blank.</p><br/><p>The cover of the roster only had the word Xie Xi and everything else was blank paper.</p><br/><p>What was this situation?</p><br/><p>Then a new prompt appeared in the lower right corner. [Main Task: Find blank illustrations, collect the illustrations of the holy beasts.</p><br/><p>Side Task: Find blank illustrations, collect the illustrations of the demon beasts.</p><br/><p>Promotion Task: (1) Repair the broken rose illustration.]</p><br/><p>These three messages gave Xie Xi many clues. It seemed that this roster was the key item needed for the tasks and could be used to collect the holy beasts and demon beasts illustrations. As for how to collect them, Xie Xi wasn\u2019t sure but he definitely wouldn\u2019t draw or write casually on the paper. It was estimated that there were special requirements that he needed to think about.</p><br/><p>The roster was a prop for the promotion task and Xie Xi didn\u2019t know how to repair the broken rose illustration.</p><br/><p>In short, there were clues and he would slowly explore the follow-up.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tried it and found that the roster could be placed into the items bar, which made him feel at ease. As long as he placed it in the bar, he didn\u2019t worry about it being stolen or destroyed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi studied it for a while before deciding to lay down and rest after confirming he didn\u2019t miss anything.</p><br/><p>It was unknown what the little rose experienced before but his physical strength was exhausted. Xie Xi couldn\u2019t endure despite his qualifications.</p><br/><p>He was woken up by a voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is the servant of the nine-tailed demon ancestor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur rose family belongs to the Holy Mountain and has nothing to do with the Demon Sea. What did they come here to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over! I heard that foxes like to pick the flowers and trample the grass (womanize). Are they going to pick us?\u201d</p><br/><p>The idiom wasn\u2019t used like this!</p><br/><p>There was the sound of footsteps. Xie Xi had just sat up when he heard the voice of Red Three. \u201cA betrothal gift?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! The fox demon said that the nine-tailed fox ancestor is coming to give us a betrothal gift?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s scalp became numb.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

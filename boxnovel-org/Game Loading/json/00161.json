The last time Xie Xi took away Beginner Repair and this time it was the god\u2019s wisdom. It wasn\u2019t random, it was taking the most important item!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was modest. \u201cThe god\u2019s wisdom isn\u2019t the same as it was in the quasi-world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked, \u201cIs it the beginner version?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xie Xi continued, \u201cAre you in the garden? I will go and find you so we can talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was about to tell him to wait when he received Xie Xi\u2019s entry request. How could he refuse? He could only wrong Yan Zhe. Before Jiang Xie let Xie Xi enter, he sent Yan Zhe out.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe scolded, \u201cTrash who forgets about your friends!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cHe is very smart. If he sees you then he will certainly suspect that I\u2019m not in good health.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe understood. \u201cTake it easy. If one day you actually die, Little Rose\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sent the person out and Yan Zhe could only talk to himself. \u201cWon\u2019t be able to bear it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s series of movements were very smooth but Xie Xi still saw Yan Zhe\u2019s back. His heart tensed up as he asked, \u201cWas that God Yan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t change colour. \u201cIt is Old Qin earing Yan Zhe\u2019s clothes.\u201d It was normal for Qin Ge to be present since he had to use the Equivalent Exchange skill.</p><br/><p>Qin Ge and Yan Zhe, \u201c\u2026\u201d Was it still too late to split from this person?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t believe it and he frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your body?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can there be a problem?\u201d Jiang Xie leaned over and hugged him while whispering, \u201cI have no problem doing it 70 times a night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt this person\u2019s body was quite normal and felt slightly relieved. He yelled, \u201c70 times a night and you say there is no problem? This is simply an early discharge!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie laughed. \u201cIf we are in the Antarctic then the night will be longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>This sophistry! Xie Xi didn\u2019t have a good atmosphere around him. \u201cOnly 70 times in half a year?\u201d</p><br/><p>He immediately regretted saying this. He had dug a hole for himself!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes brightened and he lowered his voice. \u201cIt is a low number but your husband is very long-lasting. I can last for two days\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t listen and pushed this person away. \u201cClose, your, mouth!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no point in saying anything.\u201d Jiang Xie told him innocently. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we try it out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Forget trying it out!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took out the god\u2019s wisdom.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw the topic had changed and no longer had a poor mouth as he examined the god\u2019s wisdom.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi explained, \u201cIt is a bound item. It can\u2019t be transferred, traded or discarded.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sighed. \u201cMost divine objects are like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>This god\u2019s wisdom was truly at a divine level, which was the highest level in the Central World at present.</p><br/><p>It was said that there were only two divine objects in all of Central. One was in the hands of Yunge\u2019s founder and master, N, while the other was in the hands of the greatest designer, X.</p><br/><p>Now there was a third and it was in the hands of a beginner collector. This showed Xie Xi\u2019s excellent luck.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi added, \u201cThe current function can\u2019t compare to the quasi-world\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In general, this was a weakened version of the god\u2019s wisdom. Xie Xi could draw on it and the thing he drew would be created in thin air. It was unfortunate that Xie Xi didn\u2019t have the flower god\u2019s drawing skills.</p><br/><p>He tried to draw and it was crooked, twisted and bent. He finally finished drawing and the god\u2019s wisdom responded with: [It is too ugly to recognize.]</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie heard this and smiled. Xie Xi glared at him. Jiang Xie immediately cried out, \u201cGarbage god\u2019s wisdom, you dare to laugh at my baby. I\u2019ll tear you apart!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi ignored him and continued. \u201cThe beginner god\u2019s wisdom has many limitations. I can\u2019t create life forms, the object can\u2019t be larger than one square metre and there are only five minutes of drawing time. After drawing, there is a one hour cooldown.\u201d</p><br/><p>It might sound like there were many limitations but it was still frightening.</p><br/><p>The beginner version couldn\u2019t create lifeforms. Did this mean it was possible at a higher level?</p><br/><p>There was also a one square metre size limit. The beginner level was so large. Imagine how big it would be when upgraded.</p><br/><p>Drawing something in five minutes might sound short but if he became proficient in drawing, he could draw many things.</p><br/><p>Other people were desperately trying to expand their items bar. Xie Xi only needed to bring the god\u2019s wisdom and draw some simple items that he remembered. Then wouldn\u2019t they be created?</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t look down on small things. A health potion worth thousands of gold wasn\u2019t difficult to draw.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing. If you use it properly then it will have great value.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi remembered something and asked, \u201cIs this related to being a designer?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cIt is possible but definitely not now. You don\u2019t need to worry. In order to promote to a designer, you need to pass a test set by the Central Government. The test is single-player mode and you can only rely on yourself. You should upgrade as much as possible before trying to pass the test.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cYes, I\u2019m not in a hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>He also knew that some designers didn\u2019t know some of the basics. The designers in Central was getting smaller, because they couldn\u2019t pass the test, not because people didn\u2019t know the true meaning of designing.</p><br/><p>Without enough experience and strength, attempting the test was tantamount to dying.</p><br/><p>Even with plenty of preparations, too many senior players fell in the test.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t been promoted to an intermediate player yet and wasn\u2019t eager to try being upgraded to a designer. He wanted to talk about his new world when he suddenly glimpsed the withered roses.</p><br/><p>The roses in this garden were the spiritual image of Jiang Xie. They had been thriving in the past so why were they now\u2026</p><br/><p>He immediately looked up with narrowed eyes. \u201cWere you damaged by Equivalent Exchange?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d Hadn\u2019t they got past this?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his mouth. \u201cThis time you lost your body. Do you still have your body when staying in the bodies of the soul? Is that why you were physically damaged when you came out?\u201d The more he spoke, the paler he became. He even thought the worst. Perhaps Jiang Xie\u2019s body was gone. Was this another piece or perhaps it was an illusion that Jiang Xie was showing him?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi reached out and Jiang Xie held his head. He understood what Xie Xi was thinking and hurriedly reassured him. \u201cI was a bit hurt but it wasn\u2019t so serious. I was divided among five and those bodies were dominated by the souls of the main body. I borrowed the bodies at most and it doesn\u2019t count as gaining a body.\u201d [1.]</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glared at him. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled wryly. \u201cI can\u2019t lie to you.\u201d He desperately hid all of this but because his spirit relaxed, he exposed a flaw and let Xie Xi notice.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi raised an eyebrow. \u201cIt really only hurts a bit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie comforted him. \u201cIt is a little flesh injury. If I am lying, I will be hit by five thunderbolts\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi rushed to interrupt him. \u201cStop talking nonsense!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying to you so I\u2019m not afraid of this thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t hesitate to expose him. \u201cThis is your garden so there won\u2019t be any thunderbolts!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled.</p><br/><p>It really wasn\u2019t because the garden didn\u2019t have five thunderbolts. It was because he wasn\u2019t afraid of being hit by them. They only tickled him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cIf you are only hurt a little bit, why God Yan come here?\u201d It had been a while since he came here and he was aware of Yan Zhe\u2019s nature.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie could always pull something out. \u201cIt is all Old Qin\u2019s fussing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sneered. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have the strength to stop General Qin!\u201d Qin Ge was previously a general so this was what low level players called him in Central.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned. If he had a bit of strength left then he wouldn\u2019t have allowed Qin Ge to call Yan Zhe.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s lies were poked and he could only act as a scoundrel. \u201cIf you are worried then do you want to take my clothes off and check directly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also had a killer move. \u201cIf you keep a secret from me, don\u2019t think about going to the next world with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Jiang explained the truth in a matter of seconds. \u201cI only broke a few bones.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA few?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 it was 200\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There were a total of 206 bones and Jiang Xie broke 200 of them\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s face was a frosty white as he gritted his teeth. \u201cDon\u2019t go with me to the next world\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie kissed him and spoke softly, \u201cI won\u2019t hesitate to follow you even if I am crushed to powder. You can\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was too foul. The big fire immediately vanished! Xie Xi\u2019s eyes reddened and he couldn\u2019t help kissing back.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was a typical opportunist and how could he give up such a good thing? He waved his hand and made a beautiful room appear, pressing the other person down onto a soft bed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared up at him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie felt heartache and pity as he touched the tip of the delicate nose and whispered, \u201cI fear nothing in Heaven or Earth, I only fear you becoming a sacrificial vessel.\u201d Then he kissed the corner of Xie Xi\u2019s eyes, tasting bittersweet tears.</p><br/><p>After experiencing the strength of the other person\u2019s waist, Xie Xi was convinced. \u201cGod Yan is really powerful.\u201d</p><br/><p>During such a time, his lover was talking about another man being powerful. Jiang Xie angrily bit his neck and left a small strawberry. \u201cDon\u2019t boast about other men.\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this! Xie Xi explained, \u201cI mean that God Yan\u2019s healing is really powerful!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was amazing that Jiang Xie\u2019s heavy injuries could be healed in such a short period of time!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is he powerful? He is exhausted from running 800 metres and can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe let out a big sneeze. He rubbed the tip of his nose while glancing at Qin Ge. \u201cI think Old Jiang is scolding me.\u201d</p><br/><p>General Qin was an honest man. \u201cHow is that possible? You just healed him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe was indignant. \u201cIt must be because Little Rose discovered something was wrong and admired my superb healing. The old brute\u2019s heart is unwilling and he blackened me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Well\u2026 good brother, you guessed correctly.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie really wanted to do Xie Xi 70 times in one night. Unfortunately, Xie Xi couldn\u2019t stay in Central for too long. He had to go to the new world as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was trying to ask about the new quasi-world when Xie Xi asked him first, \u201cHave you recovered any souls this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie answered, \u201cFive souls.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cIs your luck so good?\u201d Last time only one was recycled. This time it was actually five?</p><br/><p>The rules regarding taking back the souls weren\u2019t just to make them happy. It was to see how many quasi-worlds they participated in. Wasn\u2019t this too much of a coincidence? All five souls had Wonderful Painting of the Mountains and Seas as their last world?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie paused.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi keenly captured this and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cThey should be involved in a few more worlds. However, I entered the quasi-world and they were forcibly brought back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes became bigger. \u201cWhat about the other quasi-worlds they were involved in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe souls were forcibly removed and the quasi-world might collapse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart thumped and he had a bad feeling. \u201cDoes it hurt you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cIt is a good thing for me but the damage to the Central Government is relatively large.\u201d</p><br/><p>The number of quasi-worlds was already decreasing and now the worlds of the main designer, Jiang Xie collapsed\u2026 it was adding insult to injury.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood. Jiang Xie had scattered out too many souls and his own state was unstable. He urgently needed to take back the souls.</p><br/><p>Forget how they came back. As long as they returned to Jiang Xie, it was a good thing. On the other hand, the quasi-worlds that lost the souls suffered.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his mouth. \u201cIf this is the case, we can recover all the scattered souls as long as we clear a few more worlds.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was unknown how many souls Jiang Xie scattered but if Jiang Xie could pull them out of the quasi-world then the efficiency was improved.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie refuted it. \u201cThings won\u2019t be that simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought of his new world and hurriedly told Jiang Xie about it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned. \u201cA specific occupation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI tried all the low level occupations but they didn\u2019t work. In addition, according to your words, I can\u2019t pass the designer test right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie said, \u201cIt is impossible that it is a designer. Go to the occupation interface and there should be a tip about transferring occupations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really didn\u2019t know this. He hurriedly dragged down the interface and found the occupations tab.</p><br/><p>Once it was opened, Xie Xi was stunned. \u201cRepairer? There is such an occupation in Central?\u201d</p><br/><p>[1.] TL: If this is confusing, remember that when it comes to Equivalent Exchange, Jiang Xie loses something every time he enters the world. If he recovers the thing he lost in the world, he will lose it permanently. In this chapter, Xie Xi was worried that whenever Jiang Xie took over the soul\u2019s bodies, this was regarded as Jiang Xie regaining his own body and it would be permanently lost.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

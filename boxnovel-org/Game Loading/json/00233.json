Student Jiang Xie was really good. He could come back after this, he truly was the embodiment of the world\u2019s will!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cYou can rest assured, I won\u2019t be separated from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before that, he had spoken euphemistically by saying they would go to the Demon World together. After being active all night, now he could speak more straightforwardly.</p><br/><p>What could Xie Xi do? He had to watch this show.</p><br/><p>Speaking of which, Jiang Xie was still worried about Xie Xi\u2019s health. \u201cIs your body really okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t feel any abnormality at all. \u201cI feel full of strength.\u201d It was worthy of a succubus that fed off sex, not a normal constitution.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Jiang Xie was puzzled again. \u201cBy the way, which is your adult ceremony so dangerous?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also wanted to know this. He had done a lot of homework for this assessment, especially his adult ceremony, and checked it carefully.</p><br/><p>Other succubi didn\u2019t have such a situation? Why did he need to X when it was his turn?</p><br/><p>Of course, this might be the careful machinations of the soul. Still, no matter how the soul\u2019s heart, he had to follow the logic of the world and needed a logical reason.</p><br/><p>What exactly was going on?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cDid the Demon World say anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were no details. They only said there was danger but didn\u2019t say why.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t say anything because he was afraid it would likely not be angelic.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie said again, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. After the assessment, we will go to the Demon World and inquire together, to ensure there are no hidden dangers in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>This situation was over but he was afraid Xie Xi\u2019s body would have problems in the future.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was unsure and could only nod his head. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The second assessment was scheduled in three days.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi patted Jiang Xie\u2019s chest and promised, \u201cI will definitely stay three metres away from you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The room was three metres wide. Jiang Xie was on the east side and he was on the west side. He absolutely wouldn\u2019t seduce Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Neither of them thought too much until Jiang Xie received the assessment notice.</p><br/><p>The teacher in charge told him, \u201cXie Xi has been intimate with you and will certainly show mercy. Thus, he won\u2019t be responsible for this assessment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wondered, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>The teacher explained, \u201cThe Demon World specifically arranged an adult succubus to assess you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie frowned. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like this before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe situation is special and there is no other way. After all, it is very important that the assessment is fair and just. You have saved Xie Xi and he will surely be grateful to you. It is inevitable that he will help you pass the assessment.\u201d</p><br/><p>This arrangement was really reasonable. Xie Xi might\u2019ve become an adult but Jiang Xie also had a relationship with him in order to save him. Forget Xie Xi\u2019s gratitude, the \u2018freshness\u2019 alone would be much worse.</p><br/><p>In fact, the teachers were thinking the opposite\u2026</p><br/><p>The teacher said, \u201cBe prepared to carry out the assessment at three in the afternoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The teacher left and Xie Xi\u2019s lips curved downwards in a slightly angry manner.</p><br/><p>\u2018What is this? Gemini, you still want other people to seduce you? You really are a playboy horoscope!\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t expect for vinegar to bubble inside him!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect for this to happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi listened to him and didn\u2019t fight. \u201cYou refuel. I\u2019ll go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>He went back to the dormitory while scolding Jiang Xie in his head.</p><br/><p>Rationally, he knew this had nothing to do with Jiang Xie. The soul might represent the will of the world but it couldn\u2019t go against logic.</p><br/><p>After this happened, the school definitely wouldn\u2019t let Xie Xi assess Jiang Xie. If Jiang Xie wanted to go to the Demon World then another person needed to be arranged.</p><br/><p>He understood the reason but when he thought of Jiang Xie and an adult succubus being along in a room for an hour\u2026</p><br/><p>Very angry!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie cared a lot about Xie Xi and could detect the small emotional fluctuations, let alone this obvious anger.</p><br/><p>He somewhat couldn\u2019t believe it. The little succubus was jealous?</p><br/><p>Ecstasy overflowed in his chest and Jiang Xie strode to catch up with Xie Xi, holding the succubus\u2019 hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Get lost!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie hurriedly coaxed him, \u201cDon\u2019t be angry. I won\u2019t be with others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t make a sound but his heart wasn\u2019t happy.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie continued, \u201cReally, I don\u2019t want to see anyone else apart from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi unexpectedly remembered God Yan\u2019s mantra: Old evil, deceitful ghost\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie felt both sweet and anxious when he saw the silent Jiang Xie. \u201cBelieve me, as long as it isn\u2019t you, the difficulty of this assessment is zero.\u201d</p><br/><p>This point woke up Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>The soul wanted to pass the assessment and go to the Demon World. The soul didn\u2019t want to separate from Xie Xi so a loophole was found.</p><br/><p>Changing the person doing the assessment was indeed a loophole. In this regard, Xie Xi still believed in Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>He believed in Jiang Xie but he still felt sour.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at the other person. \u201cIf you don\u2019t pass the assessment\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie kissed him on the forehead. \u201cI won\u2019t be separated from you.\u201d It was hard to develop to this point. He must follow to the Demon World and watch the succubus. If the succubus was taken away then he would want to kill.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi bit his lip. \u201cYou aren\u2019t allowed to kiss others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned towards his ears and whispered, \u201cI only kiss you, only look at you, only think of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He must\u2019ve been infected or how could he eat such stupid vinegar?</p><br/><p>Naturally, Xie Xi didn\u2019t go to the assessment. After all, he wasn\u2019t the \u2018invigilator\u2019 so why would he go? Was he crazy?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had a million methods to watch Jiang Xie and the adult succubus but he didn\u2019t look.</p><br/><p>There was nothing to look at. His heart might be uncomfortable but he believed in Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>If Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t resist this temptation then he would\u2019ve died 10,000 times already.</p><br/><p>An hour later, the assessment was over and there was no doubt that Jiang Xie passed perfectly.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, Xie Xi was called aside by the teacher.</p><br/><p>The teacher asked carefully, \u201cIs Jiang Xie\u2019s body okay? That night, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t understand why the teacher was asking this.</p><br/><p>The teacher confessed about what happened and Xie Xi was speechless.</p><br/><p>At the end of the assessment, the adult succubus came out and found the teachers, declaring with great emphasis, \u201cThat child has something wrong with his body. This is a serious illness. You should check him and treat him as soon as possible!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was too stable that the adult succubus thought he was someone with no sexual desires.</p><br/><p>The teacher replied, \u201cNo, Student Jiang is very normal. The other day\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The adult succubus spoke firmly. \u201cThere is definitely a problem. You should check it. If he doesn\u2019t have a problem then I will pan-fry my heart and hand it to him to eat!\u201d</p><br/><p>The teacher asked Xie Xi again, \u201cIs he really okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had no expression. \u2018There is a problem. His waist was almost broken!\u2019</p><br/><p>Back in the dormitory, Jiang Xie returned and immediately confessed, \u201cHe didn\u2019t meet me and I didn\u2019t look at him. It was all monitored and you can go see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Who wanted to see this? Xie Xi said, \u201cThe succubus examiner said that you have a physical problem with your body. The teacher specifically asked me to see if you have any problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi added, \u201cThe succubus examiner also said that if you aren\u2019t ill, he will fry his heart and hand it to you to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled and hugged Xie Xi. \u201cI probably have something wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie touched his white neck. \u201cI want to kiss you whenever I see you. Is this an illness?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Smelly, shameless person.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke again, \u201cI\u2019m sick and can\u2019t be cured.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice dropped and he kissed Xie Xi. The two people kissed\u2026</p><br/><p>No illness!</p><br/><p>Adult succubus, come here with the plate of fried heart!!</p><br/><p>Finally, the semester was over and Jiang Xie was perfectly qualified to be an exchange student. He could go to the Demon World\u2019s university to continue his studies with Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>At the end of the term, the students wanted to send their succubus classmate off.</p><br/><p>Throughout the year, they didn\u2019t have many opportunities to talk to Xie Xi and didn\u2019t even see him in the later period. Even so, he was a succubus with unparalleled charm and they cherished the opportunity to send him away.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had no idea about this. The only angel he knew was going to the Demon World with him. The others\u2026 it didn\u2019t matter if they got together or not.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t intend for a gathering. Their classmates\u2019 meditation mantra was very deep but Xie Xi\u2019s charm had doubled since becoming an adult. It would be troublesome if they couldn\u2019t resist temptation.</p><br/><p>The students told him, \u201cMaster Jiang, please loosen your tie. Xie Xi has been in Heaven for a year and never experienced anything. If he returns to the Demon World like this, won\u2019t his classmates laugh at him?</p><br/><p>This worked. Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t help worrying and accepted their suggestion.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t afraid of being laughed at. Besides, Jiang Xie was going to the Demon World with him. If someone laughed at him then this guy would probably react faster.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 let\u2019s still have the gathering.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was worried about Xie Xi and Xie Xi didn\u2019t want him to worry.</p><br/><p>This was called a send-off party for Xie Xi but in fact, the students just wanted a glimpse of him. In the beginning, they all said hello to Xie Xi. Later, they played with each other, sang and danced.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stayed for a while before whispering to Jiang Xie. \u201cIt is noisy. Shall we go?\u2019</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie glanced at him and asked, \u201cHave you had enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s fine. Let\u2019s go back first.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people got up and left after saying goodbye to their classmates. They went away and the students whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Jiang is in love with the little succubus.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is obvious. Look at that expression. It is love to the bones!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I wonder what it is like to go to the Demon World\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no comparison with Heaven. Will Jiang Xie manage to hold Jiang Xie?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can see it\u2026 Heaven is clean and Xie Xi can hold on. Wait until the Demon World\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I was Jiang Xie, I wouldn\u2019t go to the Demon World. Why pick up a green hat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Compared to the students\u2019 worries, Jiang Xie and Xie Xi strolled in the moonlight and the atmosphere was sweet.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked, \u201cIs there anything I have to pay attention to in the Demon World?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi only knew several things and replied vaguely, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Just talk less and watch more.\u201d This was a jack of all trades method and could be used anywhere.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once they were basically ready, they set off for the Demon World.</p><br/><p>It was public exchange student so the transportation fees were reimbursed. Of course, it was equivalent to travelling in economy class.</p><br/><p>The journey from First Heaven to the First Domain didn\u2019t sound far but they had to fly for 20 hours.</p><br/><p>Thus, Jiang Xie upgraded the plane ticket at his own expense and transferred to business class with Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Business class was much more comfortable. They could lie flat and sleep.</p><br/><p>Even so, the two people were tired by the time they reached the First Domain.</p><br/><p>They disembarked and the scenery was quite different from First Heaven.</p><br/><p>The sky of the Demon World was dark purple. It was grey even during the day and the dark clouds made it look like it was going to rain.</p><br/><p>There were demons responsible for reception here and Jiang Xie and Xie Xi didn\u2019t settle down until 6 o\u2019clock.</p><br/><p>The demon who received them winked at Xie Xi. \u201cXiao Xie, come to me at night?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It was impossible to be Old Four. After the last quasi-world ended, Jiang Xie took all the souls away. Old Four had returned to Jiang Xie so how could he appear in this world?</p><br/><p>Moreover, this face didn\u2019t belong to Azure Dragon. Xie Xi thought that this was likely Jiang Xie. Perhaps this world hated his two coloured eyes and gave him beautiful pupils?</p><br/><p>By the way, how did he shrink? This Jiang Xie\u2026 um\u2026 was too tender?</p><br/><p>Secretary Li reported, \u201cThe e981 rebel leader, code X. The rest of the information is unknown. This youth\u2019s combat power is very high and he is very difficult. The intelligence department suspects that he is the rebel leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Xie Xi heard the code X, he understood everything.</p><br/><p>The rest of the information was unknown? He could go to the intelligence department and tell them things such as\u2026 name: Jiang Xie. Age: Old. Gender: Love Brain. Resume: Cough\u2026 too much, too lazy to read!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took out the model of the flower god and stared at the young version of Jiang Xie. This person was really tall. Despite only being around 15 or 16 years old, he was already 1.8 metres.</p><br/><p>However, his temperament was very tender like a newborn calf.</p><br/><p>As if aware of his sight, Jiang Xie was also looking at Xie Xi. Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes were very deep and his thin lips pursed together, making it hard to see through him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his mouth. \u201cHe is still underage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Secretary Li replied, \u201cHis body\u2019s age is 15 but as you know, biological monitoring can\u2019t judge his annual ring.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard the words \u2018growth ring\u2019 and acted very well, struggling to tighten his mouth. Still, these words were very accurate for this society. Round after round like a wheel\u2026um.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suppressed his thoughts and added, \u201cThe growth ring doesn\u2019t matter. In this round, he is a minor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Secretary Li was stunned and hurriedly said, \u201cHe might be a minor but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Minors Protection Law in the United States clearly stipulates that only the age of the body is looked at, not the rounds.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was reasonable. The age might be recorded in rounds and many people inherited the experience and knowledge of previous rounds, but few people would inherit the heart, thoughts and life experience.</p><br/><p>Therefore, in the life of a new reincarnation, a person might be able to solve Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem at birth but he might not have the common sense to know not to eat mud.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the Minors Protection Law didn\u2019t look at the annual ring and it only depended on the current age. Anybody who was less than 19 years old would be given certain protection and pardon.</p><br/><p>Secretary Li understood these laws but it was very likely that this young boy was the leader of the rebel army. Under the protection law, he would be released from prison and moved to a youth care centre.</p><br/><p>The level of vigilance at those types of homes was very low. How could this boy live there? Wasn\u2019t it like returning a tiger to the mountains?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew his concerns and under normal circumstances, Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t be stupid enough to release such a dangerous variable. However, this wasn\u2019t a normal case.</p><br/><p>In the whole world, no one gave him more peace of mind than this teenage X.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi still had to maintain the president\u2019s establishment and there was a logical reason. \u201cWe have no evidence to prove he is the leader. If we arbitrarily detain him and let the Senate know, they would inevitably impeach the president.\u201d He paused and lowered his voice. \u201cHow you forgotten how I lost?\u201d</p><br/><p>The words made Secretary Li nervous and he bowed his head. \u201cThis subordinate was reckless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Speak to a wise person and his own brain would be able to supplement what was told to him.</p><br/><p>Of course, Xie Xi\u2019s words were indeed clever.</p><br/><p>The Minors Protection Law was clearly established and the youth in front of him was indeed a minor. In the absence of sufficient evidence to establish that he was the leader of the rebels, it was illegal to detain him.</p><br/><p>The president couldn\u2019t break the law or it would be a dictatorship.</p><br/><p>In particular, when Xie Xi ran in his first election, the reason for the unsuccessful election was his age. He was Chief Justice in his first round and vice-president of the United States in the second round. He fought in the third round and should be qualified for the presidency despite being 21 years old. Yet the Senate told him that he was too young and wasn\u2019t mature enough.</p><br/><p>The laws and the public believed that no matter how many times the reincarnation, as long as the body wasn\u2019t up to standard then the heart was immature. Thus, X could be protected by the Minors Protection Law as long as he was a citizen of the United States.</p><br/><p>If Xie Xi arbitrarily detained him, Xie Xi\u2019s political opponents would definitely take the opportunity to attack. It was almost time for the re-election and it was understandable to be cautious.</p><br/><p>As for the identities of his political opponents, President Xie himself didn\u2019t know. Still, he was in a high position and how could there be no political opponents?</p><br/><p>In any case, his words were correct. The president was working hard to save the First Lady!</p><br/><p>Secretary Li was still worried. \u201cMr. President, can we really let him go?\u201d</p><br/><p>The e981 rebel army was the most troublesome bandit group in the United States. They lasted for dozens of annual rings and couldn\u2019t be completely subdued. Now the president had captured the suspected leader and it was hard to let him go just because of the Minors Protection Law!</p><br/><p>However, Secretary Li didn\u2019t dare say any more because he knew that the president was the one who put the most energy into capturing the rebels and he would be the one most reluctant\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi ordered, \u201cYou go out. I will talk to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Secretary Li hurriedly said, \u201cHis physical and mental abilities are very high. He is an S-grade dangerous person. Mr. President, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him. \u201cDo you think I can\u2019t subdue a brat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Secretary Li was stunned and calmed down. He forgot what the president had done to reach the top of the United States.</p><br/><p>The United States\u2019 president had always been the commander of the army but it was certain that there was no president more qualified than the current one to command the entire army. He had been fighting since the age of 13 and was called this generation\u2019s God of War.</p><br/><p>Secretary Li respectfully bowed. \u201cThis subordinate will retreat first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi removed all the people and shut down the surveillance, leaving him alone with Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know if this was the person or the soul so he didn\u2019t take the initiative to open his mouth.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at him with dark eyes. Xie Xi waited a minute and basically confirmed one thing. If this was the main body then it was impossible not to know Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>If it was a soul then things were unknown. If it was the master, had he forgotten Xie Xi? Well\u2026 it wasn\u2019t the first time he lost his brain but this time there seemed to be more lost?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s demeanour changed and he asked, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he opened his mouth, the boy moved. It was unknown when he disconnected the aura used to suppress him. He clasped Xie Xi\u2019s neck with one hand and forced him to the wall.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes narrowed as he stared at the person in front of him. \u201cMr. President? You are more beautiful than your images\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man\u2019s curved lips were full of hostility as he whispered, \u201c\u2026And even stupider.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s back was against the solid wall and his whole body was completely suppressed by Jiang Xie but he didn\u2019t panic. He even thought this thorny person was a bit cute\u2026 cough, he should be serious. They both had hostile identities now.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi calmly stated, \u201cYou are younger than I thought.\u201d</p><br/><p>This 15 year old teenager was also very cute. Jiang Xie\u2019s pupils shrunk and he increased the pressure of his hand. \u201cDo you think I won\u2019t kill you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked slowly, \u201cWhat if you kill me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the president of the United States. Your assassinated will send all of the US into a turmoil!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if I am dead, there will be countless presidents. For countless years, the least missing thing in the United States is a president.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie cried out, \u201cYou are the most authoritarian and have the strictest control over the people in history!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cDo you think this is something I can do on my own?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I kill you, I will have disintegrated the image you created.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him, voice unusually gentle. \u201cHow will you live if you kill me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s hand trembled very lightly. He quickly rallied his spirit and his trip was stronger. It seemed he could use his strength to break this white neck. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect the president of the United States to use this trick.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi found it funny and smiled. \u201cWhat trick?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart jumped and his gaze became more dangerous. \u201cI remember that your gender is rational.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d Xie Xi asked him, \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie exclaimed, \u201cWill I be a cowardly emotional?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t agree. \u201cAn emotional person just has stronger empathy. This doesn\u2019t mean they are cowards.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sneered. \u201cThen why are there almost no emotional people in office throughout the government?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied lightly, \u201cThey are just doing their respective duties.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie suddenly said, \u201cYou don\u2019t hide your gender.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled at him. \u201cDo I need to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie frowned and no longer spoke. He didn\u2019t expect this young and beautiful man to be so deep.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had seen his image countless times. The rebels had satirized him as the president of corolla because he stood in front of the US\u2019s rose emblem and looked like a rose corolla, more eye-catching than the most beautiful stars in the US.</p><br/><p>Such a person held the supremacy of the United States and enacted numerous harsh and cruel laws, implementing many dehumanizing policies. He acted like it was reasonable and inevitable.</p><br/><p>After a close observation, Jiang Xie confirmed that this was an unfathomable man and he couldn\u2019t be deceived by the simple appearance. Jiang Xie had to be wary and maintain a cold heart.</p><br/><p>A rational person rarely made such an emotional expression yet this gentle voice seemed to be full of affection. It held a strong appeal and the power to confuse people.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie became more determined to kill him. Even if Jiang Xie\u2019s body was crushed, he had to drag this person to hell. This man was too dangerous.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew all the twists and turns and whispered, \u201cIf you let me go then I\u2019ll let you go. How about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s fingers increased in strength. There was a stinging from his neck and Xie Xi slightly frowned. After seeing the subtle emotions, Jiang Xie\u2019s brain hadn\u2019t yet issued instructions when his hand had unconsciously loosened.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi complained, \u201cCan\u2019t you do it lighter?\u201d</p><br/><p>The slightly raised tone at the end was like a small hook that easily hooked the most critical piece of the stone wall around Jiang Xie\u2019s heart. There was a bang and the hard-built wall collapsed\u2026 Jiang Xie\u2019s heart was struck. Jiang Xie\u2019s hand trembled slightly.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought this youth finally raised weighed the pros and cons and knew a sense of proportion. He coaxed, \u201cI can use the Minors Protection Law to let you go but you can\u2019t leave my sight. You have to eat and live with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at him. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gently smiled and spoke a bit ambiguously, \u201cAre you asking why I will let you go or why I want you to eat and live with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw him like this and thought, \u2018If you are still rational then I will believe in ghosts!\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course, it was necessary to maintain Jiang Xie\u2019s face. After all, this was either a soul or brainless Jiang Xie and Xie Xi had to coax him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi continued, \u201cThe underage care facilities won\u2019t be able to look after you, right? Follow me and I can supervise you, as well as determine if you should bear the punishment of treason.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie recovered his voice and spoke through gritted teeth, \u201cI won\u2019t get along with a hypocritical person like you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t angry. He thought this was too fun and his smile widened. \u201cIf you don\u2019t try to get along with me, how do you know what type of person I am?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

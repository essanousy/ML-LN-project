It was better than being a great white shark. This damn ghost, the great white shark was at least an animal. This time he had become a plant!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tried to move his body but the purple woman in front of him had already picked him up. \u201cLook at your cute little face, look at your pure white colour, think about your flower language. How can you escape from marriage!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had no knowledge of this. He didn\u2019t know who he was going to marry or who had escaped.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill pretending!\u201d The woman in purple poked him with small leaves. Xie Xi admired how this lady could tell that he was pretending while he was a rose.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, crying and screaming isn\u2019t a good thing. Think about what you\u2019re doing here. Us roses aren\u2019t vine plants thanks to the protection of Lord Azure Dragon!\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, this purple woman was also a rose\u2026</p><br/><p>The roses weren\u2019t vine plants? How could they normally grow legs?</p><br/><p>Forget it, it was meaningless to pursue these things in such a colourful and beautiful Mary Sue world.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was carried in her hand and made a posture of listening.</p><br/><p>The purple woman said, \u201cDon\u2019t act pitiful. Originally when Lord Azure Dragon came to Baihua Mountain, I should\u2019ve told you not to go. You are a small rose and can\u2019t hold your human form. Going to that place..\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt wronged. If he had come earlier, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have gone to Baihua Mountain and would\u2019ve gone straight down the mountain!</p><br/><p>The task was to collect the holy beasts and demon beasts, not flowers or grass.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a stupid person and was rescued by Lord Azure Dragon.\u201d The woman in purple scolded him but didn\u2019t want to hurt him too much. \u201cLord Azure Dragon didn\u2019t dislike you and also took care of you. I can understand why you\u2019re not at ease with this marriage. After all, the identity of Lord Azure Dragon is so big and he thinks you are cute. What will you do when this freshness is over? You little goblin, where is your foothold on that holy mountain?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know how to speak as a rose and could only spit in his heart, \u201cSince you\u2019re not at ease, let me escape from the marriage.\u201d</p><br/><p>It turned out he said it out loud!</p><br/><p>The woman in purple angrily shook him. \u201cYou can still say such words? Don\u2019t you realize who that is? This marriage was what you wanted and now you want to destroy it? How can our rose clan live in the mountain and sea if we offend Lord Azure Dragon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He woke up to such a big problem but he still didn\u2019t know where the initiator had gone!</p><br/><p>The purple woman continued, \u201cI told you earlier and you didn\u2019t listen. You had to go to the Holy Mountain to be a man. Now you are afraid? I\u2019m saying that you can\u2019t do this! Even if you don\u2019t want to marry him, you have to! Our entire rose family can\u2019t be destroyed because of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt helpless. \u201cI\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The purple woman wondered, \u201cWhat are you doing? Quickly change back to human form!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also wanted to become a person. The problem was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHow?\u201d He really didn\u2019t know how to change from a rose to a person.</p><br/><p>The woman in purple froze. Xie Xi had to pull out his acting routine. \u201cSomehow I woke up remembering nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman in purple, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to pretend to have amnesia but the souls in this quasi-world had obviously arranged a lot of the plot in advance. He knew nothing so it was better to pretend.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really forgot. I don\u2019t even know my own name.\u201d</p><br/><p>The purple woman glared at him angrily. \u201cYou little bastard. There are 365 days in a year and you have forgotten 360 days. If you want to forget, I won\u2019t let you forget. I see that your leaves are itchy. Just wait for me to use you to catch insects!\u201d What type of magic metaphor was this?</p><br/><p>Then\u2026 what the hell was the setting for this flower? Was it a runaway train? He wasn\u2019t a Jiang soul. How did he end up like this?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hurriedly told him, \u201cNo, I have really forgotten.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman in purple cried out, \u201cDon\u2019t use amnesia as a cover. If you really forgot then why do you want to escape the marriage? Say you will marry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke sincerely, \u201cI can\u2019t remember at all. If getting married can really save the rose family, I will go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman in purple was stunned by these words.</p><br/><p>This was obviously something that the bold and mischievous little bastard wouldn\u2019t say.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really\u2026 have forgotten?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cYes, I don\u2019t even know your name.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou forgot me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman in purple finally believed that he lost his memory. Forget regaining his human form, even amnesia wasn\u2019t an easy thing.</p><br/><p>The woman in purple asked a few questions and Xie Xi really didn\u2019t know the answers. His expression wasn\u2019t fake (Xie Xi didn\u2019t know how she could see an expression on a white rose) and the woman\u2019s face became complicated. \u201cYou little bastard, how could you forget all of it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what is going on.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman in purple sighed. \u201cYour broken things, I know them clearly and will tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded and waited for the information to come.</p><br/><p>The woman in purple was called Purple Nine. She was a low-grade rose flower. This meant she hadn\u2019t lived for hundreds of years and wasn\u2019t comparable to the snow lotus who was born early on the cold mountain.</p><br/><p>Those with a low level had few names and were mostly sorted by colour.</p><br/><p>Purple Nine naturally wasn\u2019t the ninth purple rose in this family. She just inherited this name with strength.</p><br/><p>The serial number of each colour only went up to 12. After that, it didn\u2019t make much sense. They used the number they liked and didn\u2019t care if it was repeated.</p><br/><p>Only the first 12 numbers couldn\u2019t be used indiscriminately since they were obtained with strength.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cWhat is my name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Purple Nine replied, \u201cXie Xi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned. \u201cShouldn\u2019t I have no name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Purple Nine stared at him. \u201cYou are about to marry Lord Azure Dragon. How can you have no name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Well, he was a wildflower about to fly up a branch to become a phoenix. It was time to have a name. But Xie Xi\u2026 how was it his original name?</p><br/><p>Purple Nine told him, \u201cLord Azure Dragon spoils you and gave you the name of the flower god.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>Purple Nine sighed. \u201cHow can our rose family afford this name? You are nothing but a small rose with low mana. How can you stand it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wait a minute\u2026 Xie Xi got goosebumps. How did his name become the name of the flower god? His name was very ordinary and common. He wasn\u2019t Mary Sue, okay!</p><br/><p>And what was a flower god? Weren\u2019t most of them beautiful women?</p><br/><p>Purple Nine continued, \u201cThus, Lord Azure Dragon had high hopes for you. However, this naughty child\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She shook her head with real worries in her eyes. \u201cYou have to marry Lord Azure Dragon, even if it isn\u2019t for the rose family. You have inherited this name and in order to protect yourself, you have to rely on Lord Azure Dragon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t yet recovered from this colourful setting and laughed. \u201cIsn\u2019t it just a name\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate it!\u201d Purple Nine shouted. \u201cHow many flowers have been waiting and dreaming of obtaining the name of the flower god?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs a person bound to become a flower god with this name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Purple Nine replied solemnly. \u201cYou might not become a flower god with this name but without the name, you can\u2019t become a flower god.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He refused and wanted to resist this damned setting. He had a mad desire to change his name. Sein was very good and Colin was also good!</p><br/><p>Purple Nine told him, \u201cYou must not speak nonsense. Underestimating the words of the flowers means being abandoned by the god\u2019s pen and then Lord Azure Dragon can\u2019t protect you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Abandoned by the god\u2019s pen? Xie Xi was interested in this and directly asked.</p><br/><p>Purple Nine was stunned. \u201cYou really forgot everything. I can\u2019t believe you dared ask such a question!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt helpless. \u201cThus, I\u2019m really not lying to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Purple Nine explained, \u201cThe god\u2019s pen is an ancient relic which records everything on the mountain and sea continent. If abandoned by it, you will no longer exist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo longer exist?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it will erase everything you have. Your family and friends, your lover and everyone who knows you will forget you. You will even forget yourself and finally, your soul will be annihilated.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cYou will forget yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t simple amnesia. It is removing the meaning of your existence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very curious about this god\u2019s pen but Purple Nine shook her head when he tried to ask again. \u201cUs roses are humble and don\u2019t know much. In short, you should remember that the name of the flower god is written with the god\u2019s pen. You can\u2019t discard it. Once it is gone, you will disappear, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cWhat is counted as discarding it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Purple Nine replied, \u201cIf you don\u2019t deserve the name then it will be discarded.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned.</p><br/><p>Purple Nine opened her mouth. \u201cIf you are the companion of Lord Azure Dragon, you will always be worthy of this name. However, if you are just a small white rose in the rose family, you don\u2019t deserve this name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Xie Xi had to marry that Azure Dragon!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help thinking, \u2018This name was very bad. What the hell was this name? It was clearly placing a life or death charm on him!</p><br/><p>How could he dare escape this marriage now? Xie Xi felt\u2026 he feared the souls\u2019 misunderstanding and wasn\u2019t that afraid of life and death.</p><br/><p>Purple Nine had spoken roughly about the relationship between Azure Dragon and the little rose but now she said it in more detail.</p><br/><p>Every 10 years, there was a grand event on Baihua Mountain were sages were invited to visit. This time, it was fortunate enough to invite Sage Azure Dragon.</p><br/><p>By all accounted, Xie Xi was a little rose and wasn\u2019t qualified to go to Baihua Mountain. After all, not all of the rose family could go.</p><br/><p>Purple Nine was the leader of the younger generation of the rose family and she was close to Xie Xi. Xie Xi wanted to see his birthplace and she took him with her.</p><br/><p>Who knew that Xie Xi would be bored, go out to wander, fall into a valley and be saved. The person who saved him was Sage Azure Dragon.</p><br/><p>After that\u2026</p><br/><p>It was estimated that Purple Nine was just joking. In any case, her story was cliche and full of a teenage heart and pink bubbles.</p><br/><p>Finally, Azure Dragon went flying through the rose family\u2019s elders, found Purple Nine who was half his caretaker and finally proposed to Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t mention the flower family. The entire holy mountain received a shock that was like three earthquakes.</p><br/><p>Sage Azure Dragon actually wanted to marry a small flower?</p><br/><p>It was unbelievable! As the wedding date approached, the name of the flower god was given and everyone slowly accepted it.</p><br/><p>Then\u2026 the little flower ran away from the holy mountain!</p><br/><p>There was the sound of quick footsteps outside. \u201cDid you find Xiao Xie? Lord Azure Dragon has come to Rose Mountain!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

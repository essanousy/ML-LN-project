The skin that was originally as flawless as jade had a red dot on it. Jiang Xie\u2019s brain crashed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t see it but he knew the situation. He smiled and said, \u201cI was awakened by you early in the morning. Pushed you a few times before finally pushing you away and then I went to take a shower.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t alarmed on the surface but his heart was turbulent. Did he do this? He held and kissed Xie Xi?</p><br/><p>However, he had no impression or memory of it at all. Then indescribable remorse welled up in his chest. He kissed such delicate skin and forgot all about it?</p><br/><p>No\u2026 Jiang Xie quickly suppressed the regret that shouldn\u2019t be there. Xie Xi paid attention to his demeanour and could basically guess what this person was thinking. It was so much fun. Old Jiang actually had such a childish time.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi actually regretted it a bit. Why didn\u2019t he meet this person at an earlier time so he could see the real young Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie finally recovered his voice and spoke hoarsely, \u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t remember anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was influenced by someone for so long and grabbed some of the words. \u201cI haven\u2019t told you to take responsibility. Why so nervous?\u201d</p><br/><p>This succeeded in making Jiang Xie\u2019s ears turn red. Xie Xi felt itchy. He really wanted to kiss these rare red ears. Endure it! Don\u2019t scare the snake!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi cleared his throat. \u201cWell, it\u2019s nothing. It is normal to have a dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie refuted it. \u201cI didn\u2019t dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him. \u201cHmm? If you weren\u2019t dreaming then you were deliberately awake\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie cried out without waiting for him to finish, \u201cNo, I\u2026\u201d He himself didn\u2019t know what was going on!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought, \u2018Of course, you don\u2019t know. How else can I tease you?\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood a bit about Old Jiang\u2019s bad taste. It turned out that teasing kids was really interesting.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous.\u201d The \u2018proud of his age and experience\u2019 Xie Xi spoke. \u201cI don\u2019t care and you don\u2019t have to take it to heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sentence showed that as an adult, Xie Xi was still a bit young and was a lot worse than Old Jiang.</p><br/><p>This sentence instantly cooled Jiang Xie\u2019s hot heart and calm returned to the indigo eyes.</p><br/><p>This person didn\u2019t care. Yes, Jiang Xie laughed at himself. How could a rational care about such a thing?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie silently gave this person a \u2018frivolous\u2019 label in his heart. It was fortunate that Xie Xi couldn\u2019t read this child\u2019s mind or he would smash the small head!</p><br/><p>After eliminating the misunderstanding, Jiang Xie\u2019s mood was much better. He felt that Xie Xi might be a frivolous person but thought about everything Xie Xi praised for the United States and filtered out 99% of it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also noticed this person was in a good mood. He was busy teasing Little Jiang and the whole day was comfortable.</p><br/><p>The quasi-world had collapsed and he didn\u2019t know the original situation. He only knew that this world was facing the collapse of the universe and all civilizations were facing disaster.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had seen many sci-fi themes on Earth. There were solar system explosions, humans constructed an ark to escape. However, the ecological system of the ship was unstable and dragged Earth to ruin. The solar system was gone and new homes were found in the vast galaxy.</p><br/><p>This world was different. It wasn\u2019t the sun but the entire universe. Where could they flee to when the whole world was collapsing?</p><br/><p>This might be the despair and hopelessness of the collapsed world. Like a person infected with a zombie virus, its sense of reason was about to disappear but it was still unwilling to give up and wanted to live.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xie Xi really felt the difference between repairing and erasure. He was thankful to be a Repairer. Otherwise, it would be cruel to let a world of such desires be destroyed.</p><br/><p>A long day of work passed. Xie Xi was tired but his spirit was very good.</p><br/><p>On the aircraft, Xie Xi stated, \u201cI\u2019ll cook delicious food for you tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a clear sign of happiness on Earth. A person who wasn\u2019t in a good mood definitely wouldn\u2019t say such a thing.</p><br/><p>However, it was an inexplicable sentence in the United States.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was slightly stunned. \u201cIt\u2019s delicious?\u201d</p><br/><p>What was delicious? Food was just to obtain energy and many rational people would directly inject nutrient solution in order to save time.</p><br/><p>Some emotional people still adhered to the regular three meals a deal but this wasn\u2019t about delicious food. It was a sense of respect for past rituals.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t find it easy to explain and only said, \u201cIn short, you will know when you taste it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>The citizens of the United States didn\u2019t pursue food. Xie Xi might\u2019ve entered Central but he didn\u2019t spend the time taking physical potions. Food wasn\u2019t just about hunger. It was also a spiritual enjoyment for people.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was excited to cook. The high-tech world was good and he could make things at will, even if there were no pots and pans in this world.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned curiously against the door and asked, \u201cAre you cooking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi softly replied to him, \u201cThe president of the United States is cooking for you. Are you happy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him with curved eyes. Jiang Xie cocked his head and left with the word, \u201cBoring.\u201d Nevertheless, his heart was jumping and his eyes were full of smiles.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s cooking was good. In the past, he spent more than 60 years with Professor Jiang and was naturally in charge of the three meals.</p><br/><p>Professor Jiang would often say, \u201cThere is a snail boy at home and I can ask for anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi might\u2019ve spent thousands of years as the flower god but the flower god was in a spiritual state and there was no concept of time. Thus, he didn\u2019t cook.</p><br/><p>Not long afterwards, he easily placed three dishes and one soup on the table.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at it. \u201cWhat is the difference?\u201d</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t seem as beautiful as the machine but\u2026 um\u2026 it was very cute.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cTry it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sat down after Xie Xi and learnt from Xie Xi how to set a napkin and pick up chopsticks. Xie Xi watched as Jiang Xie picked up a piece of white onion and laughed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie glanced at him. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fried onion is mainly eaten with the lamb.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why eat a piece of onion alone? Jiang Xie told him, \u201cThey all aren\u2019t tasty.\u201d Despite his words, his chopsticks obediently picked up a piece of lamb.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked him, \u201cHow is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes curved. \u201cIs it delicious?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was probably having all the gourmet animations around him as fireworks burst from eating the most delicious food!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is good to eat.\u201d He never thought food would be like this.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was slightly relieved. He knew that many rational people had degraded tastebuds and they couldn\u2019t taste the food. It seemed that Jiang Xie still had his original body, despite it shrinking.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cTry this and this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t polite and one person ate all three dishes. Xie Xi only ate a few pieces but he was happy. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sincerely declared, \u201cYou are very good.\u201d He knew everything and did everything well.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi once again wanted to record this. The sentence should be repeated 20 hours a day for 260 days. Cough, although he would be the one listening, not Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Xiao Xie and Xi were very happy. The atmosphere of the two people became better and finally, Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t help asking about the collapse of the universe.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had been waiting for this and explained, \u201cI found this sign when I was 38 years old in my second round. At the time, it had started to decay. Explorers disappeared in the cloud galaxy. I sent a field probe and came to the conclusion that the galaxy clouds had disappeared.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s expression was serious. \u201cSince then, the United States banned the exploration of alien domains?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cThe people would panic if they discovered it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The universe collapsing was terrible. It would be hard to calculate what would happen once revealed to the United States.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi continued, \u201cThe speed of the collapse is faster than expected. By the time I was 98 in my second round, the Love Galaxy had fallen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was shocked. \u201cAlmost one billion light years collapsed in just 60 years?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cThe speed isn\u2019t constant. It is exponential growth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie understood and his thin lips were pale. \u201cThus, you estimate that the universe will completely collapse after 10 years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi closed his eyes. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the typical lotus pond effect.</p><br/><p>Suppose that a lotus leaf in a lotus pond grew exponentially. On the first day, two on the second day, four on the third day\u2026 perhaps in the first 40 days, the lotus leaves only covered a quarter of the pond. Then the next day, the lotus leaves suddenly covered half the pond. The day after that, the whole pond was full of lotus leaves.</p><br/><p>The speed of the universe collapsing was like this. It was very slow and undetectable at first. If it was ignored, they might suddenly lose all the universe.</p><br/><p>This was the scary thing about exponential growth.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie knew more. \u201c10 years is just the most optimistic estimate?\u201d</p><br/><p>All the words that could be controlled could be broken. This was the truth that civilization realized so far.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Perhaps the universe would be gone in the next moment.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was completely stunned. Xie Xi patted him on the shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t think too much. Hold onto your time and do everything you can so you don\u2019t regret it when the end comes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s shocked indigo eyes became calm again. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had told Jiang Xie this but they were here to fix the world. He definitely wouldn\u2019t let it collapse. It was best to coax Jiang Xie so he could help and not make trouble. After all, Jiang Xie was an important screw. It would be troublesome if he struck.</p><br/><p>The same evening, Jiang Xie refused to go to sleep with him. \u201cI won\u2019t run away and will sleep in the guest room.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was hesitant.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you being overly sensitive? Sleeping with me is also for your safety.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyebrows twisted. \u201cNo one can hurt me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are a newborn calf not afraid of tigers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi added, \u201cYou can go to the guest room but I will stay with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes widened. He was going to the guest room to sleep on his own. What was the point of this?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi insisted, \u201cIn any case, you must eat and sleep with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, Little Jiang compromised and lay on the bed like a piece of wood. He drew a clear line between the two of them.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought, \u2018If you have the ability then don\u2019t hesitate to come over!\u2019</p><br/><p>Just before dawn, Xie Xi was hot from being kissed. A rational gender referred to his mind but not his body.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his eyes and quickly said, \u201cDon\u2019t waste time. Tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie acted as a hooligan. \u201cYour Little Xie misses me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi exclaimed angrily, \u201cDon\u2019t touch it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t have much time but he couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cYou took the initiative in the daytime. I would\u2019ve long eaten you dry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glared at him. \u201cTalk business!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie felt a burst of dizziness and spoke quickly, \u201cThis world is a bit strange. Be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cDo you know how many souls there are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least three.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt a bit relieved hearing this amount.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cMy side task is to find the collapsed god. This should be an important clue and you should find a way to check.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s side task was also this. He wanted to ask again but this guy had already fallen asleep. So\u2026 why did he have to say something bad earlier? He made a fool of himself.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tried to push this heavy guy away. At this time, Jiang Xie opened his indigo eyes that were still a bit dazed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Jiang\u2019s senses instantly returned as he saw Xie Xi pressed underneath him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

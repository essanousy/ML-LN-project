Don\u2019t think like that!\u2019</p><br/><p>However, a succubus\u2019 habits were written in the textbook. If he said that he didn\u2019t wear clothes because they kept disappearing, it was estimated that all of Heaven and even the Demon World would laugh like it was the best joke all year.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t know where to place his eyes and the tip of his ears was red. He pretended to be calm, \u201cIt is fine without the school uniform. You can wear any clothes.\u201d His tone was as if he was spoiling Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said honestly, \u201cEverything I wear will disappear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie coaxed him. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the Demon World. It will cause confusion if you go out like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He knew and really wanted to wear clothes. The problem was that he really couldn\u2019t wear it.</p><br/><p>Poor Xie Xi was like a well-known liar who corrected his evil ways. No one would believe him even if he told the truth.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie requested, \u201cCan you put on some clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s brow furrowed and he was very embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie could be counted as finding a place to put his eyes. He didn\u2019t dare look at Xie Xi\u2019s body so he stared at Xie Xi\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>He saw the reluctance in Xie Xi\u2019s eyes and thought about the contents of the textbook. He quickly explained, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to wear clothes because you are ugly. In fact, you are beautiful. Just\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned and tried to keep up with this person\u2019s brain circuits.</p><br/><p>The succubus had a beautiful and sexy body. Making them wear clothes was like implying they were ugly.</p><br/><p>This was a great insult to succubi. It was quite rude, just like telling an angel they had a pair of chicken wings.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t angry about this\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s scalp was still numb. \u201cYou are just too good-looking that I don\u2019t want others to see it.\u201d He was startled when he finished, his heart beating like a drum.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was speechless. Did this person inadvertently speak the truth?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie reacted quickly and changed his words. \u201cI mean, us angels are used to guarding the beauty of things. I should protect your beautiful body well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was this coaxing a three year old succubus?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi inwardly rolled his eyes but his expression looked convinced. \u201cIt turned out to be like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw his posture loosen and let out a sigh. \u201cThen shall you put on some clothes first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was helpless. \u201cHowever, at night, my clothes will disappear. It can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke again. \u201cCan I wrap myself up in a quilt? A quilt won\u2019t disappear.\u201d</p><br/><p>A beautiful and thrilling succubus not wearing anything apart from a quilt. This would turn the welcome party into a bloody meeting!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s blood surged and his head felt like it was on fire. \u201cYou must wear clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is really the case. If you don\u2019t believe me then try it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t care. Hadn\u2019t they already done everything? It was unknown how many times the shameless Jiang Xie had dressed him.</p><br/><p>However, this was the first time for Gemini.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt a bit cold so he sat back on the bed and pulled up a quilt to cover himself.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t yet autumn and this quilt was thin. This only made him more attractive.</p><br/><p>As a member of the heavenly race, desire was forbidden. This didn\u2019t mean it was impossible. So again and again\u2026</p><br/><p>No, if you couldn\u2019t resist the temptation then he would be transferred from this dormitory. Then other people would live with Xie Xi\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know these thoughts or he would definitely think of a sentence: Old vinegar can cure a lustful heart.</p><br/><p>In order to not change dormitories, Jiang Xie promised, \u201cThen I will try it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke calmly, \u201cThank you for the trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>From this point of view, Xie Xi was quite suitable for the identity of a succubus. It was obvious that he wasn\u2019t dressed but he was relaxed while the well-dressed sacred angel was uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>As he was assisted to wear clothes, Xie Xi suspected that Jiang Xie would need to take off some clothes to dissipate the heat.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was sweating heavily after placing the first piece of clothing on Xie Xi. Once the clothing disappeared into the air, the white body was too close.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his mouth. \u201cLook, I didn\u2019t lie to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, I won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d As he spoke, his slim fingers touched Xie Xi\u2019s brow.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was surprised and didn\u2019t know what this person was doing.</p><br/><p>Then he felt a coolness pouring in from his brow and his strength seemed to be drained away.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie held him and had him sit on the bed. Xie Xi was full of doubts. Jiang Xie hurriedly helped him dress neatly. Xie Xi was like a puppet and didn\u2019t even have the strength to speak.</p><br/><p>The magical thing was this time he dressed and his clothes didn\u2019t disappear. Xie Xi was slightly surprised. Jiang Xie had a \u2018you see, your clothes didn\u2019t disappear\u2019 expression.</p><br/><p>The slow Xie Xi took a while to understand\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie used his \u2018magic\u2019 so the clothes wouldn\u2019t disappear?</p><br/><p>What was this? He couldn\u2019t wear clothes because he didn\u2019t want to wear them? That definitely wasn\u2019t it! Yet Jiang Xie threw the \u2018evidence\u2019 in front of him.</p><br/><p>After seeing Xie Xi\u2019s displeased face, Jiang Xie raised his eyebrows and sighed. \u201cIf you really don\u2019t want to wear clothes then don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>He removed the enchantment, restored Xie Xi\u2019s magic and the clothes immediately disappeared.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t care about this passive skill. He was curious. Would Jiang Xie actually let Xie Xi go out naked?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was Jiang Xie after all. Vinegar was his essence.</p><br/><p>He said, \u201cIt is fine not to attend the welcome party.\u201d</p><br/><p>It turned out to be giving up the welcome party.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it important to attend the welcome party?\u201d Once he finished speaking, he regretted it. Sure enough, Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes became, \u2018Do you attend the welcome meeting in the Demon World without clothes?\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was dumbfounded. His demon World wasn\u2019t like this. What was in Jiang Xie\u2019s yellow skull?</p><br/><p>However, this filthiest man was pretending to be a holy angel and patiently coaxed him, \u201cIf you want to go then you have to wear clothes. If you don\u2019t want to wear clothes then you can\u2019t go.\u201d</p><br/><p>This seemed to be giving him a choice but in fact, there were no options. No matter what option he chose, he would still be a pervert.</p><br/><p>He wanted to go but unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t get dressed. If he didn\u2019t go then it 100% showed that he disliked clothes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t have a choice. He turned over in the bed and wrapped himself up in the quilt. \u201cI won\u2019t go.\u201d</p><br/><p>This looked like he was sulking.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie put himself in the other person\u2019s shoes, thought about the succubus\u2019 nature and apologized. \u201cIt is my bad. Don\u2019t be angry. I know that making you dress is as uncomfortable as us not dressing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the Xie Xi in the quilt almost spat out, \u2018Old Jiang, your face!\u2019</p><br/><p>It was no wonder why God Yan always liked to scold him. Xie Xi also experienced the essence of it. He wouldn\u2019t be comfortable if he didn\u2019t scold Jiang Xie!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was still changing his angle of thinking. \u201cThe fact that you came to Heaven as an exchange student shows you are the best student. I can see that you are diligent and eager to learn. You listen carefully and are interested in the history of Heaven\u2026\u201d He saw Xie Xi reading the history in the bookstore.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie continued, \u201cYou are alone in a strange place and it is normal not to adapt. Can we do it slowly? If you come to this world, you have to dress well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to talk.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie kept comforting him. \u201cAs long as you wear clothes outside, you can go back to the dormitory and not wear them. I won\u2019t care.\u201d</p><br/><p>Look at his pleading tone, his indulgent attitude and his understanding posture.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He felt that he couldn\u2019t wait to go back to Central. He wanted to commit domestic violence now!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was still very ethical. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t going to the welcome party then I will accompany you in the dormitory.\u201d</p><br/><p>How good, kind and holy was the angel Jiang Xie? He was breaking his heart for the succubus that didn\u2019t like to wear clothing.</p><br/><p>Finally, the two people didn\u2019t go to the welcome party. There was no way. Xie Xi wasn\u2019t willing to wear clothes (get lost) and Jiang Xie was afraid he would be lonely, and justifiably stayed to accompany him.</p><br/><p>The teachers understood the situation. After knowing the details, he directly praised Jiang Xie. \u201cThis treatment is very good. A succubus who doesn\u2019t wear clothes will cause too much confusion for the students but we shouldn\u2019t wrong him and should respect his choice. Student Jiang, you are working hard to get along with your roommate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was humble. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the room, Xie Xi rolled his eyes up to the school. It truly was hard. Jiang Xie worked hard to design such a wonderful world!</p><br/><p>The campus life of Succubus Xie and Angel Jiang officially kicked off.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie took care of Xie Xi very well. He delivered three meals a day on time, afraid that the hungry Xie Xi would go and hook people.</p><br/><p>At night, he closed the window and gave Xie Xi comfortable space to be naked.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi learnt more about the world in these days.</p><br/><p>Heaven and the Demon World were in harmony. In order to be more respectful and understand each other better, every year there would be an exchange of excellent students to experience the other school.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi came to Heavenly University as an exchange student from the Demon World. It was reasonable to say that a student of Heaven would\u2019ve gone to the Demon World as an exchange student.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was quite worried about this compatriot at first. He came to Heaven and went from never wearing clothes to wearing them. The exchange student from Heaven would go from wearing clothes to not wearing clothes\u2026</p><br/><p>The situation that was worst was obvious at first glance.</p><br/><p>Later, Xie Xi understood that the exchange wasn\u2019t carried out at the same time.</p><br/><p>For example, Xie Xi was current in Heaven. After a year, a student from Heaven would go to the Demon World.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mind worked and he asked Jiang Xie, \u201cWill you join me in the Demon World next year?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cIt depends on whether I can pass the assessment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cWhat assessment?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, the two people had been together for a month but it was the first time Jiang Xie saw Xie Xi like this. He asked, \u201cDo you want me to go to the Demon World?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi naturally wanted it. Besides, he believed that if Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t pass this assessment, other people couldn\u2019t even think of it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cYou are taking care of me like this. I will take good care of you in the Demon World.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s lips curved, his expression happy.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked again, \u201cWhat type of assessment is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie glanced at him, head buzzing. \u201cYou will be an adult at the end of the year. I have to withstand the temptation of an adult succubus before I am qualified to go to the Demon World.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi helped translate for him. \u201cThis means I have to seduce you at the end of the year and you have to hold on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie thought the other person wasn\u2019t at ease and promised, \u201cI will try my best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pursed his lips. \u201cI will be merciful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told you, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything. An adult succubus can make people crazy by doing nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was speechless. He really didn\u2019t understand these wonderful settings.</p><br/><p>After holding on for so long, Jiang Xie finally revealed his fox tail. \u201cHowever, we can practice a bit in private.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cHrmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie whispered softly, \u201cIf you have time on weekdays, try to seduce me. Perhaps my resistance will grow.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

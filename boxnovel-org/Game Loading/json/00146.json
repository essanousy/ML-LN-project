The so-called repairing Azure Dragon\u2019s scales, Vermilion Bird\u2019s feathers and Nine Tails\u2019 tails\u2026 they were all rumours?</p><br/><p>The flower god hadn\u2019t met them? Xie Xi felt there was something wrong but he temporarily couldn\u2019t think about it.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails saw that Xie Xi was in a daze and felt restless. \u201cHouqing treated you as the flower god.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, he didn\u2019t forget to emphasize this even after becoming a little fox.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hesitated. He was worried about his Repair skill. Would Nine Tails think he was the reincarnation of the flower god and become more uneasy? After all, Nine Tails didn\u2019t know the flower god before but the flower god was involved with Houqing.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails thought he was worried about the tail thing and lazily lay in Xie Xi\u2019s arms. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry. I can spend a lifetime with you even if I only have one tail.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was worthy of being from the \u2018same source.\u2019 The dragon and fox thought the same. It was as if Xie Xi\u2019s life was their life and the extra time was irrelevant.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed softly and confessed, \u201cMaybe I can fix your tail.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails didn\u2019t take it seriously. \u201cHow can you fix it? Will you give me a petal as a tail? Oh, I can\u2019t bear it.\u201d Once there wasn\u2019t any drama, his poor mouth was exposed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi explained about what he had done on Rose Mountain and as expected, Nine Tails was stunned. \u201cRepair?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails\u2019 eyes flashed. \u201cLike the flower god?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know because I have never seen the flower god.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could basically guess what he was thinking and softly comforted him. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I got this ability but I know who I am and what I want.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails stared at him. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes curved. \u201cI want to be with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails trembled as he turned back into his human form. He hugged Xie Xi and kissed him on the forehead. \u201cIn fact, repairing my tails doesn\u2019t matter. In any case\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cWhat if I live for more than two or three hundred years?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails was stunned.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi added, \u201c\u2026Please don\u2019t live me alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words were good and gave Nine Tails infinite power. Two or three hundred years was quite long for mortals but for Nine Tails, it was like two or three months. If a couple could only stay together for two or three months, how tragic would it be?</p><br/><p>How could he not be willing to stay together for a longer time?</p><br/><p>Previously, Nine Tails hadn\u2019t dared think about it. Once there was the possibility, the desire was like a magic bean that rooted itself and grew into a towering tree.</p><br/><p>He wanted to be together forever, he wanted to make every moment eternal!</p><br/><p>Nine Tails wondered, \u201cIs there any harm to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>An injury was unavoidable. He had almost fainted from physical exhaustion when repairing Azure Dragon\u2019s scale. This time, it was estimated to be worse.</p><br/><p>However, Xie Xi didn\u2019t say this. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I have repaired thousands of flowers and don\u2019t think anything will happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails was cautious. \u201cThen we\u2019ll try it first. If you feel uncomfortable, immediately stop.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt very soft. \u201cYour Excellency, can you not think about me first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails was surprised and then his lips curved. \u201cI don\u2019t think about you all the time but my heart is full of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>These familiar words of love caused Xie Xi to chuckle. \u201cThen you should also give me a chance to think about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He smiled so sweetly that he fed sugar to Nine Tails. Nine Tails hugged him hard and said, \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cHrmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is so beautiful\u2026I always feel like I\u2019m dreaming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned and the warmth in his heart decreased. In a way, this was truly a dream. The past had long gone and Nine Tails gave everything only for the white rose to forget him.</p><br/><p>He became a substitute for the white rose, only for the white rose to forget him. This was extremely cruel.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a dream.\u201d Xie Xi slowly spoke from within his arms. \u201cAs long as the two of us are real, it isn\u2019t a dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a dream but the two people were the truth.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had spoken these words to Xie Xi after Dream Come True and now Xie Xi told him the same words.</p><br/><p>Their truth was proven by each other, and this was the truest truth.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tried to fix Nine Tails. To his surprise, he finished one tail and didn\u2019t feel too tired.</p><br/><p>Was Nine Tails\u2019 injury lighter than Azure Dragon? This wasn\u2019t right. One was a tail and the other was a scale. The scale shouldn\u2019t be any lighter than the tail.</p><br/><p>Or perhaps it was because of the painting? This wasn\u2019t really a repair? It shouldn\u2019t be. Then what the hell was going on? Did he experience a surge of power overnight?</p><br/><p>After fixing a tail, Nine Tails nervously asked him, \u201cHow do you feel.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cI feel that you can cover the sky.\u201d This was teasing him because in the Demon Sea, it was rumoured that once Nine Tails spread out his tails, he could cover the sky.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails smiled.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s thoughts changed. \u201cI think it might not be covering the sky but a peacock opening his tail.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young fox doctor present laughed out loud. Nine Tails stared at him before glancing back at Xie Xi. \u201cNaughty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi started looking forward to Nine Tails\u2019 open screen!</p><br/><p>Once he got to the third tail, Xie Xi knew why he didn\u2019t lose power. It was because\u2026</p><br/><p>Hint in the lower right corner: [The number one puppet has reached its limit and has been destroyed.]</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was silent. Had he accidentally killed the first puppet with exhaustion?</p><br/><p>It was shameful\u2026 Xie Xi solemnly apologized. \u2018Number one, you are much better than Siri!\u2019</p><br/><p>The puppet was exhausted after repairing three tails. It seemed that he couldn\u2019t see Nine Tails\u2019 screen today. He repaired one more tail and drooped.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails immediately noticed. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi reassured him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I just used a bit of strength and will be fine after some rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>The green fox doctor hurriedly said, \u201cThis is already a miracle. Someone can fix the tails of Nine Tails! The legendary flower god\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t finish his words before Nine Tails glared at him. The green fox shut up.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails ordered, \u201cGo bring some jade dew over.\u201d</p><br/><p>The green fox bowed and rushed out.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew that Nine Tails didn\u2019t want to know about the flower god and didn\u2019t mention it. He only said, \u201cI can repair your other tails after two days of rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no hurry. There is plenty of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t agree. \u201cThat time is for enjoyment. I don\u2019t want you to be affected by pain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, I\u2019m enjoying this moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t say anything to the soul.</p><br/><p>The second puppet was soon created and Xie Xi knew his upper limit was three tails. Thus, he stopped after repairing two.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, there was no way to selectively consume his strength. Otherwise he would consume his own physical strength instead of the puppet and could repair three without the puppet dying.</p><br/><p>In any case, it wasn\u2019t urgent. There were only two tails left and he could recover his physical strength after a few days.</p><br/><p>Once all nine tails were repaired, Xie Xi stared at Nine Tails\u2019 body.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails was still in the mood to tease. \u201cDo you want to see me open a tail screen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Nine Tails was Jiang Xie and he leaned closer to Xie Xi. \u201cA peacock only opens his screen in courtship. You have to take responsibility.\u201d</p><br/><p>This shameless flirty fox!</p><br/><p>Then Xie Xi saw an extremely shocking scene.</p><br/><p>The real Nine Tails wasn\u2019t a weak fox. Once he recovered, he was dozens of times larger and his tails unfolded, making Xie Xi realize what it meant to cover the sky.</p><br/><p>The large amount of silver light was very beautiful and strong. Even the sunlight receded like it was difficult to compete with him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned and as he stared into the silver eyes, he couldn\u2019t help wondering, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails stared at him with clear silver eyes, his voice seeming to ring in the depths of Xie Xi\u2019s heart. \u201cI have no name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi involuntarily said, \u201cFox Nine.\u201d</p><br/><p>The nine-tailed silver fox cocked his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will call you Fox Nine in the future, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Xie Xi\u2019s voice fell, a strong pull hit him. He realized that he would be ejected and looked at Nine Tails as Nine Tails shouted, \u201cWhere are you going? Xie Xi, where the hell are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi left the god\u2019s wisdom. He returned to reality but his soul still hadn\u2019t returned.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2026 where was Jiang Xie? He entered the god\u2019s wisdom with Jiang Xie next to him. He couldn\u2019t help looking around to find him. However, Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t be found.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned and stared at the god\u2019s wisdom. He found that the painting on the scroll had changed. It was no longer the Nine Tailed Fox Palace in a world of ice and snow. Instead, it was a lifelike nine-tailed silver fox with his tails unfolded in a majestic manner.</p><br/><p>He stared at Xie Xi with silver eyes full of attachment. Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help stepping forward to take the painting. There was a bang and the painting fell, becoming a small book. Xie Xi picked it up and saw the words: Nine Tailed Fox Nine.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tried to open it but it was like there was a ward on the book. It couldn\u2019t be opened. What was going on? Where did Nine Tails go?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at the system prompt in the lower right corner.</p><br/><p>[Side Task: The nine tailed fox illustration has been collected. The completion degree is 100% and the total progress is 50%.]</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his roster and at the same time, the small book turned into a scroll that was incorporated into the roster. Then the illustration of the nine tailed fox emerged. He looked at Xie Xi as if asking, \u2018Where are you?\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi reached out and touched it, full of doubts. What was going on? After collecting the illustration, Nine Tails was sealed into the god\u2019s wisdom? What was the god\u2019s wisdom? What happened once an existence was sealed?</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Nine Tails wasn\u2019t here so Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t either. He couldn\u2019t discuss it with Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Then there was a loud scream from Red Two outside the door. \u201c99! Something big is happening!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s nerves tightened and he hurriedly opened the door. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Red Two took him by the hand. \u201cWe must hurry and get out of here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi followed him and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Red Two ran as he explained, \u201cSage White Tiger suddenly launched an attack on Demon Sea and is fighting with Ancestor Houqing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t figured out Nine Tails\u2019 location and now these two were fighting?</p><br/><p>Red Two added, \u201cIt\u2019s really wicked. I don\u2019t know where the white rose came from. He actually hooked up with two demon ancestors from Demon Sea and also fascinated the heart of Sage White Tiger, causing him to be furious and filled with the desire to slaughter all of Demon Sea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare be careless. This was very much like something that Old Three could do!</p><br/><p>In Atlantis, Xie Xi discovered that the soul with the highest combat power was the third prince (White Tiger), followed by the sixth prince (Houqing). If these two people fought, it would really be a catastrophe in various ways.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cI will go and see.\u201d He couldn\u2019t let them fight or the whole quasi-world would collapse!</p><br/><p>Red Two wondered, \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of you going? The most important one is the white rose.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the white rose.\u201d</p><br/><p>Red Two, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

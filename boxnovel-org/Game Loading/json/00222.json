It was as if all the strength was exhausted and the last blood of life was falling.</p><br/><p>The back of the man standing in front of the floor to ceiling window was straight but the shirt showed a large gap. In particular, the waist was so thin that it was distressing.</p><br/><p>In this one month\u2026 hadn\u2019t this person eaten any good meals?</p><br/><p>During the one month abroad, Jiang Xie hadn\u2019t wanted to think about Xie Xi. In fact, as long as he was idle, he couldn\u2019t help thinking about Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>However, he was too afraid to look. Turning on the phone would allow him to connect to the monitor and see Xie Xi\u2019s every move.</p><br/><p>Yet Jiang Xie didn\u2019t dare take a single look. It was like facing Pandora\u2019s Box. If he didn\u2019t look at it, he wouldn\u2019t be tempted. He was afraid that one glance would make him return home.</p><br/><p>This gap created by Jiang Xie could be regarded as giving Xie Xi enough time. He had a comfortable time this one month.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t look at Xie Xi but Xie Xi always paid attention to Jiang Xie. The monitoring was very useful and even Jiang Xie\u2019s breathing while sleeping at night could be transmitted to Xie Xi\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi went to see him several times and even got close to him using the stealth charm.</p><br/><p>While staying in the office, Xie Xi was very comfortable. Once he interfered with the cameras, he could casually enjoy himself.</p><br/><p>It was nothing to read books. If he was tired of reading books then he would play with high-tech gadgets and he could also practice his drawing skills.</p><br/><p>There might be the sketch pen and it was bound to him for life but he couldn\u2019t always rely on it. For example, this quasi-world emptied out all his other skills and items. What if there was a world where he couldn\u2019t take the sketch pen?</p><br/><p>In short, there was no harm in practicing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi only moved his chopsticks when outsiders sent him food. Privately, he drew whatever he wanted to eat.</p><br/><p>There was the enhanced version of the slimming pill, causing Xie Xi to become thinner. In one month, he lost 5 kilograms. He was already really thin so it was miserable to lose 5 kilograms.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie hadn\u2019t seen Xie Xi for one month. It was natural to be shocked.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stirred up some emotions, made sure he wouldn\u2019t burp and slowly turned around\u2026</p><br/><p>This picture was very moving.</p><br/><p>The exquisite face became smaller because it was thinner while the eyes became bigger. The lips were dry and the colour was very light, presumably from malnutrition\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart was tugged.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s voice was hoarse (from choking) as he asked, \u201cYou came back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Theoretically, Xie Xi didn\u2019t know what Jiang Xie was doing and didn\u2019t know that Jiang Hong had recovered.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you been eating well?\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, Xie Xi had been eating well. He ate food from all over the world, including China, France, Italy, Japan, Korea and Thailand.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cI have no appetite.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t say anything. He just took off his coat and went to the kitchen.</p><br/><p>It hadn\u2019t been used for one month but the kitchen contained fresh vegetables, which were prepared by the daily cleaning people.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t sure when Jiang Xie would come back and their job was to change the fresh vegetables every day. The types were prepared according to the schedule and they never changed it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wanted to cook rice but he looked at Xie Xi and was afraid of his indigestion. Thus, he changed it to porridge and didn\u2019t put anything apart from a few green vegetables.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sat outside worrying.</p><br/><p>It was reasonable to say that this meal should be eaten. He had been hungry for so long and Jiang Xie finally came back and personally cooked a meal. Eating it would give extra points.</p><br/><p>However\u2026 he couldn\u2019t support it.</p><br/><p>Not only did he eat dinner, he swallowed a mouthful of dessert.</p><br/><p>Now he was panicked. He couldn\u2019t exercise to eliminate the food. After all, he was skinny and if he jumped around\u2026 it would be poisonous!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was afraid that Xie Xi would be hungry and cooked quickly. The porridge was made in a pressure cooker and the speed was incredibly fast.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at the table full of dishes, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome over and eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were all food that Xie Xi loved to eat, light but delicious homemade dishes.</p><br/><p>If Xie Xi hadn\u2019t eaten a bowl of pork bone ramen, chestnut fish and strawberry mochi, he would really want to eat it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie watched Xie Xi have no appetite and frowned even more. \u201cYou aren\u2019t eating. Do you mean to starve yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi picked up the chopsticks and caught a small pea.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really wasn\u2019t able to eat. If he knew that Jiang Xie would come back, he wouldn\u2019t have sneaked so much food.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie felt pained and uncomfortable. He also couldn\u2019t eat and put down his chopsticks, asking him, \u201cWithout Chengyu, you don\u2019t even have the strength to eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s spirit was shocked and he finally led Jiang Xie to the right track.</p><br/><p>His dazed expression fell into Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes and there was a burst of pain in his heart. \u201cDo you think I will be soft if you look like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi raised his emotions and shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was unsure what question he was answering.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke softly, \u201cI just think it is quite boring.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps his body was so weak that it made his voice as light as a whisper. If it wasn\u2019t so quiet, Jiang Xie wouldn\u2019t have heard his words.</p><br/><p>After listening to the answer, Jiang Xie\u2019s heart trembled and an uncontrollable sourness spread in his chest.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wondered, \u201cDo you live just for the sake of Chengyu?\u201d This Chengyu represented Xie Xi\u2019s ambition but he didn\u2019t have the heart to say it in such a straightforward manner.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at Jiang Xie in a startled manner. \u201cOtherwise, what else can I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stumped by the question.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at the meal in front of him and spoke slowly, \u201cI have never been as idle as I am now. I have always been working hard, struggling to go up.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time Jiang Xie saw such a Xie Xi. The dazzling aura was removed and the exquisite camouflage faded away, revealing a Xie Xi that had never been seen before.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was very clear about Xie Xi\u2019s experiences. Or it should be said that no one in D City\u2019s financial circles didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>He was a child of the Xie family. Due to some enmity, his mother left that life and took him away.</p><br/><p>His father married someone else and it wasn\u2019t long before he gave birth to Xie Xi\u2019s younger brother.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mother was depressed and committed suicide when Xie Xi was seven.</p><br/><p>What could a seven year old child do? It was hard to live.</p><br/><p>He was sent to the orphanage and after being tossed around, he recognized his ancestors at the age of 11.</p><br/><p>It was reasonable to say that such a child would find it difficult to integrate into family life but Xie Xi was exceptionally good.</p><br/><p>He had experienced all types of hardships from a young age and knew how to observe people.</p><br/><p>At the age of 11, he knew how to be pleasing. He got along very well with everyone, from his stepmother, his brother who was two years younger than him, his driver and even the gardener at home.</p><br/><p>Not only that, he was clever and had a fast learning ability. He thought that it would take some time to adjust to school life. Who would\u2019ve thought he would\u2019ve jumped classes at the age of 12?</p><br/><p>He already received a college degree overseas at the age of 16.</p><br/><p>After returning to China, he was even more astounding. He helped his father enter the board of Chengyu and gradually expanded Chengyu into a big group that couldn\u2019t be ignored in D City.</p><br/><p>Under these glamourous achievements was his ruthless heart.</p><br/><p>Outsiders didn\u2019t know what he did but his father got depression and stayed in the hospital. His stepmother had a horrific scandal exposed and her cheating bed photos became a joke in the circle. His half-brother was arrogant and incompetent. While racing with people in the middle of the night, he failed to brake and flew off a cliff, his body not being found.</p><br/><p>By the time Xie Xi was 24 years old, he was completely alone.</p><br/><p>Four years later, he met Jiang Xie and took away the Lance Project. He was in full swing and led Chengyu to a peak that no one could\u2019ve imagined.</p><br/><p>After the peak was downhill.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had to bear the consequences of his early years. Jiang Xie returned like a cheetah and destroyed his hard-built castle.</p><br/><p>As Xie Xi stated, he had never been idle. This month was unprecedented for him but it was also boring and meaningless.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie realized this but he also knew that Xie Xi was likely acting. He might indeed feel bored but he was still putting on a show.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw through this but he was still affected. As long as he thought that 30% of this play was true, his heart was stirred up.</p><br/><p>\u201cLife is more than that.\u201d Jiang Xie told Xie Xi. \u201cYou can see more if you put aside Chengyu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at him. \u201cBut I have nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have family left, all his friends were gone after the loss of Chengyu and his subordinates belonged to others. Even his office wasn\u2019t his own.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie raised his eyebrows and said nothing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt the fire was almost ready and he had to take his time, not be too anxious. He had almost digested the previous food and could barely eat.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi \u2018braced his spirit\u2019 and said, \u201cThe porridge is really fragrant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEat something. Your body can\u2019t stand it if you are always hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded and shoved down half a bowl of porridge.</p><br/><p>This really didn\u2019t need acting. He ate so much that he wouldn\u2019t be tempted even by exotic delicacies!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t continue the topic from before. It seemed he didn\u2019t want to stimulate Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was also happy and carefully reflected on his operation.</p><br/><p>In fact, Xie Xi wasn\u2019t sure if this was the key to repairing the world but this was what Xie Xi wanted to convey to Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s mood was very weak and there were always hidden dangers. Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to miss it if there was an opportunity to dig out the thorns buried in his flesh and blood.</p><br/><p>This was a good opportunity. Xie Xi took advantage of his identity to let Jiang Xie observe the psychology of the world from one angle.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s coaxing wouldn\u2019t necessarily dig out this thorn.</p><br/><p>However, if he let himself become weary with the world then Jiang Xie would pay attention to caring for him and get rid of this imprisonment.</p><br/><p>Regardless of whether the world was repaired or not, Xie Xi wanted to face this emotion with Jiang Xie. No matter what happened previously, they now had each other.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s calculations were excellent and he performed very well.</p><br/><p>In the evening, he slept very unsteadily. It was no wonder since he slept and ate so much during the day.</p><br/><p>This caused Jiang Xie to feel emotional instability and he tossed and turned in a sleepless manner all night.</p><br/><p>After three or four days of persistence, Xie Xi clearly felt that Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t hold on anymore.</p><br/><p>What would happen next? Was he going to return Chengyu? If this was true, what to do\u2026 Xie Xi was very satisfied with his current life and didn\u2019t want to go to work!</p><br/><p>As he thought about it, Xie Xi suddenly felt his body become empty. He opened his eyes and saw a blank space.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had experienced this once before and immediately reacted\u2026 white space?</p><br/><p>Did Jiang Xie use this forbidden technique again? Xie Xi thought of the man\u2019s tragic appearance in the garden and his expression suddenly changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat nonsense is this\u2026 I\u2019m perfectly fine!\u201d Xie Xi wanted to swear.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled and pulled the person over for a kiss. How could Xie Xi willingly push him away?</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the white space had time constraints and they couldn\u2019t stay for too long. Jiang Xie reached into Xie Xi\u2019s clothes and rubbed his belly. \u201cYou really aren\u2019t hungry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi grabbed the thief\u2019s hand. \u201cOf course not\u2026\u201d He froze as he realized. \u201cDo you know what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the world of the collapsed god, Jiang Xie didn\u2019t know exactly what happened before he recycled the soul.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cI know that you are starving yourself to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is all fake. I was just pretending.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned over and kissed his forehead. \u201cYes, I saw it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew that time was tight and quickly asked the main point. \u201cWhat is your situation in this collapsed world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cIt is a state of integration. Without entering the white space, I only have the memories of the soul.\u201d Jiang Xie only remembered everything once he entered here.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood and said, \u201cI believe that the 12 boundaries are 12 collapsed worlds mixed together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie nodded. \u201cIt is possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him. \u201cAfter this time, all your souls will probably return.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie felt this person\u2019s thoughts and his heart warmed. \u201cYou are here. They will return to me sooner or later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glared at him and then became worried. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in danger. How could you activate the white space?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sighed. \u201cIt is because I think you are in danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned\u2026 he pretended too much that Taurus truly believed it!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Houqing told him, \u201cWe don\u2019t need names so it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cDidn\u2019t you want them before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that time, we were small and not sensible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at the portrait of White Tiger and whispered, \u201cWhat do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing didn\u2019t speak. White Tiger\u2019s tone wasn\u2019t very good. \u201cThe name doesn\u2019t matter. Don\u2019t draw anymore in the future.\u201d Then he bent and picked up Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d Xie Xi was startled and stared at this silly tiger. \u201cWhy? In addition, put me down.\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger told him, \u201cGo back to the house. It is cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can go by myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger retorted, \u201cWhy? You are as light as a petal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt that his dignity as a father had disappeared. He had been sleeping for 15 years and became lighter!</p><br/><p>They returned to the house and Xie Xi questioned them, \u201cWhat are you so nervous about? I\u2019m just getting older\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people glanced at each other and Houqing\u2019s eyes were serious while White Tiger looked fierce. Then they spoke in unison, \u201cDon\u2019t say that! You\u2019re not old at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He really felt like he took one step into the tomb.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you panicking about? I have lived longer than both of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, Xie Xi\u2019s words were just a bluff. No one knew how long the flower god had lived. The only thing certain was that they couldn\u2019t imagine it. Their short life was like the blink of an eye in front of the flower god. Xie Xi said he lived longer than them and they believed it.</p><br/><p>Houqing\u2019s demeanour became much more soothing, \u201c\u2026I just hope that you can sleep less.\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger added, \u201cYou slept for 15 years. The next time you sleep, I will be dead when you wake up\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glared at him. \u201cNonsense!\u201d</p><br/><p>He said he was old and they didn\u2019t listen. They tried to persuade him and he couldn\u2019t hear anymore.</p><br/><p>White Tiger muttered, \u201cThen you will\u2026\u201d His voice was very low and awkward. It was amazing since it didn\u2019t fit his personality. \u201cSpend more time with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart instantly softened into water. He looked at the painting in his hand before rubbing White Tiger\u2019s head and whispering, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sky was getting dark when Azure Dragon came back. He was still young when they first met and now that he saw Xie Xi, his indigo eyes were filled with amazement.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was aware of it and felt moved. Yes, at the time, Azure Dragon had been too small and his angle of view was limited. It was estimated that he didn\u2019t see Xie Xi\u2019s appearance.</p><br/><p>However, shouldn\u2019t Azure Dragon have visited when Xie Xi was sleeping? Perhaps he looked different awake compared to when he was sleeping?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t quite understand.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon\u2019s emotions were hidden very quickly. He bent down and bowed. \u201cLord Flower God.\u201d It was a clear tone with a youthful air.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes curved and he smiled. \u201cCome over and let me see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time seeing Azure Dragon\u2019s human form and wanting to see it was normal.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon approached and stared into his eyes. Well\u2026 189 centimetres was already really tall!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart itched. \u201cCan you change back to your body to let me see?\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing and Azure Dragon immediately cried out, \u201cDon\u2019t draw.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cThese brothers are too unseemly. You just allowed me to draw you but you won\u2019t allow me to draw your brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon frowned. \u201cYou just woke up and need to rest. Drawing is laborious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t happy. \u201cYou have grown up and your wings are hard. You aren\u2019t even willing to show me your body.\u201d</p><br/><p>He slightly lowered his voice and one tiger and dragon became nervous. Azure Dragon replied, \u201cYou can see whatever you want, just\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi interrupted. \u201cDon\u2019t draw?\u201d</p><br/><p>The three men nodded. Xie Xi knew it wasn\u2019t easy to fool them and ended up saying, \u201cWhat are you afraid of? You have existed for a long time so how can I draw another one of you into existence?\u201d</p><br/><p>The words stunned all three people. In particular, Houqing\u2019s thin lips trembled. \u201cSure enough, you drew the Holy Mountain and Demon Sea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was too difficult to explain, whether it was true or not. White Tiger and Azure Dragon\u2019s demeanours were very solemn as Azure Dragon asked, \u201cDid you sleep for so long because of the creation of the Holy Mountain and Demon Sea?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi answered, \u201cSort of.\u201d</p><br/><p>The trio were unanimous. \u201cWhy create them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Why\u2026</p><br/><p>How to explain it\u2026</p><br/><p>If there were no Holy Mountain and Demon Sea, where would the sages and demon ancestors in the future come from?</p><br/><p>Without them, where did this world come from? Where did the roses come from and where did the flower god come from?</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it for us?\u201d The three people already had the answer. The outside world was chaotic and there were evil things, but those in the flower world didn\u2019t have to worry about that. The flower god and flowers could stay in the flower world without worrying about the things happening outside.</p><br/><p>Then the flower god painted the Holy Mountain and Demon Sea, painting a different world and creating a new world for them.</p><br/><p>During these 15 years, they travelled all over the Holy Mountain and Demon Sea, looking at the grass and trees, the mountain and the water. They thought that everything came from the flower god\u2019s pen and only had admiration and awe in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked a seemingly unrelated topic. \u201cDo you believe in fate?\u201d</p><br/><p>None of the three could answer. Xie Xi told them, \u201cDon\u2019t believe in it. You just have to believe in yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was to leave a path for them in the countless years in the future. Xie Xi still painted Azure Dragon\u2019s body and then caught the nine tailed fox.</p><br/><p>He already had the illustration of Nine Tails but it didn\u2019t matter. He still drew it to the same standards. Houqing\u2019s painting was already done so he was always a human. Xie Xi didn\u2019t need to look to draw Houqing.</p><br/><p>As he drew, the four people were worried that he would fall asleep again. Fortunately, Xie Xi\u2019s state was very good and showed no signs of exhaustion.</p><br/><p>He also loved these drawings. He couldn\u2019t help staring at them and the people gradually let go of their worries.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew that he wouldn\u2019t \u2018disappear\u2019 as long as he didn\u2019t\u2019 write their names.</p><br/><p>The bird was the last one.</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird was the youngest and the time he had transformed into a human was also the shorted. His impression of Xie Xi was slightly shallow and he flew further away. After receiving the news, he flew for three days before returning.</p><br/><p>It was supposed to be this day and Xie Xi was very excited, so he decided to have a party.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails and Houqing went to prepare food, Azure Dragon and White Tiger went to get some fresh things and the bored Xie Xi sunbathed in the garden.</p><br/><p>He flipped the album in his hand with a faint smile.</p><br/><p>Then there was a fascinating bird song and a red light crossed the sky before a teenager in gorgeous feathered clothes fell in the sea of flowers.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up and thought this little bird had really returned. The teenage Vermilion Bird didn\u2019t chirp like he did as a child. He was beautiful and graceful.</p><br/><p>His facial features were most like Jiang Xie and when Xie Xi thought about Jiang Xie having such a young appearance, he couldn\u2019t help smiling.</p><br/><p>He was about to greet the other person when the bird came over himself, eyes full of surprise. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou look beautiful.\u201d Vermilion Bird bent down and stared at Xie Xi. After watching for a while, he seriously suggested, \u201cHow about marrying me?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

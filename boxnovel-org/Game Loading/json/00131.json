This didn\u2019t mean that they were immortal.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince had died once.</p><br/><p>At the time, Xie Xi loaded the file but that wasn\u2019t available in this world! What would happen if the soul died? Would it affect Jiang Xie?</p><br/><p>Every soul was a part of Jiang Xie. How could there be no impact from losing a part of him?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was concerned and his thoughts were full of the worst case situation.</p><br/><p>The sound of one hundred birds grieving was really painful. The relationship between the flower family and bird family had always been good. The roses couldn\u2019t hide their sadness after hearing the cries of the birds.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can Lord Vermilion Bird suddenly fall?\u201d Purple Nine murmured. \u201cSuch a powerful sage, how\u2026 how\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The old chief shook his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how strong he is. His life is determined by Heaven.\u201d</p><br/><p>Somehow, hearing these words caused a burst of unhappiness in Xie Xi\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>What was life and what was Heaven? Who was qualified to determine everything?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t sit still. He would go to the Holy Mountain to check!</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Purple Nine,\u201d Xie Xi called out to her. \u201cThe little tiger fell asleep in my room. I have to go out and do something. Can you help me look after him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Purple Nine was startled. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cI\u2019m going to the Holy Mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do at the Holy Mountain? Lord Vermilion Bird has fallen and the Holy Mountain must be a mess. Going at this time, even Lord Azure Dragon\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m going.\u201d Xie Xi couldn\u2019t explain. \u201cSister Purple Nine, rest assured, I have a reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>Purple Nine wanted to say something but the old chief pulled her back and shook his head.</p><br/><p>Purple Nine was worried about Xie Xi and told the old chief, \u201cLord Vermilion Bird had an accident and half of the Holy Mountain is burning. How can us flowers withstand that heat?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old chief replied, \u201cLet him go. There must be something with Lord Azure Dragon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hurried down the hill and rushed towards the Holy Mountain. He pulled Roast Pork Bun out.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun didn\u2019t know that he had an extra brother and meowed when he heard the song of the birds.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cLook and see if any birds are coming over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun was still reliable and immediately flew high to check.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi always felt that a member of the bird family would come looking for him. Vermilion Bird was a soul and there must be a setting involving Xie Xi. It wasn\u2019t clear at the moment but it was serious enough to cause him to fall.</p><br/><p>The bird people probably knew he was the white rose and would come to him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi going to the Holy Mountain himself was too slow. It was natural to save himself time and trouble.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s thoughts were right. A moment later, Roast Pork Bun shouted, \u201cA big swallow is flying!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shocked\u2026</p><br/><p>Was this a swallow? He thought it was a fighter jet!</p><br/><p>The fighter, um, flying bird was probably equipped with a radar system and actually saw Xie Xi\u2019s small body.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hurriedly put Roast Pork Bun away and Roast Pork Bun whispered, \u201cDaddy, I don\u2019t want to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>This caused Xie Xi to feel strangely pained but he thought of what would happen next and had to coax him. \u201cWait for me to stop and I\u2019ll let you out. There will be a small partner for you to play with.\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke these words and sent Roast Pork Bun back to the pets bar before Roast Pork Bun could react. A small partner? What small partner? He didn\u2019t want a brother or sister. He wanted to be an only child!</p><br/><p>The flying swallow fell and dark eyes stared at Xie Xi. \u201cYou still want to run!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Who knew what this was all about?</p><br/><p>The swallow raised his wings and turned into a handsome teenager with straight black hair. \u201cThis cursed flower, you hooked our lord\u2019s heart and soul before abandoning him, making him go crazy and angry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was really afraid for the soul and hurriedly asked, \u201cHow is he? Take me to see him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you asking? Sage\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes narrowed and he lowered his voice, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want the sage to have an accident, take me to see him!\u201d</p><br/><p>The swallow had been sent to pick this person up but couldn\u2019t speak the words in his heart\u2026</p><br/><p>In any case, the situation was really urgent and there couldn\u2019t be any delays. The swallow returned to his original form and ordered, \u201cCome up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sat on his broad back and they flew to the Holy Mountain.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Xie Xi was seeing the Holy Mountain.</p><br/><p>The word mountain was used but this wasn\u2019t like a mountain. It was an extremely area covered in clouds and mist. At first glance, it was like a fairyland in people\u2019s fantasies.</p><br/><p>The flying swallow flew straight through the clouds and soon flew over a place that was burning.</p><br/><p>There was a palace in the distance with a magnificent atmosphere. It was unknown what it was built of but it was currently glowing with a red light, as if it was melting.</p><br/><p>\u201cHold on tightly. If you fall, you will be burned to death,\u201d the swallow warned.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t reply.</p><br/><p>The flying swallow sped up and flew straight through the fire towards the palace in the deepest place.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi clung to the swallow, his face red and his breaths full of heat.</p><br/><p>This was the fire of Vermilion Bird. He went overboard and his ability led to a wildfire starting on the Holy Mountain.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know how he was doing and felt extremely urgent.</p><br/><p>The swallow\u2019s flying speed was fast and Xie Xi finally arrived at Vermilion Bird\u2019s palace.</p><br/><p>The whole palace was burning. Many of the birds weren\u2019t afraid of the heat as they stayed there grieving.</p><br/><p>A man with coloured tail feathers came over. \u201cDid you bring him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The swallow replied sharply, \u201cI brought him but will he be useful? The sage\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to try!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt a bit relieved when he heard this. As long as there was still breath then this was likely part of the setting!</p><br/><p>He thought of the pure fifth prince and wondered how the child could learn such bad things.</p><br/><p>Okay\u2026 it was his fault. Sein died and resurrected while also pedalling six boats. In addition, the boats were his brothers. This was enough to make the pure child doubt life!</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Rose.\u201d The man with the colourful tail feathers was more mature. He suppressed his anger and was polite to Xie Xi. \u201cPlease save the sage!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t sensitive about titles but now it was important to save the soul and he ignored this matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to the sage? What do you need from me?\u201d Xie Xi wondered.</p><br/><p>The man with the colourful tail feathers replied, \u201cThe sage knows your wedding date is approaching. He was unhappy all day and it happened to coincides with when the Millennium Fire descended to the world. He went alone and controlled the fire, saving the people, but he was seriously wounded!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t understand these things and grasped the key point. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Vermilion Bird\u2019s self-healing ability is very strong but he has a knot in his heart\u2026\u201d The man with the colourful tail feathers was saddened. \u201cThe sage himself doesn\u2019t want to recover!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood it. Simply put, at this moment Vermilion Bird couldn\u2019t have his love and was intent on dying.</p><br/><p>The man with the colourful tail feathers was afraid Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t understand and gave a tip. \u201cYou just need to give him some hope and he will wake up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t care about the setting of his wedding and he also couldn\u2019t let the soul have an accident\u2026</p><br/><p>As if these things weren\u2019t big enough, the chirping of birds was heard from outside, followed by the announcement, \u201cSage Azure Dragon has come!\u201d</p><br/><p>They were both sages and Vermilion Bird had such a big incident. Azure Dragon would definitely come to see what was going on.</p><br/><p>The problem was\u2026 did Xie Xi have to be stuck here?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The sound might be loud but the good thing was that no one else would be alarmed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at Jiang Xie and really didn\u2019t know what to say. If he explained that his clothes disappeared, would Jiang Xie believe him?</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t mention Jiang Xie, even Xie Xi didn\u2019t believe it himself!</p><br/><p>He was standing there in a daze and didn\u2019t know that someone was meditating on 100 types of calmness, this calmness almost enough to suppress the flames in his heart.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had seen the same sex body but he swore that he never felt the male body could be so attractive.</p><br/><p>The succubus\u2019 skin in front of him looked like clouds under a holy light. It was beautiful and soft, so that people couldn\u2019t wait to praise him with all types of beautiful words. His body line was excellent. It wasn\u2019t a male\u2019s masculinity or a woman\u2019s charm. It was somewhere in between and was sexy.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t look at this person again but the body was imprinted in his mind, so clear that it was frightening.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d Jiang Xie thought for a long time before finally choking out these words.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026Morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked, \u201cHave you eaten breakfast?\u201d</p><br/><p>This awkward chat!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought of a way to get rid of his perverted title. He could wear clothes in front of Jiang Xie. If Jiang Xie saw his clothes disappearing then he would understand without any need for an explanation.</p><br/><p>This way, the two people could get closer and discuss the problem of wearing clothes.</p><br/><p>Um\u2026 he was serious but why did it sound so naughty?</p><br/><p>No matter, just wear clothes first!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned against the door and saw movement in the corner of his eyes. It was Xie Xi wearing clothes.</p><br/><p>His movements were natural and gentle, but it was an unconscious seduction that made people want to tear off all the pieces of clothing\u2026</p><br/><p>Calm down!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie shifted his gaze away.</p><br/><p>In order for Jiang Xie to witness the miracle moment, Xie Xi deliberately spoke to him. \u201cDid you bring me breakfast?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi feared that this person would miss it and was even more deliberate. \u201cIt is a pity about the soy milk\u2026 oh, this collar behind me isn\u2019t very comfortable. Can you give me a hand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Look over here and see the clothes disappearing!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie looked up and saw the black hair flowing down the white neck. The shirt collar was slightly turned inside and it could be sorted as long as it was gently pulled. Yet Xie Xi asked him for help.</p><br/><p>This hint was too obvious. It was a seduction.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t go forward. He felt that once he got close, he would end up kissing the white neck and giving this person what he wanted.</p><br/><p>No, he had long been informed that he would share a dormitory with Xie Xi. It would be too bad if he fell in one day!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also didn\u2019t want Jiang Xie to help him sort out the collar. This guy used to always do it unsolicited and make it even messier\u2026 He just wanted Gemini to look over and see Xie Xi\u2019s clothes disappearing.</p><br/><p>Then\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi dressed neatly and found that his clothes hadn\u2019t disappeared.</p><br/><p>What was going on? Had his skin come to an agreement with the fabric? How did it become like this?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pulled at his clothes and found they were very strong and didn\u2019t mean to disappear at all.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s Adam\u2019s Apple surged as he calmly said, \u201cThe collar is just turned it. Pull it and it will neaten.\u201d He wasn\u2019t going to tidy it for this person. He refused to be tempted!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took a long time to recover. He was sure that his clothes had returned to normal and there was no point trying to make sense of it.</p><br/><p>Since his clothes didn\u2019t disappear, didn\u2019t this mean he couldn\u2019t clean himself of being a pervert?</p><br/><p>Then the final conclusion was that he was a pervert? Not only was he dressed, he deliberately asked his roommate to fix his collar.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well\u2026 Jiang Xie, come over here! I promise not to kill you!\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t think that he was unable to clear his evil but also increased his evil. Xie Xi had underestimated the pit of this small world.</p><br/><p>After seeing that he was finally dressed, Jiang Xie sighed and realized there was a mess. He said, \u201cI will clean this up. You go and eat first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi must have a good relationship with this person and said, \u201cI\u2019ll help.\u201d After all, Jiang Xie was scared by him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi went to grab the mop and coincidentally grabbed his hand.</p><br/><p>The two people, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t done it deliberately. He didn\u2019t think too much. He just saw the mop. How did it become Jiang Xie\u2019s hand? Could both of them be the same colour?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up and saw the stunned Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie pulled back his hand and calmly said, \u201cI will go get a bucket for the rubbish.\u201d</p><br/><p>What was a bucket for the rubbish? It was a trash can!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help laughing, causing Jiang Xie to feel a current flowing to the top of his head. If he was a computer, he would already be down.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie went to get his \u2018bucket of garbage\u2019. Xie Xi unexpectedly found that this was quite interesting. He was used to Jiang Xie teasing him and now he was passively teasing Jiang Xie. It was really interesting!</p><br/><p>Well, Xie Xi would\u2019ve been happier if it hadn\u2019t been a passive skill.</p><br/><p>The pair cleaned up the soymilk and deep-fried breadsticks on the ground and Xie Xi asked, \u201cDo you have something to do next?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cWe have class at 9 o\u2019clock and there are some welcome activities in the afternoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know this at all but decided to lean on Jiang Xie. He would go wherever Jiang Xie went.</p><br/><p>He might be a pervert but Jiang Xie didn\u2019t hate him too much.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi decided to let it go.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will go with you.\u201d Xie Xi said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t too early. I will buy soy milk and drink it on the road.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie froze.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi picked up his one-shoulder bag. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie hesitated for a moment before finally choosing to say, \u201cYou aren\u2019t wearing underwear, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not questioning your habits. It is just a custom here and it is better for you to wear them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t dig a hole in the ground. Otherwise, he would stay underground and never come out.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t wearing it. At the time, he just wanted to show the miracle of the clothes disappearing and how could he care about the underwear. Even if he wanted to wear it, he couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t draw a pair of underwear right in front of Jiang Xie\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke again, \u201cI\u2019m just making a suggestion. You\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had to use an excuse. \u201cI forgot to bring it.\u201d This was better than being a pervert who didn\u2019t like wearing it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned forward slightly and his voice was lower. \u201cI\u2019ll lend it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Fine, what else could he do? It was better to wear it than to not wear underwear.</p><br/><p>Soon, Xie Xi found that it really wasn\u2019t good. Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t the same size as him and his waist was twice as larger. It was very awkward after Xie Xi put it on.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie seemed to be aware of his discomfort and unexpectedly comforted him. \u201cAdapt slowly. This is where we do here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d It was just that the size didn\u2019t match! He wasn\u2019t a pervert who wasn\u2019t used to wearing underwear!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mood was already complicated. After this night and day, what type of person was he in front of Gemini?</p><br/><p>Watching G movies in the daytime, sleeping naked in a double bedroom, being seductive in the morning and not wearing underwear\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt that if he was Gemini, he certainly wouldn\u2019t say a word to himself.</p><br/><p>They went to the cafeteria and Xie Xi found himself the centre of a lot of attention.</p><br/><p>It seemed there were more gazes this time. Perhaps because Jiang Xie was next to him?</p><br/><p>Gemini\u2019s face value was really high and he was brimming with the vitality of young people. It was normal for him to attract people\u2019s attention. In any case, Xie Xi really liked it.</p><br/><p>After buying soy milk, there were only seven or eight minutes left until 9 o\u2019clock. Xie Xi wasn\u2019t hungry and followed Jiang Xie to the classroom.</p><br/><p>He casually asked, \u201cWhat class is it today?\u201d It was normal not to look at the class schedule.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is the first day so it is just a basic course.\u201d</p><br/><p>What class was a basic course? Speaking of which, Xie Xi didn\u2019t even know what major he was in.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie took care of his perverted roommate and asked, \u201cHave you bought all the textbooks?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d It seemed he didn\u2019t have any books.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. You can look at my textbook in this class. For the others, I will go with you to buy them in the evening.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was warm. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are roommates. Caring for each other is appropriate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded and felt that Gemini was a really good Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>They walked into the classroom and it was already full. The originally noisy classroom became quiet because of the appearance of Xie Xi and Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to take advantage of the time before class to drink the soy milk, so he started drinking when he went upstairs. Now he didn\u2019t stop and took a hard sip, only to hear the loud sound of inhalation.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie grabbed the soy milk.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked stunned and Jiang Xie saw a bit of white milk around this person\u2019s mouth. Jiang Xie\u2019s head was buzzing as he said, \u201cYour mouth\u2026 there is soy milk around it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Xie Xi licked his lower lip.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound of inhalation became even louder. Xie Xi looked around and saw a group of young people with red faces.</p><br/><p>What happened?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie took his hand and pulled him out of the classroom.</p><br/><p>The grip hurt but this situation was really bizarre. Thus, Xie Xi thought it was more appropriate for him to come outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Xie Xi stood in a cool place and couldn\u2019t help asking.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie calmed his heartbeat and gazed at the innocent succubus in front of him. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t drink anything outside in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>The dazed Xie Xi replied, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing his response and thinking of Xie Xi\u2019s situation today, Jiang Xie sighed. \u201cI will bring breakfast back for you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>What could Xie Xi do? He could only be obedient.</p><br/><p>By the time he returned to the classroom, the old professor was already present.</p><br/><p>He saw that Xie Xi was quite calm and different from the other young ones.</p><br/><p>The old professor spoke seriously, \u201cSince there is a succubus exchange student in our class, we will give priority to the demon basics today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood every word but when put together\u2026</p><br/><p>What and what?</p><br/><p>The old professor wrote powerful words on the blackboard: the succubus.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had a bad hunch.</p><br/><p>The old professor lectured, \u201cWe must know the different types of demons. A succubus is one of the big demons and they major in desire. They are different from us but we must respect their living habits\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned by the old professor\u2019s solemn nonsense.</p><br/><p>\u201cResisting the temptation of a succubus is an important course in angel psychology. You have such a good opportunity and don\u2019t miss it. Be sure to recite the mantras of meditation. For example, Student Jiang Xie, you must not change the colour of your face and your heartbeat around Xie Xi!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

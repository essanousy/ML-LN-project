Just look for me if you need me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Third prince: [Once things are finished, don\u2019t act lazy at home.]</p><br/><p>This translated to: come back quickly!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s unified reply: [Thank you for the second (third) prince\u2019s care. It is nothing urgent and I will return as soon as possible.] It was followed by a smiling expression.</p><br/><p>The second and third child\u2019s hearts thumped. If they weren\u2019t busy then they would\u2019ve rushed over to find Colin.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spent a few days with the fourth prince. His initial impression of the fourth prince had completely disappeared.</p><br/><p>Some aspects of the fourth prince were similar to the sixth prince. They liked one person and did things their own way. Some places were similar to the fifth prince in that they felt enthusiasm about being close to people. If Xie Xi thought about it, the fourth prince was also similar to the second prince. His love for the people underwater was no less than the second prince. Meanwhile, the sensitivity to danger was no worse than the third prince\u2026</p><br/><p>Each of the six brothers had their own characteristics while being similar to each other.</p><br/><p>Well, they were parts of one person\u2019s soul after all. It was normal for them to be similar.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s side mission was finally completed after several ups and downs.</p><br/><p>Collecting garbage was much more stable than collecting love. Once he reached the full one million tons, pouring it out didn\u2019t reduce the progress. It just stayed completed.</p><br/><p>After a few days of running around with the fourth prince, the fourth prince told him, \u201cYou should stop using your ability for the time being.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had traveled all over the land that bordered the sea, returning all the garbage.</p><br/><p>This occurred all over the world, causing turmoil among land-based society.</p><br/><p>The people arranged by the fourth prince started to mobilize public opinion, condemning the damage caused to the sea and criticizing humanity\u2019s self-destructive behaviour.</p><br/><p>The land people knew about the underwater people but had very little contact with each other. Many people were suspicious.</p><br/><p>Now that the garbage dumps were returned, the land people realized that their neighbours under the sea were angry. The garbage piles appeared so quickly and abruptly that they felt the mysterious power of the sea.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t come up with these ideas. There were professionals at politics under the sea and they knew how to seize this opportunity to deter people.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw that his \u2018vacation\u2019 was coming to an end and it was time to leave the fourth prince.</p><br/><p>The progress with the fourth prince was also great. In the past few days, it had risen to 16.6% and was almost full.</p><br/><p>However, Xie Xi had previous experience and didn\u2019t dare be neglectful. He made sure to get along very well with the prince.</p><br/><p>They returned to the palace and the fourth prince reminded him, \u201cYou must not pick up garbage in my absence, do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had heard this many times but he knew that the fourth prince was worried about his safety and nodded. \u201cYes, I will obey Your Highness\u2019 order.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince smiled. \u201cSit down, I will give you medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>He no longer put garbage on the land but Xie Xi still insisted on cleaning up the heavily polluted areas. In any case, the garbage could be stacked up and his items bar was empty. He simply did it to benefit the sea.</p><br/><p>He hoped that the lovely little mermaids could swim happily in the water instead of being covered with scars.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince also accompanied him and gave him a special set of clothes. Unfortunately, Xie Xi needed to stretch out his hand to collect the garbage and his left hand was still injured.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince carefully gave him medicine and after a while, Xie Xi felt powerless.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince said, \u201cGo and get some sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t see him anymore and replied in a dazed manner, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince held his hand as usual and took him into a room. This time, he actually hugged Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes slightly widened in a surprised manner.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince stared straight ahead but his Adam\u2019s Apple moved up and down. He ordered, \u201cGo to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a few steps from the outside to inside the room. The prince didn\u2019t wait for Xie Xi to struggle and directly placed him down.</p><br/><p>Forget it, Xie Xi was too lazy to care.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi slept for a while and once he woke up, his hand had recovered to his original condition. There were no scars at all.</p><br/><p>Then he heard a conversation outside.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun was also sleeping. Once Xie Xi woke up, the kitten yawned and went outside to look. \u201cIt is the eldest prince!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s ears pricked up and he moved over curiously, wondering if he should go out or not.</p><br/><p>The black progress of 8% made Xie Xi feel very concerned. This must be from the eldest prince but they had barely spoken. How did it suddenly rise so much?</p><br/><p>The more he didn\u2019t understand, the more curious he became. Xie Xi leaned forward.</p><br/><p>He took a step and heard the eldest prince ask, \u201cHow did you do that with the garbage?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince said, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t ask. Just use this event to let the land people think about their behaviour.\u201d</p><br/><p>The eldest prince paused and unexpectedly didn\u2019t ask again.</p><br/><p>The two of them were silent for a moment and Xie Xi almost thought that the eldest prince had left. He didn\u2019t expect the prince to suddenly say, \u201cThe attack on Sixth Brother, were you the one who arranged it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled. He pricked his ears further and wanted to know who had done it.</p><br/><p>In fact, Xie Xi had previously doubted the fourth prince. He did have enough motivation.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince witnessed the suffering of many people and hated the land people. Unfortunately, the underwater people always had a conservative attitude towards war and wasn\u2019t willing to start it.</p><br/><p>If the sacrifice of a useless prince could be exchanged for peace and prosperity under the sea, the fierce militant faction wouldn\u2019t hesitate.</p><br/><p>However, after accompanying each other for a few days, Xie Xi knew that the fourth prince wouldn\u2019t do such a thing. He didn\u2019t need something to set off the fire. If he hadn\u2019t been worried that a war would bring more disaster, he would\u2019ve already fought with the land people.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince smiled and replied, \u201cI want the land people to die but I don\u2019t want my brother to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>The eldest prince didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince wondered, \u201cFifth Brother isn\u2019t right these days. You\u2026\u201d He hadn\u2019t finished when he changed his words, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was curious and wanted to know what was going on outside.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun relayed it in real time, \u201cThe eldest prince turned pale and nearly fainted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c?\u201d</p><br/><p>What happened to the eldest prince?</p><br/><p>The fourth prince held onto the eldest prince and frowned. \u201cYou should pay attention to your body? How many days has it been since you\u2019ve slept? The government affairs are never-ending. If you continue like this, you won\u2019t be able to last.\u201d The eldest prince replied in a slightly hoarse voice, \u201cRecently my sleep hasn\u2019t been very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou only sleep for four or five hours a day. This is too little.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m used to it.\u201d The eldest prince continued, \u201cI\u2019ve just been dreaming lately.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince didn\u2019t think too much. \u201cProper rest is necessary.\u201d</p><br/><p>The eldest prince was about to answer when his eyes suddenly narrowed. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi deliberately came out. His eyes were dazed and he looked slightly confused, as if he had just woken up.</p><br/><p>The eldest prince glanced at him and froze.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also saw him and immediately bowed. \u201cI have seen Your Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince walked over to him and asked, \u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, I\u2019m fine to go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know if it was his illusion but he always felt that the fourth prince was deliberately separating him from the eldest prince\u2019s line of sight.</p><br/><p>The eldest prince quickly recovered and pressed a hand to his temple. \u201cYou are busy. I\u2019m going back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince kept standing in front of Xie Xi. \u201cBig Brother should pay attention to your body and have a good rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi became certain that the fourth prince was deliberately separating him from the eldest prince.</p><br/><p>This way, he couldn\u2019t even politely say goodbye.</p><br/><p>The eldest prince nodded and seemed to look at Xie Xi again. In the end, he didn\u2019t say anything and turned away.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered nervously, \u201cI suddenly came out. Was I too rude?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The fourth prince took his hand and looked at it closely. He confirmed there were no scars and glanced up at Xie Xi. \u201cStill, you should stay far away from the first prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt doubts in his heart but he didn\u2019t show it on his face. \u201cI am a small guard. I won\u2019t have any intersection with the eldest prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince stared at him, still not reassured. \u201cYou must never let Big Brother know what you are capable of.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a secret between me and Your Highness. I will never tell anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince nodded and explained, \u201cBig Brother has some psychological problems. His natural emotions are missing and he is always indifferent and strict. He only considers the pros and cons of doing anything and won\u2019t consider emotions. If you let him know your ability, you will become a bargaining chip in his hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi froze. \u201cHe lacks emotions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, he didn\u2019t know any emotions, including love towards family or friendship.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi blinked, his heart full of doubts.</p><br/><p>If there was an emotional disorder, where did this 8% progress come from?</p><br/><p>The fourth prince saw his thoughts wandering and told him, \u201cDon\u2019t be curious.\u201d Xie Xi\u2019s spirit returned and he hurriedly nodded. \u201cI\u2019m not curious!\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince smiled. \u201cYou should pay attention to safety first, understood?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very moved. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince looked at him and stop talking for a moment.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sensed it and asked, \u201cYour Highness, do you have something else?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince paused before suddenly saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to inherit the throne.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was even more confused. He didn\u2019t understand the direction of this topic.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince looked down and his voice was softer,\u2019 My mother doesn\u2019t care about me so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the fourth prince stopped again and smiled, looking extremely gentle. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Let\u2019s wait. In short, he would protect this person in the most proper way.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was puzzled but didn\u2019t think too much.</p><br/><p>He might have a big brain but there was no way for him to think a person he only knew for a week would want to marry him!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi left the fourth prince and headed towards the eldest prince\u2019s palace, unlike his words.</p><br/><p>How could he not be close? He must be close! The task progress was almost full so how could he not go to the eldest prince? As long as he took care of this, maybe he could leave this world!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi changed to a reserve face and entered without much trouble.</p><br/><p>The eldest prince was still in the study and there was a personal fish man reporting to him.</p><br/><p>The eldest prince was really dedicated. His eyes clearly had dark circles but he was still strong. It was admirable that his words were clear and didn\u2019t contain the slightest hint of sleepiness despite how tired he must be at this point.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi secretly watched him using the servant\u2019s identity.</p><br/><p>The eldest prince was born with a lack of emotions? Xie Xi couldn\u2019t tell just by looking. At most, he felt that this person was calm and decisive.</p><br/><p>The black progress bar must be him. In the end, why did it suddenly rise to 8%?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about what the eldest prince had said to the fourth prince\u2014he had been dreaming recently.</p><br/><p>Was this the key point? What did he dream about?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt uncertain.</p><br/><p>The old merman finally left and the eldest prince pinched between his eyes. He finally showed some sleepiness.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi watched as the eldest prince fell asleep at the desk. Was he really asleep?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi carefully blinked at Roast Pork Bun and the kitten flew out, circling the eldest prince several times before coming back. \u201cHis breathing is even. He really is asleep!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi waited a bit longer before coming out. His steps were very light because he was afraid to wake up the eldest prince. However, the eldest prince was in a deep sleep and didn\u2019t show any signs of waking.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t sure if Dreaming would succeed this time. After all, it was just a nap. Would the prince dream? Would he dream of Xie Xi?</p><br/><p>Still, the opportunity was in front of him and he had to try it. Xie Xi activated Dreaming.</p><br/><p>[You have successfully used Dreaming and entered the dream of Randy Atlantis.]</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes lit up. He succeeded! The eldest prince was really dreaming about him. It seemed that he would have to go into the dream to figure out the mystery behind this 8% progress.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his eyes again and was stunned. This was\u2026</p><br/><p>The dim sky, the gloomy castle and the strong bloody scent that lingered in the air.</p><br/><p>A man\u2019s low voice was heard. \u201cYoung Master, it\u2019s time for dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi look up and saw the housekeeper Randy\u2019s dull eyes and morbid smile.</p><br/><p>He was shocked. What was going on? This was the housekeeper Randy of the Love to the Left or Right world!</p><br/><p>He refused to admit he was mistaken. This was the junk game where he died many times and in the end, he couldn\u2019t die when he wanted to. He would never forget it in his life.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun\u2019s curious voice entered Xie Xi\u2019s mind. \u201cDaddy has become smaller and your clothes are so beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was the slender young man dressed in fancy clothing of Love to the Left or Right.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s spirit returned. This was a dream and it was the dream of the eldest prince.</p><br/><p>Then why was the eldest prince\u2019s dream like this? Was it really the same soul? The eldest prince had the memories of the housekeeper Randy?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about the ending of that world and his scalp became numb.</p><br/><p>It was over! Was he going to die in the dream?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

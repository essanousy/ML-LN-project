Why did he bring this thing back?</p><br/><p>When he left, there was still a decade before the universe exploded. How did he randomly get such a deadly thing?</p><br/><p>If he brought the hard drive back, what would happen to the world? It was so hard to repair yet it was over again? Could this be called completing the task?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s head was in a frenzy. Jiang Xie was also frozen. Xie Xi nervously asked, \u201cDid we fail the task?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie gazed at the hard drive Xie Xi brought out and his mood was very complicated.</p><br/><p>\u201cBaby, you\u2019re going to be famous now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExplain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie took the hard drive and sighed. \u201cThe quasi-world has been repaired but the new quasi-world needs to be redesigned.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was still confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought I would have to do it myself again. Now\u2026\u201d He shook the hard drive. \u201cIt saved me some trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood a bit. \u201cYou\u2019re saying this is an important item to design a world?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the will of the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was in a daze\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie took his hand. \u201cCome with me. There is a place you should be able to enter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was fascinated and let Jiang Xie pull him to a portal. They left the garden and came to an unusually empty hall. It was similar to the players\u2019 hall but there was almost no one here. The colour of the water curtain was also different. It wasn\u2019t the watery blue of the players\u2019 hall but a snowy silver.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cWelcome to the designer\u2019s hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was surprised. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cThere are two ways to become a designer. One is to apply to the Central Government and slowly explore. After reaching the standards, you can try to design a world and if successful, you can become a designer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew that Jiang Xie had taken such steps and became a designer in a down to earth manner.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie continued, \u201cThe other way is to get the world\u2019s will and become a designer directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo far, the second way to become a designer is just a legend. No one has ever done it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie helped all the Central players say fair words. \u201cNow I knew that this second promotion method is tailor-made for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was teased by him. \u201cHowever, I am already a repairer. How can I become a designer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Yan Zhe wasn\u2019t too wasteful, he could be both a godly healer and a designer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhen, \u201c???\u201d If this person had something to say, why pull him to death?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi still felt it was quite inexplicable. \u201cWhat is the world\u2019s will? I don\u2019t feel like I can design a world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis aspect isn\u2019t urgent. Designing a world might be interesting but it also has great hidden risks. Don\u2019t try it easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cYes, I\u2019m not in a hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was very reassured. His family member was particularly excellent.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced a the hard drive and had a thought. \u201cYou mean, we just fixed the quasi-world. If we want to let it re-enter the cycle, we need to design it again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cDo you have to design it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie designed worlds by splitting apart his soul. If this was the case, won\u2019t they enter an infinite loop and when could all the souls come back?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie hurriedly comforted him. \u201cRest assured, now I have you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was surprised. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie touched the silver-white water curtain and a different system interface appeared in front of him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie pointed to the unfinished page and there was a quasi-world with the code name of zz213442.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned. \u201cWhat is the significance of this number?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is randomly generated and has no meaning. It is just a code name for an unnamed quasi-world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the quasi-world of the collapsed god?\u2019</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cYes, I haven\u2019t designed a new world for a long time and it can only be this unfinished one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why hadn\u2019t he designed a new world for a long time? It was because he sliced too much of himself off and his body couldn\u2019t bear it anymore!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood and felt pain. He controlled his mind and asked, \u201cHow do you finish it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie clicked a few times before a prompt appeared. [Please put in the core material.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI originally intended to place my soul piece here. Now\u2026\u201d Jiang Xie placed the hard drive in Xie Xi\u2019s hand. \u201cYou can put the will of the world that you repaired.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes were wide and he was a bit nervous. He was afraid this wouldn\u2019t work.</p><br/><p>Compared to his nervousness, Jiang Xie was very calm.</p><br/><p>The prompt changed. [The design of codename zz213442 is completed. The designer is X and Xie Xi, is it okay?]</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned. It was successful?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie clicked \u2018No\u2019 and modified Xie Xi\u2019s name. \u201cThink of a codename.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s senses returned.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie pondered. \u201cHow about i. I am X and you are i, together it is Xi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their names were really sweet and were probably a natural pair. Xie Xi\u2019s senses returned and he poked the water curtain a few times. \u201cThis is okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes curved. \u201cIE like the browser?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie took this person into his arms and there was no need to mention how sweet his heart was. \u201cI like it, I especially like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>X and IE, together it was Xie. This was Jiang Xie\u2019s name and Xie Xi\u2019s last name, it was really good.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was determined.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart beat a bit faster as he whispered, \u201cWhy does there have to be an announcement.\u201d This was a big fanfare and he preferred being low-key.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xies said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy to welcome a designer. The Central Government is also very happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw the line of words that occupied the entire water curtain.</p><br/><p>[Congratulations to Designer X, Designer IE for successfully designing an SSS-grade quasi-world.]</p><br/><p>This line cycled three times. If the player\u2019s hall was like this then Xie Xi didn\u2019t need to look to know it must\u2019ve blown in.</p><br/><p>In fact, the scene of the player\u2019s hall couldn\u2019t be described with a frying pan. Every person was a pot and every pot had exploded!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god, an SSS-grade world? This beats God X\u2019s record of an SS-grade world!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is God X\u2019s design!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, who is Designer IE???\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHas anyone ever heard of this person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve never heard of it. He and God X actually designed an SSS-grade quasi-world together!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cThis world was originally S-grade. How can it become SSS grade?\u201d Jumping two levels was too exaggerated.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is probably that the husband and husband match and we can do more with less effort.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d This person was never serious!</p><br/><p>The thick-skinned Jiang Xie explained, \u201cThis quasi-world was also very difficult. It experienced collapse and was repaired. After the redesign, it is in a very complete state and being rated SSS-grade is normal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about it and generally understood.</p><br/><p>If the quasi-world originally designed by Jiang Xie was only a young child, it went through many experiences and had its own clear will. It didn\u2019t need Jiang Xie\u2019s souls to support it and it was normal for the level to improve.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also had some ideas about the pole in the repair task and the coordinates of the old professor but Jiang Xie had already changed the topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook are your rewards.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shot back at him, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you look at your own?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI looked at it. There is a lot of broken copper and iron.\u201d There were no surprises.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was speechless and didn\u2019t know how to comfort this person.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie hadn\u2019t been interested in rewards for 800 years but now he was interested again. After all, Xie Xi\u2019s hands were particularly red and it was exciting to see what he would get.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi accepted the reward and the millions of gold coins made him freeze.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cLook at the special reward.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo many gold coins\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGold coin rewards depends on the person. Designing a world would give 500,000 at most\u2026 I guess that you probably got the maximum.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t need to ask. Jiang Xie must\u2019ve only received 500,000 gold coins.</p><br/><p>It was still a lot but in comparison\u2026 Xie Xi turned and kissed Jiang Xie on the cheek.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned and only reacted after a long time.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke with some embarrassment, \u201cWhat\u2019s mine is yours. Don\u2019t care about these things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t care about this! He cared about his stupid self who unexpectedly didn\u2019t take the opportunity to pretend to be miserable and let Xie Xi coax him more!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened the special rewards column.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was still immersed in miserable regret, as if he had lost millions.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s voice called back his attention. \u201cThis thing is quite good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie looked over and replied after a pause, \u201cIt\u2019s really good\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Item: Different Space Shield.</p><br/><p>Grade: Gold (Lifetime Binding).</p><br/><p>Description: Limited to use in the quasi-world. After being used, the energy of a different space will be randomly extracted to form a shield. The duration is 30 seconds and the cooldown time is one hour. As the use of proficiency increases, the effect will increase accordingly.</p><br/><p>This type of self-preservation item wasn\u2019t annoying and Xie Xi asked Jiang Xie, \u201cWhat is the energy of a different space?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie knew this person hadn\u2019t found the power of the item and explained, \u201cIf the energy of a different space is extracted in the quasi-world, it means nothing in the quasi-world can harm it.\u201d</p><br/><p>To put it simply, the energy extracted for this shield was foreign and didn\u2019t exist in the current world. No matter what the current world used to attack, it couldn\u2019t attack something that didn\u2019t exist at all.</p><br/><p>Frankly, this Difference Space Shield could be called an invincible shield.</p><br/><p>For the 30 seconds it took effect, nothing could harm Xie Xi. The even scarier thing was that the cooldown time was only one hour. In addition, such a long duration and short cooldown time could be upgraded\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie repeated, \u201cThis is truly a good thing.\u201d There was such a bug and Xie Xi\u2019s safety index would burst!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood and was also very happy. He had a strong self-protection ability and wouldn\u2019t drag Jiang Xie down.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, he hadn\u2019t said this when he heard, \u201cBaby, it won\u2019t take long before I\u2019m hugging your thighs.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, the group chat with the zombie squad blow up. \u201cAre you IE? Boss, have you become a designer?\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t hide it from them. After all, they knew the relationship between Xie Xi and Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled and replied to them.</p><br/><p>The group on Jiang Xie\u2019s side was also blown up.</p><br/><p>Improper Man Nan Yi questioned, \u201cWhat happened? Little Rose became a designer? Isn\u2019t he a repairer?\u201d</p><br/><p>Crazy Yan Zhe Who Wants to Leave: \u201cAn SSS-grade quasi-world, how did you do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>He asked this and the other people in the group had a warning in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Jiang Xie started again. \u201cIn fact, I am also very puzzled. It seems that since I fell in love and have a person who loves me, good luck is coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Improper Man Nan Yi was renamed to Crazy Nan Yi who Wants to Leave.</p><br/><p>Crazy Yan Zhe who Wants to Leave is renamed to Yan Zhe has Already Left.</p><br/><p>Then Old Qin said, \u201cI got a task.\u201d</p><br/><p>This dog abuse moment, how could they care about a task?! Qin Ge directly posted the contents of the task to the group. Everyone saw it and was shocked.</p><br/><p>[Quasi-world: New Civilization. Difficulty: SSS-grade. Designer X &amp; IE, not cleared.]</p><br/><p>There was no doubt that this was the quasi-world Jiang Xie and Xie Xi had just designed! Jiang Xie\u2019s souls weren\u2019t present so other people could search for it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was startled and couldn\u2019t help kissing Xie Xi who was typing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cHrmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is really good I met you.\u201d Everything he did had value.</p><br/><p>After half a second of silence, the group commented, \u201cOld Qin, add me.\u201d</p><br/><p>An SSS-grade quasi-world, four gods plus a god\u2019s milk could clear it! Jiang Xie and Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t go. After all, they were the designers.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

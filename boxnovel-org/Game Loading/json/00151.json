The magnolia was worried all day long but didn\u2019t dare say anything. Xie Xi heard their private conversation.</p><br/><p>The jasmine told the magnolia, \u201cSister Magnolia, why is Lord Flower God injured?\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to this tone, it seemed that the flower god had never been hurt.</p><br/><p>The daisy was also nervous. \u201cThis time he slept a bit long.\u201d</p><br/><p>The magnolia shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t tell about it. Lord Flower God is a god and nothing will happen.\u201d Based on her tone, it didn\u2019t seem like nothing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi himself didn\u2019t have much feeling. He didn\u2019t know much about the previous flower god and he was a person. He felt that this flower god\u2019s body was very good. There were no problems apart from sleeping for a bit long.</p><br/><p>Of course, Xie Xi also didn\u2019t care much. He thought about it and knew that the flower god certainly had a problem. After all, in the future, the flower god had died or\u2026 was sleeping.</p><br/><p>Thanks to this incident, Little White Tiger became honest. As if he had grown up overnight, he started to eat meat and ran many laps around the sea of flowers every day. This was because Xie Xi told him that moderate exercise could strengthen his body. As for how to calculate the right amount, it was when he felt tired or was sweating. Thus, Little White Tiger ran from morning to night, from late to early\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hurriedly stopped him. \u201cAren\u2019t you tired?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little White Tiger didn\u2019t gasp much. He blinked his big eyes and didn\u2019t look tired at all.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could only change his mouth. \u201cThe most you can run in one day\u2026 three hours\u2026\u201d Normal people were tired after an hour but the tiger obviously wasn\u2019t a normal person. It was okay for him to run all day and night and the basic exercise amount was six hours.</p><br/><p>Little White Tiger made a disappointed sound and Houqing translated for him. \u201cHe said he will be obedient.\u201d</p><br/><p>This false translation Little White Tiger was clearly full of reluctance! The tiger stared at him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes curved as he touched the two small heads. \u201cYes, isn\u2019t it good to leave some time to accompany me?\u201d</p><br/><p>This worked and both of them nodded in a well-behaved manner. Every day, they ran around and eat before coming to Xie Xi\u2019s side. Xie Xi also taught them things about the outside of the flower world.</p><br/><p>Little Houqing was a curious child and asked, \u201cWhat type of place is the Holy Mountain and the Demon Sea?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt that words were too lacking and took a pen and paper to draw them. His magic painting technique was simply fantastic when it came to coaxing the children.</p><br/><p>The pen drew the splendid mountains and rivers and the two pairs of small eyes widened.</p><br/><p>Little White Tiger couldn\u2019t speak and could only touch with his little meat pads. Little Houqing acted as a brother and hit his hand. \u201cBe careful not to damage it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Little White Tiger fiercely growled at him. Houqing translated for White Tiger. \u201cHe said he knows he is wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled and ending up drawing a crooked tree because of their actions. In fact, Xie Xi felt ti was a bit strange. Little Houqing had never been outside and it was reasonable for him to be amazed by these things. However, Little White Tiger had been living outside for a long time. Why did he seem so surprised? Unfortunately, White Tiger couldn\u2019t speak or ask.</p><br/><p>The days passed quickly. Xie Xi spent half a year in the flower world, drawing pictures for the two little children. They grew very fast as they ate and slept well. Xie Xi unwittingly used a thick stack of paper.</p><br/><p>This day, the jasmine and daisy ran into the house with a tray in their hands. \u201cLord Flower God, we made something good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was somewhat sleepy and fought to keep his eyelids open. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>The jasmine and daisy pulled back the silk covering the tray and presented the thing inside. \u201cWe looked for Brother Peony, Brother Plum Blossom and Sister Magnolia to help bind your paintings into a book!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart jumped as he glanced over. \u201cBound into a book?\u201d</p><br/><p>The jasmine handed it over. \u201cWith a small spell, the paintings were narrowed and put together. This is much more convenient.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was mentally prepared but he was still stunned when he saw the god\u2019s wisdom.</p><br/><p>The daisy told him, \u201cWhen you want to look at one, zoom in. If you don\u2019t want to look, you can put it away. Isn\u2019t it convenien\u2026. Lord Flower God!\u201d He exclaimed before he finished his words.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at the god\u2019s wisdom and became dizzy. He tried to open his eyes but couldn\u2019t as his body fell down.</p><br/><p>As his vision blurred, he heard the screams of the jasmine and daisy. He wanted to comfort them and say that he was just sleepy but unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t open his mouth.</p><br/><p>There was another long sleep before Xie Xi opened his eyes. He felt his dry lips and throat.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Flower God, you\u2019re awake!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was somewhat stunned by this voice. It seemed to come from the dairy but it was mature instead of the juvenile tone. Xie Xi turned and saw that the daisy had grown into a young person.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Xie Xi frowned before asking hoarsely. \u201cHow long did I sleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>The daisy was nervous. \u201cYou slept for more than five years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c..\u201d This wasn\u2019t sleeping. It was being vegetative for five years!</p><br/><p>Oh, a flower was originally a plant and he became a vegetable. This joke was too cold and Xie Xi was frozen by himself.</p><br/><p>There were footsteps and Xie Xi saw the grown Houqing and White Tiger. The youth and tiger saw that he was awake and their eyes turned red.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was upset. He said he would take care of them. As a result, he woke up and they had grown so big.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d He sighed. \u201cI fell asleep again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Houqing shook his head and went forward. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Getting a good rest is the most important thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had grown up and his voice wasn\u2019t as soft. Still, the clear and juvenile was very beautiful. Xie Xi smiled at him before touching the head of Little White Tiger. \u201cYou have also grown up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little White Tiger could actually talk now. \u201cOf course, I run and eat every day!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned. In the past five years, the tiger learnt how to speak. Xie Xi smiled. \u201cYou are strong and can speak. You don\u2019t need Houqing to translate for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little White Tiger scoffed at the reference to \u2018childhood\u2019 matters. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t understand at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cWhy do I think he translated very well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little White Tiger, \u201c\u2026\u201d The grumpy child didn\u2019t refute it. This was enough to see how much he missed Xie Xi in these five years.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi slept but he didn\u2019t forget the pre-sleep things. He glanced at the daisy and requested, \u201cGive me the god\u2026 give me the picture book.\u201d</p><br/><p>The daisy didn\u2019t know why Xie Xi wanted to see the picture book as soon as he woke up but this was an order and the dairy hurried to get it. Xie Xi reached out and felt the old paintings book.</p><br/><p>The daisy mentioned, \u201cHouqing and White Tiger flip through it every day so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, it was originally painted for them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened the book and stared at the vivid paintings inside. Then he asked White Tiger, \u201cDo you remember when you were a child?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little White Tiger nodded. \u201cI remember.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did your home look like before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little White Tiger paused before speaking in a tense voice. \u201cIt was dark and there were those types of monsters everywhere\u2026 if I didn\u2019t have Mother, I would\u2019ve been eaten by them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dark\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi clearly remembered the place where he met the two tigers was a forest with lush foliage and a good environment.</p><br/><p>Little White Tiger continued, \u201cThen one day, the sky became light, many things appeared out of thin air and these monsters slowly disappeared.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cAppeared out of thin air?\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, he had an answer in his mind but he still listened to the tiger. \u201cThey are the things that you drew.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough\u2026 Xie Xi stroked the book and had a general outline of matters. Outside the flower world was chaos. There was no Holy Mountain and Demon Sea. Xie Xi drew the outside world with his sketches.</p><br/><p>Was this the meaning of Wonderful Painting of the Mountains and Seas? The Holy Mountain and Demon Sea were drawn by the flower god?</p><br/><p>This was very contradictory, like whether a chicken came before an egg or an egg came before a chicken. In the end, was the flower god a little rose from the future or was the little rose from the future the present flower god?</p><br/><p>This was an unsolved ring. Jiang Xie had told him, \u2018Don\u2019t be bound by time. There is no limit between the past and the present.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood and also didn\u2019t understand. The human way of thinking limited his understanding of time. Even if he used himself as a reference, he couldn\u2019t understand this non-linear time.</p><br/><p>Still, now wasn\u2019t the time to think about it. He had more important things. Xie Xi asked the two little ones. \u201cWould you like to go out with me to take a look?\u201d</p><br/><p>Their eyes brightened and they nodded in unison.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s go and see what is outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had painted many scenes of the Holy Mountain and Demon Sea but it was impossible to cover all the details.</p><br/><p>Perhaps there was no need for him to draw all the details. He just had to build the frame and the flesh would grow on its own.</p><br/><p>Just like humans, wasn\u2019t the most sophisticated \u2018machine\u2019 in the world grown from a fertilized egg?</p><br/><p>Even if he only drew one-tenth of a millionth of the world, the world would perfect itself to 100%, just like a quasi-world designed by a designer.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi brought Houqing and White Tiger as well as a lot of flowers.</p><br/><p>The flowers were also curious about the outside world. Xie Xi told them, \u201cThose who want to come out can follow.\u201d</p><br/><p>The magnolia warned him, \u201cLord Flower God, you are being too indulgent with them. They will become lawless!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>This time, Xie Xi paid special attention to the outside world. In fact, it didn\u2019t require verification but he couldn\u2019t help wanting to see it.</p><br/><p>They were walking through a forest when Houqing\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThis tree\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced over and his eyes flashed. The white tiger jumped up with surprise. \u201cIt is the tree you painted.\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, this was Xie Xi\u2019s tree that became crooked due to his hands shaking. This tree proved that all of this was painted by Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told the White Tiger, \u201cThere are many trees like this. It is just an accident.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was better not to let them know about this incredible thing. The flowers didn\u2019t know anything and looked confused. The two children had doubts but didn\u2019t ask again.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took this trip not just to see the outside world. It was also to\u2026</p><br/><p>The jasmine cried out, \u201cWhat is this worm always following us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t take it seriously. The worm couldn\u2019t attack the flowers since the Little White Tiger would kill it.</p><br/><p>\u201cJasmine, you\u2019re blind. This isn\u2019t a green worm, it\u2019s a snake!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard this and didn\u2019t think much. The souls absolutely weren\u2019t a snake\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes a snake have claws? There are also two small bags on top of its head.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>He quickly turned back and saw the tragic creature being picked up. This worm or snake was Sage Azure Dragon!</p><br/><p>Little Azure Dragon looked pitiful, his indigo eyes blinking in an innocent and confused manner.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hurriedly picked him up. \u201cHe is a dragon, an azure dragon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The jasmine was dazed. \u201cWhat is an azure dragon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at the little guy in front of him and found it difficult to explain how he might become domineering in the future.</p><br/><p>White Tiger also asked, \u201cCan we eat it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After hitting him, Xie Xi exclaimed, \u201cHe is your brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>In Atlantis, White Tiger was the third prince and Azure Dragon was the fourth prince. They were indeed brothers.</p><br/><p>White Tiger scoffed. \u201cMy brother should also be a white tiger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him. \u201cHe will be your younger brother in the future. Don\u2019t bully your brother when he is small.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing was different and replied quickly. \u201cI will take care of my brothers.\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger blew up again. \u201cWho is your brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing ignored him and turned towards Xie Xi. \u201cLord Flower God, White Tiger isn\u2019t my brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Little Houqing, this angel was a bit black-bellied.</p><br/><p>Poor Little Azure Dragon couldn\u2019t talk and could only wrap himself around Xie Xi\u2019s wrist.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt itchy and intimate as he touched the small bags on his head. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. I\u2019ll take care of you in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Okay, who made him boast that he would give Jiang Xie a brand new childhood?</p><br/><p>Both of them were his child versions and he couldn\u2019t say that Jiang Xie\u2019s childhood was a bit too much.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was a man who did as he promised.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t feel reluctant to see Little Azure Dragon. The souls were treated equally and none of them would lack anything.</p><br/><p>As for Nine Tails who said he had never seen the flower god\u2026 how did he become Houqing\u2019s brother?</p><br/><p>It was estimated that something had happened midway. In any case, he didn\u2019t believe that he couldn\u2019t find Little Nine Tails.</p><br/><p>They soon met.</p><br/><p>The jasmine always had a strange perspective. \u201cWow, who is so wasteful to lose 10 scarfs?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Wait, why was it 10?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked over and found that the silver fox was too small while his tails were too big. His body also looked like a scarf!</p><br/><p>The jasmine was happy. \u201cLord Flower God, can I take a scarf back?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was afraid that the jasmine really would pull off a fox tail and picked up the little fox. \u201cHe isn\u2019t a scarf. He is a fox, a nine tailed fox.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Nine Tails was sleeping and didn\u2019t feel much from being picked up. He just turned over and continued to sleep.</p><br/><p>Perhaps there were too many tails that consumed a lot of energy. His body couldn\u2019t bear it and he had to sleep more, just like Xie Xi slept for five years.</p><br/><p>The harvest on this trip was very fruitful but White Tiger wasn\u2019t happy. \u201cThis scarf won\u2019t be my brother, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing told him, \u201cYou are the same colour. Isn\u2019t this your brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>This logic was really hard. Little White Tiger froze for a long time but unexpectedly couldn\u2019t refute it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was still looking for the last little one. This time, it wasn\u2019t discovered by the jasmine. The little sleeping fox suddenly opened his eyes and rushed out like lightning.</p><br/><p>He was so fast that Xie Xi couldn\u2019t catch him. A moment later, Nine Tails strolled back with a chick in his mouth\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cChirp\u2026 let me go\u2026 you stinking fox\u2026 I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m not a chicken, chirp\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this? Vermilion Bird was treated as a chicken?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Xie Xi saw that his Beginner Repair had become Intermediate Repair.</p><br/><p>On the whole, Xie Xi was very relieved. Intermediate Repair could find the missing part on its own. As long as the pair wasn\u2019t destroyed, it could be repaired even if it wasn\u2019t next to the person.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t delay after doing this and came out. The moment he came out, the servants came up to him. Xie Xi didn\u2019t panic and directly told them, \u201cDon\u2019t enter in order to let Lord Houqing have a good rest. Wait a few days until he recovers.\u201d</p><br/><p>The servants were a bit suspicious but they chose to believe him. Xie Xi had lived in Houqing Palace for a while and Houqing simply placed Xie Xi on the palm of his hand. Everyone could understand it. Moreover, Houqing wasn\u2019t dead but he was seriously injured. It was necessary for him to rest and recuperate. This type of thing couldn\u2019t be seen by ordinary servants.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi emphasized it again, \u201cLord Houqing told me to find something. You must lock the door and no one is allowed to go in.\u201d</p><br/><p>A servant hurriedly asked, \u201cDo you need any help?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he pulled the sluggish Red Two and left Houqing Palace.</p><br/><p>The moment he walked out, he sighed with relief and the other roses surrounded him. \u201cWhat happened? Why did Sage White Tiger suddenly attack the Demon Sea?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen he suddenly left?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is Ancestor Houqing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that Ancestor Nine Tails disappeared!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWas he killed by Sage White Tiger?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over. This is a big deal\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis white rose is too powerful. He stirred up a messed that turned the earth upside down!\u201d</p><br/><p>Red Two\u2019s spirit returned. He looked at Xie Xi, looked at Xie Xi, then looked again\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him and Red Two shivered.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back to Rose Mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of roses didn\u2019t know anything and trusted Xie Xi. On the way back, they gathered to condemn the white rose.</p><br/><p>The brave Red Two knew what it was like to see a group of brave people court disaster and felt helpless! Shut up roses, don\u2019t swear in front of the person involved!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t care. He originally wanted to give Red Two time to go back and prepare the rose family. Unfortunately, time didn\u2019t wait for people. He wasn\u2019t worried. If they weren\u2019t prepared, the little flowers should also experience some wind and rain.</p><br/><p>The roses were still chattering and Xie Xi directly struck them with thunder. \u201cI am the white rose. Ask me anything if you want to know.\u201d</p><br/><p>The roses, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi added, \u201cOr you can ask Brother Red Two. He also knows.\u201d</p><br/><p>The roses turned towards Red Two.</p><br/><p>Red Two, \u201c\u2026\u201d H-He really knew!</p><br/><p>Thus, Xie Xi came clean. The group of flowers whispered around Red Two. From time to time, there were startled cries, inhales and the artificial sound of the heart beating faster\u2026 hey, something seemed wrong.</p><br/><p>Forget it, Xie Xi wasn\u2019t in the mood to manage these things.</p><br/><p>They used Nine Tails\u2019 fast mount and it didn\u2019t take long to return to Rose Mountain.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was going to send the flowers back to Rose Mountain before going to the Holy Mountain.</p><br/><p>There were still three illustrations missing. White Tiger was too difficult so he would go to Vermilion Bird first and finally\u2026</p><br/><p>He was thinking this when the mount arrived at Rose Mountain. He just descended from the mount when he discovered that the atmosphere was wrong.</p><br/><p>The roses who accompanied him were breathlessly quiet as they stayed three metres away from him. Xie Xi might\u2019ve saved countless roses but his great achievements were too scary. It was normal that no one could accept it for a while.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi descended from the mount and as soon as he touched the ground, he saw the three men standing in front of him.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon\u2019s eyes were dark and heavy, Vermilion Bird was holding his chest and White Tiger had an unfathomable look.</p><br/><p>Um\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi regretted it a bit. He should\u2019ve drawn the illustrations and directly left this broken world! That bastard Old Jiang, he didn\u2019t leave Xie Xi alive!</p><br/><p>The roses who saw this were shaken. They crowded together and hugged each other. Red Two added a sentence, \u201cThis is good. Our Rose Mountain will become a legend.\u201d The legend of the slag who hooked three sages!</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird opened his mouth first. \u201cXiao Xie, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon just stared at him.</p><br/><p>White Tiger knew everything and his thin lips slightly curved. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you protecting Houqing? Aren\u2019t you going to be with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The words caused clouds to surge in Azure Dragon and Vermilion Bird\u2019s eyes. Xie Xi wanted to kill this little tiger!</p><br/><p>Fortunately, today\u2019s Xie Xi was different. In the face of these three people, he didn\u2019t panic and came up with the perfect countermeasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll clearly explain the previous things,\u201d Xie Xi calmly told them. \u201cFirst, I hope that you can bring your respective god\u2019s wisdom scrolls to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon and Vermilion Bird didn\u2019t understand the meaning of his words but Xie Xi believed they would do it. It was only White Tiger\u2026</p><br/><p>White Tiger\u2019s thin lips slightly moved. \u201cDon\u2019t touch that thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>He had memories of the past and naturally knew why the flower god disappeared. The god\u2019s wisdom was the culprit and White Tiger couldn\u2019t let Xie Xi do it again!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him and spoke slowly, \u201cI remember everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger was stunned and complained, \u201cThat waste Houqing!\u201d Xie Xi came back from Houqing Palace. No matter how Xie Xi remembered things, it clearly had to do with Houqing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi walked towards him, eyes gentle as he whispered, \u201cLittle White, give me the god\u2019s wisdom and I can solve all these problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned when he was called Little White.</p><br/><p>Both Azure Dragon and Vermilion Bird frowned. They clearly didn\u2019t know too much and were confused about the situation.</p><br/><p>The flowers felt the collapse of Rose Mountain. Oh my god\u2026 White 99, where did he gain the courage. He unexpectedly called the most powerful and violent Sage White Tiger by Little\u2026 Little\u2026</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t even think about it!</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Sage White Tiger should be angry and screaming at the little rose but he wasn\u2019t. Instead, his red eyes showed a hint of grievance.</p><br/><p>The roses, \u201c!!\u201d It must be an illusion!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also saw it and thought of the suffering over the years. He heart ached and his voice was softer. \u201cBe obedient. This time I won\u2019t leave you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger\u2019s eyes were red and his voice was hoarse. \u201cYou liar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBelieve me again. If I die this time, I will take you with me, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>These words completely persuaded White Tiger.</p><br/><p>He turned around and screamed, \u201cEveryone, wait here, I will get the god\u2019s wisdom.\u201d He would even bring the god\u2019s wisdom that belonged to Azure Dragon and Vermilion Bird.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was relieved since the hardest thing had been done.</p><br/><p>White Tiger went to get the god\u2019s wisdom and Azure Dragon and Vermilion Bird stood still, not knowing what to think.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was fearless. So what if he was exposed? In any case, the souls supplemented everything lacking for him.</p><br/><p>Amnesia plus amnesia plus amnesia. Purple Nine wasn\u2019t deceived. This little rose really forget everything 360 days a year!</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon whispered, \u201cYou remembered everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said this and Xie Xi finally remembered. Oh, he also lost his memory with Azure Dragon and forgot matters in the Demon Sea.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cI have forgotten too many things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon frowned and there was some embarrassment in his voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I took advantage of you.\u201d He proposed and took advantage of Xie Xi\u2019s amnesia to tie Xie Xi to him for a lifetime.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about those things\u2026\u201d Xie Xi sighed. \u201cI am the flower god.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon and Vermilion Bird were stunned. Vermilion Bird suddenly asked, \u201cWe used to know each other, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t expect these words.</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird was sharp. \u201cI proposed to you before\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled. \u201cDo you remember?\u201d</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird slowly spoke, \u201cNo wonder when I felt you were so familiar when I saw you on the Holy Mountain. No wonder why I felt like I was waiting for someone for thousands of years. No wonder\u2026\u201d He was reluctant after knowing that Azure Dragon and Xie Xi were close.</p><br/><p>It was because he always felt that he should be the first to know Xie Xi and should be the only companion in Xie Xi\u2019s life. Everything was forgotten but the unforgettable thoughts were consistent in his heart.</p><br/><p>White Tiger left and came back quickly. By the time they finished this conversation, he was back with the three fragments of the god\u2019s wisdom. He was free to go in and out of Azure Dragon Palace and Vermilion Bird palace because they removed the wards for him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was relieved when he saw the god\u2019s wisdom. \u201cGive them all to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger hesitated.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi held out his hand. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time I won\u2019t lie to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger handed him the scrolls. In Xie Xi\u2019s hands, the god\u2019s wisdom became a book and merged with the previous two parts to become complete.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t in a hurry to open the god\u2019s wisdom. Instead, he looked at the three of them and asked, \u201cYou are all injured, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>They replied in unison, \u201cThere is no hindrance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi ordered, \u201cChange back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The trio didn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know what\u2019s going on?</p><br/><p>They wanted to\u2026 too much.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon\u2019s scales were missing, Vermilion Bird\u2019s feathers were scorched and White Tiger\u2019s wings were incomplete\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was distressed but fortunately, he could repair them one by one. In the countless years spend in the god\u2019s wisdom, Xie Xi wasn\u2019t idle. He made many puppets just in case. This could be used to repair the bodies.</p><br/><p>The old chief\u2019s eyes widened at the scene and he said slowly, \u201cThis is the power of the flower god. I saw it when I was young. He repaired the scales of Sage Azure Dragon, the tail feathers of Sage Vermillion Bird, the wings of the White Tiger\u2026 it is said that he also repaired the tails of the nine tailed demon ancestor and the three heads and six arms of Houqing ancestor\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Did the old chief previously saw it? Perhaps he only saw it at this moment.</p><br/><p>Once the repairs were completed, Xie Xi opened the god\u2019s wisdom.</p><br/><p>White Tiger\u2019s pupils shrank but before he could ask anything, Xie Xi had written Bai Hong on the white tiger illustration. White Tiger snapped out, \u201cYou lied to me again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had no time to answer him. He quickly wrote Long Yin and Feng Yan down.</p><br/><p>Once the names were written, Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird and White Tiger disappeared into thin air.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t stop writing and gave surnames to everything he could think of. He couldn\u2019t give many names but names were born from last names.</p><br/><p>It was just like sprinkling a few seeds that would eventually grow into a forest. Xie Xi gave surnames and this would produce countless names.</p><br/><p>In the end, he drew his own body in the god\u2019s wisdom and wrote the words \u2018Xie Xi.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was a bang and he disappeared.</p><br/><p>What was real inside and outside the drawing?</p><br/><p>Where you are is real.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

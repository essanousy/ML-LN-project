If he knew, he would certainly abandon this person.</p><br/><p>What was good to hear? What was the difference between the chirped pronunciation and Chirp Xie?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was feeling self-satisfaction!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was satisfied after hearing this and came up with anew operation. \u201cWe will be a family in the future. I am older than you so call me Brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He knew what this person was planning!</p><br/><p>He coaxed Jiang Xie, \u201cI acknowledged you as my master and will call you Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was caught between \u2018Master Chirp\u2019 and \u2018Brother Chirp\u2019 but he really wanted the latter.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou only acknowledged a master for your health. In my heart, you are my family.\u201d Jiang Xie tried to coax Xie Xi again.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to let him down and had to say, \u201cBrother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie heard a small \u2018Chirp.\u2019</p><br/><p>He choked, reacted to the single word and modified it. \u201cCall me Older Brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d This hooligan couldn\u2019t let it go!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi did as he wished.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Jiang Xie only heard, \u201cChirp Chirp.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound was very good and soft but he still wanted to hear Chirp Brother\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie inwardly sighed as he realized what it meant by he couldn\u2019t have both fish and a bear\u2019s paw (as food).</p><br/><p>Then Jiang Xie soon recovered his spirit. It was nothing. Once Little Chirp became more and more skilled, he would call out Brother. There wasn\u2019t much time to listen to the chirping so he should cherish it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had carefully counted and the more Xie Xi spoke, the number of chirps had changed from three chirps in seven words to two chirps. According to this progress, he soon wouldn\u2019t be able to hear the lovely little voice.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know what Jiang Xie was thinking. Of course, he would still accompany Jiang Xie even if he knew.</p><br/><p>No matter what, Jiang Xie didn\u2019t have a complete childhood and talking to Little Chirp was one of Jiang Xie\u2019s few childish actions.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi would cherish it well, just like Jiang Xie cherished every one of his moments.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t early and the two of them should go to sleep.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s head was too big and he couldn\u2019t fit on a bed. If it was in the wild then Xie Xi would lean against a tree and Jiang Xie could sleep well against him.</p><br/><p>However, this time both of them were in a house and on a bed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie mused, \u201cWhat is the law behind you becoming bigger and smaller? Do you feel anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi recalled it. \u201cWas it a knock on the brain?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes were full of laughter as he said, \u201cLet\u2019s try it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi bowed his head and approached, Jiang Xie patting it gently.</p><br/><p>There was no change. Xie Xi didn\u2019t become smaller.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie thought about it. \u201cDo you have to say big or little?\u201d</p><br/><p>The first time Xie Xi became smaller, he had been pulling at Jiang Xie\u2019s clothes to make him go outside. Jiang Xie had knocked on his head and said, \u201cLittle Chirp.\u201d There was the word \u2018little\u2019 in it.</p><br/><p>The second time Xie Xi became bigger, Jiang Xie had tapped his head and asked him, \u201cIs your curiosity so big?\u201d There was the word \u2018big.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then knocking on the head was one condition and saying the size was another?</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s try it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie once again patted the big head and said, \u201cLittle.\u201d</p><br/><p>This worked. Xie Xi felt dizzy and then rapidly shrunk. He turned into an egg-sized white dumpling.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned down to pick him up and smiled, \u201cIt seems right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw the enlarged Jiang Xie and spoke with some dizziness, \u201cBigger is better. I want to become bigger!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought his volume was too small and he couldn\u2019t be heard. Thus, he shouted, \u201cI want to become bigger! It is too inconvenient to be small!\u201d In addition, he couldn\u2019t the sketch pen.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie questioned, \u201cIs it impossible for you to speak after becoming smaller?\u201d</p><br/><p>It turned out that Xie Xi\u2019s words were only chirping in Jiang Xie\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi cried out, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t understand but knew Little Xie was anxious when he saw the bird jumping up and down. \u201cLet\u2019s sleep first and wait until tomorrow to become bigger?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want this. \u201cI will become bigger now. I have so many feathers that I can sleep on the ground.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, he was a bird and his sentences didn\u2019t make sense.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that your body can\u2019t adapt to frequent changes. I will hold you to sleep and you will be warmer.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he placed Little Chirp on his chest.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt the other person\u2019s body temperature. It really was comfortable.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw that Little Chirp wasn\u2019t calling to transform and patted him. \u201cSleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi lay on the other person\u2019s heart, listened to the smooth heartbeat and really fell asleep.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s fine. He would wait until tomorrow to get bigger\u2026</p><br/><p>He had a good dream and the sky had just brightened when he woke up.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had slept less than six hours but there was no other way. Yan Zhe might\u2019ve said that the black fog wouldn\u2019t reach them in three days but it was better to hurry.</p><br/><p>The black fog approaching meant there would be more and more monsters. It was really unsuitable to stay here for a long time.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe had just woken up. He was about to open his mouth when Jiang Xie pointed to his own chest.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe realized that Little Chirp was still asleep and nodded.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie made a simple breakfast and after eating, he packed his bags in a simple manner.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe\u2019s state was much better than before and his strength had also recovered a lot. He carefully took care of the weapons Xie Xi previously created.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie knew without asking that Yan Zhe would go with them.</p><br/><p>Who would want to be swallowed up by the dark fog if there was even a glimmer of hope?</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe whispered, \u201cI won\u2019t be a burden.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t say much.</p><br/><p>By the time Xie Xi woke up, they were already on their way.</p><br/><p>He opened his eyes and chirped.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked him, \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi poked out his small head and the first thing he saw was the enlarged version of Yan Zhe.</p><br/><p>He was stunned. The skin was zoomed in by so much yet the skin on the face was still meticulous. God Yan\u2019s face would make ceramics afraid!</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cLittle Chirp, good morning!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>This clear and loud chirping gave Yan Zhe a rare feeling. He wanted to touch the furry Little Chirp but Jiang Xie wouldn\u2019t allow it.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat first.\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke as he placed a peeled melon seed in front of Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi used the other person\u2019s palm as a table and ate deliciously.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember to make me bigger later.\u201d Xie Xi couldn\u2019t rest assured since this body was too inconvenient. If he was bigger then he could better support them in fights\u2026</p><br/><p>He just thought this when they were attacked!</p><br/><p>A gun was fired and the bullet headed straight towards Jiang Xie\u2019s lower abdomen.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t open a space shield in this small body. If Jiang Xie was shot like this\u2026</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe jumped and blocked the bullet with his back.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes narrowed and Xie Xi also jumped wildly.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe told them, \u201cI can only block one shot. I won\u2019t be able to recover if there is another shot.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had a strong self-healing ability. The shot hit him in the back and only his clothes were torn. The bullet slid down like the previous dirt and didn\u2019t really hurt his body.</p><br/><p>Or perhaps he was injured and the injury was cured by this powerful healing ability!</p><br/><p>This was a really scary ability.</p><br/><p>However, there were limits. As Yan Zhe stated, he could only block one shot. He wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on if the person fired again.</p><br/><p>No matter how powerful the healing ability, it couldn\u2019t continuously heal such a fatal wound.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it is the silver-haired elf. I shot him and he is fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe saved Jiang Xie but also completely exposed themselves.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s reaction was very quick and he told Yan Zhe and Xie Xi, \u201cRetreat to the back.\u201d He pulled out a gun and fired.</p><br/><p>A thumping sound came from the opposite side.</p><br/><p>Someone was shot!</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t kill anyone but it made the man unable to fight.</p><br/><p>There was certainly more than one person. Jiang Xie fired and then hid behind another tree, listening calmly.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe went to another tree with Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very anxious. He wanted to grow bigger since he drew too slowly in his current form. In the present situation, how could he dare disturb Jiang Xie?</p><br/><p>Any small distraction would allow the other side to take his life!</p><br/><p>Sure enough, he should\u2019ve become bigger last night!</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe pulled out the previous gun created and placed Xie Xi in a small groove in the tree. \u201cDon\u2019t run away. I\u2019ll help Jiang Xie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded hard while trying to manipulate the sketch pen.</p><br/><p>He had to put the shield on both of them. His entire body might be almost flattened by the sketch pen but he had to draw two space shields!</p><br/><p>The noise outside was calmed by a cold shot.</p><br/><p>There was a large number of people. Since they recognized Yan Zhe, they definitely weren\u2019t ordinary people.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe had told his story where he had been sold on the black market. He was abducted by several people on the way so his information had long spread out. Countless people knew there was a silver-haired elf could revive people from death.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe had worn a simple disguise when going out but his hair couldn\u2019t be tied up, wrapped or dyed. Everything was in vain if he couldn\u2019t hide this.</p><br/><p>The silver hair was so conspicuous that anyone could guess his identity as long as they saw it.</p><br/><p>The thing that people valued the most was life and this was the most chaotic time. They didn\u2019t mind killing innocent people for a blood bag.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe gripped his pistol and told Jiang Xie, \u201cBe careful. They might be transformed people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie nodded.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the opposite side was also shocked by Jiang Xie and didn\u2019t rush to act. This gave Xie Xi enough time as he tried his best to draw a space shield.</p><br/><p>It was probably because he drew too much recently. The sketch had adapted and the drawing was very good, the god\u2019s wisdom recognized it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t think as he threw it around Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Then he chirped loudly.</p><br/><p>It was unknown what Jiang Xie was thinking but he emerged from behind the tree and actively attacked the enemy!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare to rest and quickly drew a second shield. God Yan had been overdrawn by the gunshot just now.</p><br/><p>He must be given a shield as soon as possible!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was absorbed in painting and wasn\u2019t worried about Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>As long as the space shield was in effect, the opposite side would never be able to harm Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe sighed and muttered, \u201cI was too anxious and forgot about his ability to not be shot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard this and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cNo, thankfully you saved him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, Yan Zhe didn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi made up his mind. He had to let Jiang Xie explain that he didn\u2019t know his ability and wasn\u2019t the cause of the space shield. If God Yan mistakenly thought this was Jiang Xie\u2019s ability, he wouldn\u2019t bother blocking any future gunshots and knives.</p><br/><p>The opposite side never thought they had provoked a murderous god!</p><br/><p>They saw Yan Zhe\u2019s silver hair and didn\u2019t hesitate to shoot in order to steal this person.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was just a young man and it was easy to shoot him.</p><br/><p>Who would\u2019ve expected Yan Zhe to block the shot. Even so, they hadn\u2019t thought too much. They were just more excited since this really was the silver-haired elf who could come back from the dead!</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until Jiang Xie fired back and hit their teammate that they became alert. They were afraid that Jiang Xie was a transformed person.</p><br/><p>Then their vigilance quickly dissipated. So what if he was a transformed person? How could a young man with no combat experience match the four of them?</p><br/><p>They would take care of him first and might be able to steal his ability!</p><br/><p>However, this time they really kicked over the iron plate.</p><br/><p>They were all shocked when Jiang Xie rushed over. Did the boy want to die?</p><br/><p>They knew when they shot\u2026</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that he wanted to die. It was that knives and guns wouldn\u2019t affect him!</p><br/><p>Rather than using a pistol, Jiang Xie held the long knife and cut them. They abandoned their armour and fled.</p><br/><p>He only killed the first person he shot and the others left alive.</p><br/><p>Was it impossible for Jiang Xie to kill them?</p><br/><p>No, he did it on purpose.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe couldn\u2019t disguise himself and they were bound to meet more and more people.</p><br/><p>Rather than letting these little people keep trying, it was better to tell them straightforwardly, \u2018If you want to try it then measure your own ability first!\u2019</p><br/><p>Yes, Jiang Xie declared war against all those who were greedy!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi watched the other person walk back with the bloody knife and his heart shook.</p><br/><p>He felt that this was the Jiang Xie of the past.</p><br/><p>He truly saw the strongest designer in Central, who stepped on thorns to reach the top during his most immature time.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Was the touch as smooth as it looked? Or would it be like tender tofu?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s mouth was dry and the person in front of him was like an oasis in the desert. This person could cool him, quench his thirst and extinguish the indescribable heat in his heart.</p><br/><p>He touched Xie Xi gently on the back of the hand.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the first time he touched Xie Xi. He had held this hand countless times in the last six months.</p><br/><p>It had never been like this before. It felt like he was being sucked in, as if there were countless tiny ants nibbling at his fingertips and letting him\u2026</p><br/><p>What was he doing?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie quickly pulled back with a pale face. He fled back into the house, leaning against the cold wall and breathing deeply.</p><br/><p>Was estrus so terrible?</p><br/><p>He went so crazy that he regarded the man who adopted him as a female beastman! How could this be?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie got a basin of cold water and poured it all over himself. The burning of his fingertips went away but the throbbing of his heart still existed.</p><br/><p>He suddenly remembered the bouquet of flowers and the words that the others told Xie Xi. \u2018Mr Xie, you should find a companion too.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stated that he was in poor health and didn\u2019t want to drag down others. Did this mean he would marry if he recovered?</p><br/><p>That was for certain. Who wanted to live alone for the rest of their lives?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie slowly sank to the ground while holding his wet hair with both hands.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t think about it. He would wait for Xie Xi\u2019s body to be well and he should also embark on the road of revenge. It would be good if there was someone to accompany Xie Xi. He, he would be relieved.</p><br/><p>He told himself this but it was like a knife stabbed at his heart.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sat for a long time before getting up and changing his clothes.</p><br/><p>He calmed down. Just now, he was occupied by the silly physiological desires and his thoughts were a mess.</p><br/><p>There was nothing to think about. Ignoring the deep blood feud, what could he do even if he stayed with Xie Xi?</p><br/><p>They were both males.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saved him and treated him as a child. How could he used dirty thoughts to humiliate Xie Xi?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sighed softly and went out to call Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>It was good to be in the sun but it had been along time since this person had eaten.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir?\u201d He called out to Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his eyes, the pair of slightly blank eyes like black crystal that swept away the stars in the sky and struck at Jiang Xie\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>The thoughts that Jiang Xie suppressed surged even more sharply.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s voice was filled with some chagrin. \u201cHow did I fall asleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>He got up and it seemed he was dizzy from being in the sunlight for a long time. Once he got up from the chair, his body shook slightly.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned forward and helped hold him up.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled at him. \u201cLook at me, I\u2019m really useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s hand was on this person\u2019s waist. Through the sun-hot clothes, he seemed to be able to pinch this thin waist\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Xie?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie woke up sharply. His first thought was to pull away his hand but Xie Xi would fall.</p><br/><p>His throat moved as he looked down to see Xie Xi\u2019s dry lips.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up at him. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>It felt like gunpowder blowing apart Jiang Xie\u2019s body. Six or seven souls flew away at once.</p><br/><p>\u201cBack\u2026\u201d He controlled his voice. \u201cGo back to the house. Dinner is ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes flashed as he whispered, \u201cI\u2019m always bothering you to cook.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of raising my hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m really your father then I\u2019m too incompetent.\u201d</p><br/><p>The heartless words were like a basin of cold water being poured on Jiang Xie\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Father\u2026</p><br/><p>Older\u2026</p><br/><p>Male\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled reluctantly. \u201cDon\u2019t say that. You treat me very well. I would\u2019ve died without you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi paused before sighing softly. \u201cYou\u2019re a good boy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi often said these words, especially during Jiang Xie\u2019s childhood. He often coaxed Jiang Xie like this.</p><br/><p>Previously, Jiang Xie might not feel like a child anymore but he loved to listen to these words. He felt acknowledged.</p><br/><p>Now he heard Xie Xi say so and his heart felt like it was stabbed by needles.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stated, \u201cI\u2019m an adult. I\u2019m not a child.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up at him with a trace of worry. \u201cYes, you have grown up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie knew this person was worried about his marriage and his heart suffered even more.</p><br/><p>\u201cI bought sweet corn, broke it apart and cooked it in porridge. It tastes good. You can go in and eat it.\u201d Jiang Xie knew that Xie Xi liked to eat corn from outside the village because it was sweet, crunchy and juicy.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was delighted. \u201cThen I should hurry. It isn\u2019t good to eat if it is cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie brought him into the house. \u201cThere\u2019s no hurry. I\u2019m using the fire to keep it warm.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke again. \u201cYou are really capable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all trivial. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi seemed to want to say something but stopped.</p><br/><p>The corn porridge was sweet and delicious and Xie Xi ate more than half a bowl.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was afraid he would get indigestion and didn\u2019t give him anymore.\u201dIf you want to eat, I\u2019ll give you a bowl later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also didn\u2019t dare to eat anymore. His body was too more and the amount of exercise was seriously inadequate. If he ate a bit more then he would suffer in the evening.</p><br/><p>He replied, \u201cGood things can\u2019t be finished. Let\u2019s eat again tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi ate light food while Jiang Xie ate a large piece of cooked meat. After the transformation, he no longer ate raw meat but ate a balanced diet like humans.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was cutting meat on the plate when he suddenly opened his mouth. \u201cDo you have any plans for after your body is better?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled bitterly. \u201cMy body\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t like to hear him speak sad words. \u201cIt will certainly be better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s tone was full of indulgence. \u201cYes, it will be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you have anything you want to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at the other person and soon opened his mouth again. \u201cWhy are you suddenly asking about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s hand cut the meat, his heart flying to an unknown place. \u201cIt is very lucky that you caught the bouquet of flowers. Once your body is well, you can find a female\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The following words were like a knife in the throat that couldn\u2019t be swallowed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t expect him to say this and was slightly surprised. \u201cDo you want me to find a female parent?\u201d</p><br/><p>The knife in Jiang Xie\u2019s hand cut against the plate. The sound of metal hitting porcelain was very harsh, especially in the cave.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie put down the knife and stated, \u201cAs long as you are well, there are many females willing to marry you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sat in the chair and quietly watched this person.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie seemed to feel that he was completely seen through.</p><br/><p>No way, it was absolutely impossible!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie clenched his fists under the table while continuing, \u201cThis is normal. Getting married and having children is something we all do.\u201d</p><br/><p>The more he spoke, the more he wanted to cover up the taste\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gazed at this person deeply. \u201cYou are old enough to get married.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cI don\u2019t want to marry anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t tell the other person about revenge, only saying, \u201cThere are no suitable people here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cThen do you want to go back to the Lion Country to find someone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was clearly the one who initiated it first. He clearly asked Xie Xi first but the moment he heard Xie Xi\u2019s blunt question, a knot formed in his heart and he wanted to shout in a wronged and unwilling manner, \u2018Don\u2019t mention the matter of marrying again! It is very good if we continue like this!\u2019</p><br/><p>How could this be?</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t do so even if he wanted.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to the Lion Country.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie added, \u201cBut I won\u2019t marry any tigers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi responded with slight tiredness, \u201cI am tired. I\u2019ll go to rest first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi got up. \u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie cleaned up the chopsticks and stayed in the kitchen to think.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what was wrong with himself. He was in good health, not bound by any desires and didn\u2019t feel an uncontrollable heat.</p><br/><p>The most uncomfortable thing was the heart in his chest. He didn\u2019t know how to describe it. It was as if he woke up overnight and he didn\u2019t know when a person had been placed in his heart.</p><br/><p>That night, Jiang Xie had a dream.</p><br/><p>In his dream, he was in a completely strange place. It seemed to be a garden with roses blooming like a rolling red wave.</p><br/><p>In the distance, there was a small pavilion made of an unknown white jade. Inside was a round table with two small stools.</p><br/><p>There was a man in the pavilion. Instead of sitting on a small stool, he was leaning against the pavilion. He seemed to be looking at something in a serious and focused manner.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie approached step by step, his heart beating quickly.</p><br/><p>The man seemed to sense him and turned his head with a smile. In an instant, the red roses became white and the whole world was instantly clear.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie felt a gust of wind that blew open his heart, giving him endless pleasure and comfort.</p><br/><p>He walked up and unknowingly hugged this person.</p><br/><p>Not only did the man not push him away, the man always wrapped an arm around his neck.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie bowed his head and covered his lips, kissing this person closely.</p><br/><p>The man said, \u201cN-Not here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t listen and pressed him against the white jade pillar.</p><br/><p>The man was a bit annoyed but his voice was sweet and seductive.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wanted to kiss this person but always wanted to listen to his voice. For a time, he felt that nothing was enough.</p><br/><p>The person exclaimed, \u201cEnough!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie gently bit him on the neck. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man stared at him with wet eyes. \u201cJiang Xie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re almost\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie opened his mouth. \u201cLittle Xie, I miss you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Jiang Xie awakened from the dream. He sat up in a cold sweat, his eyes full of fear. The man in his dream was Xie Xi, the person who saved his life and brought him up.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was delusional and actually had such a dream. He was really\u2026 a bastard!</p><br/><p>In the other room, Xie Xi also woke up from a dream. How did he dream of Central again?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi rubbed his temple and got up to drink water. He moved and felt his body was a bit sticky.</p><br/><p>He dreamed of Central and also doing those things was Jiang Xie. Was he a bit dissatisfied?</p><br/><p>It was a pity that his lover was near yet his lover wanted him to marry someone else.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really wanted to pick up the little lion and shake the water off his head, making him sober! But\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi slowly changed clothes, thinking, \u2018No wonder why Jiang Xie didn\u2019t express his feelings, causing me to think about this.\u2019</p><br/><p>Still, what could Xie Xi say? He had this broken body and couldn\u2019t help Jiang Xie through estrus.</p><br/><p>Then Xie Xi had a new worry. What should he do with his sticky clothes?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

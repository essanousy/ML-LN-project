Was it normal to look like this? Why did he fall for Sein Hall as well? Or should it be said, Sein Hall was so mad that he didn\u2019t even let go of his cousin!</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Xie Xi didn\u2019t know the identity of the game designer or he would search for words to curse him 18 times!</p><br/><p>He was so shocked that Greenton wasn\u2019t surprised and even felt ashamed. \u201cI was too scrupulous before and wronged you.\u201d He thought that Xie Xi\u2019s shock was a joy that came so suddenly it couldn\u2019t be accepted.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was complicated and he didn\u2019t know where to start.</p><br/><p>Greenton spoke again, \u201cI was the one in the wrong. I will never make you sad again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was anxious as he thought about Gars who was about to return. \u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Greenton was stunned.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t understand this situation and could only test it. \u201cWe aren\u2019t suitable for each other. I have thought about it for a long time and figured it out. Go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 want me to go back?\u201d Greenton\u2019s sunny face was covered with dark clouds as he frowned. \u201cYou actually told me to go back\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was numb. \u201cYes, please go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no smile on Greenton\u2019s face as he stared at Xie Xi. \u201cHave you made up your mind?\u201d</p><br/><p>Things were a bit strange but Xie Xi didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not surprisingly, the handsome and sunny cousin pulled out a silver dagger and stabbed Xie Xi with a blank expression.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He was too lazy to pretend to be surprised by this long expected ending.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the big cousin who was just blank showed a hint of astonishment. He saw Xie Xi\u2019s calm look and eyes that weren\u2019t afraid of death.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did it on purpose! Greenton hugged him, veins bulging and an insane air around him. \u201cYou deliberately irritated me. You\u2026 no\u2026 Sein\u2026 don\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was devastated as he intermittent spoke. He couldn\u2019t form a sentence.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was already loading the file. He was curious but couldn\u2019t ask. This big brother\u2019s skill was very precise, just like the vampire. It was a deadly blow that didn\u2019t give him a chance.</p><br/><p>It might not hurt but the countdown was decreasing in front of him. He couldn\u2019t waste any time.</p><br/><p>He loaded the file\u2014</p><br/><p>He returned to when Greenton held his hand to run away together.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew that refusal wasn\u2019t acceptable and couldn\u2019t refuse directly.</p><br/><p>He was curious about Greenton\u2019s words after his \u2018death\u2019 and intuition told him this must be a clue to unraveling some doubts.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can this be?\u201d Xie Xi\u2019s acting skills had increased dramatically and he made the other person very upset.</p><br/><p>Greenton exclaimed, \u201cI don\u2019t care! I don\u2019t care about anything!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought, \u2018You don\u2019t care but I do. Who wants to run away with you? I just want to survive for seven days.\u2019 Of course, he couldn\u2019t say that and had to think about his words\u2026</p><br/><p>Greenton already set up the plot. \u201c\u2026Many people have died and the duke\u2019s house and the royal family are almost reduced to graves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart jumped as he finally caught the focus after five or six days of confusion</p><br/><p>He closely watched Greenton. He hadn\u2019t thought much about it before but these sunny eyes were filled with deeply hidden fear and anxiety.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi paused.</p><br/><p>Greenton thought he was touched and sincerely said, \u201cI know that they owe you and I also hate them. They took away Auntie and abused you. I am also very sad\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, the plot of Sein Hall had surfaced.</p><br/><p>Greenton\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cI am incompetent and couldn\u2019t protect you. I could only let you embark on such a road\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What was the road? Xie Xi was curious. Unfortunately, Greenton seemed afraid of stimulating him and didn\u2019t continue speaking.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was afraid to ask anything else in fear of the hard to obtain clue going away.</p><br/><p>Greenton watched him cautiously. \u201cPrincess Xilin died and the queen has also fallen ill. I will take good care of you and spend everyday with you. Sein, can you stop?\u201d</p><br/><p>Princess Xilin? Oh, Xie Xi remembered that this was his stepmother.</p><br/><p>Greenton didn\u2019t say much but Xie Xi developed a framework.</p><br/><p>After the death of Sein Hall\u2019s birth mother, his father married Her Majesty\u2019s sister, a proud and extravagant princess. Presumably, the princess was very reluctant to see Sein. He was bullied despite being the son of a duke.</p><br/><p>The things afterwards couldn\u2019t be guessed but from Greenton\u2019s words, Sein Hall was retaliating against those who buried him.</p><br/><p>Was he ambiguous with the vampire and housekeeper to borrow their power for revenge?</p><br/><p>What type of bloodbath had he started and why were there so many assassins after him? Did he simply kill Princess Xilin?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at Greenton again and understood why this person previously stabbed it.</p><br/><p>This cousin didn\u2019t kill him just because of love and hate. He thought that Sein Hall was obsessive and unwilling to stop his plan. In order to prevent a larger disaster, Greenton killed him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi followed along. \u201cCousin, don\u2019t worry. She is dead and I won\u2019t do anything. Go back now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Greenton stared at him. \u201cYou really won\u2019t do anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was able to guarantee this. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Greenton was apparently relieved. He held Xie Xi\u2019s hand and spoke sincerely, \u201cI will accompany you and take care of you for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t need this person to accompany him and advised, \u201cCousin, don\u2019t force it. I promise you that I won\u2019t turn back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not forcing it!\u201d Greenton\u2019s eyes were full of sadness. \u201cI really regret it. Sein, if I hadn\u2019t been too worried and accepted your feelings for me early on, you wouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t understand these feelings of love. \u201cWe are cousins. It is my fault for expressing love to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Greenton was distressed. \u201cYou have been alone and experienced so much. It is normal for you to reply on me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to say, \u2018This is dependence, not love.\u2019</p><br/><p>However, he felt this remark was inappropriate and didn\u2019t want to overestimate the game world.</p><br/><p>Greenton sighed. \u201cLet me stay, even as a sacrifice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi blinked, not understanding the meaning of these words. At this time, Greenton approached and bent over to kiss him on the cheek. \u201cSein, as long as we can return to the past, I will let you do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, there was the sharp sound of porcelain falling to the ground behind them.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pushed Greenton away and saw Gars\u2019 gloomy face.</p><br/><p>XIe Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He told this person to go and he didn\u2019t. Then this was fine.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

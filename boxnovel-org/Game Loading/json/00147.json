He couldn\u2019t take into account the dazed Red Two and kept running.</p><br/><p>Red Two responded quickly and grabbed him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at him anxiously and exclaimed, \u201cBrother Red Two, I really have to pass. If I let them cause trouble then big things will happen!\u201d</p><br/><p>Red Two\u2019s soul had returned and he felt complicated. \u201cYou are that white rose?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was afraid of the delay and unceremoniously took off his vest. \u201cI really am.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said this and there was no doubt about it. Who knew that Red Two would actually sigh. \u201cYou say that you are the white rose but how can the gap be so big? One is courageous and fearless while the other is a coward who hides his head.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d What did this mean? He could understand every word but he didn\u2019t know how they fit together.</p><br/><p>Red Two took his hand. \u201cI can\u2019t let you take this risk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or cry. \u201cI really\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that you want to take the risk for us roses and stop it. However, you can\u2019t. Even if you are a white rose, you can\u2019t replace him. His sin can only be carried by himself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough, this person\u2019s brain was enough to be called two! Xie Xi seriously emphasized, \u201cI really am the white rose, the white rose they are fighting to grab.\u201d</p><br/><p>Who knew that this vest had a strong glue and couldn\u2019t be taken off! Red Two wanted to speak but Xie Xi couldn\u2019t wait any longer. He usually didn\u2019t show it and everyone really thought he was a weak rose.</p><br/><p>Still, don\u2019t forget that Xie Xi was a person with the junior qualifications. If he was serious then ordinary people couldn\u2019t stop him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, just come with me.\u201d Xie Xi didn\u2019t shake off Red Two and simply dragged him along.</p><br/><p>Red Two exclaimed, \u201cYou\u2026 you have so much strength!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was inexplicably reminded of someone\u2019s routine: My other place is bigger. What a mess! Sure enough, he should be a follower of the Mohist School.</p><br/><p>His face was red as he ran faster. He couldn\u2019t let the souls have an accident. Something this bad was dangerous!</p><br/><p>Red Two didn\u2019t know the little rose was thinking perverted thoughts and was still chattering, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. You are Sage Azure Dragon\u2019s fiance. How can you still have time to provoke Nine Tails, Houqing and White Tiger? If you really have this ability, why didn\u2019t you give anything to Vermilion Bird?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi paused. \u201cDon\u2019t be presumptuous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Red Two thought he had really \u2018collected\u2019 Vermilion Bird and compromised. \u201cOkay, I will accompany you. It is possible that once the two ancestors see that we are roses, they will listen to our words. It is a good thing if we can stop them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Forget it. Xie Xi sighed. He was too lazy to explain. In any case, truth and lies would be obvious once Red Two saw it with his own eyes.</p><br/><p>Red Two didn\u2019t know that his worldview was teetering. He clearly had the opportunity to escape but he came to witness the \u2018miracle\u2019!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi arrived and was shocked by the battle. If there was a god of war in this war, White Tiger of the Holy Mountain and Houqing of the Demon Sea deserved the name.</p><br/><p>Neither of them looked at anyone else. They just stood there but they gave off the momentum of the mountains and rivers.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Xie Xi had seen White Tiger in this quasi-world.</p><br/><p>Old Gars was actually very meticulous, especially in the first world where he pretended to be a maid and wore women\u2019s clothing. In Atlantis, he was a general who constantly won but there was an overly exquisite face under the strong armour. His personality was fierce and he always danced with knives and guns. Otherwise, there wouldn\u2019t be any woman who wasn\u2019t charmed once he took off the armour.</p><br/><p>This time, he wore silver armour with a red cloak flying through the air. His exquisite face was filled with killing intent.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi trembled. This Old Three was also good-looking. Speaking of which, he didn\u2019t think that the five people would ever look good to him. Now\u2026</p><br/><p>If Old Jiang was present, he would probably cover Xie Xi\u2019s face with gold. Beauty was in the eyes of the lover, Dear!</p><br/><p>After seeing White Tiger, he couldn\u2019t help looking at Houqing. He had met Houqing in the god\u2019s wisdom but this was the first time in reality.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took a look and his heart jerked. Houqing\u2019s face was white and his different coloured eyes dead. He was clearly standing there but it seemed like his soul had been taken away.</p><br/><p>White Tiger shouted angrily, \u201cYou\u2019re trash.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive him to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing was silent and still didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>White Tiger had the temper of the third child and raised his hand, long knife pointed at Houqing\u2019s chest. \u201cDon\u2019t hesitate to do something until forced!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard these words and basically guessed the situation.</p><br/><p>White Tiger thought the white rose was with Houqing but the white rose had long been taken away by Nine Tails.</p><br/><p>After Houqing lost the person, he was in a state of despair. Now that he had to face White Tiger\u2019s forced questioning, how could he say anything?</p><br/><p>This was the so-called \u2018valuing both equally.\u2019 Xie Xi was really pained by Houqing. He was pitiful in Atlantis and this time wasn\u2019t much better. First, his lover was dug away by Nine Tails and now he had to face White Tiger\u2019s resentment. How miserable was he/</p><br/><p>He tried to come forward, only for White Tiger to stab at Houqing\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d He hurriedly opened his mouth but it was already too late.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t expect that Houqing wouldn\u2019t even dodge!</p><br/><p>It was true that White Tiger\u2019s fighting power went against the sky but Houqing wasn\u2019t an ordinary person! He was a person who rivalled White Tiger in strength. How could he not even hide from the knife? Houqing didn\u2019t want to hide.</p><br/><p>White Tiger turned his head and crimson eyes locked on Xie Xi. Xie Xi\u2019s heart jumped. If this gaze could be turned into something real, White Tiger\u2019s eyes would be a dense net that tightly bound Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>He was stared at like this and couldn\u2019t move at all.</p><br/><p>Houqing also turned his head. He saw Houqing but there were no fluctuations in the different coloured eyes. It was like a pool of stagnant water, the calm making people feel distressed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was stabbed and he cried out, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you dodge?\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing took a breath and whispered, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was he apologizing for the substitute matter? Xie Xi didn\u2019t care about it at all.</p><br/><p>White Tiger pulled out the long blade and demanded coldly, \u201c99, come back with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could only manage one person at a time and naturally picked the half-dead one. He didn\u2019t look at White Tiger and helped support Houqing. \u201cHow are you? Can you stand up?\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger\u2019s veins bulged and his angry voice filled the air. \u201c99, come here!\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone was so fierce that he seemed like he was hit someone. Xie Xi was afraid of him but didn\u2019t turn his head.</p><br/><p>White Tiger\u2019s voice was on the verge of exploding. \u201cHis shadow has been ruined by me and won\u2019t live long.\u201d</p><br/><p>In this quasi-world, Houqing\u2019s setting was a zombie ancestor. His most powerful feature was his undead body. It was actually similar to Xie Xi\u2019s puppet but his shadow was stronger and more resistant to a beating.</p><br/><p>Previously, the old chief said that the flower god repaired his three heads and six arms. This was actually Houqing\u2019s shadow body. Houqing had two shadows so this was three bodies. Thus, he had three heads and six arms.</p><br/><p>The shadow body was killed. For Houqing, this was truly a deadly wound! Xie Xi felt even more anxious. He supported Houqing and wanted to take him back to find a way to save his life.</p><br/><p>The white tiger\u2019s blade came over, causing Xie Xi\u2019s scalp to feel numb! Xie Xi stood in front of Houqing and confronted White Tiger.</p><br/><p>White Tiger looked murderous. He was a sage but he seemed more brutal than a demon ancestor. He spoke through gritted teeth, \u201cDo you think I won\u2019t dare to hurt you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was fearless and stared without blinking.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere suddenly dropped to freezing point and the people watching from dozens of metres away were scared to death.</p><br/><p>Would the White Tiger do it? Such a little rose wouldn\u2019t be able to stand it!</p><br/><p>By all accounts, this was the time Red Two should pop out to save his compatriot. However, he actually couldn\u2019t move. Under this amazing momentum, people lost the ability to control their bodies!</p><br/><p>Everyone was quiet and shocked by the situation. They felt that the little rose who angered Sage White Tiger was already a dead flower.</p><br/><p>Once his anger reached the limit, the White Tiger who seemed to lose his mind suddenly stopped and slammed the long knife into the ground.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t see how big his movements were but the strength was amazing. The blade struck the ground and cracks opened. It was like an earthquake as an amazing gully appeared and shone with a faint red light. This knife went all the way down to the ground fire section!</p><br/><p>Perhaps the force was too big. The long knife shattered and scattered star-like fragments. They were like falling stars in the cold knight. It was shocking and stunning, as if the thing broken wasn\u2019t this long knife but\u2026 something in the chest.</p><br/><p>The white tiger turned and left without looking back.</p><br/><p>There was a bad taste in Xie Xi\u2019s heart but what could he do? He was only one person and there were two souls. He could only take care of the one in front of him!</p><br/><p>Houqing was very weak and his voice was low as he talked to himself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He repeated these words as if he didn\u2019t know what he was apologizing for. Xie Xi put away his emotions and helped him. \u201cI\u2019ll take you back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing glanced at him, thin lips moving.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stopped him. \u201cDon\u2019t say much. I have a way to save you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing smiled, the tenderness in his eyes making Xie Xi confused on who he really was. \u201cYou\u2026 always have a way.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words were too soft and Xie Xi couldn\u2019t hear them clearly.</p><br/><p>At this time, the \u2018frozen\u2019 Red Two was finally able to move and he chased them. \u201c99\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI\u2019ll take Lord Houqing back to the palace. You should return to Rose Mountain first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Red Two gritted his teeth. \u201cHow can I leave you alone? I will help!\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, he wasn\u2019t useful. Houqing\u2019s attendants had already caught up with them.</p><br/><p>With their help, Xie Xi could send Red Two back but Red Two insisted on following Xie Xi. Xie Xi thought about it and knew it was time for him to see the truth.</p><br/><p>Back in Houqing Palace, Houqing was placed in his room. For Xie Xi\u2019s sake, Red Two was treated as a guest of honour by the servants.</p><br/><p>Red Two finally noticed that something was wrong. He stayed outside the door and heard the dialogue inside.</p><br/><p>Houqing whispered, \u201cWhy did you come back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI can\u2019t leave you alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing was dumbfounded. \u201cYou know everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi whispered, \u201cSo what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNine Tails is good to you. Why are you\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Red Two not understand after hearing this? He timidly backed away\u2026</p><br/><p>God, 99 didn\u2019t lie to him. 99 was truly the white rose. 99 was Azure Dragon\u2019s fiance but he took the betrothal gifts of Nine Tails and Houqing and had a cub with White Tiger\u2026</p><br/><p>The three views of Red Two officially collapsed!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi did this deliberately. At this point, it was impossible to conceal it. Rather than letting the entire rose family be stunned by the worst situation, it was better to let Red Two go back and mentally prepare them. This way, the old chief of the rose family wouldn\u2019t be so scared that his soul returned to the ground.</p><br/><p>Red Two left and Xie Xi was alone with Houqing. The eyes that had been filled with great sadness came alive. \u201cIt hurts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke in a pathetic manner, \u201cMy heart was stabbed with aknife, my bones were broken and 80% of my veins destroyed\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi kissed him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was already at the limit and his face was red. \u201cIs it any better?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cMy finger bone is good but there are 206 bones, a broken heart and two shadows. If you round up and kiss me 1314 times, it should be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi cried out blankly, \u201cYou can keep being hurt!\u201d Sure enough, it wasn\u2019t worth worrying about this bastard!</p><br/><p>Poor Old Jiang was really powerless this time. Apart from playing a few tricks, he couldn\u2019t even handle a few kisses.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mouth was fierce but he didn\u2019t leave this person. He asked, \u201cIs your shadow body gone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since the flower god could repair three heads and six arms, so could Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cWhite Tiger didn\u2019t hold back and Houqing didn\u2019t resist. It is already fortunate that it is just the shadow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare ask about why Houqing didn\u2019t resist.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked again, \u201cWhat happened? Explain it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>In theory, this was the first time they were meeting and some memories needed to be passed along.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi explained in full detail while also organizing it for himself.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned after hearing that Nine Tails was sealed by the god\u2019s wisdom.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cIs Nine Tails okay?\u201d If there was something wrong with the soul then the master should know. Look at Jiang Xie\u2019s current situation.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie shook his head. \u201cHe is fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut he disappeared into thin air.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie got up and looked past Xie Xi at the god\u2019s wisdom behind him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi followed his gaze. This was Houqing\u2019s god\u2019s wisdom and there was also a painting on it. Xie Xi\u2019s gaze moved and ink appeared on the scroll.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wondered, \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA sea of flowers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cRoses?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. He couldn\u2019t see it but he guessed that it was a sea of roses. A large rose broke free from the vines and lay on the ground like a beautiful fairy descending to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this where I met Houqing,\u201d Xie Xi asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo in and take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi remembered the injury on his body. \u201cCan I change the memory in the god\u2019s wisdom?\u201d The shadow had been completely destroyed and it was impossible to repair it. Xie Xi could only prevent Houqing from being injured.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wondered, \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChanging the past, won\u2019t it affect the present?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at him and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t be bound by time. There is no limit between the past and the present.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

At 11 o\u2019clock, Xie Xi was so sleepy that he couldn\u2019t open his eyes.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned Xie Xi\u2019s head against his shoulder. \u201cGo to sleep.\u201d The little head was nodding off like a sleepy bug.</p><br/><p>The two people had expressed their feelings but Xie Xi still hadn\u2019t adapted to such an intimate move. He sat up straight and exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019m not sleepy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie held his hand. \u201cThen wait a bit longer. It is almost midnight.\u201d</p><br/><p>If he slept now, it would be hard for him to wake up in an hour.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at their hands and asked curiously, \u201cWhy is your hand so hot?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied seriously, \u201cYou are by my side so I\u2019m hot everywhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie got no response and he had no more scruples as he completely exposed his nature, \u201cThere is a place that feels the hottest. Do you want to try it?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he picked up Xie Xi\u2019s hand and moved it to himself\u2026</p><br/><p>His words were too evocative and he was moving towards his lower body. Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened, thinking this person was going to\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie straightened and placed the hand on his chest. \u201cIt is the hottest here.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the location of his heart.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi blushed and shouted, \u201cTeacher!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie faked innocence. \u201cWhat? These words of love sound good.\u201d Xie Xi pulled back, not wanting to care about him anymore.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked with a smile, \u201cWhat are you thinking in that little head of yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>What was he thinking? He\u2026 Xie Xi was so angry that he moved to the side and away from this person.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie immediately moved and leaned against him. Xie Xi moved and Jiang Xie once again followed. Xie Xi moved again\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie hugged him and said, \u201cOkay, try to move again.\u201d He directly picked up the other person and placed Xie Xi on his lap.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was a real rogue. \u201cDon\u2019t move or you really will feel something hot.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s face was bright red. He didn\u2019t go anywhere but he was angry enough to think about domestic violence!</p><br/><p>After all of this, Xie Xi was no longer sleepy. The New Year\u2019s bell rang and the two people watched the screen together.</p><br/><p>The new year had arrived. This year, they were no longer alone.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie lightly pecked Xie Xi on the lips. \u201cHappy New Year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also whispered, \u201cHappy New Year.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people stared at each other and saw themselves in the other person\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>It was amazing. They could feel so happy and satisfied after seeing themselves in the eyes of another person.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie kissed him and Xie Xi hugged his neck, clumsily but seriously kissing back.</p><br/><p>The bells echoed in their ears and the blessings on the TV seemed to cheer for them, cheering that the people who had grown up alone finally met each other.</p><br/><p>The two of them separated and Jiang Xie suggested, \u201cSleep in my room tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s back was tight. Jiang Xie buried himself in the other person\u2019s neck and took a deep breath. \u201cI won\u2019t do anything. I just want to hold you like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact\u2026 it didn\u2019t matter if he did something\u2026 Xie Xi nodded and whispered, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>He also wanted to hold Jiang Xie like this and be together through the night. It was something Xie Xi had never thought before.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart was sweet and he couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cDon\u2019t be too obedient.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie held his waist. \u201cOr I will keep pushing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The other person\u2019s hands were in his clothes! Teacher Jiang had the heart of a thief but he had no courage. He held the person tightly all night but didn\u2019t dare to move for real.</p><br/><p>He cherished a person too much and was always cautious. He was afraid that Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t like it, afraid that Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t adapt, afraid of the person\u2019s pain\u2014</p><br/><p>He had too many scruples, more than the person involved!</p><br/><p>In fact, Xie Xi also felt itchy. The two people whose hearts were connected felt this closeness wasn\u2019t enough.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi liked Jiang Xie, he liked this person so much that his heart was full. He wouldn\u2019t refuse if Jiang Xie did something right now. Liking a person would give great courage but would also make you as timid as a mouse.</p><br/><p>On the first, the tired people stayed at home and didn\u2019t have to go visit relatives.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi received a message from Xie Su, a simple \u2018Happy New Year.\u2019 Xie Xi glanced at it and deleted it.</p><br/><p>Five years ago, Xie Su had invited him to celebrate the new year with her. After Xie Xi refused, she never mentioned it again.</p><br/><p>Later she made phone calls and these became text messages. Xie Xi felt that after a few years, Xie Su would no longer send even these text messages.</p><br/><p>In fact, Xie Xi had a good understanding of Xie Su\u2019s feelings. She was his mother but also the one who most wanted him to disappear.</p><br/><p>The present Xie Xi might not need her care but he was still a burden on her heart. If he wasn\u2019t there, Xie Su would just feel relieved.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi often wondered if he was biologically related to Xie Su. How could there be such a mother in this world? A mother who gave birth to a child but didn\u2019t want to care for him.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, the winter vacation was over and Jiang Xie and Xie Xi had to return to school.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, this teacher was still \u2018tired\u2019 and held Xie Xi\u2019s waist in bed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go out.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to be like this for the rest of his life. Xie Xi no longer felt awe towards him. \u201cHow can there be a teacher like you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can I have a student like you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi raised his eyebrows. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Teacher Jiang had no self-respect. \u201cGood student, you haven\u2019t kissed me. Your old father is almost starved of oxygen and will die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or cry as he hit Jiang Xie\u2019s head. \u201cGet up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned up and pressed against him. \u201cJust give me a kiss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pushed his head away. \u201cYou haven\u2019t brushed your teeth. Go away!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are so sweet that I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi snapped in a non-angry manner, \u201cI hate it!\u201d Jiang Xie headed to the bathroom with a messy hairstyle, quietly muttering, \u201cYou hate me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him through the mirror.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie took it out of context. \u201cYou think I am old, you think I am 10 years older than you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned his head and stared at him. Jiang Xie squinted in a pitiful manner.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought, \u2018You aren\u2019t 10 years older than me, it\u2019s more like you\u2019re 10 years younger!\u2019</p><br/><p>He turned his head to gargle, put down his toothbrush and pulled down the other person to block his lips.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes were full of laughter. It wasn\u2019t a deep kiss but he was satisfied. \u201cGood, I feel that I am 10 years younger and can love you for 100 years!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was amused by him. \u201cWho wants to love you for 100 years?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChild, you\u2019re a bit greedy. Do you want to love me for 200 years?\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought that Xie Xi would ignore him. Unexpectedly, Xie Xi whispered, \u201cWe will be together as long as we live.\u201d</p><br/><p>100 years or 200 years was good\u2026 he didn\u2019t want to be separated from this person until the end of his life.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned by this sudden tide of sweet sentiment and almost couldn\u2019t bear it!</p><br/><p>School started but the two people\u2019s days were still fluttering. Xie Xi strictly prohibited this naughty monster from doing anything in school.</p><br/><p>Teacher Jiang sighed, \u201cAm I such a person?\u201d Then he caught Xie Xi in his office and kissed him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cTeacher, you\u2019re not one of those people?\u201d</p><br/><p>This man had no shame. \u201cI\u2019m someone who loves you to your bones.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!!!\u201d What about your face?</p><br/><p>It was noisy but there was nothing out of the ordinary. Teacher Jiang was an elite in front of other people while completely maintaining a high and noble flower attitude in front of his female students, an abstinent and dignified man who shouldn\u2019t be desecrated.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had never seen such a high! And! Noble! Flower!</p><br/><p>One month after the start of school, Xie Xi vaguely felt that Jiang Xie was busy with something.</p><br/><p>However, Jiang Xie didn\u2019t mention it and he didn\u2019t ask. Xie Xi was a bit perturbed. He didn\u2019t care what outsiders thought but if this relationship was revealed, the one most affected was Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi himself didn\u2019t matter. He just didn\u2019t want Jiang Xie to be hurt. Jiang Xie had his own career and own ideals. He couldn\u2019t be ruined because of Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, Xie Xi could never leave Jiang Xie. He wouldn\u2019t leave even if there was a knife in front of him. The last thing he could do was let go of a person who deeply loved him. That wasn\u2019t love, it was the deadliest betrayal!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew Jiang Xie too well, just like Jiang Xie understood him. They were lonely, equally as lonely as each other and had enough of a life alone.</p><br/><p>It was hard to meet but they were like two puzzle pieces fitting together. If they were separated then they would both be incomplete.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to have no scruples and be open with Jiang Xie. He had to dissolve their current student relationship as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>He had to work hard, finished his studies early and walk hand in hand with Jiang Xie in the bright sunlight!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

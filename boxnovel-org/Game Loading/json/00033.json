They were dark, like obsidian covered with dew. His foggy eyes caused a strange feeling to wriggle in the fifth prince\u2019s heart, as if he had been waiting for something for a long time and finally met it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him before.\u201d The fifth prince finally managed to say.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince named. \u201cThe Hall family is widespread and big. It is natural not to know him if you haven\u2019t talked directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was still staring at the fifth prince because the writing in the lower left corner became: [Task progress: 2%.]</p><br/><p>Damn! Xie Xi\u2019s soul finally returned.</p><br/><p>Was the fifth prince actually the sixth prince? Or was the fourth prince the sixth prince? What was wrong?</p><br/><p>The fifth prince\u2019s slender fingers stroked the harp and he smirked, \u201cDo I look good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince got up and the originally loose clothes fell to the ground. The V-neck collar was almost open to the waist. His smooth chest could be en and when he walked, Xie Xi could vaguely see\u2026</p><br/><p>The only thought that crossed Xie Xi\u2019s mind\u2014too garish!</p><br/><p>This was truly the soul of the X Persian cat!</p><br/><p>\u201cSmall Sein.\u201d He didn\u2019t know when but the fifth prince had leaned over and placed his mouth against Xie Xi\u2019s ears. \u201cIt is impolite to keep staring at people like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned to find that the mission progress had risen by 1%.</p><br/><p>What was going on? Was there a bug in the system or was he blind?</p><br/><p>In fact, there was another possibility. However, Xie Xi was a simple 19 year old young man and couldn\u2019t think of such a terrible thing.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince coughed and told the fifth prince, \u201cMr. Hall is a guard of the palace. Don\u2019t tease him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince seemed to have a good relationship with the fourth prince. His thin lips curved as he said, \u201cBrother, your words are wrong. It is obvious that this little guy is provoking me. Look at his eyes that are staring at all of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finally recovered from his shock and found there was a layer of goosebumps on his arm.</p><br/><p>He instinctively took three steps back and quickly pulled away from the fifth prince!</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, this move was too hasty and seemed to imply something.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince\u2019s smile deepened. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I go and discuss it with you later\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished when a shrimp soldier cried out from outside, \u201cHis Highness, Prince Randy, Prince Aix-en and Prince Gars!\u201d The eldest prince, the second prince and the third prince came together\u2026</p><br/><p>Five souls were gathered together and Xie Xi really wanted to run!</p><br/><p>It was a pity that the princes were faster than him and had already arrived.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince greeted them. \u201cOlder brothers.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mermaid who came with the princes put down the gifts they brought and the fourth prince thanked them again.</p><br/><p>The eldest prince asked, \u201cIs your body better in recent days?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince covered his mouth and lightly coughed, his voice slightly hoarse. \u201cI am much better.\u201d</p><br/><p>The second prince also spoke, \u201cFather has been worried about you. He wanted to come several times to see you but was persuaded by us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince was anxious and coughed again, his pale cheeks slightly flushed. \u201cI am an unfilial son, letting my father worry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The second prince comforted him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Just look after your body and father will be relieved.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince nodded and looked at the third prince.</p><br/><p>The third prince seemed to have a bad relationship with everyone. His eyes were slightly drooping and his words were shady. \u201cFourth Brother, you have wonderful music and a beautiful person by your side. It is better than the gods.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince wasn\u2019t given a chance to speak as the fifth prince raised his eyebrows. \u201cThird Brother, if you want to listen to a song then you should tell me. Why act so sour?\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince glanced at him. \u201cFifth Brother only players for the people you like. Do I deserve it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince was pierced by the thorny words but unexpectedly only smile. He didn\u2019t answer in words, his posture saying that his brother had self-awareness.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s scalp was numb as he stayed in the middle of the five brothers. He wanted to shrink back and slip out.</p><br/><p>Some people refused to let him go. The second prince asked in a surprised manner, \u201cIsn\u2019t this the little guard from the hall?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suppressed his curse.</p><br/><p>The third prince\u2019s gaze burned like soldering iron.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi received the gaze but he was swearing in his heart. \u2018We don\u2019t have a relationship. Why are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince opened his mouth. \u201cGuard Sein received father\u2019s orders and came to deliver medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince glanced between Xie Xi and the second prince. \u201cSecond Brother, do you know him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The second prince looked at the third prince and smiled. \u201cThis is the heart of Third Brother. How can I not know?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince stared at the third prince.</p><br/><p>The third prince didn\u2019t stay still. \u201cSecond Brother, weren\u2019t you going to take him into your palace?\u201d</p><br/><p>The second prince kept smiling. \u201cHe refused to come with me. I didn\u2019t see him the next day so I thought Third Brother took him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince glanced at Xie Xi standing next to the fifth prince and sneered. \u201cPeople have their own hearts. Why should I make it difficult for them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard all of this and thought they were all crazy!</p><br/><p>Who did he provoke to stand in the middle of this drama?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to leave when he heard the eldest prince open his mouth. \u201cLittle Six, come in. Why are you standing outside?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince was slightly surprised. \u201cLittle Six is here? Why didn\u2019t he come in?\u201d</p><br/><p>The second prince replied, \u201cHe was standing there when we came. I don\u2019t know what he was looking at.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince coughed and went out to greet him. \u201cCome in, what are you doing outside?\u201d</p><br/><p>The curtain opened and a tall man walked in.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to leave but he couldn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>It turned out that the sixth prince came early! He had been outside the whole time!</p><br/><p>Then\u2026 the progress of the task just now was because of him!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed with relief and looked at the mysterious sixth prince.</p><br/><p>He was dressed in blue and white clothes, in the tight fitting style of the underwater kingdom. Flowing robes like the fifth prince were unusual. After all, flowing clothes of ordinary material would become a mess in the water and wouldn\u2019t float.</p><br/><p>Under normal circumstances, the princes and nobles would wear clothing corresponding to their status. It wasn\u2019t cumbersome but there were be more material at the shoulder, chest or waist.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince was in good shape, no less than his older brothers. However, his temperament was completely different.</p><br/><p>The eldest prince was calm, the second prince was elegant and charming, the third prince was domineering, the fourth prince was quiet, the fifth prince was sexy and romantic while the sixth prince gave off a loneliness that was as deep as the sea. He had a handsome face but the different coloured eyes showed a gloomy look.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi only glanced at him and felt a deep-sea phobia.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince didn\u2019t look at him or speak. He just slightly nodded at his brothers.</p><br/><p>The other princes seemed accustomed to this and weren\u2019t surprised.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt his heart drumming. The sixth prince didn\u2019t look too good.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince coughed from time to time but he seemed to be in a good mood as he suggested, \u201cWe haven\u2019t gathered together for a long time. It is better to have a light meal together.\u201d</p><br/><p>The eldest prince nodded, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, he was the eldest brother. Everyone else had to give him so face and stay.</p><br/><p>The second prince bent down to look at Xie Xi. \u201cSmall Sein should also stay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spat in his heart, \u2018It is your business!\u2019</p><br/><p>The fourth prince invited Xie Xi, \u201cIf Guard Sein doesn\u2019t mind, you might as well stay for the meal.\u201d</p><br/><p>If the sixth prince wasn\u2019t here, Xie Xi would 100% run. But\u2026</p><br/><p>He bowed. \u201cThis subordinate\u2019s status is humble, how can I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince interrupted him. \u201cMy mother is from the Hall family and you are both surnamed Hall. We are cousins. What is there to be humble about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to go and daringly said, \u201cThen.. I will accept your request.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince laughed. \u201cRightly so!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi found that the task progress had risen to 4%. He couldn\u2019t help glancing at the sixth prince. Did the sixth prince also want him to stay?</p><br/><p>It seemed that this task wasn\u2019t too difficult!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was confident and didn\u2019t realize he was almost surrounded by five princes.</p><br/><p>The first, second and third princes sat on the left while the fourth, fifth and sixth sat on the right.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was placed next to the fifth prince and the sixth prince was on his other side.</p><br/><p>This arrangement was very good and Xie Xi was satisfied.</p><br/><p>After the meal began, the fifth prince took special care of Xie Xi. Xie Xi thought that the fifth prince was good. He might be abnormal but he didn\u2019t seem as sick. If it wasn\u2019t for him, Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t have a chance to approach the sixth prince.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled at the fifth prince. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince was slightly startled. The corners of his eyes curved as he said, \u201cTry this. It is delicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. He peeked at the sixth prince and was surprised to find that the task progress had risen to 5%.</p><br/><p>Interesting, could he collect the love of the sixth prince without doing anything?</p><br/><p>Then if he spoke to the sixth prince and was attentive, could he leave this damn world at once?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt warm.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t good at socializing with people. Before he entered the game, he had a limited number of friends and he wouldn\u2019t say a word to the cashier when going downstairs to the convenience store.</p><br/><p>After the baptism of Love to the Left or Right, he had become much better. At the very least, he had the skill of speaking nonsense to people.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is delicious.\u201d Xie Xi whispered.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince smiled and was about to say, \u2018If it is delicious, eat more\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>However, Xie Xi had selected a piece and carefully placed it on the sixth prince\u2019s plate. \u201cYour Highness, taste it and see if it is delicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he smiled shyly at the sixth prince.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince was startled.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very embarrassed about doing such a thing. Still, this embarrassment was worth it if he could leave the room.</p><br/><p>He looked at the lower right corner and thought there would be a qualitative leap in the progress of the task. Unexpectedly, the 5% progress actually fell a bit and became 4%!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>What happened? He could collect the prince\u2019s love when he wasn\u2019t paying attention but once he did, he couldn\u2019t collect it?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t believe in such an evil thing and asked the sixth prince, \u201cYour Highness, don\u2019t you want to eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was surprised.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince quickly withdrew his gaze and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to say it, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to but the task progress had fallen to 3%! Why? What was the problem?</p><br/><p>Xie Xie Xi replied cautiously, \u201cSein Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi watched the task progress plummet to 1%\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

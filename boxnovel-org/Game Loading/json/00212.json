Still, Jiang Xie knew that Xie Xi wasn\u2019t happy.</p><br/><p>He usually slept with his head towards Jiang Xie on weekdays. Now, he turned his head inside, leaving only a furry little butt.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie felt a bit anxious but he also thought this was too cute. He couldn\u2019t help touching the cat. Xie Xi swept his tail towards this person.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie called out to him. \u201cLittle Rose.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really wasn\u2019t angry. This was the normal mentality of people. His lover received so many confession letters that it would be fake to say he didn\u2019t care.</p><br/><p>\u2026First, he was isolated and now there was too much attention. This person couldn\u2019t live a normal life! It was the same in Central. It was as if the word \u2018normal\u2019 didn\u2019t apply to him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had run around again last night and was very tired this morning. He thought himself to sleep.</p><br/><p>On this day, Jiang Xie suffered a lot of pain. He already disposed of these envelopes and seriously rejected the hearts of other people, yet Little Rose still ignored him. The two people couldn\u2019t communicate and Jiang Xie could only feel rushed.</p><br/><p>The days of March were so short that by the time they came home, it was already dark and the moon had come out.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie walked very quickly and brought out the kitten the moment they arrived home.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared up at him. Jiang Xie leaned over and kissed him. There was a fog and a teenager with cat ears stood in front of him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cI refused all the letters during the day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi went to draw the curtains and said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie came up to him. \u201cDon\u2019t be angry. I didn\u2019t know they would be there\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him. \u201cDo I have something to be angry about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned and couldn\u2019t answer.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi deliberately said, \u201cYou refused them now but you will marry and have children. Isn\u2019t that what humans are all about?\u201d His back pretended to be desolate.</p><br/><p>This was simply throwing a knife at Jiang Xie. He couldn\u2019t stand it and immediately said, \u201cNo, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi waited for his next words.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie never promised anything because he wasn\u2019t used to holding anything. He was used to constantly losing and felt afraid to take the initiative to fight for something.</p><br/><p>Just as people who didn\u2019t feel hope wouldn\u2019t be disappointed, he didn\u2019t have to lose anything if he didn\u2019t have it in the first place.</p><br/><p>However, this time\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie held Xie Xi\u2019s hand and his voice was like a taut rubber band that might break at any moment. \u201cI only want you. My life will have enough as long as you are present.\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke with uneasiness and fear, breaking through the obstacles in his heart to speak.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to force him to say this but felt pained once he heard it. In fact, he knows everything even if Jiang Xie didn\u2019t say it. He just wanted to let Jiang Xie face up to it and regain his convictions.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t push away happiness but work hard to protect the happiness at hand.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked him, \u201cDo you like me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned. Xie Xi watched him as if staring into his heart. Jiang Xie slowly smiled. In an instant, it was like spring returning to Earth and the grass growing. Countless warmth melted into his clear voice. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was more than like and could only be love. Xie Xi also smiled and hugged this person, whispering, \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie clung to Xie Xi\u2019s waist tightly, head buried in this person\u2019s neck and his breathing hot and eager.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gently touched him on the neck. It was like the last spark that ignited fireworks, completely setting Jiang Xie on fire.</p><br/><p>Aries\u2019 birthday was at the end of March and he was a few days away from adulthood\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought it was pretty much the same thing. In the end, it was Jiang Xie who stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d His voice was full of restraint. \u201cYou are too young.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie left and didn\u2019t dare look at him. \u201cI will go and take a shower.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi muttered, \u201cI\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t know how old he was.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie took deep breaths. \u201cI want to be with you forever. These\u2026 there is no hurry at the moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the Jiang Xie who was always a beast in Central?</p><br/><p>However, Xie Xi thought about it and decided it wouldn\u2019t be so bad to wait. Jiang Xie cherished him and he also cherished Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Sex might be a way for love to be expressed but it definitely wasn\u2019t the only one.</p><br/><p>It would be too pitiful if this was the only way for two people in love to express it.</p><br/><p>After the mutual understanding, Xie Xi\u2019s task hadn\u2019t changed. He still had no clue about the so-called true spirit and he no means to leave here.</p><br/><p>What should he do? Xie Xi wasn\u2019t very anxious. As long as he and Jiang Xie were together, he was happy.</p><br/><p>On the day of Jiang Xie\u2019s birthday, Xie Xi asked him, \u201cAre you going out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cThen I\u2019ll take time off in advance.\u201d His birthday wasn\u2019t on a weekend.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we will go out after school and come back in the morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we meet an acquaintance\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI\u2019ll take you to a further place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t take any risks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cNothing will happen. Besides, you only have one 18th birthday.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho has only one birthday?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi blinked at him. \u201cBut this is my first birthday with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>This remark was so good that the cautious teenager finally agreed.</p><br/><p>During school, Kang Hong blocked Jiang Xie in order to celebrate his birthday. Jiang Xie slipped away quickly and didn\u2019t return home. Instead, he found a place for Xie Xi to become a person.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi held him and asked, \u201cAre you afraid of heights?\u201d This person didn\u2019t seem afraid.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi used a transparent aircraft, which was one of the most popular aircrafts in the last world.</p><br/><p>Sitting inside and looking out through the transparent walls allowed them to see the scenery unobstructed but the people outside couldn\u2019t see inside.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sat in it and his heart thumped. \u201cIf we are discovered\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. No one can see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi deliberately let the aircraft drive through the bustling streets. Jiang Xie nervously clenched his fists but to his relief, the pedestrians didn\u2019t feel nothing.</p><br/><p>Was the stealth charm a joke? It worked very well. Of course, this had a time restriction. Xie Xi flew with Jiang Xie and stopped in the open sea without people.</p><br/><p>The aircraft was transformed into a spacious living room. Xie Xi brought out the dinner he had already prepared. \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he spoke, splendid fireworks were ejected from the aircraft and bloomed in the air one after another.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke like it was a dream. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>A beauty that didn\u2019t exist in dreams, a happiness that couldn\u2019t be imagined.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie turned and saw the smile on Xie Xi\u2019s face. At this moment, he felt the person around him was one hundred times more beautiful than the fireworks on the horizon.</p><br/><p>It was truly fortunate he could meet this person. Jiang Xie held his hand firmly and silken strands like the sun rose in his heart.</p><br/><p>After this birthday, the two people became sweeter.</p><br/><p>The big lightbulb Kang Hong didn\u2019t disturb them. There was no reason to because the university entrance examination was coming soon. Kang Hong was studying like crazy.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was also reviewing seriously.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was on the table and swept his hand with the tail.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cLet me finish writing this paper.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cLet me turn into a human.\u201d Meow meow!</p><br/><p>\u201cI will kiss you when I finish writing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Sure enough, this person was worse when growing up! Previously, Jiang Xie turned the kitten into a human as soon as it became dark.</p><br/><p>Since the beginning of studying for the university entrance examination, Jiang Xie would only kiss Xie Xi after finishing his homework.</p><br/><p>The reason was simple. He could study quietly if he saw the cat. If he saw the cat-eared youth, he wanted to do adult things.</p><br/><p>In Xie Xi\u2019s heart, the university entrance examination was useless. So what about a good university? There was him and Aries would always be happy.</p><br/><p>Obviously, Jiang Xie thought differently.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want Xie Xi to use his ability or to wrong Xie Xi. The only way to do this was to strengthen himself and let Xie Xi live a rich life.</p><br/><p>In addition, Jiang Xie was always worried that Xie Xi would be exposed and he wouldn\u2019t be able to protect Xie Xi. Wasn\u2019t Xie Xi the one who wanted to protect Jiang Xie?</p><br/><p>No matter how strong their lover, two people who loved each other would want to protect each other.</p><br/><p>The university entrance exam finished and the results were issued. Jiang Xie was first in the province.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought, \u2018Fortunately, each province has different questions. Otherwise, won\u2019t you become first in the country?\u2019</p><br/><p>Kang Hong was more surprised compared to Jiang Xie. \u201cI have exceeded my unofficial mark!\u201d This was the ecstasy that normal people should have.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie congratulated him.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong jumped out of happiness and his face was red. He excitedly told Jiang Xie, \u201cMy results soared thanks to the learning god!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie shook his head. \u201cIt is the result of your own efforts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Kang Hong said, \u201cI think it is related to you. Since I transferred to this school and became friends with you, everything has been going smoothly. I don\u2019t have rhinitis and I always feel that the quality of my sleep is much better. I am full of strength learning every day\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The younger classmate who often sat next to Jiang Xie and asked questions said, \u201cThis is really true. I feel that my spirit has been particularly good in the past six months and I have learnt things very quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Someone else joined the discussion. \u201cIt is the same for me. I used to study until 12 o\u2019clock, wake up sleepy in the morning and wasn\u2019t in a good state at all. This time, I sleep normally and manage a lunch break.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also seem to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The cat in the bag was going crazy and wanted to give these people a forbidden spell!</p><br/><p>\u2018Shut up and take advantage of it instead of talking about it!\u2019</p><br/><p>However, all these words were heard and the keen Jiang Xie must\u2019ve understood it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi collapsed into a cat cake as he thought about how to coax this alarmist teenager after returning home\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t stay any longer. He was clearly the provincial champion but it was like he took last place in the exam. They were still having a heated discussion and Jiang Xie left first.</p><br/><p>Once he got home, he locked the door. Xie Xi poked out a small head. It wasn\u2019t dark so he couldn\u2019t become a person.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t say anything. He sat at the window and waited until it was dark. Xie Xi\u2019s heart beat like a drum and he knew that Jiang Xie was really angry this time.</p><br/><p>The moon rose and Jiang Xie\u2019s cool kiss fell on his lips. Xie Xi stood by his side. He had been enduring it all day but Jiang Xie didn\u2019t say anything. He just asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know what to say\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie frowned and his hands on the table clenched into fists. \u201cIs it to cover up the rumours before?\u201d</p><br/><p>A year ago, Jiang Xie was avoided by everyone. After a year, Jiang Xie became close to everyone.</p><br/><p>Why did this happen? It was due to Xie Xi\u2019s painstaking efforts.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is really nothing. No one will find out.\u201d He knew Jiang Xie was afraid he would be in danger but such a world couldn\u2019t hurt him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie questioned, \u201cYou protected the people around me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi jerked with shock.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie hoarsely revealed the truth. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t protect Kang Hong, he would die, right? In addition, the people who came close to me and talked to me were secretly protected by you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled wryly. \u201cFor more than 10 years, those who were close to me would be very miserable. It is no wonder that it changed in this year\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could lie to him and say no, but he couldn\u2019t do this. He couldn\u2019t lie to Jiang Xie. It was true that Xie Xi was busy every day protecting the people close to Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Once he relaxed, these people would encounter light or heavy misfortunes. It was like a curse. Anyone who came close to Jiang Xie would be targeted by disaster.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi protected these people while looking for reasons. Unfortunately, he was unable to find the cause.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi approached him and carefully clung into Jiang Xie. \u201cI will be careful not to let them find out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie whispered, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s lips thinned.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie declared, \u201cI won\u2019t become closer to anyone. I don\u2019t need anyone as long as you are there.\u201d Thus, no one would suffer because of him ad Xie Xi didn\u2019t need to work hard to protect everyone.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed and placed his chin on top of his head. \u201cHowever, you won\u2019t be happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s body froze.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI hope that you will be happy every day and be full of hope and enthusiasm for life. I want to be with you as well as give you happiness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d It was like there were many stones in Jiang Xie\u2019s throat as he tried to speak, making him unable to say anything.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi kissed him on the forehead.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie pulled this youth onto his lap and held his waist, as if bringing this person into his own soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hate them.\u201d Jiang Xie\u2019s suppressed voice seemed to tremble in his chest. Xie Xi was stunned. Jiang Xie held him and revealed the most unfathomable places inside him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI had nothing. No one needed me, no one was close to me and no one even looked at me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Therefore, he hated them.</p><br/><p>He hated all those who ignored him, hated all those who isolated him and hated the world that abandoned him.</p><br/><p>This was Jiang Xie\u2019s deep heart, the most unbearable and hard to understand part.</p><br/><p>At this time, this darkness was blown away.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes were red and his voice was hoarse. \u201cIt is fine. You\u2019ll have me later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, Jiang Xie had him. It was Xie Xi\u2019s unreserved love that released the knot in his heart. Jiang Xie let go of himself and let the world go.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed with relief. He stared at Jiang Xie and saw the teenager reveal a pure smile that was brighter than the sun.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard Jiang Xie\u2019s words and wanted to touch him again, only to reappear in the space with 11 light groups.</p><br/><p>The roses were lovely but Xie Xi stood among them in a trance.</p><br/><p>The red light group representing Aries disappeared and was replaced by the young Jiang Xie sleeping in the flowers.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi rushed over and saw the line of words hanging over him.</p><br/><p>[Wake up countdown: 3:00:00.]</p><br/>\n</div>"}

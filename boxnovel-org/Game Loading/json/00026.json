Thinking about it, X seemed somewhat similar to the vampire Aix-en?</p><br/><p>The hair colour wasn\u2019t the same and the facial features weren\u2019t exact but\u2026</p><br/><p>This type of feeling was very similar.</p><br/><p>In fact, X\u2019s outfit was very simple and in a plain black colour. There wasn\u2019t the cumbersome medieval Europe style yet he inexplicably gave people such a feeling.</p><br/><p>In particular, there was the two different coloured eyes and the laziness that seemed immersed in his bones.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought to himself, \u2018A Persian cat?\u2019</p><br/><p>It was really fancy! He hated this person in his heart while he smiled. \u201cGod X, hello.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was frozen. It wasn\u2019t his fault. This was the first time he was seeing Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>He might\u2019ve chased Small Sein for several days and his soul was fascinated by this little guy, but this was actually their first time meeting.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very good-looking. He had impeccable facial features, clean and delicate skin and was like a flag standing on a mountain, fluttering straight into Jiang Xie\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u2014God X, hello ^_^.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw the live version. The little guy\u2019s smiling face was exactly the same as the symbol. It was a standard fake smile but it was also lovely to death.</p><br/><p>His \u2018mechanical\u2019 appearance made Xie Xi sigh with relief. \u201cSure enough, it is a puppet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s spirit returned.</p><br/><p>Song Qi\u2019s 0 eyes were staring at him. \u201cThe living God X, so handsome. Ah, I\u2019m dead. I will die without any regrets!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was still very wary and kept observing X. He saw X acting indifferently to the stupid Song Qi and his thoughts were once again confirmed.</p><br/><p>This was truly a puppet. Indeed, how could a bigshot be summoned so casually? It was estimated that the central will created a substitute for the real people. This was just a NPC with a player\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Once he knew it wasn\u2019t a real person, Xie Xi was too lazy to pretend.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t offend the real pervert but how could he be afraid of a puppet that signed a contract?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about his anger from the last world and was more and more unwilling to see this fancy Persian cat. Song Qi was still moving around X. \u201cGreat figure, this is the legendary golden ratio!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe eyes are so exciting\u2026 don\u2019t look at me\u2026 I\u2019m going to faint\u2026\u201d The 0 Song Xi acted out a drama.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gave a brief assessment. \u201cUgly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi spat out, \u201cYou have the aesthetics of a straight man.\u201d The two of them had been together for a while and Song Qi got to know this person better. Xie Xi was beautiful but unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t tell between beauty and ugliness.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at X and saw that X still had a dull face. He completely put down his worries. \u2018Okay, this is 100% a puppet and won\u2019t run.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was an old fox who had been turned over and over in a pan of oil, how could he not understand this situation? According to common sense, the summoning only summoned the body. There was no rule that the actual person couldn\u2019t come. Jiang Xie had been waiting so long and naturally wouldn\u2019t send over a puppet.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that he came but was treated as a puppet. Still, it was kind of fun.</p><br/><p>He looked at the change in Xie Xi\u2019s face and found it funny.</p><br/><p>The more Song Qi looked, the more reluctant he became. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this to him! This is God X. It might be a puppet but it is still top goods!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him. \u201cDo you want to go down?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi hurriedly zipped his mouth.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for the beauty present, he would\u2019ve already left the cave. This smell was killing people. How could he go do to search for something? It was better to die.</p><br/><p>Old Jiang didn\u2019t know what he was about to face but played a show with great interest. He bowed to Xie Xi and whispered, \u201cMaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi took a breath and exclaimed, \u201cGod, my god\u2026 my ears are pregnant!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was also shocked\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s words were similar to the housekeeper Randy. The posture of the bow, the sloping eyes and the curve of the face were exactly the same!</p><br/><p>Haha.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought, \u2018Sure enough, it is that damn person.\u2019</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t forget how the housekeeper Randy had cut off his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp me obtain something.\u201d Xie Xi didn\u2019t intend to waste time. He needed to obtain the dragon heart in three minutes.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s lips curved. \u201cPlease give me a command.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis blood pool contains something called a dragon heart. Please bring it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was surprised for a moment.</p><br/><p>Song Qi was almost crying, \u201cBrother Qi, how can you do this? That pool is full of rotten corpses. If God X jumps down, his name\u2026\u201d He felt like dying.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart wasn\u2019t moved.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at the blood pool with rotting corpses. He absolutely couldn\u2019t go down there.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t see the goodwill in a quasi-world but Jiang Xie suspected that if he really came up from the bloody pool, his appearance would cause a 0 would be added to his -175.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him with dark eyes.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie realized that if he let Xie Xi know he wasn\u2019t really a puppet, there would be two 0s added to the -175.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, Master.\u201d Jiang Xie accepted it.</p><br/><p>Song Qi felt numb at these words.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned and unconsciously exposed an alert look. Don\u2019t blame him, Randy and Gars were like this. They had an abnormal heart under the obedient surface!</p><br/><p>He had died so often that he learnt to look through the appearance to the essence.</p><br/><p>It was fortunate that Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t see the goodwill in a quasi-world or the red -1\u2026</p><br/><p>Well, it wouldn\u2019t be a fatal strike when seeing it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t let this little guy go down. How could he let Xie Xi touch the broken corpses? Jiang Xie also wouldn\u2019t dive down to find the dragon heart.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t carry items but he had his skills. He could take out the object without going down.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw X raised his hand. The darkness of his palm was obvious even in the dark cave. It was a big strange, as if the black fog was too dark, causing the surrounding area to be lined with a dark blue light.</p><br/><p>Song Qi held his breath and didn\u2019t dare blink. This scene wasn\u2019t common. After all, there was no such sight in this town!</p><br/><p>The black mist gathered to the size of a goose egg. Then it lightened and fell rapidly from the slender fingers. It was clearly as light as a feather in Jiang Xie\u2019s palm but now it was a heavy iron ball that slammed into the bloody sea.</p><br/><p>For a moment, the whole cave seemed to shake.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked back and there were no corpses. Only a large white stone was lying at the bottom of a dry pool.</p><br/><p>Song Qi screamed loudly, \u201cAmazing!\u201d What was the point of his worry? A bigshot was a bigshot. Who could he raise dung? He only needed to lift his fingers to take care of it He also purified the scary bodies.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled and thought, \u2018Yes, he really is capable. I can\u2019t afford to provoke him now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie raised his hand. The white stone rolled up until it floated in front of Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi grabbed the dragon heart and told X, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was just about to open his mouth when he was pulled by something and disappeared into thin air.</p><br/><p>Three minutes was really fleeting.</p><br/><p>Song Qi was full of regrets at not seeing enough. Xie Xi hit him in the forehead and called back his spirit.</p><br/><p>Song Qi shook his head and sighed. \u201cReally exciting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at him. \u201cDo you like him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi laughed and wanted to say that everyone loved beauty. Then he remembered that Xie Xi didn\u2019t love beauty and replied, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand the world of the face obsessed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi was afraid of a misunderstanding and explained, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if I like him. God X is too close to a god and I can only look up to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t fully approve but he admitted that X was extremely powerful.</p><br/><p>Song Qi thought about the task and glanced to his bottom right. \u201cThe task isn\u2019t completed?\u201d</p><br/><p>His side mission was Xie Xi\u2019s main mission. Both of them had to collect the dragon\u2019s heart. By all accounts, it should be completed at the same time.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cIt seems the task isn\u2019t so simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi wondered, \u201cIs the dragon heart a fake?\u201d</p><br/><p>They glanced at the golden-eyed boy. Unexpectedly, the boy had fainted at an unknown time.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi quickly held him. The boy had lost consciousness and seemed like he had fallen into a deep sleep. It was almost unbearable to wake up him. Xie Xi placed a finger under his nose and felt his steady breathing. The vital signs were good. He was just asleep.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi called to him. \u201cXiao Feng?\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy showed no reaction.</p><br/><p>Song Qi glanced at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Due to X, the bodies in the cave were gone and even the air had become refreshed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi muttered, \u201cIt seems that this dragon heart\u2026\u201d He paused before he could say \u2018there is a problem.\u2019</p><br/><p>Song Qi followed his gaze and flinched.</p><br/><p>The person who arrived had blond hair and ferociously cold eyes. His footsteps were light and he gave off an unpleasant feeling.</p><br/><p>Zhong Jin! He found them!</p><br/><p>It was over\u2026 As soon as God X left, this bastard came. What should they do? Could Xie Xi still use summoning?</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Zhong Jin smiled at them and said, \u201cFollow me, I will take you to complete this task.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a fake sunny smile. He really did want to help them.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie returned to his garden and Yan Zhe asked him, \u201cHow was it? What did you have to do after being summoned?\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t done anything in the past few days. He wanted to know the progress of Old Jiang\u2019s love, which was much more interesting than those boring love games.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe said again, \u201cLittle Rose is so good to you, he must be very happy when you met!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was happy, happy to use Jiang Xie as a excavator.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie calmly said, \u201cYes, he smiled at me.\u201d The fake smile was also very cute.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe choked because he swallowed dog food after a long time. \u201cWhat did he call you to do? Was it a person from the Double Beheading School? He wasn\u2019t in danger, was he?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie really wanted to act as a hero and punish someone but unfortunately\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHe encountered a very tricky problem.\u201d Old Jiang half lied. \u201cI helped him resolve it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTut.\u201d Yan Zhe didn\u2019t doubt him and felt bitter. \u201cYour goodwill definitely went higher!\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Zone, why did you make Old Jiang\u2019s love road so smooth? Yan Zhe wasn\u2019t satisfied!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie looked at the goodwill and saw that it was really \u2018higher.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt just reached 180.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe was silent for a moment before shouting, \u201cThis is too high! Once he comes out, will the two of you get a license to be married?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was very clear about this. \u201cHe is still young. I will take my time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

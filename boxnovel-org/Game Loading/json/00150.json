Xie Xi still remembered the white tiger cub who called him \u2018Mummy\u2019 before. Jiang Xie said it was the baby spirit of White Tiger so it was very innocent. This one\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh\u2026\u201d The jasmine was in pain. \u201cThe rabbit bites!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi determined that this wasn\u2019t the baby spirit. It was White Tiger as a cub. Xie Xi glanced at the jasmine\u2019s injury and determined the child\u2019s teeth couldn\u2019t hurt anyone. He told the jasmine, \u201cDon\u2019t touch him. He isn\u2019t a rabbit.\u201d</p><br/><p>The jasmine rubbed the back of her hand in a distraught manner. \u201cHowever, he is white and his ears prick up\u2026 ah, his ears aren\u2019t long enough!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thankfully, the little jasmine finally realized the difference between a white rabbit and white tiger.</p><br/><p>Houqing in Xie Xi\u2019s arms looked at the white tiger curiously, his eyes wide as he whispered, \u201cThat is his mother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also saw that Little White Tiger was protecting the big white tiger. Unfortunately, the big white tiger was seriously injured and on the verge of death.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi handed Houqing to the jasmine and slowly walked over. \u201cYour mother is hurt. Can I help check that she\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was unknown if Little White Tiger understood or not. He kept baring his teeth, ears pricked high as he issued a warning sound.</p><br/><p>If he wasn\u2019t so small, this appearance would be really scary but\u2026 he was too small and cute that people couldn\u2019t be afraid.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to stimulate him anymore. He stayed in a safe position, lowered his posture and carefully explained, \u201cYour mother is bleeding. If she isn\u2019t treated, she will be in a lot of pain. I won\u2019t hurt her. Let me see her injuries, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little White Tiger\u2019s demeanour slightly relaxed but he still refused to step aside.</p><br/><p>At this time, the big white tiger let out a groan. Little White Tiger turned anxiously to look at her. The big tiger\u2019s eyelids moved and she saw Xie Xi. \u201cYou are\u2026 from the flower family?\u201d</p><br/><p>The white tiger could talk. This relieved Xie Xi since they could communicate. He quickly replied, \u201cYes, we came from the flower world. Are you injured? Can I take a look?\u201d</p><br/><p>The white tiger told him, \u201cI won\u2019t last long. You don\u2019t need to worry about me.\u201d She coughed intermittently. \u201cCan you take my child away?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little White Tiger screamed at the big tiger. He was still fierce but his eyes were full of grievances.</p><br/><p>The big white tiger told him, \u201cGood boy, you have to live.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little White Tiger was anxious. He couldn\u2019t talk and could only scream. His tone was tough, as if saying, \u2018I don\u2019t want to leave. You won\u2019t die!\u2019 He was like a rebellious teenager, domineering and distressing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stated, \u201cMaybe I can treat your injury.\u201d</p><br/><p>The spirit of the big white tiger was becoming worse. \u201cI have lived my life and was relieved when picking up this little guy. I was originally worried about his safety but now that I see you\u2026\u201d Her voice was becoming smaller and smaller and was about to disappear. \u201cPlease let him grow up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, the big white tiger wasn\u2019t this cub\u2019s mother. She just picked him up. Nevertheless, it was clear that their relationship had long become a real mother and son.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to keep talking but the white tiger closed her eyes. She seemed to make a wish as her body slowly disappeared and finally became a white star, vanishing into the air.</p><br/><p>The big white tiger had died.</p><br/><p>Little White Tiger stood in the same place, little claws stretched forward as he was unable to catch the scattered starbursts.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, all the strength supporting him vanished. His vertical ears fell and his eyes closed as he fainted to the ground. Once the defense was gone, Little White Tiger\u2019s soft hair fell and his stiff body softened. His lowered ears made him look like a plush toy.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was inevitably distressed and he carefully held the passed out Little White Tiger in his arms.</p><br/><p>Houqing saw this and asked, \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi touched the little belly and sighed. \u201cHe is hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>These two little ones really could endure. It was unknown how long Little White Tiger had protected his mother. The white tiger wanted him to leave but he refused. Despite knowing the big white tiger\u2019s life couldn\u2019t be saved, he refused to give up on her.</p><br/><p>All cubs couldn\u2019t bear hunger. Children lived by instinct and hunger was something that even adults couldn\u2019t suppress if they wanted to survive.</p><br/><p>In order to not leave the flower world, Houqing would rather be hungry.</p><br/><p>In order to protect his dying mother, Little White Tiger endured for a long time with a strong perseverance that was beyond imagination.</p><br/><p>The souls were different but their natures were generally the same. Their tenacity was amazing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked the jasmine, \u201cDo you have any goat\u2019s milk on you?\u201d He didn\u2019t know what a white tiger should eat and decided to give some milk first.</p><br/><p>The little jasmine hurriedly replied, \u201cYes!\u201d Houqing had previously almost starved and the flowers were now very cautious, always carrying around goat\u2019s milk or even rice porridge.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi coaxed Little White Tiger to drink a can of milk and let go of his worries once he saw the white tiger sleeping sweetly.</p><br/><p>Thus, the flower world had one human and a tiger.</p><br/><p>The flowers generally looked the same as Little Houqing after the transformation so their curiosity to Houqing was much lower. White Tiger was different. This little guy was born too different and the flowers were very interested.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so hairy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, his hair is as white as snow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think it will feel as cold as snow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTry and touch it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The flowers touched one by one. Little White Tiger\u2019s sleep was too heavy and he didn\u2019t react to them.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought of the violent temper of the third child and felt funny now that he was being bullied by flowers.</p><br/><p>His eyebrows curved and Little Houqing in his arms looked closer. Now this person didn\u2019t understand what it meant to be jealous of a white tiger. Little Houqing only had one thought in his head. As long as this person was happy, everything was good.</p><br/><p>Once Little White Tiger woke up, the flower world was full of fun. This little guy wasn\u2019t Houqing and wasn\u2019t born to understand what quite meant.</p><br/><p>The flowers poked him and the tiger sprang up and bit. The flowers could be repaired. Even if they weren\u2019t able to avoid the movement of this fierce (cute) tiger, their skin was thick and they weren\u2019t afraid of being bitten.</p><br/><p>Little White Tiger biting them was just a tickle. They didn\u2019t get angry and even giggled as they stole a few tiger hairs.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi happily watched from the sidelines. He really wanted to find a video recorder to record this wonderful moment (black history).</p><br/><p>Little Houqing saw the smile and Xie Xi asked him, \u201cWould you like to play?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Houqing immediately shook his head. Xie Xi reassured him, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid and go. Little White Tiger\u2019s skin is very thick and there is no need to be afraid of curses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Houqing looked up at him with worry. Xie Xi asked him, \u201cDon\u2019t you believe me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Houqing hurriedly replied, \u201cI believe you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen go and play.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was also excellent. Little White Tiger was too noisy and Little Houqing was too quiet. The two of them neutralized each other.</p><br/><p>Once Little White Tiger adapted to life in the flower world, Xie Xi gave instructions to the flowers and couldn\u2019t help going to sleep.</p><br/><p>He had a hunch that he would sleep for a long time but once he woke up and saw the taller Houqing and bigger White Tigger, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cHow long have I been sleeping?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Houqing\u2019s voice was full of thoughts. \u201c350 days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026.\u201d This was almost a year!</p><br/><p>He hurriedly pulled Little Houqing over. \u201cI have slept for too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Houqing had become more sensible. \u201cSleep is very important. Your Excellency should have a good rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to sleep for too long. Once I fall asleep, I will wake up soon. Next time I will control it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Houqing wanted to talk again but the left out Little White Tiger snorted. Xie Xi looked over and reached out. \u201cLittle White, come over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little White Tiger turned his head and didn\u2019t move. Xie Xi grabbed the white tiger. The tiger rubbed his head against Xie Xi\u2019s chest but didn\u2019t look up. He just stayed in Xie Xi\u2019s arms and even licked him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt funny. \u201cHow awkward.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little White Tiger understood and his eyes stared in a dissatisfied manner. Little Houqing actually became his translator. \u201cHe said he missed you very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi and White Tiger, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Houqing smiled. \u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little White Tiger screamed at Little Houqing. Little Houqing was unmoved and translated, \u201cHe said that he missed you very much and\u2026 um\u2026 became fatter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little White Tiger blew up, his paws desperately wanting to fight with Little Houqing. Little Houqing wasn\u2019t afraid at all as he moved closer to Xie Xi. \u201cHe isn\u2019t honest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi laughed as he felt amused at these two living treasures.</p><br/><p>The days in the flower world passed leisurely and comfortably. There were the carefree flowers, the small adult like Houqing and the arrogant White Tiger. Xie Xi sat on the sidelines and felt comfortable.</p><br/><p>He obviously slept for so long yet he was tired after seven or eight days.</p><br/><p>This day, the little jasmine ran over and shouted, \u201cLord Flower God! Little White Tiger left the flower world!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shocked and hurriedly asked, \u201cWhat about Houqing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The daisy also ran over. \u201cHouqing chased after him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two little ones went outside. Xie Xi quickly got up to find them.</p><br/><p>The world outside the flower world was becoming bigger and bigger. The Holy Mountain that Xie Xi first thought was strange had increased in scale and style.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was somehow dizzy for a moment. The magnolia sensed it and suggested, \u201cYour Excellency, go back and rest if you are tired. We will find them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart wasn\u2019t steady and he waved his hand. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I will go and see.\u201d</p><br/><p>He still had some mana left. He concentrated it and soon found the two little ones. However, he was startled when he found them and arrived in front of them in almost an instant. The flowers had no idea what was going on. They blinked and the flower god disappeared.</p><br/><p>He was at the place where the big white tiger died. Little White Tiger looked fierce as he rushed towards a mass of black fog.</p><br/><p>Houqing followed him nervously. \u201cYou can\u2019t beat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little White Tiger didn\u2019t listen. Hatred filled his eyes and he wanted to tear this black fog to pieces!</p><br/><p>Houqing anxiously told him, \u201cThere is no way. You will be eaten by it like your mother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>These words undoubtedly provoked Little White Tiger. He actually pounced his small body towards the monster that killed his mother!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi moved and saved Little White Tiger. He glanced at the black fog and felt numb when he saw the dense, serrated teeth.</p><br/><p>Little Houqing exclaimed, \u201cLord Flower God!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi picked up the two cubs and left quickly.</p><br/><p>What was that? Xie Xi didn\u2019t know there were such monsters in the Holy Mountain and Demon Sea in later generations. Was that the thing that hurt the big white tiger? Then Little White Tiger ran out to get revenge?</p><br/><p>This was really something that the third child would do. He was really too reckless. How big was the monster? Pouncing on it was simply going to death!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi returned to the flowers. Once the flowers saw the flower god\u2019s bleeding arm, they were stunned silly.</p><br/><p>They\u2026 never knew\u2026 the flower god could actually be hurt. Xie Xi ordered, \u201cReturn to the flower world!\u201d</p><br/><p>The group returned and the flowers rushed forward to stop Xie Xi\u2019s bleeding. Little White Tiger stayed on the sidelines, staying up without blinking.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw him and felt a strange heartache. His scolding words didn\u2019t emerge and he finally only said, \u201cYou want to avenge your mother, this is understandable. However, you have to consider your own strength. Why do you want to die? Did your mother save you just for you to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little White Tiger looked at Xie Xi\u2019s wounded arm and emotions raged in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Grow up well and work hard so that you have the power to protect your precious people.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

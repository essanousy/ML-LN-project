The sixth prince\u2019s state is very problematic. Xie Xi tried to organize his thoughts and words but then a hint appeared in the lower right corner.</p><br/><p>[The dream is coming to an end. Please be prepared to leave. The countdown time is 30 seconds.]</p><br/><p>There were only 30 seconds left so Xie Xi had to hurriedly say, \u201cSirius, I hope you will be happy in the days to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sirius replied softly. \u201cI\u2019ll be happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, there was no happiness in his tone! Xie Xi looked at him anxiously. \u201cDon\u2019t be blinded by hatred. You deserve a better life.\u201d</p><br/><p>He saw that the two different colours of Sirius\u2019 eyes had become extremely shallow, as shallow as a bubble about to break under the sun.</p><br/><p>Sirius smiled but it was more heart-wrenching than if he cried. \u201cSein, there is no light at the bottom of the sea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shocked but he had no more time. He couldn\u2019t let Sirius find him and could only leave the dream. He quickly hid while Sirius hadn\u2019t woken up yet.</p><br/><p>There was no light at the bottom of the sea. There was a beautiful legend of Atlantis.</p><br/><p>Atlantis was once a beautiful empire. The people could embrace the vast sea while looking up at the bright sun. They could enjoy the bleakness of the water while appreciating the warmth of the sun.</p><br/><p>This lasted until Atlantis fell and they sank to the bottom of the sea. There was no light at the bottom of the sea but the people of Atlantis created light and warmth by loving and caring for their fellow citizens. Sirius was telling Xie Xi:</p><br/><p>Once Sein died, the bottom of the sea no longer contained love and care for him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hid in a corner and saw Sirius open his eyes.</p><br/><p>Sirius woke up but didn\u2019t immediately leave. There was no confusion on his face after he woke up. He was calm enough to be frightening. He put his face on Sein\u2019s bed and stayed quietly for a long time. It gave the feeling that his body was here but his heart had long been pulled away.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt so sad that he couldn\u2019t help swearing at X! What a broken task, turning an excellent young man into this!</p><br/><p>Once the sixth prince left, Xie Xi also sneaked away while taking the communicator that the third prince gave him.</p><br/><p>Sein Hall couldn\u2019t come back here again. His true face could no longer be used and he directly replaced it with the second face.</p><br/><p>The information on the second face had already been filled and he even redistributed his room. Xie Xi found his new residence and temporarily settled down.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at the task progress. The orange bar still had a bit left. After three days, he would enter the dream again and it should be full.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took care of two princes but he wasn\u2019t happy at all. If this was the \u2018revenge\u2019 trio that consisted of the housekeeper, vampire and maid, Xie Xi would clap with praise.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince and sixth prince didn\u2019t provoke him and gave him most of the task progress. Xie Xi was reluctant to part with such a good person.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what would happen after this. If he cleared this world, what would happen to X\u2019s soul? Would they stay in this world?</p><br/><p>After clearing the world, the Zone will close the entrance. X\u2019s souls belonged to the Central World? Would they stay here? Or would they go back to X? Xie Xi was curious and suddenly wanted to leave this world to ask X.</p><br/><p>He just opened the communicator when he received a message from the third prince. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>This arrogant tone made Xie Xi\u2019s lips thin but he naturally sent a respectful reply. \u201cI just finished my shift. Your Highness, what is your command?\u201d He also sent a smiley face.</p><br/><p>The third prince stared at the little smiley face and the other person\u2019s childish and cute face appeared in his mind. He coughed lightly.</p><br/><p>His lieutenant asked him, \u201cYour Highness, are we going?\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince didn\u2019t say anything. The lieutenant asked again. The third prince turned his head and cried out angrily, \u201cWhat\u2019s with the noise? Am I deaf?\u201d</p><br/><p>The lieutenant shut up. The third prince held the communicator and stared at the reply box for a while. The lieutenant stood to the side, eyes full of curiosity.</p><br/><p>The third prince felt it and turned on the anti-peeping device. The pop-up projection turned black. The lieutenant felt regret.</p><br/><p>The third prince was too lazy to care about him and kept staring at the reply box. He was about to write \u2018Nothing\u2019 but this wasn\u2019t appropriate. If there was nothing then why send a message?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi waited a while but the third prince didn\u2019t reply. He thought the signal wasn\u2019t good and sent it again. It was a direct copy and paste so there was also the smiley face.</p><br/><p>The third prince looked at the two smiley faces and said, \u201cSince you love to smile so much, I will take you somewhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d When did he give the illusion that he loved to smile?</p><br/><p>The third prince kicked the lieutenant. \u201cWhy are you in a daze? Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>The wronged lieutenant murmured, \u201cI just asked you this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince turned back. \u201cHrmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>The lieutenant stood upright and gave a military salute. \u201cYour Highness, the airship is ready to go at any time!\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince grunted coldly and got up to leave.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at the communicator and couldn\u2019t figure out this third prince. He asked again, \u201cWhere is Your Highness going with this subordinate?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was like a stone sinking into the sea. No one responded. After a while, a tall mermaid in a military uniform knocked on the door. \u201cExcuse me, is Colin Hall here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard it and opened the door. \u201cHello, what can I do for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The uniformed mermaid told him, \u201cHis Highness is waiting for you. Come out quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to ask about where the third prince was taking him. It was just\u2026 for the sake of the task, he had to put down his knives.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was ready to go out. Once he saw the airship, the blade in his heart became sharper.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this a military ship? It wasn\u2019t true. After all, this was the palace. Even if Gars Atlantis was an army commander, he couldn\u2019t bring airships in.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi cautiously got into the vehicle and heard the third prince\u2019s voice. \u201cWhy are you dilly-dallying?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d This fiery fish, soaking him in fish couldn\u2019t reduce the fire! He hurried to sit next to the third prince. The third prince stared at him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi reacted with, \u201cI see Your Highness. He gave a slight salute.</p><br/><p>The third prince frowned slightly. He wasn\u2019t satisfied. Xie Xi knew his brain circuits. \u201cIs there anything on this subordinate\u2019s face?\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince raised his eyebrows. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you smiling?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s face was stunned. What smile? The third prince was a typical person who didn\u2019t like showing joy but anger would clearly appear on his face.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t provoke him and could only make a fake smile.</p><br/><p>He smiled and the third prince instantly shifted his gaze away, staring straight ahead of him. Then he uttered a typical line from a Mary Sue novel, \u201cJust wait, you soon won\u2019t be able to smile.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d Crazy third prince!</p><br/><p>The third prince maintained his cold air and Xie Xi didn\u2019t find it easy to open his mouth.</p><br/><p>Halfway there, the lieutenant brought them a fruit tray. The third prince frowned and was about to become angry when the lieutenant said, \u201cIt is early and Colin hasn\u2019t eaten yet. He should eat something.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince still scolded him, \u201cDo people only eat fruit for breakfast?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t reacted yet. The lieutenant was used to being scolded and immediately said, \u201cThere are some salmon and sweet shrimp. I will go get it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince didn\u2019t forget to show contempt. \u201cA waste.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt somewhat surprised. The third prince looked like he had a violent temper but this mermaid lieutenant wasn\u2019t afraid of him? He also didn\u2019t use \u2018this subordinate\u2019 and spoke directly.</p><br/><p>A moment later, the food was sent. Xie Xi really was a bit angry. The third prince told him, \u201cBe careful, don\u2019t get it everywhere.\u201d Then he got up and left.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t there so Xie Xi felt more at ease. He carefully ate breakfast.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know if it was his illusion but the airship that was originally flying wildly became slower and more stable. It was like a sports car that became a steady business car. Slowing down made it convenient for him to eat.</p><br/><p>Once he finished eating, they reached the destination. The third prince had brought him to the northern border. It was no wonder why he said that Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t smile.</p><br/><p>The speed of the airship underwater was extremely fast. On land, this trip would take two or three hours with the plane. The airship only took 40~50 minutes.</p><br/><p>The third prince got out and looked at Xie Xi. \u201cStay close to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. The third prince didn\u2019t go fast, making it easy for Xie Xi to keep up.</p><br/><p>He should\u2019ve come here for some military affairs. Some people came up to report to him and the third prince was serious and efficient when doing his work.</p><br/><p>In order to avoid suspicion, Xie Xi moved to the side and pretended not to hear anything.</p><br/><p>The third prince looked back at him. \u201cKeep close. You won\u2019t understand anyway, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He wanted to avoid suspicion but he wasn\u2019t given a chance?</p><br/><p>The third prince saw it and sneered, \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was silent. The third prince picked him up like he was a chick. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t clean, I will deal with you immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was used to carrying Roast Pork Bun. He didn\u2019t expect to be carried like this!</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, please put me down.\u201d Xie Xi was exasperated.</p><br/><p>The third prince poked his cheek.\u201dTo be honest, there are field exercises here. Don\u2019t look at the guns for too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>He released his hand. Xie Xi tidied his clothing and looked towards the corner of his field of view. The red progress bar had risen by 3%.</p><br/><p>What was going on here? Sure enough, this fish heart was an undersea needle? He was baffled.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi followed the third prince and saw many things. The technology of the sea floor was truly amazing. It was a different direction from science and technology but it was still great.</p><br/><p>The third prince\u2019s popularity in the army was really high. The people were respectful to him but it wasn\u2019t because of his power. They truly admired him.</p><br/><p>At this time, Xie Xi didn\u2019t take it seriously. Soldiers adored the strong. The third prince was excellent in combat and it was natural to worship him.</p><br/><p>At least, until an accident occurred on a training field and a mermaid was blown up.</p><br/><p>Their group had just arrived. Once the third prince saw it, he rushed over at a very fast speed.</p><br/><p>The people at the scene were stunned. This training used real ammunition and was indeed dangerous, but this shouldn\u2019t have happened\u2026</p><br/><p>By the time someone reacted, the third prince was rushing to the infirmary with the wounded soldiers. People around him reacted, crying out, \u201cYour Highness, give it to me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince had blood on his face and his glorious uniform was stained. However, he didn\u2019t care as he shouted, \u201cCan you be faster than me? Don\u2019t talk nonsense. Go check if someone has touched the shock cannon!\u201d</p><br/><p>He moved quickly as he spoke and left everyone far behind him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shocked when he saw this.</p><br/><p>The third prince wasn\u2019t quite as he imagined.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Why did they think there were monsters on this farm? What happened to the outside world?</p><br/><p>He held his breath quietly as the men outside checked everywhere before saying, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, we can rest here for the night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie might\u2019ve lived on the farm for a while but he didn\u2019t tamper with things and everything remained basically the same. Thus, these people couldn\u2019t find his traces and only thought they were left by the people of the farm.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wanted to listen to their words but he was afraid Little Chirp in his hand couldn\u2019t stay silent and looked down at the bird.</p><br/><p>The little bird was sitting in his palm without making a sound and was very obedient.</p><br/><p>There was a feeling that he was also eavesdropping along with Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>This little guy was really sensible and good. Jiang Xie\u2019s heart warmed as he listened carefully to the movements outside.</p><br/><p>The people outside seemed relaxed and after sitting down, they chatted more openly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think the plot of a novel would happen in reality.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ground cracked while I was in bed and I almost became impotent!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI still think I\u2019m dreaming. How did all of this come true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Based on their mutual complaints, Xie Xi figured out the general situation outside.</p><br/><p>The so-called ground crack was the earthquake that killed Father Jiang. This was a global scale disaster. Every large city was burned overnight while only a bit of the forests outside the cities was lost. The more horrifying thing was that the forests contained many monsters and their only prey was humans. Once they rushed into the cities, they brought a fatal blow to the people who survived the disaster.</p><br/><p>Since the entire human race was going to die, there were also humans who changed.</p><br/><p>Listening to their story, the transformed humans were strong and even had a variety of special abilities.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help looking at Jiang Xie through his fingertips. Jiang Xie had definitely changed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was also looking down at him. Such a good Little Chirp certainly wasn\u2019t a monster.</p><br/><p>The outsiders chatted about the changes again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were really unlucky. It wasn\u2019t easy to get an evolved person but he is a waste apart from his blood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. If we didn\u2019t have him then you would\u2019ve bled to death a long time ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want an ability but who the hell wants his ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe content. The fact that we have such a blood bag means we can continue to live.\u201d</p><br/><p>Another man spoke in a low voice. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to the city tomorrow and find a way to get rid of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Several others agreed. \u201cYes, he will die soon if this continues. If he dies then he is worthless.\u201d</p><br/><p>The previous reckless person wondered, \u201cHe is like this, will anyone want him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been greedy about drawing so much blood from him, would he be so terrible to sell?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was afraid he would leave\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d The man with the low voice spoke again. \u201cHe has this ability and there is always someone who wants it. We can dig out his heart for someone else or use him as a blood bank if carefully controlled\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is possible.\u201d The reckless man spoke. \u201cThen why don\u2019t we\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The man with the low voice sneered. \u201cDo we have the power? You were greedy and hastily chewed him up. We should see if we can exchange him for more valuable resources.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xie Xi\u2019s hair stood up.</p><br/><p>He knew that the person whose blood was drawn must not be God Yan of Central but listening to these words still made him furious.</p><br/><p>A good person lost human dignity and was sold as a commodity just because his blood had special effects?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt sick.</p><br/><p>The more disgusting thing happened later. After they ate something, the reckless man gave a short laugh. \u201cThis Yan Zhe is too beautiful. If he was a woman then I would use her body.\u201d</p><br/><p>The low-voiced man scolded him. \u201cDon\u2019t mess around!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in men.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart fell and he wanted to see what this Yan Zhe looked like.</p><br/><p>From beginning to end, Jiang Xie was very calm. His expression didn\u2019t change while listening to these things and he showed no intentions of being a hero.</p><br/><p>This was right. It was difficult to determine how many people were outside. If he rushed out alone then he might be in trouble rather than saving people.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t alone now and had to take care of Little Chirp. If he had an accident then it would be dangerous, regardless of whether Little Chip was big or small.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie waited for the men to fall asleep.</p><br/><p>Unexpected, just before going to sleep, the man with the low voice spoke carefully, \u201cUse that just in case.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reckless person replied, \u201cDon\u2019t waste it because it can\u2019t be used often. It is very safe here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are all tired. In case everyone falls asleep, it is better to check again.\u201d The man with the low voice stated while pulling something out.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie and Xie Xi couldn\u2019t see anything but based on the conversation, they knew that this group had other means of investigating.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was tense and his hair stood up. Jiang Xie also tensed and he completely held his breath. But\u2026</p><br/><p>The reckless man cried out, \u201cThere really are people here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn, they were found!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt Jiang Xie moving and Jiang Xie quickly placed the bird on the dark shelves behind him. \u201cHide well and don\u2019t come out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was anxious and hastily called out the god\u2019s wisdom and sketch to draw the Different Space Shield.</p><br/><p>Originally, this drawing could be done in a second but now it took so long. By this time, the reckless man had arrived with a knife.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had absolutely no experience in this area but his instinct to survive stimulated his body\u2019s potential. He rushed up and seized the knife while the man was feeling surprised.</p><br/><p>The man snorted. \u201cDamn, it\u2019s a rabbit!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was young and grabbed the hand holding the knife.</p><br/><p>At this time, Xie Xi was relieved as he finally drew the space shield and threw it around Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>This shield was close to invincible in this small world and no one would be able to hurt Jiang Xie within the time limit.</p><br/><p>Next was to draw a weapon. These people couldn\u2019t be left alone!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really wanted to draw an artifact that belonged to Jiang Xie in Central but it was too hard for him as a bird. He could only reluctantly draw a modified version that ordinary people could easily handle.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, his wings were weak and sore after drawing the space shield. He made several attempts but couldn\u2019t draw it.</p><br/><p>The damn god\u2019s wisdom only said: Too ugly to recognize.</p><br/><p>Your sister was ugly!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s side didn\u2019t have a weapon and the man controlled by Jiang Xie was already fighting back.</p><br/><p>In the end, Jiang Xie was young and thin and let the man break free.</p><br/><p>The movements were so big that the people outside quickly came over. There were five people, each with a fierce and sinister look. It was conceivable that they were typical gangsters before the disaster.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill him!\u201d The man with the low voice was clearly the leader and he didn\u2019t hesitate to open his mouth.</p><br/><p>The tall man next to him pulled out a gun, pulled the trigger and fired it at Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s pupils shrank but he couldn\u2019t hide from it. The bullet flew and aimed at his forehead. This was a shot that couldn\u2019t miss and was also one that was bound to kill Jiang Xie. Everyone thought so, including Jiang Xie himself.</p><br/><p>At this moment, an unwilling feeling surged inside his heart!</p><br/><p>Why\u2026 Why? HIs father was gone, his house was gone and he was even going to die! Why?! He never asked too much. Why wasn\u2019t he allowed even the most basic survival?</p><br/><p>The moment the bullet was about to hit his forehead, Jiang Xie slashed the long knife in his hand and the person opposite him was completely unprepared. They didn\u2019t think the person shot in the forehead could still fight back.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is an evolved person!\u201dThe man with the low voice was standing further back and saw this amazing scene.</p><br/><p>The bullet hit, it absolute hit and it was a fatal shot, but the youth in front of him was unscathed! What else could he be apart from an evolved person?!</p><br/><p>The man who first attacked Jiang Xie was the first to lose his life. Blood poured out, instantly making the claustrophobic space red and terrifying.</p><br/><p>The person in front saw the teenager\u2019s red eyes and his scalp became numb. \u201cKill him, kill this monster!\u201d</p><br/><p>They shot in tandem, firing frantically. However, the bullets struck a wall and caused no harm. Rather, they angered the sleeping beast.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finally drew an image but it was no longer necessary. Jiang Xie used the knife to hack to death all those who wanted to kill him.</p><br/><p>Everything returned to its previous calm, the only sound that of the blood falling from the tip of the knife.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stood motionless and stared at the scene in front of him, his senses unable to return for a long time.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi flew out and gave him a gentle peck on the cheek.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie turned his head mechanically and saw the little white spot against the scarlet darkness. The bird was very small but tried to touch him with the white feathers, as if wanting to wipe off his blood. The small thing seemed to sense his eyes and looked up with very small black eyes.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Jiang Xie lost all the strength in his body and the blood-covered knife fell. He carefully held the bird in his hand and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard these words and it felt like his heart was being continuously struck by needles.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi whispered a bit, obediently staying in this person\u2019s palm.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was warmed by this small heat. He breathed softly and didn\u2019t look at the blood around him.</p><br/><p>No matter what the world was like, no matter what happened in the future, no matter what he had to encounter, it was fine as long as he had the little thing in the palm of his hand.</p><br/><p>Little Chirp cared about him and he cared about Little Chirp.</p><br/><p>The blood Jiang Xie emerged and saw the man trapped in the cage.</p><br/><p>The man was leaning weakly against a corner of the cage. HIs long silver hair was bloody while pointed ears emerged from his hair. His white skin was like cold snow.</p><br/><p>He perceived the sound of footsteps and looked up with a bloodless face, beautiful enough to surpass fireworks.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shocked.</p><br/><p>This was Yan Zhe, the god of Central who could return people to life.</p><br/><p>What was going on? This world\u2026 was it Jiang Xie\u2019s past? Jiang Xie and Yan Zhe were originally from the same world?</p><br/><p>No, Central would only select one person from the original world at a time. It wasn\u2019t possible to grab two people at the same time.</p><br/><p>Wait\u2026 Jiang Xie\u2019s past was more than his original world.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

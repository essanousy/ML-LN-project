Was he digging a hole for Xie Xi to jump into and test if he had a partner.</p><br/><p>Or perhaps Jiang Xie knew about Little Jiang and just like Old Li, he thought Xie Xi was raising a \u2018child bride.\u2019</p><br/><p>Or\u2026 or\u2026</p><br/><p>Whether it was the heart and soul or a needle under the sea, he couldn\u2019t guess at all!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t say anything and Jiang Xie spoke again, \u201cIt isn\u2019t convenient for you if I live in the presidential palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hurriedly opened his mouth. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Silly Xie Xi! He wanted to say this wasn\u2019t true. Why did he say \u2018no\u2019?</p><br/><p>No one? Did it mean that Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t an inconvenience? Wasn\u2019t this admitting to his previous question?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had a sense of experiencing retribution. Sure enough, he had been a slag for so long that his mouth had its own conscience.</p><br/><p>Once this word mistakenly came out, Jiang Xie frowned and his attitude wasn\u2019t as calm as before.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it is just a bed partner, can you break up?\u201d His voice was very strict like he was declaring a decree. However, the contents gave it a different flavour, especially when combined with the following words. \u201c\u2026If it is just solving physical needs then I can help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finally took control of his mouth and said, \u201cNo.\u201d OH, this was the answer last time. Saying it here\u2026 well\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie looked down at himself in a deprecating manner. \u201cYes, young people are better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like that! He wasn\u2019t such a rascal!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s confused head was restored because of his shock and he grabbed the key point. \u201cI don\u2019t have a partner!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s demeanour wasn\u2019t soothed. \u201cThis is a normal thing. You don\u2019t have to hide it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stated firmly, \u201cI\u2019m not hiding it. I really don\u2019t have a partner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cYour life assistant has always been earrings. What is with that bracelet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He was a bit confused about the high-tech matters but should he translate it to mean there were clothing of different sizes and styles in the closet?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie added, \u201cEven if it is a spare, you wouldn\u2019t use a bracelet. The president\u2019s light brain link only supports earrings.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was just like how Jiang Xie had a black earring on his left ear.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s brain translated it: The president\u2019s uniform is set and you can\u2019t casually wear t-shirts or jeans to work.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie continued, \u201cThere are two bathroom records. You never take a cold shower and you don\u2019t like shiso toothpaste. The temperature of the hair dryer won\u2019t be lower than 30 degrees and you don\u2019t need the self-drying function. The constant temperature on the left and right sides of the bed is different\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They lived together and it was understandable\u2026 but what were these details?</p><br/><p>How was he a former president? This was Sherlock Holmes!</p><br/><p>Jiang Holmes kept speaking. \u201cBased on the style and size of the clothes stored in the bracelet, as well as his eating habits and tastes, it can be inferred that he is a young man under the age of 20\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was afraid. Fortunately, he didn\u2019t cheat in life or he would be caught by this guy!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is true that someone was living in the presidential palace previously but he isn\u2019t my partner.\u201d Xie Xi quickly threw out.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s expression was unchanged. \u201cIf he isn\u2019t a partner, why did you sleep in the same bed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was dumbfounded for a moment but fortunately, he had a legitimate reason and he spoke the truth. \u201cIt is like this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The leader of the e981 rebels was also familiar to Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have much entanglement with them during his time in office, After all, he was an immortal cockroach.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi talked about how the rebels were caught, how they suspected this person was X and how they couldn\u2019t imprison him because he was a minor. They also wanted to take the opportunity to capture a powerful force to help with the universe collapsing\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke the truth and didn\u2019t tell any lies, but he still had a guilty conscience.</p><br/><p>This was probably\u2026 the instincts of a slag. A guilty conscience was the norm, regardless of whether it was true or false.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie listened quietly and then frowned. \u201cHe is X?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is highly likely. He also has a rare SSS-grade physique.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wondered, \u201cYou sent him to the pole?\u201d Jiang Xie had long known that someone was sent to carry out the task but he didn\u2019t know who.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cThere was no way to reach you and I can\u2019t leave the capital. We could only let him go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie paused and stared at him. \u201cNothing really happened between you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or cry. \u201cReally. He is only 15 or 16 and is a half-child. What can I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Well, this half-child gave him many strawberries.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is possible for a 15 or 16 year old.\u201d Jiang Xie spoke quietly. \u201cYou climbed into my bed at that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s face was shocked. What the hell!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled again. \u201cOf course, I didn\u2019t do anything to you.\u201d Then he gently scratched the tip of his nose.</p><br/><p>The sound of his low voice was particularly nice and Xie Xi\u2019s ears trembled and his waist became numb.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stood firmly and tried not to be led by this person. \u201cSince separating from you, I have never slept with anyone. I haven\u2019t been with anyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the truth and Xie Xi spoke confidently!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was startled before nodding. \u201cThe work of a president is truly busy.\u201d A rational person was satisfied with work.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was about to explain when main Jiang Xie\u2019s words emerged in his head. He had to let them believe in his gender.</p><br/><p>A rational person who didn\u2019t love work wasn\u2019t qualified to be rational. Xie Xi couldn\u2019t refute Jiang Xie\u2019s sentences.</p><br/><p>In any case\u2026 he didn\u2019t mess around and loved working. Wasn\u2019t this better than flirting?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie relaxed and he asked Xie Xi, \u201cI really don\u2019t have to move out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded solemnly. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s lips curved. \u201cYou really need my help?\u201d</p><br/><p>His gaze moved downwards and Xie Xi understood, crying out, \u201cWork is important!\u201d He was very rational.</p><br/><p>The next day, Little Jiang came back. The starship landed and the Third Institute\u2019s president was ecstatic after receiving the data. \u201cPerfect! Perfect!\u201d</p><br/><p>A rational didn\u2019t understand love but other emotions weren\u2019t bad. The cabinet immediately held a meeting while Xie Xi quickly glanced at Little Jiang.</p><br/><p>The teenage Jiang Xie was staring at him greedily with an undisguised, fiery look.</p><br/><p>This month had been spent sleeping and having countless dreams, all of which were about Xie Xi. The even more wonderful thing was that when flying back to the Capital Stare, he suddenly entered a pure white space with Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was there but he was very different from the president. He seemed to be frightened as he shrunk into Jiang Xie\u2019s arms. Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t remember what Xie Xi said in the dream. He just felt that his chest was very sweet and the heat warmed his entire soul.</p><br/><p>Once he woke up, he had only one thought in his heart, \u2018Protect this person and guard him. Give him everything.\u2019</p><br/><p>Little Jiang had always looked down on emotional people. He felt they were suffering from invisible discrimination in this society and were being treated as pets by the rationals. Thus, Jiang Xie hid his gender, pretended to be rational and even became the leader of the rebel army.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie always felt that he wasn\u2019t emotional. He was more rational than an actual rational person. Until now\u2026</p><br/><p>After one month of these thoughts, he saw Xie Xi and his heart jumped and he couldn\u2019t look away. Everything clearly told him that he was an emotional, a thorough emotional.</p><br/><p>The emotional people had a saying: The stupidest thing an emotional person can do is fall in love with a rational person.</p><br/><p>There was another saying: The even stupider thing is an emotional disguising as a rational.</p><br/><p>This was tantamount to a moth throwing themselves at the flames to kill themselves.</p><br/><p>However, if a moth didn\u2019t throw itself into the flames, how would it know that this warm and bright light filled with infinite beauty would burn it?</p><br/><p>Little Jiang\u2019s task was completed exceptionally well. The cabinet gave him unceremonious praise and even hoped to give him a position he deserved.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at the teenager and spoke warmly, \u201cDon\u2019t be anxious. He is still young.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s gaze moved back towards the burning flame. Xie Xi received it and had no doubt that this boy would kiss him if no one else was present.</p><br/><p>Cough\u2026 Xie Xi\u2019s head was full of thoughts about what to do after returning to the presidential palace.</p><br/><p>The collision of Big Jiang and Little Jiang, he was afraid this universe would collapse early!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tried to concentrate as he listened to the data that the Third Institute\u2019s president reported from the pole.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need a few days to calculate it. If there are no accidents, the pole will be the only sanctuary of the universe!\u201d</p><br/><p>The meeting ended and Xie Xi and Jiang sat in the aircraft.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s head was full of the words before his departure but Xie Xi didn\u2019t mention it and he didn\u2019t ask.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are you so good to me?\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said he would answer when Jiang Xie came back. He was back.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi praised, \u201cYou have done a very good job on this mission.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, it is very important.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s thin lips moved before he changed his words. \u201cCan I move out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned. Why did the two of them want to move out? He might wish for them to move out but he wasn\u2019t at ease when they weren\u2019t under his eyes.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie continued, \u201cI used to live in the presidential palace for supervision. Now you shouldn\u2019t be worried about me anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>He completed such an important task. Regardless of Jiang Xie\u2019s identity, he was now the hero of the entire United States!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi considered it. It seemed possible? The two people would be temporarily separated until the institute got results. Then maybe Xie Xi could repair the broken god. If he completed the task then he didn\u2019t need to worry!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt he was thinking too beautifully. Since being with Jiang Xie, he was full of doubts about his luck in this area.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you want to move out?\u201d Xie Xi asked.</p><br/><p>Little Jiang replied, \u201cThere is no reasonable identity and it is strange to live in the presidential palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d This person wasn\u2019t very old but his ability to dig a pit wasn\u2019t small. This was telling Xie Xi to give him an identity!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t mind giving him the status of \u2018child bride\u2019 but he was afraid it wasn\u2019t possible!</p><br/><p>He thought about it before stating, \u201cYou are still young. I don\u2019t feel at ease when you live outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was also a wordplay. Jiang Xie was still young and an identity couldn\u2019t be given.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie declared, \u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi imagined the scene of Little Jiang and Big Jiang living under the same roof and said, \u201cAlso\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished his words when Big Jiang\u2019s voice was heard. \u201cYou\u2019re not back yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>The low and mature voice of a man filled the aircraft.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even worse, the aircraft stopped and they arrived at the presidential palace. The teenage Jiang Xie stared at Xie Xi with cold eyes. \u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>He is you!</p><br/><p>This was the feeling of being caught in bed!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi calmly answered, \u201cA friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>LIttle Jiang made a sound. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>The monosyllabic word almost froze the entire aircraft. The aircraft door opened and Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare say anything else about the matter. He could only act hard-headed. \u201cWe are here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>It turned out that these single syllables could be so terrible! Xie Xi had a tough choice between \u2018get off and die\u2019 or \u2018stay on and die.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then Big Jiang appeared, a gentle smile on the mature man\u2019s face. \u201cThe data of the pole was sent back? This is good news.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi rushed to the door of the aircraft, blocking the sight of the two sides in a final struggle. Unfortunately, the aircraft door was so big that the lone president couldn\u2019t stop it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi faced Big Jiang and saw this person\u2019s gaze pass over him, while at the same time, Xie Xi felt a low pressure coming from behind him.</p><br/><p>The teenager\u2019s voice was as cold as a knife. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s lips thinned and he looked calm. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

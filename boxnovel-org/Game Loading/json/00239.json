This alone made Xie Xi think this person was a serious and restrained man with a long life.</p><br/><p>The grey-haired demon let go of Xie Xi and ran out in a panicked manner.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s location was somewhat isolated. Once the grey-haired demon left, only Xie Xi and the strange man was were left behind.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew that all the adult demons in the Sixth Domain had a high status, so he cautiously bowed.</p><br/><p>The man smiled. \u201cDo you know me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shi shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you are.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man gazed at him for a while before speaking slowly, \u201cJust call me Jiang Xie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Jiang Xie.\u201d</p><br/><p>The smile on Jiang Xie\u2019s face deepened and he sat next to Xie Xi. \u201dIt is just Jiang Xie, not Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he felt that his first impression was an illusion. In fact, this gentleman wasn\u2019t restrained or serious!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Jiang Xie asked him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gave his name and added the following to prevent any misunderstandings. \u201cI came here with my teacher. My teacher has a seminar on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was surprised. \u201cA student?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to be looked down upon and straightened. \u201cNow I am a student. I will apply to the Seventh Domain after graduation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat will you do in the Seventh Domain?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cEvery demon\u2019s dream is to be loyal to the Demon God, I am no exception.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked with interest, \u201cHave you ever seen the Demon God?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi cast a disapproving gaze towards him. \u201cWould the Demon God go to the First Domain? Naturally, I haven\u2019t seen him.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to seem righteous and restrained so Xie Xi added, \u201c\u2026I\u2019ll see him later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke slowly. \u201cHow can you be loyal to a person you have never met?\u201d</p><br/><p>His demeanour wasn\u2019t pious and Xie Xi watched him vigilantly. \u201cAre you a spy sent from Heaven?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was amused by him and raised his eyebrows. \u201cIf I am a spy, I would tie you up and bring you to Heaven right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi rarely had physical contact with others. He usually became cold but now he felt heat spreading through his body\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sensed it and his smile deepened. \u201cWhy, does the little succubus want me?\u201d</p><br/><p>His slow tone would have others think negatively of him but it was normal for a succubus. Xie Xi might not indulge in desire but he was a real succubus. He knew the life of a succubus very well and wasn\u2019t angry.</p><br/><p>He hesitated. The man in front of him felt different from the first impression but Xie Xi didn\u2019t hate him. If Xie Xi had to find a person, uh\u2026</p><br/><p>Unexpected, Jiang Xie told him, \u201cGo find someone else. I\u2019m not free tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This man was really annoying!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi got up and stated coldly, \u201cYou are thinking too much, I\u2019m not interested in you.\u201d He might be angry but he didn\u2019t want to offend this person and used honorifics.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie noticed his anger. \u201cTonight really isn\u2019t possible. If you are willing to wait then can you come back tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shouted, \u201cNo!\u201d Then he turned and left.</p><br/><p>Such a casual big demon, Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with him! Outside the bar, the cold wind blew at Xie Xi and calmed him down. He saw his reflection in the window. It was a very standard succubus\u2019 face and others could recognize it at one glance.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t hate his lineage, he just hated that he couldn\u2019t adapt to his lineage. Why couldn\u2019t he find someone? Wasn\u2019t it just sex?</p><br/><p>This was a problem that even Xie Xi didn\u2019t know the answer to. All he knew was that he would rather face death than find just anyone.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi laughed at himself and thought in his heart, \u2018I said I would go to the Seventh Domain to be loyal to the demon god but I can\u2019t even go through the adulthood ceremony.\u2019</p><br/><p>The next day, Xie Xi didn\u2019t go to the bar but he didn\u2019t dare stay at the reception thanks to his professor. He could only go outside into the cold wind until midnight, when he dared to go back and sleep.</p><br/><p>This happened for three days in a row. There were only a few days left until they returned to the First Domain and the professor was furious. \u201cWhat type of demon do you want to pick?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie flashed through Xie Xi\u2019s brain for a moment\u2026 he didn\u2019t want that bastard!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi angrily cried out, \u201cI won\u2019t become an adult!\u201d</p><br/><p>The professor seemed like a mother and father who regretted marrying off their daughter. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to live!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stepped forward. \u201cIf I won\u2019t live then I won\u2019t live!\u201d</p><br/><p>The professor was angry but he also knew Xie Xi\u2019s stubbornness. 10 hell dogs wouldn\u2019t be able to move him!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat nonsense are you saying?\u201d The professor decided to compromise. Tell me the type of person you want. With the exception of the Demon God, I will help you find a way to contact them.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that he was being arrogant. His student was so excellent that even the domain masters wouldn\u2019t refuse to help this promising little succubus.</p><br/><p>The only one Xie Xi could think about was Jiang Xie. However, that person wasn\u2019t available!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi made a gamble. \u201cI want the Demon God. Apart from the Demon God, I don\u2019t want anyone else!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026 you stinky boy!\u201d The professor was so angry that he almost died on the spot!</p><br/><p>They would be leaving the Sixth Domain tomorrow. During this period, Xie Xi never went out again.</p><br/><p>The professor couldn\u2019t control his student anymore and didn\u2019t bother looking. He just went out to drink.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sat in his room until 9 o\u2019clock. He couldn\u2019t go to sleep so he went out. He didn\u2019t know how but he went to the bar again. In fact, he didn\u2019t have any thoughts. He just went in and looked around. Naturally, he didn\u2019t see the man with purple eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>This was normal. So many days had passed. Xie Xi relaxed and let out a breath. He sat at the bar and sipped his wine slowly. It was the last night. Tomorrow he would go back\u2026</p><br/><p>This was it. He would go back and tell everyone that he only wanted to sleep with the Demon God. Then he would wait to die. His life might be short but he somehow wasn\u2019t upset.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finished his glass of wine and was ready to go back. Then a voice was heard behind him. \u201cI thought I\u2019d never see you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned around and saw the purple-eyed man who made him itch with dislike.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes flashed with surprise and he spoke somewhat helplessly, \u201cThis little succubus is really\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had just drunk a glass of wine and thought about those things. His eyes were covered with a layer of moisture and his cheeks were faintly red, which made his skin more stunning. He was already very good-looking and this appearance could simply take away the soul of a person.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t expected to see Jiang Xie and didn\u2019t react for a while. He just stared at the other person.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s voice lowered and was warm. \u201cI am free tonight. You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not free!\u201d Xie Xi\u2019s senses returned along with an unknown anger and he refused.</p><br/><p>He was inexplicably uncomfortable when he heard Jiang Xie\u2019s words. He didn\u2019t want to see Jiang Xie or have anything to do with him. So what if Xie Xi died? In any case, he should live happily!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was slightly shocked.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi got up and said, \u201cSorry, I\u2019ve already made an appointment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he left. Jiang Xie naturally didn\u2019t follow. He sat down for a while, the light fading from his eyes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi returned to the First Domain. On the way, the professor sighed and kept glancing bitterly at Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s face didn\u2019t change colour. \u201cIt is either the Demon God or death!\u201d</p><br/><p>The professor poked him. \u201cI haven\u2019t raised a naughty student like you for so many years!\u201d On the contrary, Xie Xi was too excellent. If he could graduate then he could be assigned to the Sixth Domain. Then if he worked hard for several years, he might get a great prospect.</p><br/><p>This stinky student had a great future but the problem was if the student could live to next year?</p><br/><p>The thing that led Xie Xi to compromise later was that he saw a piece of information.</p><br/><p>The Demon World had a long history and the succubus race was one of the original races, they were very old.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi found a predecessor who also suffered from anorexia like him. Before the adulthood ceremony, the predecessor refused to do anything with others. Later, he held the ceremony and it went completely out of control. The people around him\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw up to here.</p><br/><p>The one holding the ceremony for him was his own professor. If he became a beast and forced his teacher then\u2026</p><br/><p>No, this image was too terrible, more terrible than death!</p><br/><p>However, committing suicide would be too cowardly. This would make the professor who always cared for him feel sad and lose his dignity.</p><br/><p>What should he do?</p><br/><p>As the day drew nearer, Xie Xi compromised. He could ignore himself but he couldn\u2019t implicate others.</p><br/><p>Finally, Xie Xi plucked up the courage to go to a famous bar in the First Domain while wearing a special outfit.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter the identity of the person. The first one to talk to him was fine. He just needed to complete the task!</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, he just entered the door when he bumped into a person. Xie Xi looked up and saw Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie frowned as he took off his coat and wrapped it around Xie Xi. \u201cDressing like this, do you want to cause chaos?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t hear what he said and asked, \u201cWhat are you\u2026 why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Why was a big demon from the Sixth Domain in the First Domain? How could Jiang Xie explain that he was fascinated by the little succubus and came to find him?</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a job,\u201d Jiang Xie replied.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart heated up as he thought about his set goal: have sex with the first person to talk to him. This was Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>The awkwardness from a few works ago had long scattered and Xie Xi watched this person.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s voice became slightly hoarse. \u201cIt seems you don\u2019t have an appointment tonight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI just arrived here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I make an appointment with you then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s thin lips quivered but he remained strong. \u201cIf you are free\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie picked him up and directly teleported to a large room. Xie Xi was thrown on the bed and his body was a bit squished. \u201cThis is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie covered his mouth and kissed him into a daze. At the last moment, Jiang Xie stopped. Xie Xi stared up at him with moist eyes.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cPromise me something or I won\u2019t continue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was going crazy. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned towards his ear and whispered, \u201cAfter tonight, you will only be with me and not look for anyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie kissed his small earlobe. \u201cI will give you the best sex but you can only belong to me from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xie Xi could only hear his own heartbeat that violently engulfed his entire body.</p><br/><p>He circled Jiang Xie\u2019s neck with his arms and whispered, \u201cOkay\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt unparalleled joy the moment he uttered these words.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If people heard what he said\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi would really be his father and killed by him.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince was still watching him. Xie Xi finally reacted and bowed. \u201cI have seen Your Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had previously used Sein Hall on the sixth prince so he had to carry it through to the end without being exposed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only recently arrived and don\u2019t know many people. I don\u2019t know who Sein Hall is.\u201d Xie Xi kept his head down and tried not to look at the sixth prince.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince lived in a simple manner and had little contact with people. He didn\u2019t want to alarm many people and said, \u201cHe is also a guard here. If you see him, help me give him a message. Tell him to come see me if he has time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince left and Xie Xi was relieved. He had enough trouble dealing with the sixth prince alone and now he had to use three identities to face six people\u2026</p><br/><p>It was like walking a tightrope. It wasn\u2019t easy for a person to walk on a wire. Now he had to walk back and forth on six steel wires!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi went back to his place, locked the door and turned off the Camouflage technique.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t panic and lightly stroked his face.</p><br/><p>His real skin: Sein Hall, corresponding to the fifth prince and sixth prince.</p><br/><p>The second face: Colin Hall, corresponding to the second prince and third prince.</p><br/><p>The first face: Jesse Hall, temporarily assigned to the eldest prince and fourth prince.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi repeated it several times to ensure he would remember. Then he recorded the progress of the task.</p><br/><p>A 100% progress bar meant the task was completed. There were six people at the moment. On average, each person was 16.6666%\u2026 why couldn\u2019t it be a constant number?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about it. Perhaps it might be a good thing that it wasn\u2019t constant? If it wasn\u2019t evenly divided, perhaps he could focus on one person and collect as much love as possible? Then he would collect the rest from the remaining people. This seemed much simpler.</p><br/><p>For example, the fifth prince was easy and he could coax 60% love from him. Then the remaining 40% would be the other princes since the task was collecting the love of the six princes. The difficulty between 1% and 60% was quite different.</p><br/><p>For the crazy second prince, getting 1% instead of 60% was much simpler.</p><br/><p>Could he really do this? Xie Xi was deeply skeptical.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie watched Xie Xi, who was biting the pen while seriously thinking, and felt worried. He was worried that his goodwill would drop after Xie Xi knew the truth.</p><br/><p>The number was already terrible. If Yan Zhe knew then he would most probably say that there was no chance in heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>This task certainly wasn\u2019t that simple. It was 16.6666% for each colour. This represented the love of a single soul because love was endless, so the number was endless.</p><br/><p>Since all love couldn\u2019t exceed this percentage, there was no way to collect 60% from a single prince.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi put away the small book and decided to go to the sixth prince first.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince came to him specifically so there might be something urgent.</p><br/><p>This was also a preference. Compared to the slag third prince and temperamental second prince, the \u2018simple\u2019 fifth and sixth prince were much lovelier.</p><br/><p>Time was life. Xie Xi immediately went to the palace of the sixth prince.</p><br/><p>Once the sixth prince saw him, the dark eyes lit up.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun sang his praises. \u201cAhhh, the second most handsome person under the sea!\u201d Don\u2019t ask who the first one was. There were only two beings with different coloured eyes under the sea.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi bowed and the sixth prince helped him up.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do for Your Highness?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince paused and said, \u201cThere is something I wanted to tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at the active progress bar and was happy to spend time with the sixth prince. \u201cYour Highness, please speak.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince hesitated before finally saying, \u201cTomorrow, I\u2019m going up to the land.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled. The land?</p><br/><p>The sixth prince continued, \u201cThus, I wanted to have a word with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was tense and he asked, \u201cHow long will you be gone?\u201d If he was gone for a few months, wouldn\u2019t it be impossible to complete the task?</p><br/><p>His nervous appearance made the sixth prince relax, saying gently, \u201cIt isn\u2019t too long. Three or four days at the most.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xie Xi spoke in a relieved manner, \u201cI thought you would be gone for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was somewhat puzzled. If it was just three or four days, why specifically tell Xie Xi? Of course, he couldn\u2019t ask this. The sixth prince was pitiful and probably had no friends. Was this why he paid extra attention to a person who was good to him?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt a bit ashamed when he had this thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis subordinate\u2026\u201d He wanted to say something about when the prince came back, only to suddenly stop.</p><br/><p>There was a green light flashing on the jade table next to him. If Xie Xi wasn\u2019t mistaken, this was a save point.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince noticed his pause. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince felt doubtful but didn\u2019t ask.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi moved quickly and chose to save. His heart was beating quickly and he had a bad feeling. Why was there a save point? Was there going to be an important event next?</p><br/><p>The last save point helped get him into the palace. What was it this time?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t figure it out for the moment and it wasn\u2019t good to snub the sixth prince. He pushed away the thoughts and asked, \u201cWhen will Your Highness leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince answered, \u201cTomorrow morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sincerely told him, \u201cThis subordinate will be waiting for you to come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince laughed in a light manner that inexplicably made a person feel sad. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was comforted as he looked at the 7% progress bar.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince asked, \u201cDo you still have errands to run? Go ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t finished giving out the gifts and didn\u2019t dare delay. He left with a bow.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart wasn\u2019t comfortable. This save point made him uneasy. A save point wouldn\u2019t appear unless there was an important decision.</p><br/><p>Did he make the right choice? He didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi changed his face and went to give the gift to the elder prince. However, he didn\u2019t see anyone. The eldest prince was busy and working overtime. Xie Xi turned and went to the palace of the fourth prince. The fourth prince was the only one with a legitimate reason to not see any guests.</p><br/><p>He was ill. He could say no if the king\u2019s personal attendant came, let along a small guard.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was slightly sorry but he wasn\u2019t in a hurry. There was no need to test anything. The six people had already been assigned to the three faces. Now it was just creating opportunities to approach them.</p><br/><p>He was really tired from this day and fell asleep.</p><br/><p>He had a dream. In this dream, he became a small fish and was chased by six big sharks. He swam desperately and was finally torn into six servings for the sharks.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi woke up and smiled bitterly. How was it a dream? This was reality!</p><br/><p>Today he wasn\u2019t very busy. He didn\u2019t try to pick up a fish and instead perfected the information of the other two faces. Camouflage was a big bug and he could do many things. He naturally had to make good use of it.</p><br/><p>First of all, he used it to become the steward of the palace and recorded the first and second faces into the register of palace guards.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, this was a technologically advanced underwater world. The authority was verified with fingerprints and the iris and Xie Xi could easily pass.</p><br/><p>After changing the register, he arranged a proper family background for his three faces by entering the household registration management department. Xie Xi also used this opportunity to find out a lot of prince-related information and was ready to go back and study it slowly.</p><br/><p>This was a squandered day but Xie Xi felt it was worthwhile. After all, he needed to hone the blade to cut the wood.</p><br/><p>The next day, a maid came to find him. \u201cMr. Hall, there is a request from His Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>For a moment, he couldn\u2019t tell which face he had on. Miss Mermaid, couldn\u2019t she call his name and mention which prince?</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Roast Pork Bun was taught and knew some things. He shouted, \u201cSein, Daddy is now Sein Hall!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was relieved to know which prince sent the maid.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince didn\u2019t have a maid, not to mention that he had gone up to land. This could only be the maid of the fifth prince.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi followed after the maid.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince was waiting and greeted him. \u201cSein, come here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was pulled by the fifth prince before he could react.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince was wearing rare formal attire. The uniform outlined his figure very well and his long legs could make a mermaid die from envy. After being a fish for a long time, Xie Xi really missed the taste of Earth.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince noticed his gaze and asked, \u201cDo you like my legs?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince bent over and whispered, \u201cIn fact, my tail is also beautiful. If there is a chance, I will show you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d Why did he feel so weird?</p><br/><p>The fifth prince laughed. \u201cSmall Sein, you are so cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at the rising orange bar and said, \u201cYour Highness, please don\u2019t\u2026 tease this subordinate.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince held his hand. \u201cI\u2019m not teasing you, I\u2019m looking at you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt the heat from his palm and felt\u2026 wasn\u2019t this progress a bit too fast after a few days? He would be even more surprised if he knew that 16.6666\u2026% was the fullest possible value.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince\u2019s progress bar had already reached 13%. This was also after some progress had been lost!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t say anything. The fifth prince thought he was shy and stopped teasing him. \u201cLet\u2019s go, I will take you to a concert.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was surprised. \u201cA concert?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It is a song I wrote. I\u2019m sure you will like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t hate it. The fifth prince was versatile and just casually fiddling with the strings created a heavenly sound. The song that the prince wrote\u2026 Xie Xi was looking forward to it a bit.</p><br/><p>The underwater kingdom also had \u2018cars\u2019. Of course, they were called airships instead of cars.</p><br/><p>After all, there was no need for a highway under the sea. The vehicle shot out with a loud sound. A mermaid\u2019s speed wasn\u2019t slow, certainly not slower than an airship. However, a fast speed would consume physical strength. This was an enjoyable means of transportation so who would willingly swim?</p><br/><p>There was no need to mention the grandeur of the fifth prince. Xie Xi might not understand the technology but he could see how luxurious his transportation vehicle was. It was estimated to be superior to two Rolls-Royce on land.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince treated Xie Xi so well that he was slightly ashamed. He might be forced by the task and wasn\u2019t doing this willingly, but he was still deceiving the fifth prince.</p><br/><p>If the soul was like the second prince then he wouldn\u2019t care. However, the silly fifth prince was really\u2026</p><br/><p>The fifth prince asked him, \u201cIs it delicious?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi swallowed the pastry in his mouth and nodded. \u201cIt is delicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will ask them to prepare more for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I have\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince told him, \u201cYou are too small. You should move out and come to my palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Xie Xi dare do that? He frowned. \u201cYour Highness, please give me some time. I can arrange my own life.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince didn\u2019t force him. \u201cOkay, don\u2019t be angry. I will leave it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt more and more guilty.</p><br/><p>They had just arrived at the concert hall and hadn\u2019t walked in yet when the fifth prince\u2019s communicator rang.</p><br/><p>It was very sharp and especially shrill, like it was some type of alarm. The fifth prince frowned and quickly pulled out the communicator. He glanced at it and froze.</p><br/><p>At the same time, a huge screen was projected in the screen, the square clearly visible.</p><br/><p>The third prince dressed in military attire appeared. His posture was majestic and there was a deep look in his eyes. The words from his mouth blasted the entire sea bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSixth Prince Sirius Atlantis went up to the land and was brutally killed! How can we so back when the land people are so cruel and insolent?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned. What? The sixth prince was dead?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He could get the license and then fill up the progress!</p><br/><p>Obviously, this was wishful thinking. Xie Xi stared at the lack of 0.006\u2026% progress and wanted to manually paint the white a green colour!</p><br/><p>How good was green? Fourth prince, you are so environmentally friendly. Why not turn yourself green?</p><br/><p>The fourth prince was in a good mood. \u201cI also want it to be simple. I won\u2019t ask too many people or engage in cumbersome rituals. I will only celebrate with our families.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about the fourth prince\u2019s family.</p><br/><p>The eldest brother had a \u2018previous life\u2019 debt, the second brother promised to spend the rest of his life with Xie Xi, the third brother also asked to marry him, the fifth and sixth brothers were wistfully waiting for him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to say, \u2018There is no need to ask the family. Just us is enough! Let\u2019s hurry and get married!\u2019</p><br/><p>These unseemly words, how could he say them\u2026</p><br/><p>The fourth prince was still thinking, \u201cWe can go to the Muguang District for the feast and find Xinren to be a flower girl?\u201d Muguang District was the shallow area inhabited by ordinary merpeople and was previously polluted by the land people. Xinren was the little mermaid Xie Xi had previously saved.</p><br/><p>If Xie Xi hadn\u2019t stepped on six boats, he would really think this picture was very warm.</p><br/><p>The two of them shared a common ideal. After meeting, they saved countless merpeople and resolved the hidden danger of the sea.</p><br/><p>Once they returned to Muguang, they would receive the most sincere blessings and these blessings would make their marriage beautiful.</p><br/><p>It was great, on the premise that Xie Xi wasn\u2019t a scum male.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really wasn\u2019t a scum! He just agreed to three proposals in a matter of hours\u2026 just\u2026</p><br/><p>His heart was a mess and it was inevitable that Xie Xi would act a bit perfunctory. Fortunately, the fourth prince was in a good mood and didn\u2019t think much. What could he think about? Who would think that such an angelic merman would be his eldest sister-in-law, second sister-in-law, third sister-in-law, plus add another two for his younger siblings.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince could never imagine this, even if his brain hole was bigger than the sea!</p><br/><p>The worried Xie Xi thought of a new plan. Couldn\u2019t he use Dreaming to satisfy the fourth prince\u2019s desire to marry and fill up the progress?</p><br/><p>If the timing was good, he could still pretend to be the resurrected Sein, take care of the eldest prince and then complete the task!</p><br/><p>He just needed to wait for the fourth prince to sleep!</p><br/><p>After two hours, Xie Xi asked, \u201cYour Highness, aren\u2019t you resting yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince asked him, \u201cAre you tired?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was tired. His heart was more tired than his body. \u201cI\u2019m somewhat sleepy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen go to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at the fourth prince. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to sleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince dealt him a serious blow. \u201cI have some side effects from the use of the medicine. My rest is chaotic and I often don\u2019t sleep for seven or eight days. Then I will sleep for three or four days straight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince added, \u201cYou haven\u2019t used it a lot so there will be no side effects.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seven or eight days without sleep? Was he joking?</p><br/><p>The fourth prince thought Xie Xi was worried about him and patiently explained, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t use the medicine anymore. I will stop for a while and transfer a few months of work to someone else.\u201d The implication was that after they got married, they would ride into the sunset and return\u2026</p><br/><p>After a few months? Sorry, in 15 days, your husband\u2019s face will change. The first face could only be used for half a month!</p><br/><p>The fourth prince wouldn\u2019t sleep for seven or eight days\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t even wait 10 hours, let alone so many days!</p><br/><p>The fourth prince was uncertain and he didn\u2019t dare drag out the eldest prince.</p><br/><p>In 24 hours, Sein must life or the great prince\u2019s progress would reduce.</p><br/><p>What about after he was resurrected? Even if he could fill the progress of the eldest prince, how could he stabilize the fifth and sixth princes? Not to mention 2 and 3\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi rubbed the kitten while worrying and Roast Pork Bun whined, \u201cDaddy, pick a good day and marry all of them at the same time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This little cat didn\u2019t know how to worry!</p><br/><p>Then Xie Xi blamed himself. It was his fault. He didn\u2019t act correctly and raised a bad child.</p><br/><p>No, it was all X\u2019s fault. He was the culprit!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gritted his teeth as he thought of X.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince didn\u2019t sleep and Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare waste any more time here.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince told him, \u201cYou are sleepy. Just sleep here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare before Now\u2026\u201d Xie Xi looked embarrassed. \u201cI will go back!\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince didn\u2019t force him and let him go.</p><br/><p>The Dreaming plan fell through. Xie Xi had to think of plan B!</p><br/><p>He took a deep breath and went to Sein\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>He was bound to be resurrected. The rest was acting!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told the kitten. \u201cGo help me keep watch. Pay attention to the expression of the state teacher. The moment he looks scared and starts shivering, hurry and call me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun didn\u2019t understand and asked, \u201cWhy do you want me to watch the state teacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the resurrection doesn\u2019t succeed, he will be killed on the spot. Thus, once he looks scared, it is the time when I should come back to life but nothing is happening.\u201d</p><br/><p>The state teacher said 24 hours but this vague timing wasn\u2019t easy to grasp. The state teacher was the best way to judge.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun cried out, \u201cDaddy is so clever!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi showed a tired and bitter smile while Roast Pork Bun added another knife, \u201cNo wonder why so many people love you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi threw the kitten away.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, ah~\u201d Roast Pork Bun fell on his favourite sixth prince\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>The kitten didn\u2019t belong to this world and the sixth prince couldn\u2019t feel him at all.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun admired the sixth prince\u2019s beautiful eyes before starting to observe carefully.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s thoughts were correct. Nearly 20 hours later, the state teacher started to shrink back. His eyes drifted around, his face was ugly and his forehead was covered with beads of sweat.</p><br/><p>The third princes present were all amazing. Despite giving so much blood, they stayed awake for 20 hours and their eyes were still sharp. They quickly saw the state teacher\u2019s unusual state.</p><br/><p>The eldest prince asked, \u201cWhat is it? Is there a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>The state teacher glanced at the sixth prince and was scared to death. \u201cNo, no problem. Everything is right. The array started successfully. I will surely, surely bring him back to life.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy are you panicking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sweat dripped down the state teacher\u2019s forehead. \u2018It might be that not enough time has passed. Wait, wait a while and he should, should\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t say anything else. By all accounts, the person should\u2019ve appeared. Why wasn\u2019t there the slightest reaction?</p><br/><p>The fifth prince stared at him. \u201cYou better be honest and don\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><br/><p>The state teacher shook even more, his webbed hands waving. \u201cThere are no mistakes. The conditions are fulfilled. As long as he is really dead\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince couldn\u2019t listen anymore and grabbed him by the collar. \u201cIs he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The state teacher frantically shook his head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t mean that. I mean, he will definitely come back!\u201d</p><br/><p>The eldest prince was calmer. \u201cWill he appear in the centre of this array after resurrecting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy, by all accounts\u2026 It is also possible that he is nearby\u2026\u201d In fact, the state teacher didn\u2019t know. By all accounts, this person should\u2019ve come back to life already!</p><br/><p>The eldest prince declared, \u201cI\u2019ll go out and look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, who had just swam to the roof to be on \u2018standby\u2019 was startled and hurriedly lay flat.</p><br/><p>He knew that he couldn\u2019t rush in or teleport to the centre of the array. He could only retreat to the top and lay above the array\u2026</p><br/><p>Then\u2026 he was still resurrected so don\u2019t think about it too much!</p><br/><p>The roof of the seabed was different from the land. The fish could easily come and go and it was no different from the ground. Thus, Xie Xi couldn\u2019t lie there ahead of time.</p><br/><p>The eldest prince reached this height and saw the \u2018unconscious\u2019 Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Ink-coloured hair and white skin that was more beautiful than a pearl at the bottom of the ocean.</p><br/><p>Sein Hall.</p><br/><p>The eldest prince was shocked and the emotions he couldn\u2019t hold back surged up, turning his thoughts into a mess.</p><br/><p>This was Sein Hall.</p><br/><p>His Sein Hall.</p><br/><p>His loss of control caused the surrounding waters to shake. The fifth and sixth prince came out and saw the unconscious person. Both of them were stunned and it was the sixth prince who recovered first. He stepped forward and hugged Xie Xi, ecstasy in his choked voice. \u201cSein, Sein, Sein\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t stay anything other than this person\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>The first ray of light he saw that had been brutally taken from him\u2026</p><br/><p>The light was back.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He might feel that this thing couldn\u2019t be separated from Aries but he couldn\u2019t be stuck here. It was necessary to find it.</p><br/><p>After being able to transform into a human form, it was much more convenient to move. As long as Jiang Xie fell asleep and a sleep monitor was placed on him, Xie Xi could go out to do things.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the last world, Xie Xi knew about many high-tech things. He might not understand the principle behind them but he could draw them if he thought about it.</p><br/><p>The sleep monitor was used to watch Jiang Xie\u2019s sleep and Xie Xi would come back as soon as it showed signs he was waking up.</p><br/><p>A simple aircraft could be used to make the journey. As long as it was equipped with signal shielding, the current world\u2019s scientific and technological meant he couldn\u2019t be found.</p><br/><p>Just in case, Xie Xi also made a stealth charm, which was sold in the system store. It could only be used in the quasi-world and the effect was only suitable for people in the quasi-world. The duration was short and it had a limit on the number of uses.</p><br/><p>This was enough for any emergencies.</p><br/><p>It was so foolproof that Xie Xi flew over almost all the world and found it was very similar to the Earth he lived in. It was a parallel time and space but the development of certain details wasn\u2019t the same.</p><br/><p>For example, the appearance of money, some important historical celebrities and there seemed to be a gap in the Earth\u2019s map. However, Xie Xi didn\u2019t know enough about this aspect.</p><br/><p>A few months of exploration didn\u2019t find anything strange. This was at least an S-grade quasi-world but it didn\u2019t show signs of collapse.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really couldn\u2019t find a clue. The last world had the collapsing universe as a clue. This world was peaceful and not abnormal at all.</p><br/><p>What was wrong?</p><br/><p>While exploring, Xie Xi also went to learn more about Aries\u2019 life. This was truly pitiful. From birth, there was endless misfortune around him.</p><br/><p>His mother died in childbirth, his father was seriously and his grandfather, who presided over the family business, died.</p><br/><p>His uncle who came back from abroad barely escaped a disaster but because he took care of Jiang Xie for two years, his two children died at a ski resort. The uncle collapsed and committed suicide.</p><br/><p>The living aunt knelt down in front of Jiang Xie, begging him to let her live.</p><br/><p>At the time, Jiang Xie was only 12 years old. He left on his own and used his years of lucky money and saved pocket money for the past few years to buy this one bedroom apartment. Then he lived alone.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was even more pained after hearing this.</p><br/><p>He thought about how this might be Jiang Xie\u2019s past and it felt like his heart had been stabbed a few times.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had no way to change the past but the current Jiang Xie wouldn\u2019t suffer again.</p><br/><p>Just like Jiang Xie helped him in Dream Come True, this time he would also give Jiang Xie a different life.</p><br/><p>It might be false but he firmly believed in the words that Jiang Xie told him. As long as they believed it was real, all the experiences were reality.</p><br/><p>A painful memory could be covered with sweetness. Xie Xi had personally experienced this!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t fight for the past people and things but he could fight for the things now.</p><br/><p>The so-called rumours would always magnify things infinitely or change the facts beyond recognition. It would also cause irreparable harm to the party involved.</p><br/><p>It was hard to break the rumours but using rumours was easy.</p><br/><p>As long as Xie Xi made it so that the people who suffered disasters because of Jiang Xie became lucky, the wind would quickly change.</p><br/><p>The effort to help Kang Hong wasn\u2019t enough. Thus, Xie Xi aimed at Teacher Sun who had cancer.</p><br/><p>The cancer was deal and there weren\u2019t any mistakes with the diagnosis. It was impossible to cure it with the world\u2019s current medical society but it was possible for Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>In the world of the collapsed god, many drugs could cure this disease.</p><br/><p>In addition, there were the pills in the magical world of the mountains and seas that could let humans be reborn.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi now felt the benefits of the god\u2019s wisdom. As long as he had enough experience, this was simply a giant cheat!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare delay the time. In the middle of the night, he sneaked into Teacher Sun\u2019s hospital and gave him injections. This medicine should be injected three times in a row.</p><br/><p>He went back and forth three times. He didn\u2019t expect that the last time, Teacher Sun would wake up and see him depart.</p><br/><p>Of course, this was nothing. Teacher Sun\u2019s recovery was already amazing. No one would believe in the matter of the boy with cat ears. Even Teacher Sun felt he was dreaming.</p><br/><p>However, it was different when reaching Jiang Xie\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong was still talking about Teacher Sun\u2019s luck when Jiang Xie suddenly stood up.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong was startled. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie picked up his bag. \u201cI am a bit uncomfortable and will go back first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong asked, \u201cWhere is it uncomfortable? Do you need to go to the hospital? I will accompany you.\u201d He knew that Jiang Xie was living on his own and the downside was that nobody would care for him when he was sick.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie shook his head. \u201cIt isn\u2019t serious. I didn\u2019t sleep well last night and will go back to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong understood. It turned out this person was being lazy. Kang Hong spoke sourly, \u201cYour brain is really a foul. You can skip class and still test first.\u201d Jiang Xie used to \u2018take time off\u2019 occasionally. The teacher treated good students well. As long as the results were reliable, they didn\u2019t care if the students weren\u2019t in the classroom.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie grabbed his bag and headed home without looking back.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi lay in the bed and felt a bit shaken\u2026</p><br/><p>He could feel that Jiang Xie was angry. The reason for the anger\u2026 Xie Xi guessed it as well.</p><br/><p>A person who rarely became angry was really scary when becoming angry. Xie Xi\u2019s cat ears drooped as he thought about how to coax this person.</p><br/><p>Back home, Xie Xi jumped out of the bag and stared at Jiang Xie. Xie Xi told him, \u201cHey, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Meow meow.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie opened the laptop and carried him to the keyboard.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie questioned, \u201cDid you do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi typed out, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie raised his eyebrows and his eyes became bright red and blue. \u201cI told you not to casually use that ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stayed still.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s voice was cold. \u201cI said that it was a secret between the two of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi typed out, \u201cHe didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe saw it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be a needle\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The caw paws made an error and typed the wrong word, turning the word into needle.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie watched the kitten scrambling to delete the word and his heart suddenly filled with chagrin. He felt sad and remorse. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was held in Jiang Xie\u2019s arms and felt the shaking of his body.</p><br/><p>An indescribable sourness reached the tip of his nose and Xie Xi licked this person with his tongue. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie felt more ashamed after hearing the cat\u2019s cries. \u201cI know you are doing it for me but I was so fierce. It\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew what this person was thinking and why he was angry but still felt pained.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie closed his eyes and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t put yourself in danger and don\u2019t risk yourself for anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had felt cold to his bones the moment he heard Kang Hong\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Someone had seen Little Rose, someone knew Little Rose\u2019s secret, Little Rose was in danger.</p><br/><p>It rushed towards him like a cold tide.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi licked Jiang Xie\u2019s cheeks. Jiang Xie had calmed down a bit and he whispered, \u201cIs it very selfish?\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t care about Teacher Sun\u2019s life at all. He only thought about how Little Rose was in danger.</p><br/><p>Compared to the whole world, he only hoped that nothing would happen to the person in front of him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t speak and could only lick this person again. Jiang Xie kissed the furry little head and repeated, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi rubbed against his neck and said, \u201cIt will be okay.\u201d There was no danger.</p><br/><p>Once Jiang Xie calmed down, Xie Xi jumped down and typed on the laptop, \u201cBelieve me, I won\u2019t leave you. I never will.\u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence poked hard at Jiang Xie\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>The teenager had lost most things in his life and he most feared losing Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>The promise that Xie Xi gave him was the most powerful centering agent.</p><br/><p>He might\u2019ve accidentally exposed some of his back but it was true that Teacher Sun was cured.</p><br/><p>Previously, Kang Hong escaped from death and Teacher Sun \u2018came back to life.\u2019 This broke the name of \u2018ghost eyes.\u2019</p><br/><p>Some people might be afraid to stay close to Jiang Xie but the teachers no longer avoided him. They weren\u2019t very close but they treated Jiang Xie well enough as a student.</p><br/><p>Teacher Sun wasn\u2019t one of Jiang Xie\u2019s teachers but every time he saw Jiang Xie, he would say hello warmly.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie greeted him back.</p><br/><p>The fire of rumours wasn\u2019t something that could be extinguished in a day or two but as long as there were good signs, it would get better.</p><br/><p>By the time winter arrived, Jiang Xie was already living a normal high school life and didn\u2019t need to hide from people.</p><br/><p>During the Spring Festival, Kang Hong invited Jiang Xie to his home but Jiang Xie definitely wouldn\u2019t go. Kang Hong\u2019s mother was allergic to cat hair and it was impossible to bring Xie Xi. Jiang Xie would stay him with Xie Xi on this day.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong stared at the kitten, also reluctant to go home. \u201cThen I will send you dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had already bought the ingredients and shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll cook myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie said this but Kang Hong still insisted on sending three dishes. In addition, Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t paying attention so he picked up Xie Xi and turned three laps.</p><br/><p>By the time Jiang Xie realized, Kang Hong put the kitten down and ran away like a thief afraid of Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shouted, \u201cGrow up!\u201d</p><br/><p>He scolded the thief and the vinegar bag, killing two birds with one stone.</p><br/><p>During the Lantern Festival, Jiang Xie went out with Xie Xi to see the lights.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi often went out at night, especially in winter. After all, it was cold and Xie Xi wore a hat to cover the cat ears. Then he wore a thick, long jacket to cover the tail and look like a normal young boy.</p><br/><p>They watched the colourful lights and in a corner where no one could see, Xie Xi locked fingers with Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie felt like he was electrocuted and immediately grabbed back.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled and interlaced their fingers together.</p><br/><p>At this time, fireworks appeared in the air. The splendid brilliance made people couldn\u2019t help wanting to make wishes.</p><br/><p>I want to be with him forever and ever, longer than the twinkling stars.</p><br/><p>The school year started and it was the last year of high school. Jiang Xie had completely washed away the name of \u2018ghost eyes\u2019. After all, many people spoke to him and not only did they not encounter any misfortunes, some had their academic performances improved.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was the school learning tyrant effect. Jiang Xie had an excellent brain and his problem solving ideas were simpler and clearer than the teachers. He was particularly powerful.</p><br/><p>This was Xie Xi\u2019s favourite person. Seeing the teenager go from gloomy to clear made Xie Xi happier than anyone.</p><br/><p>Until\u2026</p><br/><p>White Day, where Jiang Xie received more than 20 love letters.</p><br/><p>Um\u2026 being too clear wasn\u2019t good!</p><br/><p>High school was like this. They basically couldn\u2019t confess on Valentine\u2019s Day because it was a holiday. Of course, there were still many couples who went on trips and sneaked around for a meeting.</p><br/><p>They missed Valentine\u2019s Day so White Day was especially important!</p><br/><p>In the past, Jiang Xie was an existence everyone wanted to avoid. There might be girls who liked his appearance but they didn\u2019t have the guts to confess.</p><br/><p>Now the curse was already in the past and there were no disasters near Jiang Xie. They wouldn\u2019t be worthy of youth if they didn\u2019t confess to such a handsome schoolmaster!</p><br/><p>Thus, his desk was stuffed with love letters.</p><br/><p>The desk hole was Xie Xi\u2019s nest. He was busy at night and tended to sleep here during the day. As a result, he arrived and found a pile of pink with a variety of scents.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi almost choked.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw it and took advantage of when no one was paying attention to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s inside?\u201d</p><br/><p>The kitten used strength and kicked out everything in the way.</p><br/><p>The envelopes fell on Jiang Xie\u2019s leg and he understood. How could he care about these things? He quickly bowed his head to see the kitten.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned and waved his tail at this person.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned and hurriedly spoke, \u201cI won\u2019t accept them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi meowed, \u201cFlirt!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

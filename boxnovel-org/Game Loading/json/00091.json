Her acting skills were so lame that Xie Xi had seen through them early on.</p><br/><p>Confusion, shock, being overwhelmed, Xie Xi didn\u2019t know how many times he had made these expressions. He saw other people acting and felt slightly embarrassed for them.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very clear that once the four people lacking limbs appeared on the high platform in a good condition, it would definitely raise suspicions on the other side.</p><br/><p>Skills couldn\u2019t be used in this world but only a skill could cause players to \u2018grow\u2019 arms and legs in such a short amount of time.</p><br/><p>Everyone had no skills while one person could use a skill. Then this person must be using the privilege from opening the game field.</p><br/><p>This privilege could be inherited by killing the person.</p><br/><p>This was what Yun Die thought.</p><br/><p>Yun Die didn\u2019t know if it was Xie Xi or Jiang Xie who saved the other people but the announcement when the game field opened said that two people had privileges!</p><br/><p>Yun Die attacked Xie Xi because she was looking for a soft persimmon. Unfortunately, this \u2018persimmon\u2019 wasn\u2019t soft but was very fierce!!</p><br/><p>It was obvious which was faster between a knife or a pistol.</p><br/><p>Yun Die was frightened. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill me. My brother is an elder of Yunge. He won\u2019t let you go if you kill me!\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know that her words meant she had to die.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was against killing but since he came to the Central World, he would definitely have to experience this type of thing.</p><br/><p>He gave Yun Die a chance. If she just left then Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t do anything.</p><br/><p>However, Yun Die was greedy and didn\u2019t hesitate to kill people for the privilege. This stupid and cruel person couldn\u2019t stay alive.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t say a word. He only hesitated for a few seconds before pulling the trigger. There was a bang and the bullet fired.</p><br/><p>The close distance meant there was no need to aim at all. Yun Die lowered her head and looked at the blood coming from her chest. She couldn\u2019t believe it even as she died. \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The people in her car froze for a moment before reacting, \u201cHow dare you attack Yunge\u2019s big lady! You are looking for death!\u201d</p><br/><p>They rushed up and Jiang Xie pulled Xie Xi behind him,. Zhu Li and the others quickly responded.</p><br/><p>The two groups collided while Jiang Xie pulled Xie Xi to the side.</p><br/><p>The gun in Xie Xi\u2019s hand had long since fallen and his hands were shaking uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>He told himself that he had to kill Yun Die. Her bad personality meant she would be more troublesome in the future. She couldn\u2019t survive if she was really someone from Yunge. Yunge was so powerful that once she returned to Central, she would use the power of Yunge and cause endless consequences. This meant offend Yunge but as long as it was handled properly, no one would know who did it for a while\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Jiang Xie was very distressed as he held the trembling hands. \u201cYou did a good job, don\u2019t worry. She can\u2019t be an important member even if she is part of Yunge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had also thought of those. Those who entered the Central Government were abandoned by their original world and had no family bonds as well. Everyone who went to the Central Government also lost their ability to reproduce so there was no blood kin\u2026</p><br/><p>The so-called big miss was just a woman who borrowed Yunge\u2019s name in this low-level world.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re right.\u201d Jiang Xie kept comforting him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi froze as he realized he had accidentally spoken the words in his heart. Then he found himself in Jiang Xie\u2019s arms as Jiang Xie whispered to him like he was a child.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart was pained and he kissed Xie Xi on the forehead. \u201cIf I had known, I would\u2019ve\u2026\u201d helped him kill the woman. Xie Xi might have to grow but there was no rush. There would be plenty of opportunities in the future.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pushed him away while stuttering, \u201cM-Master!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s arms felt empty.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi cried out loudly, \u201cPlease behave!\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was too loud and the group of four who had ended the battle were confused. \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled and blocked their view so they couldn\u2019t see the red-faced child. Xie Xi was embarrassed to death and wanted to find a place to dig into.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie came looking for death. \u201cThis is returning politeness with politeness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi kissed him on the ear and he kissed Xie Xi on the forehead, it was really returning politeness with politeness.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was furious. If he hadn\u2019t dropped the gun to the ground then he would\u2019ve\u2026 surely\u2026 um\u2026 at least cut off one of his arms!</p><br/><p>There was an announcement. \u201cThe treasure trove is about to clear. Please collect the treasure as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t care since he already received the best treasure under the sky. He had no interest in anything else.</p><br/><p>The group of four were eager but their bosses were busy and they were too embarrassed to interrupt.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi found a reason to get up and said, \u201cHurry and get the rewards. It will be a pity to miss it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie listened and found that Xie Xi didn\u2019t leave out even a single punctuation mark.</p><br/><p>Everyone got on the car and it drove to the treasure trove.</p><br/><p>It sounded creepy to receive the favour of the zombie princess but this was still a serious treasure trove. There were no horror elements. It was just a relatively bright room with a golden treasure chest in the centre. It was easy to tell that something good was hidden inside.</p><br/><p>Cao Yan spoke up, \u201cI can\u2019t do it. I have very bad hands and can\u2019t open the box!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other people shook their heads and spoke together, \u201cBoss, you go. We are happy no matter what comes up!\u201d</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t empty flattery. They could regain their limbs and pass the project after meeting Xie Xi. For them, this was already the biggest fortune. They didn\u2019t dare think too much.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie mentioned, \u201cIf I open this box, I might get the zombie princess.\u201d</p><br/><p>The four half zombies looked surprised.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stepped forward while thinking curiously, \u2018Should I really let Jiang Xie open it to see what he will get?\u2019</p><br/><p>Forget it, he always felt his left eye twitching and it was safer to do this thing himself.</p><br/><p>In fact, the \u2018zombie princess\u2019 actually happened before. At the time, Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t convinced about his bad luck and had to open the treasure chest. As a result, he didn\u2019t gain anything and opened a big boss. This boss tied up Yan Zhe to bring him back as a wife and they finally beat him to death.</p><br/><p>From then on, even if Jiang Xie didn\u2019t give up, Yan Zhe would never let him touch the treasure chest. This old comrade\u2019s bad luck was too great and opening the treasure chests would be left to them!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gently lifted the lid and opened the box.</p><br/><p>There was a golden light and people didn\u2019t have to get close to know there was definitely something good!</p><br/><p>The four half zombies were excited. They were already satisfied but it would be icing on the cake if they received something else.</p><br/><p>There was an announcement. \u201cCongratulations, you got a kiss from the zombie princess and each player can choose to open one disabled skill.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people present were stunned by the words.</p><br/><p>Zhu Li yelled, \u201cThis reward is absolutely great!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cao Yan\u2019s spirit returned. \u201cBoss, your hand is going against the sky!\u201d</p><br/><p>The skinniest Zhuo Liu flopped to his knees. \u201cEmperor of luck, please let this unlucky person worship you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuang Yi was the craziest. \u201cI can finally become a woman again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really didn\u2019t want to know what skills this guy had!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was still in honey mode and wasn\u2019t very careful. \u201cShake my hand and give me some good luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glared as the thief\u2019s hand touched him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was shameless. \u201cDon\u2019t be so stingy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned his head to look away but his red ears exposed his mood. Jiang Xie\u2019s heart was tickled but he didn\u2019t dare provoke Xie Xi. He just felt like a cat was scratching at his heart.</p><br/><p>This reward was really great. They could open a skill in a world where everyone\u2019s skills were disabled. They might be low in level and their skills were ordinary but it was like the difference between the earth and the sky!</p><br/><p>The group of four started to seriously consider which skill to open.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had nothing to think about. He only had a total of two skills and the one to summon X couldn\u2019t be used. He already wanted to kill X. Why would he summon another damn body?!</p><br/><p>The only thing that remained was the passive ability to randomly take away one thing from this world. He didn\u2019t think there was anything worth taking in this world but Xie Xi still chose it.</p><br/><p>In fact, the biggest benefit to Xie Xi wasn\u2019t opening a skill but rationalizing his Repair skill.</p><br/><p>The four half zombies having skills meant people would no longer suspect that Xie Xi\u2019s Repair skill was a privilege. This meant a lot of trouble would be avoided.</p><br/><p>The group of four might be tigers when attacking the zombies but they were actually very smart.</p><br/><p>Zhu Li declared, \u201cI will choose the explosion technique.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cao Yan said, \u201cMine is breathing fire.\u201d Then he opened his mouth and breathed out fire.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Liu was low-key in comparison. \u201cSuspension.\u201d He floated upwards but unfortunately, the height was a bit low.</p><br/><p>Zhuang Yi really lived up to expectations. \u201cTransformation.\u201d The Chinese man became a beauty with red lips.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to vomit but Xie Xi also felt their hearts.</p><br/><p>They deliberately chose skills that were more eye-catching and would use the skills immediately after leaving the game. Their only purpose for doing this was to help Xie Xi cover up the privilege.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s Repair, anyone who saw it would consider it a privilege. As long as they used their skills, there would be confusion and no one would stare at Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Everyone had chosen while only Jiang Xie was still hesitating. Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to talk to him but couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cHave you chosen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie hadn\u2019t chosen. He hesitated for a while as he stared at the goodwill skill.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Was it that difficult to choose a skill?</p><br/><p>Of course, Jiang Xie wouldn\u2019t expose the matter of the goodwill value. He calmly replied, \u201cI have too many skills and don\u2019t know which one to choose.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

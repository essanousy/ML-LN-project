The green progress bar could actually change back!</p><br/><p>After all, the fifth prince and second prince\u2019s bars were locked and never changed. Thus, he decided that the second prince was safe after turning green.</p><br/><p>Who would\u2019ve expected the second prince to not take the usual path and actually take back the love he had given!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare let the third prince hold him and struggled. \u201cYour Highness, please put me down!\u201d His voice was full of helplessness.</p><br/><p>The third prince smiled. \u201cRest assured, I\u2019m not tired. I can easily carry your small physique.\u201d</p><br/><p>Who cared if he was tired?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned and said, \u201cI worked the night shift last night and slept the whole day. I might be a bit hungry but I can walk.\u201d In particular, he had a fish tail and could swim in the water!</p><br/><p>He said this for the second prince to hear. The translation: There is nothing between the third prince and I. The third prince just came over. Please don\u2019t think too much!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was full of sorrow. Why did he have to explain to a man that the relationship between him and another man was innocent? Why did he have to prove to a man that he wasn\u2019t messing around with another man?</p><br/><p>Once he got to the bottom of it, he had to blame X.</p><br/><p>If X hadn\u2019t designed such a stupid world and made such an idiotic mission, Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t be so unlucky!</p><br/><p>In a certain quasi-world, Qin Ge glanced at Jiang Xie. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie cocked his head as he stabbed a demon dressed as a sugar gourd in front of him. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ge saw the \u2018public enemy of the world\u2019 that had fallen to the ground and remembered Yan Zhe\u2019s words. Doing a task with Old Jiang was no fun at all.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t see the degree of goodwill when he was summoned as a puppet. Now that he was in a quasi-world, he saw the -1-1-1-1\u2026</p><br/><p>Old Jiang was worried. Why was it raining red again? Which soul wanted to die?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s explanation worked. The 16.1% progress rose slightly and reached 16.2%.</p><br/><p>The third prince reluctantly put him down. \u201cDon\u2019t blame me for not catching you when you faint.\u201d</p><br/><p>Who would faint, you big-headed bastard!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at the purple progress bar and gritted his teeth. \u201cYour Highness, I won\u2019t go out to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince raised his eyebrows. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t look at the second prince but spoke for him. \u201cIt is too wasteful to go out and eat. I can do it myself and eat simply.\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought that these words would cause the third prince\u2019s red progress to plummet. Who would\u2019ve expected the third prince to be very interested? \u201cYou can cook?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi believed in the saying: To grab a man\u2019s heart, you must first grab his stomach.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe restaurant in the guard\u2019s quarters has nothing to eat after dinner. I often work night shifts and will cook for myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cWhat do you cook? I also want to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spat out in his heart, \u2018I am dizzy from hunger yet you want me to serve you?\u2019</p><br/><p>The third prince finally remembered. \u201cDo it next time. You are too hungry so we will go out to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought of the second prince and didn\u2019t dare go with this person. \u201cI\u2019m not that hungry. I still have a crescent fruit in my house and will be fine after eating a piece.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince was really interested in Xie Xi\u2019s cooking and asked, \u201cCan you really cook?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi realized he couldn\u2019t get rid of this big candy. \u201cYour Highness, if you don\u2019t hate it then stay and eat together.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince exclaimed, \u201cYou are really amazing. You can actually cook.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was impossible to walk away. Looking at this, Xie Xi was afraid he would have to cook for the rest of his life.</p><br/><p>The second prince listened quietly. His heart was poked as he thought about the previous dream.</p><br/><p>It turned out that Colin really could cook\u2026</p><br/><p>Colin was with him in the dream. They had mutual feelings and Colin even chose him over Third Brother.</p><br/><p>But in reality\u2026</p><br/><p>The second prince frowned and wanted to leave.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw the progress bar had fallen to 15.9% and felt anxious. Be more patient and don\u2019t arbitrarily take back the things given!</p><br/><p>He glanced at the second prince and politely wondered, \u201cYour Highness, have you eaten yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>The second prince was stunned.</p><br/><p>The third prince instantly opened his mouth. \u201cSecond Brother must\u2019ve eaten already.\u201d</p><br/><p>The second prince replied quickly, \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s actions were very reasonable. He was just a small guard and the second prince was standing in front of him. He invited one prince and naturally had to invite the other. He pretended to be polite, \u201cI can\u2019t cook much and this might be offensive, but I still have to ask. Do you want to try them?\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince said, \u201cSecond Brother naturally\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The second prince\u2019s lips rose and he finally showed his usual smiling appearance. \u201cOkay, Third Brother is looking forward to it and I\u2019m also very curious.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cThen please wait a moment. I will go prepare.\u201d</p><br/><p>He left and could immediately hear the two brothers quarrelling.</p><br/><p>The third prince\u2019s voice was full of anger. \u201cWhat are you staying here for?\u201d</p><br/><p>The second prince\u2019s careless tone was restored. \u201cYou can stay so why can\u2019t I?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cColin is cooking for me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The second prince had a \u2018hehe\u2019 expression. \u201cHe also invited me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince didn\u2019t have a good atmosphere. \u201cYou are a prince. How can he be rude?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are also a prince. Little Colin was forced by you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince\u2019s hackles were raised and the second prince didn\u2019t back down.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s face was dark and he wanted to die.</p><br/><p>Hey\u2026 maybe he should die? He had two more lives with Roast Pork Bun and there was the effect of fatal wounds being painless. It wouldn\u2019t matter if he actually died.</p><br/><p>If the second face died, wouldn\u2019t the progress of the second and third princes be locked?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi quickly dismissed this idea. He didn\u2019t forget that the Haiqui Kingdom had a national teacher who could resurrect the dead.</p><br/><p>Who knew what was going on with the national teacher. What if it wasn\u2019t a big trick?</p><br/><p>The fifth prince and sixth prince were already dispatched. If the god of war third prince and the god of wealth second prince were added, the Haiqui state teacher wouldn\u2019t be able to run, even if he had 18 tails.</p><br/><p>Then the fifth and sixth would resurrect Sein Hall while the second and third would resurrect Colin Hall\u2026</p><br/><p>This image was so terrible that Xie Xi started sweating thinking about it! He couldn\u2019t die. Death was the real hell mode.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t look at the currently stupid second and third princes. If they really \u2018lost love\u2019, who knew what psychopaths they would evolve into?</p><br/><p>The food at the bottom of the sea wasn\u2019t very creative. Xie Xi made simple things and placed them on the table.</p><br/><p>The third prince was exaggerated in his surprise. \u201cColin, you really can cook!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned his eyes away. \u2018You underwater people, this isn\u2019t cooking. It is simply cutting things!\u2019</p><br/><p>The second prince added, \u201cYour knife skills are great.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince was worthy of being a soldier. He acted quickly and grabbed three dishes first.</p><br/><p>The second prince\u2019s mouth twitched as he glanced at this rascal.</p><br/><p>For the progress of the task, Xie Xi had to say, \u201cThere is a lot of food. Your Highness, you can\u2019t eat it all alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince replied, \u201cDon\u2019t you know my appetite yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two prince said, \u201cYes, you can\u2019t eat it alone. Colin is hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that I was going to eat it all. Of course, I will share it with Colin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told the second prince, \u201cYour Highness, you should also\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince picked up a piece of sashimi and placed it on the second prince\u2019s plate. \u201cTry it and leave afterwards.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was telling his brother to get lost.</p><br/><p>The second prince wasn\u2019t ashamed about interfering and was very tolerant. \u201cLittle Colin is the master here. Is it appropriate for you to act like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince said, \u201cColin and I aren\u2019t that distant.\u201d</p><br/><p>The second prince raised his eyebrows. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw the shaky progress bar and could only say, \u201cThis subordinate didn\u2019t arrange it properly. There are too few dishes. Please wait and I will cook some more.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince heard this and immediately exclaimed, \u201cDon\u2019t go. There is enough for all of us to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Your Highness, please eat. I will cook some more.\u201d</p><br/><p>The second prince sneered at his brother.</p><br/><p>The third prince pushed the three dishes away. \u201cEat it. Second Brother is really capable. You don\u2019t even let go of a small bodyguard.\u201d</p><br/><p>The second prince was unmoved. \u201cI\u2019m not as good as Third Brother, who wasn\u2019t taught etiquette when being raised.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He really wanted to sweep them out of here but he couldn\u2019t afford it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had never eaten such a tiring dinner. Move a bit close to the third prince and the purple progress bar of the second prince would fall. Be slightly friendly to the second prince and the third prince would raise his eyebrows with a murderous atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t move to the left or right and really wanted to die.</p><br/><p>He was now certain that the second prince was the vampire Aix-en and the third prince was the maid Gars. The only difference was that Colin Hall didn\u2019t confess to them.</p><br/><p>If Colin was entangled with the two of them as the last world\u2019s Sein, he could guarantee that they would either fight each other or kill him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t understand it. Why did people want to steer two boats?</p><br/><p>Weren\u2019t they afraid? Wasn\u2019t it okay to live well? Why did they want to be a slag man!</p><br/><p>Then he remembered that he was going to steer six boats.</p><br/><p>X, come out and die!</p><br/><p>At the end of the dinner, Xie Xi was more tired than when he hadn\u2019t eaten.</p><br/><p>The third prince\u2019s communicator rang and he had to leave. Xie Xi was relieved and eagerly rushed them out.</p><br/><p>The third prince also had to drag his brother away. \u201cThe meal is finished. Second Brother still isn\u2019t leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>The second prince told him, \u201cYou go first. I will help Colin clean up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince was determined not to give him and Xie Xi the opportunity to be alone. \u201cOkay, I was going to ask Father about the development of the 623 water cannon\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince jumped up. \u201cAsk what? That is just burning money. Don\u2019t even think about it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have already thought about it. I just need Father to agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he turned and left. The second prince knew that his brother was deliberately leading him away but he was afraid this madman might really do something\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted them to leave and hurriedly said, \u201cYour Highness can leave if you are busy. I can clean up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The second prince wasn\u2019t at ease and didn\u2019t dare stay him. He reluctantly said, \u201cTonight\u2019s dinner was excellent. Please invite me next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t dare refuse.</p><br/><p>He finally sent away this god and Xie Xi silently stared at the progress bar.</p><br/><p>The third prince\u2019s red progress bar was 16.63% and the second prince\u2019s bar was 16.62%.</p><br/><p>The two of them were really a problem!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was tired and needed a change. For the time being, he didn\u2019t want to see any princes. Thus, he changed his face to do the side mission.</p><br/><p>Compared to the princes, one million tons of garbage had become cute!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

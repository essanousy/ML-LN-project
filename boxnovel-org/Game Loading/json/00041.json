He just returned from the hot land to the warm water, only to see the sixth prince alive. He sighed with relief. This feedback was transmitted to Jiang Xie in the form of goodwill +1.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was uncomfortable. The sixth prince blocked a shot for Xie Xi and it was natural for goodwill to rise. Then why did it rise again after the file was read and they met?</p><br/><p>Clearly his little rose had good feelings but Old Jiang wasn\u2019t happy.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke the same words to the sixth prince and the sixth prince\u2019s reply was almost identical.</p><br/><p>This included the sentence after departure.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Call me Sirius.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes curved as he called out, \u201cSirius.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince whispered, \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve felt that my name is so good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt sounds good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d The green +3 stung his eyes. In other words, Old Jiang caused the goodwill to fall while his soul caused it to rise?</p><br/><p>Next, the sixth prince helped Xie Xi gain his legs. Jiang Xie already disliked this part the first time it happened and now he hated it even more. The sixth prince was his soul and his soul was part of him. Right now, he was feeling green towards himself.</p><br/><p>This authentic green, the green +1 was like the green grassland under the blue sky and white clouds.</p><br/><p>It was too much.</p><br/><p>This time, Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare delay with his legs. He actively held the sixth prince\u2019s arm and tried hard to walk. There would be danger once they went ashore. He must adapt to these two \u2018bamboo poles\u2019 as soon as possible!</p><br/><p>The sixth prince saw the thin sweat dripping from his nose and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be anxious. Take your time.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Xie Xi slow down? He resisted the discomfort and kept walking. \u201cI can\u2019t drag you back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The second prince asked, \u201cHow can that be? The fact that you accompanied me ashore, I already\u2026\u201d He paused and felt that this was too intimate to say.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood.</p><br/><p>They only met each other for a few days and the time spent together was even less, yet the sixth prince saved Xie Xi\u2019s life at a critical moment. This showed how much he valued Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t understand how a person who had seen a cold world, who suffered from the injustice of being excluded and who lived such a miserable life, could have such a gentle heart.</p><br/><p>The prince accepted Xie Xi\u2019s without knowing the sham and sacrificed his life.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very ashamed.</p><br/><p>This time, Xie Xi adapted well. Not only did he require less help, but he could also run on these legs.</p><br/><p>He drank the water retention agent and after landing, he resisted the dry heat and sultriness of the air. He couldn\u2019t let the sixth prince waste strength on giving him a water shield! The sixth prince had to recharge his batteries and do his best!</p><br/><p>The sixth prince asked in a worried manner, \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t good. He was very bad but he smiled and said, \u201cThe land is really different from the sea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you feel bad\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi screamed, \u201cBe careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was heard before the air broke apart. This gave the sixth prince enough reaction time. He reached out to protect Xie Xi and the two of them rolled together, dodging the bullet.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was beating quickly and his hands were shaking uncontrollably. Despite his many death experiences, his adrenaline was surging in this tense moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is danger on the shore. Let\u2019s go back to the boat first!\u201d Xie Xi hurriedly told the prince.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince was on guard and paying attention to the enemy\u2019s movements. \u201cGo!\u201d</p><br/><p>They moved as a dense hail of bullets were fired. Fortunately, Xie Xi had practiced moving on his legs or he would\u2019ve had to load the file again!</p><br/><p>The two people escaped from the bullets and finally returned to the boat. The boat was simple but it could withstand the pressure of the seabed. Thus, ordinary knives and guns couldn\u2019t harm it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled as he suddenly realized a problem he had ignored before.</p><br/><p>The undersea people lived under high pressure all year round. Their bodies were far superior to the land people and ordinary bullets couldn\u2019t pierce through their skin at all. The sixth prince was from the powerful royal family. How could the previous shot be fatal?</p><br/><p>So\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at the sixth prince and found he was looking solemn, the different coloured pupils much deeper than usual. They were filled with an unknown meaning.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi whispered, \u201cYour Highness, there is danger on the shore. Let\u2019s go back first!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince glanced at him. \u201cYou go back first. I have to find out who is behind the ambush.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince explained to him. \u201cThis attack isn\u2019t just about our lives or deaths. If this news is sent back to the bottom of the sea, it will lead to greater trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince hadn\u2019t publicized that he was going to the shore but he had registered it. He had just left. If he returned straight away, he was bound to be questioned. Even if the sixth prince managed to hide it, other people would be attacked if they went ashore.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had some vague conjectures. He couldn\u2019t explain it and could only ask, \u201cIf it is the land people who declared war on us\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince stared out the window. \u201cThen we will fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t expected the sixth prince to be so decisive and spoke again, \u201cIf it isn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I have to confirm the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned to Xie Xi. \u201cGo back and find a place to hide. No one knows that you went to the shore and it won\u2019t arouse suspicion.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was going to stay and find out what happened, but he didn\u2019t want Xie Xi involved.</p><br/><p>How could Xie Xi not understand? He exclaimed, \u201cI am a guard of the royal family. How can I leave Your Highness and escape alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince was stunned. His pupils shrank and an unprecedented indifference filled his voice. \u201cHow is the royal family worthy of your protection?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was unmoved. \u201cSirius is worth it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The words shocked the sixth prince. He stared at Xie Xi with unsettled eyes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t shy away. Forget the fact that he had several lives. He wouldn\u2019t leave the sixth prince, even if he had only one life.</p><br/><p>This man died for him once. Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t let him die a second time.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi might have no friends but this didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t understand brotherhood!</p><br/><p>The sixth prince sighed and handed a weapon to Xie Xi. \u201cStay close to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t used this before and didn\u2019t have time to open the talent system. He didn\u2019t have a gun specialization and could only pray that nothing happened.</p><br/><p>Still, he had Roast Pork Bun. He used Roast Pork Bun as his eyes.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun understood and flew out to explore the area. There were eyes that no one else could see, meaning Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t hold back the prince.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince was in front and Xie Xi behind him. The two men were focused and on guard.</p><br/><p>At almost the same time, gunshots were heard. Xie Xi followed the sixth prince and repeated the message that Roast Pork Bun brought back. \u201cThe firepower is concentrated to the left rear side.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he spoke, the sixth prince adjusted his position.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s chest was hot and he didn\u2019t forget to care for the prince in this emergency. He asked, \u201cAvoid it or\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince replied. \u201cI will create a route and we will rush through the route.\u201d Xie Xi tightened his grip on his gun, his hands all sweaty.</p><br/><p>After all, he had no experience and couldn\u2019t be calm in such a situation.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince told him, \u201cConcentrate on covering me. I will open my five senses so they can\u2019t run away.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the enduring essence of the Atlantis royal family. They had different physiques from ordinary people and unique abilities. Once activated, their combat power was amazing.</p><br/><p>It was said that the third prince activated his ability during the North-South War. One man alone wiped out the entire army, giving him the name of Killing God.</p><br/><p>There was Roast Pork Bun to pass on information and the sixth prince\u2019s ability. They finally rushed through the coast and pulled out the person hiding in the darkness, aiming a gun at him.</p><br/><p>It was a short battle and the outcome emerged in a flash. Xie Xi thought it was over. They just needed to shoot and kill this person.</p><br/><p>The man gave a low laugh. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to lead a wolf into the room.\u201d</p><br/><p>The familiar voice made Xie Xi\u2019s heart jump.</p><br/><p>The man took off his mask, revealing an honest face.</p><br/><p>Thomas\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi expected that it was the underwater people attacking the sixth prince but he hadn\u2019t expected it to be his guard captain Thomas!</p><br/><p>The sixth prince was also stunned.</p><br/><p>Thomas was expressionless as he aimed his gun at the sixth prince. \u201cYour Highness, I can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cold words ended and he pulled the trigger.</p><br/><p>At such a critical moment, the sixth prince was motionless as he stared in front with wide eyes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t let him die again. He flew between the bullet and the prince, wanting to use himself as a shield.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the motionless prince saw that Xie Xi was planning to block the bullet for him and quickly hugged Xie Xi, turning to avoid the bullet.</p><br/><p>His movements were too fast, faster than a bullet!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s scalp was numb and his head was blank.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince asked him, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew the sixth prince\u2019s meaning. He was asking why Xie Xi saved him? Xie Xi barely managed to open his mouth, \u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t give up on yourself.\u201d Even if he was abandoned by his loved ones and the country, don\u2019t give up on himself.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince\u2019s pupils shrank. The colours were too deep and were close to black.</p><br/><p>He got up with a blank expression, killing Thomas and the others.</p><br/><p>At the end of the disaster, all those who died were the underwater people.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at the dead Thomas with complicated feelings.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince\u2019s voice was calm, \u201cIt is the royal secret service.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had long guessed it and he understood why the sixth prince had died the first time. Based on Sirius\u2019 abilities, he wasn\u2019t as strong as Gars but he could retreat from these people.</p><br/><p>The reason he didn\u2019t was because he was motivated to die.</p><br/><p>The moment Thomas and the others showed their faces, he understood.</p><br/><p>They were the royal special guards. No one could give them orders apart from the royal family.</p><br/><p>Who was in the royal family? His father, his brothers, his closest family.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince grew up alone and never received any love. He gave up on himself after learning that he was abandoned by everyone.</p><br/><p>By killing him, the underwater kingdom could go to war with the land people.</p><br/><p>This was the wish of his family and his family believed it was his only value.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart hurt and he couldn\u2019t help comforting the prince, \u201cMaybe it isn\u2019t what you think.\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside the water curtain.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie reached out and touched Xie Xi\u2019s white face.</p><br/><p>The souls were a part of him and occasionally mapped out some of his memories.</p><br/><p>He had experienced the same thing as the sixth prince. Unfortunately, there was no Xie Xi at the time and he was born a dead monster.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie looked away and gazed at his goodwill.</p><br/><p>The green +10 was particularly conspicuous.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned back on the chair, a wry smile on his face.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know if he was lucky or not.</p><br/><p>The base red colour was too large. Despite all the green floating up, the green still wasn\u2019t that much.</p><br/><p>The number was still -250.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, it was really sad.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They couldn\u2019t be more intimate.</p><br/><p>The third prince continued to transmit heat to him while asking in a worried manner, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Your Highness in a few days. How have you lost so much weight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t good at saying these things but sure enough, his attendant started to sing about how he was so haggard.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Gars, His Highness has thought about you day and night and couldn\u2019t sleep well. He has become haggard from thinking about you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mouth felt sour while the third prince was pained. \u201cHow can Your Highness not cherish yourself?</p><br/><p>Our wedding will soon arrive. There will be many ceremonies and you will have to give sacrificial offerings to your ancestors and pray for the people. How can you last?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought, \u2018You are the one making me think that I can\u2019t sleep!\u2019</p><br/><p>The attendant responded, \u201cYes, I also advised His Highness but he really can\u2019t sleep. I am so distressed that the best way was to ask you to see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Forget it, some people\u2019s heads were too broken to manage.</p><br/><p>The third prince sighed. \u201cYour Highness, promise me that you will eat well and sleep well.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, the attendant didn\u2019t help him speak. Xie Xi\u2019s mouth thinned as he realized the third prince wanted to hear him say it himself!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew how to make the dream perfect but\u2026 it was hard to talk!</p><br/><p>The third prince urged again, \u201cYour Highness?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at the red progress bar and gritted his teeth. \u201cI also want to eat and sleep but whenever I can\u2019t see you, I feel that the delicacies are tasteless and I can\u2019t sleep when lying in bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said it! He actually said it! Keep the goosebumps steady!</p><br/><p>The third prince was sweet in his heart but his mouth was still stiff. \u201cAfter a few days, Your Highness won\u2019t have such a hard time.</p><br/><p>Hard? No, who was the one having a hard time?</p><br/><p>The attendant came forward to push the plot again, \u201cMr. Gars, it is better for you to stay for a while, so that His Highness can have a good meal and get so sleep. If he continues like this, his body really won\u2019t hold on.\u201d After he finished speaking, he wiped at his tears. It was really realistic.</p><br/><p>The third prince naturally replied,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t appropriate. If anyone else knows, it will dishonour the reputation of His Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>What damn reputation? The only prince of the kingdom was already going to marry him.</p><br/><p>Forget it, this was his dream and Xie Xi could only cooperate with the show. Xie Xi looked up at the prince with eager eyes.</p><br/><p>The third prince was stunned and his eyes heated up, as if he wanted to eat the person in his arms.</p><br/><p>The attendant perfectly conveyed his heart. \u201cMr. Gars, don\u2019t be so rigid. Is there anything in the world more important than His Highness\u2019 body? In a few days, you will be sheltered by the gods and supported by the people. Who cares about these few days before marriage?\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince was still hesitating.</p><br/><p>The attendant said again, \u201cHow can the beloved prince be wronged by a valiant man like you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was going to die from laughter. What was this? The third prince was crazy enough to block himself!</p><br/><p>His body trembled slightly as he suppressed his laughter and the third prince naturally felt it. Thus, his \u2018thoughts\u2019 passed onto the attendant.</p><br/><p>The attendant immediately shouted, \u201cMr. Gars! You see, His Highness is shivering from hunger. If you stick to etiquette, His Highness will faint from hunger!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201cPfft!\u201d Who could bear it anymore?!</p><br/><p>The attendant had the ability to turn everything into a way for the third prince to step over obstacles. \u201cListen! His Highness is crying from sadness!\u201d</p><br/><p>Forget it, who was crying!</p><br/><p>The third prince finally softened and he quickly said, \u201cI\u2019m stupid.I only thought about your reputation and ignored your body!\u201d</p><br/><p>The attendant hurriedly said, \u201cMr. Gars, His Highness can\u2019t stand. Carry him into the house while I will prepare a delicious dinner!\u201d He was a slave selling his master!\u201d The third prince whispered, \u201cYour Highness, I am being rude.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he picked up Xie Xi in a side carry.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He buried his face in the third prince\u2019s chest to hide his uncontrollable mouth. The third prince naturally misunderstood it as\u2026</p><br/><p>The attendant sighed, \u201cMr. Gars, you should\u2019ve done this earlier. Then His Highness wouldn\u2019t have cried so bitterly.</p><br/><p>The third prince felt very guilty. \u201cIt is my fault. I\u2019m too old-fashioned.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi almost laughed out loud. He was really old-fashioned! This dream was full of \u2018old-fashioned\u2019 flavour!</p><br/><p>The third prince decided that he was sobbing and gently patted Xie Xi on the back, not wanting him to feel any more pain.</p><br/><p>Once they entered the house, Xie Xi needed cold water to calm down his facial expression. He bowed his head and said, \u201cI have to go get myself under control.\u201d</p><br/><p>He \u2018cried\u2019 for so long that it wasn\u2019t good to eat in this state.</p><br/><p>The attendant immediately said, \u201cYour Highness, I have the hot water ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hot water? No, Xie Xi needed cold water to cool down. His face was red from laughing!</p><br/><p>By the time Xie Xi finished and came out again, the table had been set up with food.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at it and sure enough, the table was full of seafood. The third prince was an underwater person and didn\u2019t understand the food of the land people. Therefore, these aspects were all based on underwater standards.</p><br/><p>The thing that made Xie Xi feel warm was that the third prince remembered what he loved to eat. There were big crabs, lobster, salmon and a plate full of crescent fruit\u2026</p><br/><p>The attendant was particularly interested. His back was straight as he watched the third prince carefully deal with the hard shells of the seafood for Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was really hungry and ate seriously.</p><br/><p>The third prince was very happy in his heart while his mouth said, \u201cYou have to eat well, even if I\u2019m not with you. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought, \u2018If you weren\u2019t here, I might\u2019ve eaten more comfortably.\u2019 However, his mouth said, \u201cI\u2019ll try my best.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince was satisfied.</p><br/><p>After eating, the third prince took Xie Xi to digest his food and then coaxed him to sleep.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could only try to get some sleep in the dream.</p><br/><p>Due to the third prince\u2019s politeness, once Xie Xi went to bed, the prince pulled the curtains and sat down beside the bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, rest assured, I am here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about it and understood what line to say. \u201cWill you leave after I fall asleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince didn\u2019t make any noise, which was counted as an agreement! Of course he had to go! How could a man stay overnight?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi requested, \u201cCan\u2019t you stay the night?\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince told him, \u201cYour Highness, go to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t sleep at all!</p><br/><p>The attendant came again. \u201cMr. Gars, you might as well hold His Highness\u2019 hand. If he feels that you are here, he will surely sleep with peace of mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d There was still this trick!</p><br/><p>The third prince hesitated. \u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took the initiative to extend his hand. The third prince instantly held it and said, \u201cOutside is cold.\u201d Then he placed Xie Xi\u2019s hand in his under the covers.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned a blind eye. \u2018Okay, this is your style.\u2019</p><br/><p>However, Xie Xi still underestimated the \u2018inconsistent\u2019 third prince.</p><br/><p>After a while, the attendant hurriedly ran inside. \u201cIt\u2019s bad! Your future mother-in-law is coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>What? Mother-in-law?</p><br/><p>The attendant added, \u201cMr. Gars, you must not let her see you! If she sees you, she will surely reprimand His Highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>For a moment, Xie Xi didn\u2019t understand what path this was taking.</p><br/><p>The third prince was anxious. \u201cI\u2019ll leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The attendant immediately said, \u201cIt\u2019s too late. She is coming now. She will definitely see you while you are leaving!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u2018Aren\u2019t we engaged? How can it still be like sneaking around? There were too many things in the royal family!\u2019</p><br/><p>The third prince cried out, \u201cHow can it be like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The attendant was a bit clever. \u201cMr. Gars, hide in the bed first! Once Mother-in-law comes in, I will tell her that His Highness is sleeping. She will at most open the curtain to take a look and won\u2019t pull off the blanket.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew this road! You really have many ideas, Little Gars!</p><br/><p>The third prince froze while his voice was very tight. \u201cThis isn\u2019t polite\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will be even more difficult if Mother-in-law sees you in His Highness\u2019 room. What if she reports it to His Majesty and the engagement is cancelled?\u201d</p><br/><p>The attendant didn\u2019t forget to add, \u201cHis Highness knows what type of person you are but outsiders will definitely misunderstand you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi laughed. \u2018There is no need to explain but there is already an explanation to cover up.\u2019</p><br/><p>The third prince was persuaded. He raised the blanket and looked at Xie Xi. \u201cYour Highness, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What could Xie Xi do? He had to accompany the prince in the dream by saying, \u201cHurry up. Mother is coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was an invitation so the third prince helplessly got into bed next to Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t care about sleeping with him in the bed. They were both men and sleeping together didn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>At this moment, there was no waiter to deliver the steps and the third prince could only stay, \u201cI will hug you to prevent any accidents.\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, it was two people in a bed. They had to gather together to look like one person.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded and entered a hot embrace as the other person clung tightly to him.</p><br/><p>There was the sound of the door opening and then a conversation between the attendant and an old woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother-in-law, His Highness hasn\u2019t slept well these days and is very tired. He just lay down and went to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mother-in-law said, \u201cHis Highness is really infatuated. It is touching!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, His Highness is a perfect match with Mr. Gars.\u201d</p><br/><p>Boasting and more boasting.</p><br/><p>\u2026It was a lot of boasting.</p><br/><p>The mother-in-law said, \u201cI heard that Mr. Gars was born handsome and has the strength of the sky. His personality is also very good!\u201d</p><br/><p>The attendant continuing with the boasting, \u201cYes, he is sincere towards His Highness and fought the dragon, regardless of life or death. After the dragon dropped His Highness, he caught His Highness and they tumbled to the ground. His Highness was unscathed while his arms were bloodied.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mother-in-law blew another wave of boasting, \u201cMr. Gars is a rare hero in the world. He is the only one worthy of our honourable prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people sung the same tune and Xie Xi almost laughed to death. He thought about how this world was written by Gars and couldn\u2019t help shaking gently as he choked on his laughter.</p><br/><p>The mother-in-law left and Xie Xi moved. He thought that he could finally get rid of this hot octopus.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the third prince got out of the blanket and asked, \u201cYour Highness, do you have a fever?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d What fever?</p><br/><p>The attendant came over and opened the bed curtains. \u201cMother-in-law is gone!\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince frowned. \u201cYour Highness was shaking just now. Do you have a cold?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have a cold. He was just choking!</p><br/><p>The attendant was also nervous. \u201cThese days, His Highness hasn\u2019t been eating well and there was a cold wind blowing today. Is His Highness feverish?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them said this and Xie Xi was affected by their trick.</p><br/><p>He shrank back and actually felt cold.</p><br/><p>The third prince got back into bed, still acting old-fashioned. \u201cYour Highness, I\u2019ll test your forehead.\u201d As he spoke, his palm fell onto Xie Xi\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi blinked up at him.</p><br/><p>The third prince was relieved, \u201cGood, it isn\u2019t too hot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was also relieved. He thought he would have to experience the trace of illness in the dream.</p><br/><p>The attendant wondered, \u201cIs he just cold? Perhaps the temperature of the room isn\u2019t high enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew he hadn\u2019t been cold but now he really felt cold.</p><br/><p>The third prince said, \u201cPerhaps the cold wind has entered his body and made him a bit cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook and his teeth chattered.</p><br/><p>The third prince hurried to hold him and asked, \u201cIs it warmer like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi guessed his mind. \u201cYes, much better.\u201d</p><br/><p>The attendant opened his mouth. \u201cIn this weather, there is no fire basin in the house. The other bedding is drying outside. What to do\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought, \u2018This royal family is really poor. There isn\u2019t heating in the prince\u2019s bedroom and even the blankets are missing!\u2019</p><br/><p>The attendant continued, \u201cMr. Gars, what if the cold wind enters again after you leave? You should warm His Highness first while I watch outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince was very embarrassed. \u201cThis is the only way.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

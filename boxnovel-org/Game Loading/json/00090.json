He wondered, \u201cMaster, what are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tried to escape. Jiang Xie looked like he wasn\u2019t exerting any strength but his hands were as strong as handcuffs.</p><br/><p>What to do? Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t just suspicious and directly asked.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t believe they was master and apprentice. Then how should Xie Xi explain why they came to the open world together?</p><br/><p>It was obvious that under normal circumstances, Jiang Xie wouldn\u2019t come here. Now he had entered the open world.</p><br/><p>If they weren\u2019t master and apprentice, why come with Xie Xi?</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it\u2026\u201d Jiang Xie spoke slowly. \u201cWe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suddenly approached and touched him on the ear.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi broke free and his eyes trembled. \u201cDon\u2019t feel pain.\u201d</p><br/><p>The child kissed him, kissed him on the ear\u2026</p><br/><p>It was almost like a light skim but it was indeed a kiss.</p><br/><p>By the time Jiang Xie recovered, Xie Xi had run back to the other four. Jiang Xie wanted to ask but he couldn\u2019t open his mouth.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t care that there were other people but Xie Xi was shy. What if Xie Xi turned around and angrily ignored him?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw the -365 goodwill and held back!</p><br/><p>After doing something crazy, Xie Xi felt it was highly likely he was infected by this group of psychos.</p><br/><p>Even if he couldn\u2019t find an excuse, even if he was afraid that Jiang Xie would think too much, going such a thing\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also couldn\u2019t hide forever. Once the game ended, what should he do if Jiang Xie asked him again?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s head was a mess.</p><br/><p>Cao Yan called out to him, \u201cBoss, are chicken wings really impossible?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him. \u201cWhy do you want chicken wings? Do you want to be a one-winged angel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cao Yan explained, \u201cIf I have a large wing then I can slap away all the monsters!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was speechless. \u2018With this wing, you are the biggest monster!\u2019</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Zhu Li gave up on the chicken legs. He lamented, \u201cI will have to jump around on this leg and it will be too tiring.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just tiring? It wasn\u2019t because it was ugly and crazy?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was coming over when an announcement was heard. \u201cThank you for killing the annoying big chicken. The last round is a competition mode. The track leading to the treasure can only accommodate one car. Please prepare the two vehicles for battle. Four wins out of six matches will allow you to qualify for the treasure. If it is three wins and three losses, no one is qualified for the treasure!\u201d</p><br/><p>The last round turned out to be a one on one fight with the players of both cars. There were 12 people and six games, with four victories required. Xie Xi listened carefully to the announcement. \u201cIf you lose, you can\u2019t gain the treasure but you won\u2019t be trapped here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those who weren\u2019t greedy would have no problems living.</p><br/><p>The four half zombies spoke in unison, \u201cLose?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Li was very passionate. \u201cBoss, just watch! We are enough!\u201d The four of them would gain four points and Jiang Xie and Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t have to act.</p><br/><p>Cao Yan added, \u201cBoss, rest assured that if I lose, I will\u2026 cut off my own arm!\u201d</p><br/><p>Couldn\u2019t he show a bit of sincerity? His arm was more worthless than his clothes!</p><br/><p>Zhuo Liu laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not the same. If I lose, I will cut off Cao Yan\u2019s arm!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cao Yan shouted, \u201cStop fucking around. Why do you want to cut off my arm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Liu shifted his gaze. \u201cI like your arm. Occasionally, another person\u2019s life experience is also a fresh experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>If this had happened before, Xie Xi would\u2019ve ignored them and move towards Jiang Xie. Now\u2026 he was afraid to approach Jiang Xie and had to listen to this group.</p><br/><p>They were really relaxed. What was there to be afraid of? The first car might\u2019ve made it through the last round but they could easily smash the first car.</p><br/><p>As for the status of the first car? They were a mess and several of them already had less air intake.</p><br/><p>In the second round, the big rooster was mercilessly crushed by Xie Xi\u2019s group but it was actually very arrogant. The hill-like body, the proud chicken wings and the healthy chicken thighs, it was a strong boss and normally the abused players would be crying and shouting!</p><br/><p>The second car had all types of weapons and it was easy to fight, but the first car only had the long knives. These knives were good for cutting zombies but against the big rooster, it was the same as cutting stone. Zhou Wuwei rushed up and slashed at it, only for the chicken foot to\u2026</p><br/><p>Slam out.</p><br/><p>There was nothing wrong with the chicken leg and the knife was broken!</p><br/><p>Zhou Wuwei froze and was hit by the rooster\u2019s wing. He slammed into the wall and coughed up blood.</p><br/><p>Zhou Wuwei was fairly good and all his qualifications were placed in strength. He desperately swung the knife but the rooster was unexpectedly unscathed. It showed how thick the skin of the rooster was!</p><br/><p>Fortunately, they had an \u2018attack strategy.\u2019 Yun Die cried out, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Stand in a good position and try to attack its lower abdomen!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a piece of soft flesh covered by feathers. Aiming at it could deal a fatal injury.</p><br/><p>Zhou Wuwei\u2019s face was ugly. \u201cThis rooster\u2019s skin is to thick. They probably can\u2019t beat it even with weapons!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Die added, \u201cDefeating it is useless. Without anyone blocking the position, it will soon come back to life. Upgrading only gives limited weapons and ammunition. That man can\u2019t win alone.\u201d It really was a pity. It was the first time she had seen such a handsome man in her life.</p><br/><p>Zhou Wuwei cheered up, organized his teammates to stand in the right position and started to attack the big rooster.</p><br/><p>All of them had good fighting power apart from the man with no hand. However, after the first round baptism, they were exhausted and the big rooster was really strong. They might have an attack strategy and know its weakness but it took half an hour to defeat.</p><br/><p>The big rooster died and they were a mess.</p><br/><p>Yun Die\u2019s shoulder was injured and her whole arm couldn\u2019t be broken. Zhou Wuwei\u2019s left leg was broken and he could barely walk. The other four were no better. The worst one was a black man whose back was pecked by the big rooster and he was bleeding. It was unknown if he could leave this game alive.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiwei panted, \u201cRest assured, the third round is a one on one confrontation. We will easily win.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Die nodded. \u201cThe treasure must be ours!\u201d</p><br/><p>The price they paid for this project wasn\u2019t small but there was a chance to recover if they could get the zombie\u2019s treasure!</p><br/><p>At this time, an announcement was heard. \u201cWelcome to the third round. Please submit the list of players and the first game will start later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s side was exuberant when they heard this. Zhu Li cried out, \u201cI\u2019ll go first! Don\u2019t steal my place!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cao Yan was next. \u201cThen I\u2019m second.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Zhuo Liu spoke, \u201cI\u2019m third.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuang Yi added, \u201cThen it is up to me to end the game.\u201d He was the fourth one. If he won, it was indeed possible to announce the end of the game.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had been hiding from Jiang Xie but he couldn\u2019t escape anymore. He asked, \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cI\u2019ll be fifth.\u201d If any of them lost, he would gain another point.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was well aware that he had the lowest combat power out of the six people. There was no way other than placing him at the end.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi confirmed the order again. Everyone nodded and said there was no problem. Then he submitted the list.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t care about these serious matters. \u201cXiao Xi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>What did he call him? Xie Xi took three scared steps back and nearly hit Zhu Li.</p><br/><p>Zhu Li wondered, \u201cBoss, what\u2019s wrong with you? Why are the ears so red? If you are uncomfortable\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn, could he apply to withdraw from this team?</p><br/><p>The first game also submitted their lineup. The first one was Zhou Wuwei. He had a broken leg but he had to be first. The reason was ready-made, \u201cI don\u2019t know if there is anyone left on the other team. Perhaps we can just walk through the game!\u201d</p><br/><p>The big rooster was so dangerous that anyone alive in the second car would only be defeated!</p><br/><p>The third round couldn\u2019t use weapons. That man might be strong but if he was still alive after the first and second rounds, he must be unsteady.</p><br/><p>Zhou Wuwei\u2019s heart was on fire. He had to personally teach that arrogant and ignorant man!</p><br/><p>If he hadn\u2019t been so arrogant to refuse their invitation, they wouldn\u2019t have suffered such losses!</p><br/><p>The list was submitted and the cars moved. They passed through an iron door and entered a place similar to an arena.</p><br/><p>After two rounds of games, the players from both cars gathered again.</p><br/><p>When entering the game, the first car contained elites apart from the man without a hand. In the second car, apart from Jiang Xie and Xie Xi, the others all had missing arms or legs. They were miserable.</p><br/><p>Now\u2026 it was the other way around.</p><br/><p>The people in the first car were stunned. Yun Die and Zhou Wuwei were pale and disbelief filled their faces.</p><br/><p>How could this be? How were there still six people in the second car? In addition, the arrogant man was unscathed?</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just him. The young man next to him looked too good. The shocking thing was that his clothes weren\u2019t dirty at all\u2026</p><br/><p>On the other side, the first car was really miserable. Forget the injured people, even Miss Yun looked like she had rolled around in a pigsty.</p><br/><p>Yun Die and Zhou Wuwei suspected that they were hallucinating. Otherwise, how could such an incredible thing happen? This man was strong enough to kill 600 zombies without any injuries? He easily killed the rooster in the second round?</p><br/><p>How could it be?!</p><br/><p>Zhu Li and Cao Yan couldn\u2019t describe how good it felt when they saw the expressions of the opposite car.</p><br/><p>Yun Die and her group had stabbed them before entering the game. It was true that they were physically disabled and they weren\u2019t suitable for clearing the game but did Yun Die\u2019s group have to ridicule them? Why sentence them to death? Why take pleasure in their despair and pain?</p><br/><p>The announcement was heard again, \u201cThe first game is about to begin. The players should enter the competition field.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Wuwei\u2019s soul returned and he stared at Jiang Xie with a horrified expression. This man was going to kill him! Soon he would know\u2026 he didn\u2019t deserve to be Jiang Xie\u2019s opponent at all.</p><br/><p>A white light flashed and one person disappeared from each of the cars.</p><br/><p>Zhou Wuwei of the first car.</p><br/><p>Zhu Li of the second car.</p><br/><p>They were transmitted to the high platform in the middle. Zhu Li cracked his neck and moved his hands and feet while grinning viciously. Zhou Wuwei was already trembling.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stood far away and thought, \u2018Don\u2019t smile! I can\u2019t tell who the villain is!\u2019</p><br/><p>There was no suspense in the battle. Zhou Wuwei\u2019s face was swollen and he unwillingly asked, \u201cWhat happened to your legs? You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Li punched him. \u201cSpeak less crap!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Wuwei was extremely humiliated and could only shout, \u201cI, I admit defeat!\u201d</p><br/><p>The game was over as long as he admitted defeat. There was no suspense in the match. The outcome had been decided the moment both sides first appeared.</p><br/><p>After four wins, the second car qualified to inherit the treasure.</p><br/><p>The first car might be wounded but they cleared this game as long as they passed the second round. The third round was only for the final reward. It wasn\u2019t fatal if the reward wasn\u2019t obtained.</p><br/><p>The announcement rang again, \u201cThe second car is favoured by the zombie princess. Please go to the treasury to collect your special reward!\u201d</p><br/><p>The zombie princess\u2019 favour? It didn\u2019t feel very good.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at the first car and saw the stunned Yun Die.</p><br/><p>Yun Die hadn\u2019t appeared in the four games. She held her shoulder while her face was dazed, as if she hadn\u2019t recovered from the shock.</p><br/><p>The first car was leaving the game while the second car was heading to the treasury. They were heading in opposite directions and were next to each other\u2026</p><br/><p>A silver light flashed straight towards Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Yun Die\u2019s face was exposed and the thin blade in her hand pointed at Xie Xi\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>She gritted her teeth. \u201cNo wonder why you are so fearless. It turns out you have the privilege.\u201d</p><br/><p>She just had to kill him and this powerful healing would be hers!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t terrified at all as he stared at her with no expression.</p><br/><p>Yun Die was shocked and found that the dark muzzle in Xie Xi\u2019s hand was already pointed at her!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Pisces used his illusions and was sleepy. He wasn\u2019t up to the task of surveillance and it needed to be handed over to others. Their master couldn\u2019t worry about this and they had to share it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought that Scorpio must\u2019ve said something like this to Capricorn. \u201cI originally wanted to talk to Sagittarius but he is busy with Master tonight. I can only bother you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once this was said, how could Capricorn let Sagittarius be \u2018free and easy?\u2019</p><br/><p>Scorpio\u2019s trick could be called perfect!</p><br/><p>Old Qin was the most honest. Once asked by Nan Yi, he repeated the words that Scorpio told Capricorn.</p><br/><p>It was as Xie Xi thought.</p><br/><p>The male gods were silent for three seconds before laughing like fools.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe scolded: Is this a fucking palace drama?</p><br/><p>The thing they didn\u2019t know was that with the six princes of Atlantis, there really was a palace fight.</p><br/><p>If Scorpio was just like this then the quality of the \u2018palace drama\u2019 was really underestimated.</p><br/><p>He first arranged for Capricorn to drag Sagittarius away and then arranged a bitter plan for himself to coax Xie Xi to his side in minutes.</p><br/><p>His calculations were too slippery.</p><br/><p>The intruders who needed to be watched were entrusted to others while he ran outside. Once Xie Xi came to find him, it was the perfect time to be alone.</p><br/><p>Scorpio didn\u2019t say a word and arranged things for the other Jiang Xies!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2026 really wanted to hit him!</p><br/><p>All the others were good. Could Scorpio use this bitter play so casually? What if he was really ambushed by N?</p><br/><p>The erasure mission was to kill the six fallen star signs but Xie Xi understood that as long as one died, all six would die!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew this was Scorpio\u2019s small trick but he still had to jump head-on into it.</p><br/><p>He observed. \u201cThe enemy\u2019s ability can restrain him. Did he go to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>Capricorn replied, \u201cLosing is a disgrace. He wants to prove himself so this subordinate can\u2019t stop him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi believed that Capricorn couldn\u2019t wait for Scorpio to die directly in battle.</p><br/><p>Sagittarius also said, \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t have any ability then he doesn\u2019t deserve the name of Scorpio.\u201d</p><br/><p>The six star signs were new names given to them by Xie Xi, representing glory and trust.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s white finger moved in the void as he declared, \u201cI am going to find him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sagittarius exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019ll go with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Capricorn was much calmer and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s rebuke only fell on Sagittarius. \u201cWhat about the intruders of the temple? Do you want to let Capricorn guard them by himself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sagittarius, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The so-called crying child was given sugar to eat. Xie Xi saw Sagittarius\u2019 reluctant expression and red eyes and his heart softened.</p><br/><p>He was fierce but Xie Xi could only say warmly, \u201cStay here and wait for me, I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sagittarius wasn\u2019t stupid. How could he not understand? This was all part of Scorpio\u2019s calculations! Unfortunately, it was a winning move in chess and he could only bear the pain of losing.</p><br/><p>He told Xie Xi, \u201cI will wait for you, I will always wait for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought that this guy would become even hungrier waiting for him and became distressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>He just entered the portal when Xie Xi seemed to hear Sagittarius whispering, \u201cBut you won\u2019t belong to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt heartache and helplessness. He didn\u2019t belong to Sagittarius? They were all his. All his\u2026</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know why but once these words appeared in his mind, Xie Xi twitched.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the first time he felt this feeling. It was like this every time he touched something. It was as if on a vast sea, he saw a little iceberg exposed.</p><br/><p>He stood up but couldn\u2019t imagine how deep and unpredictable the mountain below it was.</p><br/><p>What exactly was it?</p><br/><p>In Xie Xi\u2019s mind, the prompt that the system gave him when he first entered the 12 Boundaries flashes.</p><br/><p>Remember, you don\u2019t believe in things because they are real. It is because you believe in them that they are real.</p><br/><p>There is no eternal truth in this world, because what you think is nothing more than a \u2018hypothesis.\u2019</p><br/><p>The world is hypothetical.</p><br/><p>What did this mean?</p><br/><p>Why give him such a hint?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi recalled the collapsed worlds that he had passed through. He felt the shadow of these sentences everywhere but like a fog, he couldn\u2019t touch the most real place.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you come\u2026\u201d Scorpio\u2019s voice entered Xie Xi\u2019s ear and brought back his wandering nerves.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced over at him and sighed with relief.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, this guy hadn\u2019t really encountered N.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi no longer thought about the other things and gazed at Scorpio. \u201cWho allowed you to act without permission?\u201d</p><br/><p>He lowered his voice and Scorpio immediately fell to one knee, purple hair spread out on the ground. \u201cPreviously, it was this subordinate\u2019s job and the intruder escaped. In order to make up for my fault, this time I must bring the intruder back to the temple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis ability naturally restrains yours. You rushing out, what is the difference with going to death?\u201d</p><br/><p>Scorpio spoke clearly. \u201cQin Ge is good with heavy weapons and suppresses the flexibility and agility of Aquarius. Zong Xia\u2019s vision is different from ordinary people and he can see through Pisces\u2019 illusions. They are restrained yet they completed the task.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was reasonable but the opponent was on a different level!</p><br/><p>The master of Yunge was only second to this person\u2019s main body. It wasn\u2019t strange if he was restrained!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi explained, \u201cIt is their captain who escaped and he is the strongest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am older than Aquarius and Pisces\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The unspoken words implied that he was stronger than Pisces and Aquarius but lost.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi long had the ambition to \u2018destroy his own prestige\u2019 and spoke seriously, \u201cThe person who ran away is called N. I suspect that his strength is above mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scorpio looked up sharply, purple eyes deep. \u201cImpossible, you are the only god.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned again.</p><br/><p>Scorpio exclaimed, \u201cEven the six gods can\u2019t match you, let alone a nobody!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned. \u201cThere are countless people outside the mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one can surpass you.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was being blindly worshipped by a lover\u2026</p><br/><p>Cough, Xie Xi was strangely embarrassed. It was good that no one else was here or his face would be hot.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t hurry back to the temple and asked Scorpio, \u201cAre there any traces of N?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe took care of the poison fog I placed on him and it is hard to track him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Last time, N made Scorpio lose half his flesh but N probably wasn\u2019t in a much better state.</p><br/><p>Then Xie Xi remembered that N was a god level pharmacist and must have many means to resolve Scorpio\u2019s poison.</p><br/><p>It was quite a coincidence.</p><br/><p>General Qin suppressed Dark Elf Aquarius.</p><br/><p>Zong Xia\u2019s vision restrained Sea Demon Pisces.</p><br/><p>N\u2019s medicine could resolve Lich Scorpio.</p><br/><p>It was a coincidence, a coincidence that was too deliberate.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had experienced too many things and no matter how much he thought, it was never too much.</p><br/><p>He had a thought before.</p><br/><p>This world was different from any of the quasi-worlds he previously encountered.</p><br/><p>It was a quasi-world being erased.</p><br/><p>The previous ones were only collapsing and the erasure tasks hadn\u2019t been released yet. This one was indeed being erased.</p><br/><p>What did that mean?</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only the deterioration of the small world but also the emergence of the players who received the task and represented the will of the Central Government.</p><br/><p>Yes\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had been thinking, \u2018Is repairing a quasi-world that is being erased the same as before?\u2019</p><br/><p>The will dominating this small world being wiped out wasn\u2019t just the souls.</p><br/><p>Look at the abilities of the souls, the abilities of the players who entered and then thinking about Central\u2019s will\u2026 was this really a coincidence?</p><br/><p>An idea flashed through Xie Xi\u2019s brain.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi held Scorpio\u2019s hand and ordered, \u201cGo back to the temple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease let this subordinate continue\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo back with me. He struck one time and there will certainly be a second time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scorpio insisted. \u201cThis subordinate should find out his whereabouts and resolve him in advance.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at him. \u201cWhy do you think I saved you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sudden question made Scorpio freeze.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at the cold face of the lich, his eyes gentle as if to melt the other person.</p><br/><p>Scorpio had his eyes lowered and he couldn\u2019t answer.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi held the cold hand tightly. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scorpio glanced at him fiercely, deep purple eyes filled with unabashed eagerness.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi kissed the back of his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t let yourself get hurt. I hope your body can be warmer.\u201d</p><br/><p>The experiences were summed up\u2026</p><br/><p>Scorpio had never been able to drink other people\u2019s blood and Scorpio would certainly have his own sufferings.</p><br/><p>A lich was undead, didn\u2019t have a warm body temperature and always looked like cold jade.</p><br/><p>He wanted the so-called what was missing. Xie Xi noticed that Scorpio liked hot things.</p><br/><p>These words undoubtedly poked at Scorpio\u2019s heart and his voice trembled. \u201cThank you, my god.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scorpio no longer insisted and returned to the temple with him.</p><br/><p>After this, Xie Xi could finally \u2018stand alone in a room.\u2019</p><br/><p>He did this deliberately since he had something to talk about with his seniors.</p><br/><p>There was no one present but Xie Xi still opened a soundproof barrier before using the communication device to contact Yan Zhe and the others.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cGod Yan, can you contact N?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe lowered his voice and asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope you can send a message to him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe listened to Xie Xi and hesitated. \u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The other big seniors were present and heard Xie Xi\u2019s words. Zong Xia spoke calmly, \u201cN might not necessarily listen to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi added, \u201cYes, Old N has seen Pisces\u2019 illusions. He will think we are all controlled.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the experience of a senior.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t look at the players having a \u2018system\u2019 that was superior to the quasi-world. In essence, they were still restricted by the operator.</p><br/><p>There had been situations where the player was controlled and used his own system to kill his teammates. Never underestimate any quasi-world. The players of Central were never \u2018gods\u2019 above the small world.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cGive a suggestion. As long as I don\u2019t let the six star signs go outside, he will attack the temple sooner or later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ge asked, \u201cWon\u2019t you be in danger is he summons the six main gods?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi declared, \u201cI have to be in danger.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

How can you ask a person to devote his heart to you?\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought it was funny and there was a look of astonishment on his face. Azure Dragon still cared about the face of a sage and he said, \u201cI\u2019m joking, don\u2019t take it seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was rare to see Jiang Xie like this so Xie Xi unexpectedly played along, \u201cIt was originally a joke?\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon\u2019s eyes shot towards him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi lowered his eyes and stuttered, \u201cI\u2026 I thought\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon hastily asked him, \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked down and suppressed his smile while pretending to be embarrassed, \u201cNo, no.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was actually speaking seriously. Azure Dragon\u2019s heart trembled and he didn\u2019t know what to say for a while.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suggested, \u201cI am just a rose. Who would think that Lord Azure Dragon saved me? This life is what you gave me. Shall I be your servant in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon\u2019s breathing stopped.</p><br/><p>Intellectually, Azure Dragon knew this wasn\u2019t possible. His cultivation was one of no desires and he couldn\u2019t be tempted. The little rose\u2019s few words were enough to make his heart unstable. In the long-term, the consequences would be unthinkable.</p><br/><p>He replied, \u201cI don\u2019t lack personal servants\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was disappointed. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, you can stay in Azure Dragon Palace.\u201d Azure Dragon looked away after saying this. Intellectually, he understood the reasons but his mouth and feelings ran away from him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes curved. \u201cIf I\u2019m not a servant, what reason is there to stay here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon replied quietly, \u201cCan\u2019t Azure Dragon Palace have a little flower?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh, it didn\u2019t have a little flower as a fixture.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon added, \u201cStay here and be at ease.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi quipped, \u201cWill you prepare a vase for me?\u201d \u201cBe more conscious of yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon smiled. \u201cYou can do whatever you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cHrmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can think of Azure Dragon Palace as your vase.\u201d</p><br/><p>The conversation between them sounded strange but once translated, it was filled with an unimaginable sweetness.</p><br/><p>The vase was a temporary home for flowers. Xie Xi asked Azure Dragon to find him a home and Azure Dragon told him that he could think of Azure Dragon Palace as his home and do whatever he wanted.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s how Xie Xi stayed.</p><br/><p>He should\u2019ve entered the painting and saw the meeting between the white rose and Azure Dragon.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t find a way to leave the painting for the time being because he felt there was probably a clue in the past.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon was busy every day since Azure Dragon Palace was responsible for most government affairs on the Holy Mountain. He worked until very late every day.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stayed by his side and gave him a cup of tea or water. Whenever Azure Dragon was busy, Xie Xi found a corner to stay in and flipped through a book.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon told him, \u201cDon\u2019t follow me, you can do whatever you want.\u201d He was afraid the small rose would be bored.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cThis is what I want to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon\u2019s heart swayed uncontrollably. \u201cIsn\u2019t it boring?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Xie Xi glanced at him. \u201cFollowing you, I think\u2026\u201d He seemed too embarrassed to continue.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon saw the blush rising on the fair face and his heart thumped. He wanted to ask but he also didn\u2019t\u2026</p><br/><p>He still asked, \u201cWhat do you feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled lightly. \u201cI\u2019m very happy and at ease.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was very soft, soft enough to be talking to himself but Azure Dragon heard it. Azure Dragon knew this wasn\u2019t right, that his cultivation didn\u2019t allow for emotion desires. In addition, Xie Xi forgot many things due to the side effect of the medicine. Once he remembered, he would certainly regret it but\u2026</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon whispered, \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw this pure and contradictory Jiang Xie and couldn\u2019t help wanting to tease him. \u201cReally? You aren\u2019t bothered by me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not, I\u2019m afraid that you will think Azure Dragon Palace is rigid and boring.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied sincerely, \u201cI like it here. Azure Dragon Palace is very quiet and beautiful, making people feel at ease in their hearts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon\u2019s heart warmed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke again, \u201cYou must\u2019ve never been to Rose Mountain. We have many roses and every day, new small roses are being born. It is always noisy in the nursery and there is never any quiet time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of Azure Dragon\u2019s slips curved. \u201cThen you are staying here to hide?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon glanced at him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was also watching him and stared into his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m staying at Azure Dragon Palace because Azure Dragon is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying this, Xie Xi seemed shy and anxious. \u201cThe tea is cold. I\u2019m going to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was about to leave when Azure Dragon grasped his wrist.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nervously pressed tight lips together and Azure Dragon suddenly released his hand.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled and stared up at him.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon frowned like he was thinking about something. Xie Xi was about to leave when Azure Dragon held him again and asked in a difficult voice, \u201cWhat is the life span of the rose family?\u201d</p><br/><p>Why was he suddenly asking this?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had some understanding and replied, \u201cThe old chief is 200 years old. He is the oldest in the family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c200 years\u2026\u201d Azure Dragon\u2019s thin lips curved as he smiled gently. \u201cIn fact, I wasn\u2019t joking.\u201d</p><br/><p>The topic jump was too big and Xie Xi couldn\u2019t keep up. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon pulled him closer and hugged him tightly. \u201cDevoting your heart to me, I meant it seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon whispered, \u201cWould you like to stay in the Azure Dragon Palace forever?\u201d</p><br/><p>The words were roundabout and Xie Xi deliberately wondered, \u201cYour Excellency, are you finally willing to let me be your personal servant?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want you to be the other owner of this palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Despite knowing that this person liked lewd talk, Xie Xi\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help trembling. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon told him, \u201cLittle Rose, I\u2019m proposing to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>What maze-like proposal was this?! Xie Xi had to pretend to be surprised. \u201cYour Excellency\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon declared, \u201cShall I accompany you for the next 200 years?\u201d</p><br/><p>The rose family had a lifespan of 200 years so this meant accompanying him for a lifetime. Xie Xi smiled. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>In any case, he received the betrothal gift in reality and could only say yes here.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi became more and more certain that if he wanted to leave this painting, he had to go along with the past. He might not know the real past but as long as the general trend was good, there shouldn\u2019t be any problems.</p><br/><p>For example, this proposal must be agreed to.</p><br/><p>The moment he spoke, he seemed to drift into the air as he watched two individuals in the painting from the perspective of a god.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon and the little rose were together. They were sweet and the entire Azure Dragon Palace seemed to be filled with pink bubbles.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered why he had shifted to such a perspective and figured it out the next moment.</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2019 fell asleep and Azure Dragon got up, suppressing his cough with extreme restraint. The moment he left the room, he coughed violently and blood flowed out.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart jerked and he thought about what the doctor said before.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon\u2019s cultivation involved no desires and he had to pay attention to unintentional desires. He had obviously broken this.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had thought about this problem when he first entered the painting but the events in the painting had happened a long time ago. Even if he knew anything, he couldn\u2019t change it.</p><br/><p>The doctor took Azure Dragon\u2019s pulse and frowned as he warned, \u201cYour Excellency, this is too dangerous!\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon asked, \u201cHow long can I last?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUp to 300 years.\u201d A sage\u2019s life was infinitely long and 300 years was like the span of a finger.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor knew what he was thinking and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cIs it worth it?\u201d Was it worth giving up eternal life for a rose flower?</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon calmly replied, \u201cIt\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi returned to the body of the rose flower and saw Azure Dragon\u2019s gentle gaze when he opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to speak but found that he was speechless.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon wondered, \u201cYou roses don\u2019t have a name, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will give you the name of the flower god, so that you are sheltered by the flower god and live a long life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Xie Xi was fiercely pulled out of the painting.</p><br/><p>It took a while for his senses to recover. He found that he had come out of the painting and returned to reality.</p><br/><p>There was a chance to the painting in front of him. The painting had a cyan back and the person was walking on a narrow road. In front was a dark and dead silence while behind was a cluster of flowers.</p><br/><p>He gave up behind him and chose the way forward.</p><br/><p>He walked step by step, blood-stained dragon scales at his feet.</p><br/><p>He broke the path of no desires, suffered from the pain of broken bones every day and gave up eternal life, only for this short 300 years.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon knew from the beginning that there was an infinite abyss in front of him but he went forward without hesitation.</p><br/><p>In the blank space of the painting, there were two more lines of words. The cyan ink seemed to shine.</p><br/><p>[Eternal life is less than a moment of splendor.]</p><br/><p>Being together for 300 years, this was his only wish in this lifetime.</p><br/><p>No wonder why Azure Dragon asked about the lifespan of a rose. A white rose could only live for 200 years but it was possible to live up to 300 years with the name of the flower god.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon broke his cultivation path and suffered every day just for 300 years. He only wanted the two people to be together forever.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Xie Xi, are you awake?\u201d The voice of a servant came from outside.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi jerked violently and pushed open the door. \u201cHas the sage woken up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe just woke up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them went to Azure Dragon\u2019s bedroom. The two rooms were very close and were along the same corridor.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw a pale green dragon as soon as he entered.</p><br/><p>The dragon was awake and glossy indigo eyes flashed when he saw Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was distressed to death and wanted to scold this person! It was clear that the quasi-world\u2019s plot was set by the souls themselves. How did he give himself such a bitter setting! If it wasn\u2019t for all the people around them, Xie Xi really wanted to pull out this master and ask him! Now\u2026</p><br/><p>He reached out and grabbed Azure Dragon\u2019s hand. \u201cYour Excellency, do you feel better?\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon stared at him. \u201cThe words you said at Vermilion Bird Palace\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare to stimulate him again and hurriedly replied, \u201cIt was to save Sage Vermilion Bird. I only have a few connections with him and there are those who are right and wrong.\u201d He spoke the previous words again in a tender manner, out of fear that Azure Dragon would cough up blood again.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon held his hand and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare to look directly at these words. In a sense, he wasn\u2019t lying since this was Jiang Xie\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I won\u2019t lie to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon asked, \u201cIs Vermilion Bird fine now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt already doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon opened his mouth. \u201cThen we will go and tell him clearly. This type of misunderstanding needs to be resolved as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did it to save him but it will hurt him to drag it out. I\u2019ll accompany you to Vermilion Bird Palace and explain it to him.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Xie Xi\u2019s heart was drumming because the effect of the character freeze was too short. Zhong Jin was obviously much stronger than Xie Xi and he was familiar with this town. It would be easy for him to find Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had to clear the world before Zhong Jin found him!</p><br/><p>He drank a bottle of physical medicine, endured the fishy taste and went to meet up with Song Qi.</p><br/><p>He had mouthed something at Song Qi when they split up. Song Qi had a collector\u2019s good eyesight and must\u2019ve read it.</p><br/><p>\u2014Dungeon.</p><br/><p>It was the place where they were previously held.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t take a detour and went directly to the dungeon. He used the search mirror and quickly determined Song Qi\u2019s location.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Zhong Jin didn\u2019t carry the search mirror or they really couldn\u2019t hide!</p><br/><p>Song Qi saw him and had tears in his eyes. \u201cBrother Xi!\u201d He was scared to death and really thought he couldn\u2019t see Xie Xi anymore.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gasped and said, \u201cGo to the rear mountain!\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi was nervous. \u201cWill Zhong Jin be waiting for us there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t know what our mission is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Xie Xi had previously lied and said his task was to collect Aunty Sun\u2019s mace. According to normal logic, they would want to quickly escape the world and the only way to leave was to complete the task. The biggest chance for Zhong Jin was to go to Aunty Sun\u2019s house to block them.</p><br/><p>Song Qi remembered. \u201cYes, the task rating of the rear mountain is very high and the probability of gaining it is low. He shouldn\u2019t think they would go to the rear mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them set up.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s forehead was covered with sweat and Song Qi took out a physical potion to give to him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cI drank a bottle before we came.\u201d The potion was effective for a certain amount of time. If used frequently within an hour, the effect would be greatly reduced. This type of low-grade potion would directly lose its effect.</p><br/><p>Song Qi had no choice. \u201cWhen we leave this world, we must quickly improve our strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wiped the sweat on his forehead. \u201cThis is my second task.\u201d</p><br/><p>He needed to clear at least three worlds to open the talent system.</p><br/><p>Song Qi comforted him, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Next time, refresh a F-grade world and it will be easy to finish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t hope for this. He only hoped that the next game wasn\u2019t designed by X!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was a bit tired and didn\u2019t want to say anything, but there was a question in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you ever heard of summoning?\u201d He had no one else to ask and could only ask Song Qi. It was trying everything in a desperate situation.</p><br/><p>Song Qi was startled and exclaimed, \u201cI know! This is my goal. I want a summoning skill in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t expect him to actually know and asked, \u201cWill the things summoned hurt the master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not! As long as it can be summoned, it will sign a contract and will be completely obedient to the orders of the caller.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how strong the thing summoned it?\u201d Xie Xi asked.</p><br/><p>Song Qi wondered, \u201cHow strong? Can you summon a holy beast?\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a holy beast but it was similar. A human was also a type of beast.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about it and asked, \u201cHave you ever heard of summoning a human?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god!\u201d Song Qi was stunned. \u201cThere are a few powerhouses on the ladder who are added to the summoning pool. Can you summon one of them?\u201d Xie Xi had asked this in detail so Song Qi guessed that Xie Xi most likely had a summoning skill. After all, he cleared a S-grade world and got a special reward.</p><br/><p>What the hell was the ladder? Xie Xi didn\u2019t have time to ask as he grabbed the main point. \u201cWill they be the ones summoned?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCertainly not. The big people are very busy. How can they be forced to respond to a summoning?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it just splitting the body?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi thought for a moment. \u201cIt should be a puppet who inherited their power or something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed with relief. A puppet would be much easier to control.</p><br/><p>Song Qi asked him seriously, \u201cYou can really summon the puppet of a powerhouse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, but the time is short.\u201d Xie Xi didn\u2019t need to hide it from him. \u201cStill, it should be enough.\u201d After all, the pervert who designed the S-grade world should be good at fighting!</p><br/><p>Song Qi was excited. \u201cWhich bigshot is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cX.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi was dumbfounded. \u201cX\u2026 X?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d Song Qi screamed. \u201cI can actually see God X in my lifetime!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a puppet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi gulped. \u201cI heard that his handsome looks are enough to break the sky. The only man whom God Yan can\u2019t be compared to!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know much. \u201cWho is Xie Xi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first beauty in our central government!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, you look good as well\u2026 but you are too young and haven\u2019t opened yet.\u201d Song Qi\u2019s 0 soul was burning. \u201cWhen will you summon God X to let my eyes feast?\u201d (O=bottom/shou)</p><br/><p>Xie Xi silently moved away from him.</p><br/><p>Song Qi felt his thick dislike. \u201cYou are a straight man!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know how straight he was but he couldn\u2019t understand what everyone called good-looking. What looked good? Weren\u2019t they all eyes, nose and a mouth? What was different?</p><br/><p>They finally arrived at the rear mountain. Xie Xi had the search mirror and found the golden-eyed boy with no problems.</p><br/><p>The boy froze after seeing Xie Xi unscathed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course you are fine!\u201d The boy felt complicated. \u201cYou outsiders have two lives!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to speak when he saw the text prompt in the lower right corner.</p><br/><p>[Congratulations, the side task: Trace Tornado has been completed.]</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled. \u201cYour name is Long Juanfeng?\u201d (Long Juanfeng= Tornado)</p><br/><p>The boy\u2019s golden eyes were full of vigilance. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi was also stunned and surprise showed on his face. \u201cOh my god, Tornado is a person!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t expected it either\u2026</p><br/><p>He just thought this boy was special. One reason was this golden eyes and the other was that he wasn\u2019t as thin as the residents. He felt this boy was the key and never expected the boy to be the important side task.</p><br/><p>Speaking of which, Xie Xi remembered that Sun Yunren had called the boy Xiao Feng before.</p><br/><p>Who would\u2019ve thought that a person had such a name?</p><br/><p>The boy frowned. \u201cWhat the hell do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was always wary of Zhong Jin and couldn\u2019t delay the time. He half crouched down and the boy looked up \u201cXiao Feng, I know that you hate outsiders and they have ruined your peaceful life. I can close the door so they no longer come here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy\u2019s golden eyes shone as he spoke cautiously. \u201cYou\u2019re not like them.\u201d Outsiders might be able to come back from the dead but no outsider would suffer a fatal injury for the sake of a villager.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him. \u201cI need your help.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy bit his lower lip. \u201cThe dragon god will punish you if you lie to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart hurt when he heard this sentence. The desperate child grasped such a fragile straw.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi promised him. \u201cI\u2019m not lying to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy asked, \u201cWhat do you need from me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi questioned him, \u201cDo you know what the dragon heart is?\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy\u2019s pupils shrank, his demeanor changed and his lower lip was bitten red.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi watched him. \u201cI need to collect the dragon heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought the boy was refuse but the boy miraculously calmed down, revealing an expression that didn\u2019t match his age. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi and Song Qi were both shocked. Their side task would lead to the main task? Wasn\u2019t this too easy?</p><br/><p>Then again, it was just a D-grade world and shouldn\u2019t be too hard.</p><br/><p>The boy walked in front and took them to the cave they hadn\u2019t been able to enter.</p><br/><p>The cave seemed unfathomable from the outside and once they walked in, it was much bigger than they thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi and Song Qi covered their mouths and noses at the same time, unable to breathe due to the smell.</p><br/><p>The rotten, stinky and indescribable smell made them want to vomit out their last meal.</p><br/><p>The boy looked calm as he stared at the bloody pool containing a mutilated and broken arm. \u201c\u2026The dragon heart is down there.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two men were stunned.</p><br/><p>The boy whispered, \u201cGive the devil to the dragon god and the heart of the dragon god will illuminate the town.</p><br/><p>This bloody pool contained the players who died here.</p><br/><p>Song Qi couldn\u2019t endure it anymore. He bent over and vomited.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t much better. He frowned and asked, \u201cDragon heart\u2026 down there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The boy didn\u2019t change despite seeing so many dead people. His golden eyes stared at Xie Xi, \u201cIf you need it then go down and get it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Qi, \u201c\u2026Oh!\u201d</p><br/><p>How should they get it? Who the hell could jump into a bloody pool like this to look for something?</p><br/><p>Song Qi was pale as he stared at Xie Xi. \u201cH-How\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned and asked, \u201cAre you sure that summoning won\u2019t summon the person?\u201d</p><br/><p>The startled Song Qi: ???</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed and used his only skill, summoning X\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>In the dim cave, a light flashed and a slender man appeared out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>He wore a black coat in a very simple style. The rolled cuffs and slightly open neckline gave a slight feeling of laziness. The light faded and the amazingly handsome features became more profound. The different coloured eyes made his terrible cave more frightening, as if he was the master of the abyss.</p><br/><p>Song Qi was dazed as he stared at the person.</p><br/><p>Ahhh, damn good! And\u2026 Bigshot, run quickly! Someone is trying to scam you!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

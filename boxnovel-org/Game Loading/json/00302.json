All races and nations responded to call to exterminate the evil god.</p><br/><p>Everyone agreed that evil would fall because the six gods represented the pinnacle of the world.</p><br/><p>Once they appeared, there was nothing that couldn\u2019t be overcome!</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just them. Even the six main gods felt there was no suspense.</p><br/><p>They all came in order to harvest the beliefs of the people they sheltered, so as to not be robbed of the limelight by the other gods.</p><br/><p>No one ever thought of the possibility of losing.</p><br/><p>How could it be possible? This group of ugly people were just ants who could be crushed by the gods moving their fingers.</p><br/><p>They thought so but in fact, Xie Xi\u2019s side thought the same.</p><br/><p>There was no suspense about the battle with the six gods.</p><br/><p>The six star signs had the different space shield so it was impossible to lose to anyone.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s only concern was N.</p><br/><p>N had a strong pharmacist ability. He was a powerful backup for the six main gods and it was unknown what strange tricks he had.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe and the others couldn\u2019t go to meet with N. After all, they were \u2018captured\u2019 and could only stay in the dungeon to try and lure N to save them.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought this and stayed outside the dungeon.</p><br/><p>The six star signs went to fight. Xie Xi tried not to let himself think too much but his heart was divided into several parts. He wondered if Scorpio and Libra\u2019s bodies had completely recovered, remembered that Sagittarius hadn\u2019t eaten enough and wondered if Pisces\u2019 mental state could cope with Poseidon\u2019s attacks. Of course, he was also worried about Capricorn. His temperament was steady and calm but his combat power was slightly worse. It was unknown if something would happen\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suppressed the urge to go out and see. He believed they were prepared to do their best and nothing would happen.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t walk away. He had to hold N. This was the most important thing.</p><br/><p>Only by making N give up the mission would the danger be completely eliminated. Otherwise, there would still be dangers even if the six main gods fell.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suppressed his thoughts and examined the surroundings.</p><br/><p>Would N come to save Yan Zhe\u2019s group? It was highly probable. After all, General QIn\u2019s combat power wasn\u2019t small and Yan Zhe was the god milk who could save anyone. The odds of winning would increase with their presence.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi held his breath and almost integrated into the darkness. Not a single sound could escape his ears.</p><br/><p>Now he was by himself and had to depend on his own strength to guard Jiang Xie!</p><br/><p>Just then, something shook in front of him.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe\u2019s voice was heard in his ears at the same time. \u201cN found us. Be careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi destroyed the communicator and completely hide himself in the darkness.</p><br/><p>For a strong person on the same level as Jiang Xie, Xie Xi could never take this opponent lightly.</p><br/><p>There were many magical items in Central and he couldn\u2019t measure N.</p><br/><p>The communicator in his ear might\u2019ve exposed his whereabouts. He wanted to calm down and use all his spirit to capture the person who could come to him at any time!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Xie Xi felt a pulling sensation.</p><br/><p>This familiar feeling scared him.</p><br/><p>He would experience such a pull every time he left the quasi-world\u2026</p><br/><p>What was going on? He was leaving the quasi-world?</p><br/><p>Had the souls killed the six main gods and completed the protection mission? Impossible! It was impossible to resolve the hidden dangers just by killing the six main gods!</p><br/><p>Then\u2026 N didn\u2019t come here and went directly to attack the souls? Xie Xi\u2019s back was cold and he strove to stabilize his chaotic heart. If the souls died, if Jiang Xie, if\u2026</p><br/><p>His vision was dark.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was standing in a void space when he opened his eyes again. It was dark and isolated from everything. This wasn\u2019t the temple, the small world or Central.</p><br/><p>Where was this place? The first thing that came to Xie Xi\u2019s mind was the white space. Jiang Xie had used it several times in order to wake up Xie Xi. This obviously wasn\u2019t the white space. It was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you a player?\u201d An ordinary voice rang out behind him.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know why but Xie Xi, who was so nervous that his back was wet, miraculously calmed down.</p><br/><p>This was N.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know the location of this place but he was at ease once he knew that N was with him. N didn\u2019t go to attack the souls and Jiang Xie was fine.</p><br/><p>This information was like giving the sea god\u2019s power to Xie Xi, allowing him to stabilize the violent wind and waves.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned and saw a man who almost integrated with the darkness. He wore a black cloak and only a pair of eyes was revealed. It was a pair of plain eyes like his voice. It was plain with no character, letting people easily forget him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared for a while. He thought this was N\u2019s disguise and N had deliberately concealed his original appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Xie Xi answered the question. It wasn\u2019t necessary to hide this.</p><br/><p>N stood far ahead and seemed to be separated from Xie Xi by a star river.</p><br/><p>He paused for a long time but it seemed to be just a moment before his unwavering voice rang out again. \u201cWhy are you in this world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi summoned the god\u2019s wisdom and sketch pen and stood motionless.</p><br/><p>The two items were suspended in front of him but N seemed unaware, making Xie Xi sigh with relief.</p><br/><p>He could use the god\u2019s wisdom and there would be no problem with self-protection He would win as long as he could protect himself.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him. \u201cDo you have to erase the world?\u201d</p><br/><p>N\u2019s eyes moved slightly. \u201cAnswer my question.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t afraid as he stared at N and questioned. \u201cDo you have to kill the six fallen star signs?\u201d</p><br/><p>N watched Xie Xi. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>They both asked each other questions and didn\u2019t answer the other person\u2019s questions.</p><br/><p>In fact, this method of inquiry could also find out some things.</p><br/><p>For example, N realized something. \u201cAre you guarding this world?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was little doubt in his tone, showing he clearly understood.</p><br/><p>After all, in the eyes of god level players, those who entered a world being erased were either teammates or competitors, nothing else.</p><br/><p>The meaning of these words was clearly to determine the mission objective.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cI\u2019m going to repair it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t mention Jiang Xie, say this was Jiang Xie\u2019s quasi-world or mention that the six star signs were Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>However, this answer tripped all of N\u2019s nerves. He cried out almost immediately, \u201cYou are IE!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned for a moment. Oh, he remembered\u2026 After repairing the Collapsed God, he redesigned the quasi-world with Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>The system wanted to publish the designer\u2019s name so he gave himself a code name. Jiang Xie was X and he was IE, together it was XIE. Xie Xi thought of the IE browser and inexplicably felt a bit of amusement.</p><br/><p>Yet N could so quickly guess it was him. This was worthy of being a famous god player in Central.</p><br/><p>As for the repair mission, the Central Government didn\u2019t make it public and Xie Xi\u2019s occupation also wasn\u2019t public.</p><br/><p>N was really wise to guess so much from a few short words.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi answered, \u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><br/><p>N paused for a long time and when he spoke again, his voice slightly trembled. \u201cWhy can you design a SSS-grade quasi-world?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Collapsed God was repaired and redesigned to become a SSS-grade quasi-world.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t open his mouth and just looked at N.</p><br/><p>N immediately understood his meaning and declared, \u201cI can give up the erasure task.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this sentence, Xie Xi released his clenched fists. It was easier than expected but this was also expected. Abandoning this mission was a small loss for N. As compensation, he could get important information from Xie Xi and this was very cost-effective.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi explained, \u201cAfter the repair, the quasi-world can be redesigned.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a certain risk saying this. After all, the designers of the SSS-grade world were he and Jiang Xie. Perhaps N could infer the designer of this world\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really didn\u2019t want to expose Jiang Xie since he was always afraid that N would hurt Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>N instantly exclaimed, \u201cThis is X\u2019s quasi-world!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was tense and ready to fight.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, N wanted to surpass Jiang Xie but there were no ideas of killing him. N just muttered, \u201cNo wonder it is so complete.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was something Xie Xi was inexperienced in. He hadn\u2019t been to other collapsed quasi-worlds and didn\u2019t know what those worlds were like. He only thought there were thousands of collapsed worlds and countless possibilities apart from Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>In fact, only a handful of people could design such a complete quasi-world. In particular, this quasi-world was collapsing yet the system was still perfect.</p><br/><p>N glanced at Xie Xi and asked, \u201cIf you repair the quasi-world and then redesign it, the rating can improve right?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was nothing to hide and Xie Xi nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>N paused before seeming to speak with slight difficulty. \u201cOnce you are back in Central, can you please do me a favour?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared blankly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can help you complete the repair task here. After returning to Central, you can ask me for anything. I only hope that you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood. \u201cYou want me to help you repair the quasi-world that you designed?\u201d</p><br/><p>N nodded.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi explained, \u201cThe repair tasks I receive are random and I can\u2019t specify which world to go to.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, he was designated as the exclusive Repairer of Jiang Xie. However, if this was Jiang Xie\u2019s last collapsed world then he might be able to repair other quasi-worlds.</p><br/><p>N replied, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. As long as you receive my quasi-world, try to repair it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He suddenly thought that this Yunge master was a bit miserable. Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help thinking of Yan Zhe\u2019s previous words to him. Both Jiang Xie and N had touched the centre.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hesitated before opening his mouth. \u201cIf I meet your quasi-world, I will fix it but I have a question.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSay it, I\u2019ll do whatever I can.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his mouth again. \u201cYou touched the centre, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>N was silent.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi continued to ask. This was the best opportunity and he would regret it if he missed it. \u201cCan you tell me what you saw?\u201d</p><br/><p>N\u2019s eyes stared at Xie Xi, as if staring into the depths of his soul. \u201cYou want to know what X saw.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, there was nothing to hide. Xie Xi nodded. \u201cYes, I want to know.\u201d</p><br/><p>N still stared at Xie Xi and after a while, he muttered, \u201cX\u2019s luck is so good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

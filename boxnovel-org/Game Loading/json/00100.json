He struggled for a moment before closing his eyes and casually picking one. Any one of them would do since Jiang Xie had already used both of them.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t thought about it before but today, Xie Xi\u2019s face became hot and the hand holding the cup lacked strength.</p><br/><p>He spent a while mixing warm water before taking it to the study.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was still writing blessings. He was focused, his hands slender and the exposed arms were also powerful. Many times, Xie Xi felt that Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t a teacher who stood at the podium or a man holding a brush.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have the atmosphere on him but once he did these things, he made people feel it was natural.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was amazing. He made people feel that he could do everything well. This type of self-confidence that came from the heart was something that Xie Xi didn\u2019t have. Even if they were alone, even if they only had themselves, they both lived different lives.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s lips curved and his eyes were gentle. He was really fortunate to meet Jiang Xie, really lucky.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi came over with the water while Jiang Xie was writing. He got up just as Xie Xi leaned over, the two people nearly hitting each other.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie held his hand. \u201cBe careful.\u201d If the cup spilled then all the words he wrote would be gone.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes curved as he smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cTeacher is stained with ink?\u201d He pointed to the left cheek.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cIt isn\u2019t good to eat ink. Is it this side?\u201d He could feel which side it was but he deliberately missed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201d Xie Xi kept pointing.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie accurately missed the correct position. \u201cHere?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt helpless. \u201cDon\u2019t move. I\u2019ll wipe it for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie immediately put down his hand and moved his face closer. \u201cHurry and wipe it or I will become a big cat.\u201d</p><br/><p>He leaned closer, his different-coloured eyes making him look like a precious cat apart from the ink. Xie Xi picked up a paper towel and carefully cleaned it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at him. \u201cCan it be wiped off?\u201d</p><br/><p>They were close and it was like his ears were being blown on. Xie Xi was red as he said, \u201cI can but\u2026 you should hurry and wash you fash.\u201d A dry tissue wasn\u2019t clean.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled and deliberately asked, \u201cHow is your face so red?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d His eyes looked panicked and it was like a certain person\u2019s soul was gone.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it red?\u201d Xie Xi opened his mouth, his face even redder. He placed a hand on his face and reluctantly muttered, \u201cProbably\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie cleared his throat and helped find an excuse. \u201cIt is too hot in the house?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi immediately exclaimed, \u201cYes! The temperature is a little high! I\u2019ll go adjust the air conditioner!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stood still, his whole body feeling like it was floating. \u201cOkay.\u201d It was fine to lower the air conditioner since he was in desperate need of cooling.</p><br/><p>The two people finished writing the blessings and Xie Xi placed them on the ground to dry.</p><br/><p>Now that he was calm, he stared at his lame words and smiled. \u201cMy writing is so ugly.\u201d It was like an ugly duckling mixed with the swans.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke like he knew what Xie Xi was thinking. \u201cThe ugly duckling grew into the most beautiful swan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t interested in practicing his writing and said, \u201cUnfortunately, it won\u2019t grow up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. People who know how to feel appreciation will always regard them as treasures.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was too straightforward. Xie Xi\u2019s heart jumped and his hands clenched uncontrollably. Jiang Xie stopped and changed the topic to give Xie Xi a chance to breathe. \u201cLet\u2019s go. It isn\u2019t early and we have to buy the new year\u2019s goods.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>They changed their clothes to go out and Jiang Xie told him, \u201cJust go to a nearby supermarket. It is estimated that the roads would be blocked for the distant one.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the 26th of the 12th lunar month and many people were on holiday. The roads would undoubtedly be blocked.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had no opinion. He didn\u2019t think there was anything lacking at home but now was too convenient. He might not need to buy new year\u2019s goods but he could buy fresh ingredients.</p><br/><p>Still, it was New Year\u2019s Day and something would seem missing without the goods.</p><br/><p>He and Jiang Xie had never celebrated the new year with anyone else and they particularly valued it. There was a type of compensation mentality, as if they had to make up for what they missed previously. Even if they didn\u2019t have anything to buy, they should celebrate seriously!</p><br/><p>The two people parked the car and entered the supermarket together. In the past few months, they had often visited the supermarket together. They ate at home all day and buying ingredients and meat was indispensable.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie pushed the trolley while Xie Xi chose things. Jiang Xie asked, \u201cDo we went to add a new bowl for the new year?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we have enough bowls.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAdding a new bowl is the custom.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about it. \u201cI remember that adding a now bowl is to pray to add new people to the family in the coming year?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie really didn\u2019t know this. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should mean to have many children and grandchildren.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie instantly gave up on the new bowl. \u201cWe are enough. There is no need for more people.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words made Xie Xi jump and his thoughts become chaotic.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie added, \u201cWe should buy some paper cuttings. We can\u2019t only place blessings on the windows.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie picked up some window paper cuttings and threw them into the trolley.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at it and whispered, \u201cIsn\u2019t this used for marriage?\u201d There was a big \u2018double happiness\u2019 character on it. (A symbol of good luck, especially for marriage)</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. A new year is a happy event and we should have many blessings to place on the windows.\u201d</p><br/><p>XIe Xi stated, \u201cThis is a double happiness.\u201d</p><br/><p>The word was for marriage but there was also the meaning of double happiness!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie pointed to the character. \u201cYou are on the left and I am on the right. Won\u2019t we have happy things in the next year?\u201d (He is referring to the characters, which are . Wiki link with more info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Happiness_(calligraphy))</p><br/><p>Happy events were the same as happiness! Although a happy event was truly good! But\u2026 but\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie pondered. \u201cChild, your thoughts are very dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suddenly looked up, feeling like his mind had been read.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked him, \u201cIs it hard to be happy in the next year? Don\u2019t you want Teacher to be happy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He found he had no chance of winning when it came to \u2018reasoning.\u2019 Jiang Xie\u2019s plot succeeded and there was no need to mention how happy he was.</p><br/><p>How could Xiao Xie be so cute? It really made people want to fool him.</p><br/><p>Then Jiang Xie thought about it and felt distressed. The child was too lacking in love that he didn\u2019t know how to properly refuse when someone was good to him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t want Xie Xi to refuse. He was willing to fill up all of Xie Xi\u2019s missing things.</p><br/><p>They were almost checking out when Xie Xi remembered the soy sauce was almost finished. The soy sauce section was slightly far away. Jiang Xie told him, \u201cWait, I\u2019ll get a bottle.\u201d Xie Xi asked with no confidence, \u201cTeacher, can you recognize the right type?\u201d</p><br/><p>There were many soy sauce brands and he was afraid that Jiang Xie would buy the wrong one.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cIs it okay to buy the most expensive one?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Well, there was no problem.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt went to line up at the cash register. He was standing at the end of the queue when a voice was heard, \u201cXiao Xie?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was surprised and turned to see Sun Muqing pushing a trolley. He smiled, \u201cBrother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Muqing smiled slightly and scratched his head. \u201cIt looked like you from behind but I didn\u2019t expect it to be you.\u201d</p><br/><p>They hadn\u2019t seen each other for a while. Originally, Sun Muqing had private work that he asked Xie Xi to help with but Xie Xi accepted Jiang Xie\u2019s job. He couldn\u2019t do both and found Sun Muqing to apologize and refuse.</p><br/><p>Sun Muqing didn\u2019t say much. He only said that he would find Xie Xi if there was another opportunity.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt a bit guilty because of this and chatted for a bit longer.</p><br/><p>Sun Muqing asked him, \u201cAre you alone?\u201d He looked at Xie Xi\u2019s shopping trolley and found that many of them were expensive items from the import area.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was slightly nervous as he replied, \u201cThere is a family member.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Sun Muqing didn\u2019t ask much. \u201cYou look more energetic than you are at school.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi always bowed his head to hide from people at school and they generally didn\u2019t notice his face. Sun Muqing had more contact with him and knew that Xie Xi was beautiful. He just hadn\u2019t expected that Xie Xi would be so beautiful with no glasses and his hair pushed up.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled and didn\u2019t know how to answer. He was a bit nervous and afraid that Jiang Xie would return at this time. He felt it wouldn\u2019t be easy to explain if Jiang Xie was seen by Sun Muqing.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the person in front of Sun Muqing finished. Sun Muqing went forward and said, \u201cThen I\u2019m going first. I\u2019ll see you at school.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cI wish you a Happy New Year in advance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Muqing repeated the same words and checked out first.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi waited a bit longer before Jiang Xie came over with three bottles of soy sauce. \u201cThere was a promotion. It said that if we buy three, we can get one free.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi blinked. \u201cBuy three, get one free. Is the free one to be sent to us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s face had a question mark. \u201cIt isn\u2019t given at the time of settlement?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi laughed. \u201cOf course not! We have to bring it directly when we buy it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi handed the shopping trolley to him and said, \u201cWait, I\u2019ll go check.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was rare to see Teacher Jiang\u2019s mistake and Xiao Xie\u2019s mood was particularly good.</p><br/><p>The two of them bought a full trolley and filled three large shopping bags. After putting away the shopping trolley, Jiang Xie carried two bags while Xie Xi carried one.</p><br/><p>They placed the bags in the trunk of the car and Xie Xi sorted things again because he was afraid the bottles and cans would collide with each other and break.</p><br/><p>His back was turned so he didn\u2019t see Sun Muqing in the distance. Sun Muqing was far away and only saw Xie Xi acting intimately with a tall man.</p><br/><p>He froze and sneered in his heart, \u2018No wonder why my private work wasn\u2019t accepted. He has a gold lord and took advantage of his good looks.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t too early when Xie Xi and Jiang Xie returned home. Xie Xi started cooking while Jiang Xie wanted to help. Xie Xi couldn\u2019t stop him and had to give him the task of washing vegetables.</p><br/><p>Comrade Old Jiang did a very serious job and the skin of the tomatoes was almost washed away!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled at the sight and almost cut his own hand. They cooked the meal and both of them were a bit tired after eating.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI\u2019ll take a shower first.\u201d After going outside, the most comfortable thing was to take a shower.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie said he had something to deal with and went to the study.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi went to the bathroom with a bath towel. He just washed his head and his body was covered in bubbles. He was able to wash them off when the original rapid water flow suddenly\u2026 disappeared!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened and he couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>There was really nothing. Two drops of water dropped from the shower head and couldn\u2019t even wash away a small bubble.</p><br/><p>Why did the water stop? Surely they didn\u2019t forget to pay the water bill because of the new year?</p><br/><p>No, the water would stop just because they forget to pay the bill! A notice would just be posted on their door.</p><br/><p>It was over. Surely a water pipe wasn\u2019t broken\u2026</p><br/><p>Then Jiang Xie\u2019s voice was heard from outside, \u201cI received a text message stating that a water pipe in the area burst and is being repaired. Can you wash?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t wash. He was covered in bath bubbles!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

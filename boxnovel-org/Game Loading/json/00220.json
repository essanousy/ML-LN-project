W-What was this?</p><br/><p>H-How could he say such a thing? In addition, he spoke it without turning red or his heart jumping!</p><br/><p>In the memory, Jiang Xie pushed Xie Xi away, a monstrous anger brewing in his eyes. \u201cYou will only use these dirty means!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi still wasn\u2019t angry and his calm voice was filled with a bit of tenderness. \u201cWhat have you painstakingly done all of this for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie gritted his teeth.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled lightly. \u201cIsn\u2019t it just to be with me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t managed to say the seductive words when Jiang Xie interrupted. \u201cEnough.\u201d</p><br/><p>An unspeakable absurd feeling hit his chest and Jiang Xie experienced a greater insult.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi completely denied that one year, completely shredding the remaining beauty in Jiang Xie\u2019s heart and thoroughly leaving no hope behind for Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi clearly told Jiang Xie: This is who I am, a person who will use any means to benefit. Everything can be calculated. Even my body can be a bargaining chip.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, the external Xie Xi calmed down.</p><br/><p>Looking at this memory from the perspective of a bystander, it was obvious that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was angering Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Calling him to this office and speaking such heartless and even indifferent words was undoubtedly to anger Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>If Xie Xi really wanted Jiang Xie to let him go then he should never say such things.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had a very high EQ and could easily play people. How could such a person not know what Jiang Xie wanted?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said this on purpose to pour oil on the fire and make Jiang Xie angrier. This wasn\u2019t advantageous for him. Such an exaggerated move was tantamount to self-destruction.</p><br/><p>He smashed Jiang Xie\u2019s last remaining good feelings towards him and insulted the beautiful past.</p><br/><p>He broke his own path and pushed himself to the edge of a cliff. It was just like this floor to ceiling window had no glass and he would step out into the bloody sunset.</p><br/><p>He yearned for death.</p><br/><p>The external Xie Xi trembled after getting this message.</p><br/><p>In fact, Xie Xi and the person in the summary had different personalities. It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say they were two different people.</p><br/><p>This was nothing. After all, this Xie Xi wasn\u2019t clear to Taurus.</p><br/><p>It was because the main soul came to this world and Taurus intercepted certain memories of Xie Xi, fantasizing about him.</p><br/><p>In Jiang Xie\u2019s memories\u2026 there were quite a lot of bad parts.</p><br/><p>For example, in Atlantis, Xie Xi agreed to the proposal of five people in one breath. In the Holy Mountain and Demon Sea, he was a flirty rose who attracted many bees. Even in the collapsed world, the rational Xie Xi didn\u2019t understand love.</p><br/><p>These pieces connected together and became sugar that Jiang Xie didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or cry out.</p><br/><p>However, once separated, the pieces were like a living knife.</p><br/><p>According to the principles of the collapsing worlds, the souls would definitely prefer to accept more negative emotions. It wasn\u2019t surprising that they would fantasize about this type of Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>After all, the frequency of stepping on N boats was quite high.</p><br/><p>The N boats might be stably stepped on but it wasn\u2019t easy to play with the hearts of people.</p><br/><p>The previous Xie Xi might\u2019ve only thought up to here after seeing the summary.</p><br/><p>Now Xie Xi\u2019s understanding of Jiang Xie was deeper and he saw some details that could be easily overlooked.</p><br/><p>This Xie Xi was weary to his bones.</p><br/><p>The layout of this office was very metaphorical. The attitude he showed made it look as if everything was well-conceived and he could turn things over even at this point.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it\u2026 Xie Xi was more likely to push himself step by step to the brink.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was imagined by Taurus so he represented some of Jiang Xie\u2019s ideological tendencies.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s world-weariness, the real Xie Xi had long been aware of it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t have such tendencies now but before they met, Jiang Xie had been deeply sunk in it.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t mention anything else. The self-destructive method of designing quasi-worlds was very telling.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi faintly found the direction to repair this small world. It was probably connected to Taurus\u2019 heart knot.</p><br/><p>The summary seemed to be a dead end in every direction but in fact, there were many ways for Xie Xi to whitewash himself.</p><br/><p>The collapsed world might be full of malice but the souls themselves wanted to be saved.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he left a trace of himself behind, even in this dead end.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could pretend to lose his memories, could pretend that everything he did was a last resort or even give himself cancer\u2026</p><br/><p>However, this wouldn\u2019t open up Taurus\u2019 heart knot.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took a deep breath and thought the idea over in his head.</p><br/><p>There was nothing to see in the memories afterwards.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie annexed Chengyu and became the new owner of the building. However, he left the top office to Xie Xi. It had a strong feeling of revenge and irony.</p><br/><p>Rather than Jiang Xie imprisoning Xie Xi here, it was better to say that Xie Xi himself didn\u2019t want to leave.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was immersed in self-contradiction all the time. He decided that Xie Xi didn\u2019t leave in order to please Jiang Xie and find a way to turn things around, but he couldn\u2019t let go.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t give Xie Xi any good face but he couldn\u2019t help wanting to see Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>It was very painful to fall in love with a scum. The even more painful thing was not being able to stop despite knowing this person was a scum.</p><br/><p>This was the greatest sorrow of love.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was now going to play a scum. If he really wanted the wound to heal, he had to squeeze out the pus. Pain was inevitable but once it was over, it would no longer ache in the future.</p><br/><p>Once Xie Xi tidied everything up, the sky was dark. With these memories, the mood in his heart was completely different as he gazed at the floor to ceiling windows.</p><br/><p>The sunset was beautiful but it was about to fall. A new sun would rise tomorrow but it wouldn\u2019t be the same as yesterday. If a day was a life, the sunset was already at the end of the road.</p><br/><p>Around 7 o\u2019clock, Jiang Xie returned. Xie Xi had thought back and forth and knew what to do.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie took off his jacket and tie, glanced at Xie Xi and went to the kitchen.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t say anything. He didn\u2019t deliberately get close to Jiang Xie like he did in the previous two days, nor did he take the initiative to help. He sat quietly and turned the pages of his book.</p><br/><p>It seemed there was no difference between Jiang Xie coming back or not.</p><br/><p>More than half an hour later, Jiang Xie placed the dishes on the table. Xie Xi put down the book and sat opposite him. He didn\u2019t speak nor did Jiang Xie speak. The two people ate the meal in silence.</p><br/><p>On the table were two meat dishes and shrimp soup.</p><br/><p>It was very warm home-cooked food and the taste was delicious. Even the rice was cooked just right. The pearl rice grains were crystal clear, beautiful and delicious.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was actually very hungry. He wanted to eat Jiang Xie\u2019s cooked rice but he had to hold back and show the appearance of having no appetite.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie glanced at the rice bowl that Xie Xi never touched and said nothing. For the meal, Xie Xi only drank a few mouthfuls of soup.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie finally opened his mouth. \u201cWhat do you want to eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is nothing I want to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked, \u201cYou aren\u2019t hungry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the end of the conversation, Jiang Xie got up and went to the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was so hungry that he quickly took out the god\u2019s wisdom and drew something to fill up his stomach. His acting wasn\u2019t good-like and he was disgraced when his stomach started growling.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was still reading by the time Jiang Xie came out after washing. Jiang Xie frowned but resisted not mentioning dinner.</p><br/><p>He returned to the lounge. At 10 o\u2019clock, Xie Xi went to bed on time and slept next to this person.</p><br/><p>The two of them had no extra words. They slept on the bed but they seemed separated by a river that they couldn\u2019t cross.</p><br/><p>This lasted for three days. Xie Xi not only didn\u2019t eat at night, but he also didn\u2019t eat breakfast and lunch.</p><br/><p>Of course, he secretly gave himself extra meals but this wasn\u2019t known to Jiang Xie. All Jiang Xie saw was Xie Xi sitting all day without eating anything.</p><br/><p>On the third night, Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t help himself. He stared at Xie Xi and asked, \u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi secretly ate two cheese baked buns and held it very well. He really wasn\u2019t interested in the food in front of him. He looked up at Jiang Xie. \u201cHrmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie put down his chopsticks in a cold manner. \u201cAre you injuring yourself to gain my confidence? Do you think I still care?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also put down his chopsticks. \u201cI\u2019d like to know more about what you want to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie frowned.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had waited for such a conversation. He had long sorted out what he had to say and now he could control his tone just right.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at Jiang Xie and spoke in a flat voice. \u201cI have nothing to explain regarding six years ago. I approached you for the sake of the Lance project.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time they walked about this topic. He had known it for a long time but Jiang Xie still felt a stab of pain in his heart.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi continued, \u201cAt that time, you didn\u2019t understand but now it should be clear. Sitting in this position with so much work, there is no greater interest. How could I have time to accompany you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cChief Xie truly has no scruples.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s lips curved. \u201cWhen you wear women\u2019s clothing, other women can\u2019t compare.\u201d He might be reading a script but Xie Xi really meant it. The adult Jiang Xie wearing women\u2019s clothing could scare people to death but the 17 year old Jiang Xie looked really beautiful.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes were cold. \u201cChief Xie shouldn\u2019t wear women\u2019s clothing or no women can match you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was fierce in his heart but he maintained the indifferent smile on his face. \u201cThen, do you still like my appearance?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sneered.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cJiang Xie, we are both adults.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at him. \u201cSo what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s tone was slow. \u201cI took your project six yous ago and you took my Chengyu six years later. Isn\u2019t that enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>A feeling of irritation filled his heart. He didn\u2019t want to answer at all because he cared about different things.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi continued, \u201cThe king was defeated. My skills aren\u2019t as good as you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie laughed loudly. \u201cThen you are conceding defeat?\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi poked straight at his heart. \u201cI lost Chengyu but what did you get?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart was stabbed by a knife.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke in a cool tone, \u201cThe work is like this. My means weren\u2019t glorious but the way you took Chengyu\u2019s shares was no better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s throat was numb. \u201cI didn\u2019t deceive anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes flashed as he stared at the other person. \u201cDo you like me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The words opened the dusty wound and the paralyzed blood that had never healed was exposed to the sun.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t answer because he really did like this person!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t need his answer. He just wanted to rip the imagination apart and pull out the reality. \u201cIf you like my appearance, I can sleep with you until you\u2019re tired\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s voice was low. \u201cStop it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t stop. \u201cUntil you are tired of it. If you like me as a person, I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t give you the feelings you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie looked up sharply.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him and spoke in a calm tone with no excessiveness. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in any feelings, let alone love. The so-called long-term is a child\u2019s lie. We are all adults and understand that there are too many variables in life. The illusory thing called love is worthless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie finally asked the question that he been suppressed for six years and always wanted to know the answer to.</p><br/><p>\u201cSix years ago, did you have no feelings for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cI appreciated you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was quiet. \u201cIf it is love, then no.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie clenched his fists and his voice was hoarse. \u201cIf I say that I will give Chengyu back to you if you fall in love with me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard this sentence and his heart was cut into many pieces.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie regretted it after asking such a question. He despised himself but he still wanted to ask.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heartbeat was steady as he said, \u201cIf you want, we can try it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie heard this answer and his heart sank to the bottom of the valley.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

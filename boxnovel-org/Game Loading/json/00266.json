The fact that it was bright could only represent that its master was around.</p><br/><p>The man was stunned and only whispered after a long time, \u201cSearch the capital and lock down His Majesty\u2019s position.\u201d</p><br/><p>The guard replied, \u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>The hall emptied and the man stood still. His appearance was hidden by the cloak and the only thing that fell outside was the white hair and clenched fists.</p><br/><p>It was a very beautiful hand even if it was tightly held in the form of a fist. It could be imagined how perfect the hand would be when it was spread out.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t aware that his whereabouts were revealed in this manner. He was currently panicking about his little lion\u2026</p><br/><p>Was it this bad? They just slept together and the little lion entered the estrus period?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to die in bed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie quickly shot up and almost fell off the bed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to pull him up but couldn\u2019t. \u201cLittle\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t continue because he saw Jiang Xie\u2019s risen clothes.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie also noticed his gaze and turned red as he rushed into the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also felt an awkwardness from his own body. After all, he just had such a dream.</p><br/><p>He weakly drew a cleaning ball and washed his clothes. The advantage of his clothes being white was that the cleaning ball couldn\u2019t make it whiter.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t seem to be estrus yet? Xie Xi thought about the situation described by Huer\u2019s mother and felt that if it was the true estrus period, the little lion wouldn\u2019t be able to leave so calmly.</p><br/><p>Was it just that after growing up, the lion had thoughts about him? Xie Xi never doubted that Jiang Xie would like himself or that Jiang Xie would fall in love at first sight. After all, he had witnessed it so many times.</p><br/><p>It was just a bit wrong this time. Xie Xi was afraid to do anything when his body was so bad. The little lion was young and vigorous. How could Xie Xi endure it? Thus, he couldn\u2019t drag it out and had to hurry to find a way to cure his body!</p><br/><p>On one side, Xie Xi was suffering while on the other side, Jiang Xie was also in shock.</p><br/><p>He kissed Xie Xi, it was a real kiss. It wasn\u2019t a dream or a fantasy. It was a real touch on Xie Xi\u2019s dry lips. It was as beautiful as the dream\u2026 no, it was better than the dream. It was soft and sweet enough to paralyze his heart.</p><br/><p>After the unspeakable taste was an abyss where he couldn\u2019t see any light. Xie Xi\u2019s panicked expression and the uneasiness at which he clung to the quilt were deadly vipers that bit at Jiang Xie\u2019s internal organs.</p><br/><p>He was\u2026 surely disgusted. Jiang Xie clung to the edge of the bathtub as if to crush the wood.</p><br/><p>What should he do? Was Xie Xi disappointed in him?</p><br/><p>By the time Jiang Xie emerged from the bathroom, Xie Xi was already dressed neatly.</p><br/><p>Neither of them spoke or looked at each other.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie thought a lot\u2026 it didn\u2019t matter if Xie Xi scolded him or felt disgusted.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t leave Xie Xi now. He could only safely leave after the other person\u2019s body was healed.</p><br/><p>The thought of leaving caused Jiang Xie\u2019s heart to split into two halves.</p><br/><p>In his short life, the memories of his family were limited to his father\u2019s kind smile and his sister\u2019s warm words.</p><br/><p>He was too young when the accident happened at home and it was a miracle that the little lion could escape the disaster.</p><br/><p>Then there was only Xie Xi in his life.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s body was weak but this man gave him the warmth of a family, working tirelessly to treat people and exchange food for Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>The people of the village said that Jiang Xie was obedient and did all the housework. It was appropriate for Xie Xi to take care of him.</p><br/><p>However, without Xie Xi, the young Jiang Xie could only starve to death. It was the man with thin shoulders who really supported the family.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie knew all about it and was very grateful and willing to do everything he could. He didn\u2019t know why such admiration had changed.</p><br/><p>Why did he have dreams like that, why did he think too much about Xie Xi, why was he so greedy?</p><br/><p>Why\u2026</p><br/><p>Why was his beating heart full of attachment to Xie Xi? It was just estrus. Why did he want a male like himself? Why? Jiang Xie didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>It was just that the thought of separating made him as sad as if there was only darkness in front of him.</p><br/><p>There was a knock on the door and the staff member asked, \u201cAre the guests awake? Breakfast is ready.\u201d Last night, they had mentioned the time they would get up which was why the employee came.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cWe\u2019ve woken up. You can enter.\u201d</p><br/><p>The employee opened the door and served a simple breakfast. \u201cThere is a bowl of rice porridge and meat. The eggs and side dishes are served in the hotel. The two of you will have to go there.\u201d</p><br/><p>The employee put down the things to leave when Xie Xi asked him, \u201cIs there a spare room today? We\u2019ll be staying here for a few more days.\u201d</p><br/><p>The employee asked, \u201cYou want another room?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain yet. If someone checks out in the afternoon then I\u2019ll keep it for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thanked him.</p><br/><p>The entire time, Jiang Xie didn\u2019t speak. In fact, it was enough for the two of them to live in this room. The hotel had prepared two sets of bedding and it was very spacious.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart was bitter. It wasn\u2019t easy for Xie Xi to save money and now he had to pay twice as much.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t mention the morning incident and treated Jiang Xie as if nothing happened.</p><br/><p>However, Jiang Xie was sharp and noticed that Xie Xi was keeping a distance from him.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t face to face when eating and in the carriage ride, they weren\u2019t next to each other. Even at the medical center, Xie Xi went up the stairs alone.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t dare take the initiative to help and could only carefully follow along, afraid of this person falling.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s faint alienation was torture for Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>He thought he should be thankful and this was the best result, but he couldn\u2019t control his sense of reason. The huge sense of loss was like a collapsed dome thrown at him.</p><br/><p>He had never thought it but after being so clearly rejected, he felt very uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>They lined up at the medical hall and it was their turn around noon.</p><br/><p>The doctor was famous in the city and had many banners hanging behind him such as \u2018Miracle Doctor\u2019 and \u2018Doctor\u2019s Heart.\u2019 The doctor himself was kind-hearted. Despite working all morning, he wasn\u2019t irritable at all.</p><br/><p>Once Xie Xi sat down, the doctor asked, \u201cDo you have a past medical record?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cI was previously in a remote village and haven\u2019t seen anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor didn\u2019t say anything and gave him several tests. This world was quite mixed. It had an ancient style but a lot of technology was also developed.</p><br/><p>The doctor\u2019s brow became tighter and tighter. Xie Xi saw him like this and knew that it wasn\u2019t curable. On the side, Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cHow is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor paused and asked Jiang Xie, \u201cYou are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The villagers called them father and son because they had seen Jiang Xie as a child.</p><br/><p>In front of an unfamiliar person, the tall Jiang Xie was more like Xie Xi\u2019s brother</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cHe is my family. Doctor, you can talk directly to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The word \u2018family\u2019 was quite vague but this was a private matter and it wasn\u2019t convenient for outsiders to ask.</p><br/><p>The doctor looked at Xie Xi\u2019s demeanour and sighed, the thoughts in his heart unknown. \u201cI will give you a prescription. Go back and take it a while to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood that this meant there was no cure but Jiang Xie didn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to let Jiang Xie worry and answered, \u201cThank you, Doctor.\u201d</p><br/><p>He took his prescription and Jiang Xie immediately stood up. \u201cI\u2019ll go and get the medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he left, Xie Xi asked, \u201cDoctor, is there really no cure for my illness?\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor looked at him. \u201cI can\u2019t do it. In today\u2019s world, if there is anyone who can cure such a serious illness, I\u2019m afraid it is only the national teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shocked.</p><br/><p>The doctor shook his head. \u201cIt is just that the national teacher is busy with the country\u2019s affairs and has no time to see ordinary people.\u201d</p><br/><p>The implication was that even if there was a cure\u2026 Xie Xi couldn\u2019t afford it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t thought too much previously but now he had to pay attention to the Tiger Country\u2019s national teacher.</p><br/><p>This was Leo\u2019s quasi-world. How was this national teacher so important.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help thinking about when he saw Virgo when entering this quasi-world.</p><br/><p>It shouldn\u2019t be\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t unwilling to admit it but he felt it was impossible.</p><br/><p>It was true that there was an angel and demon version in Gemini\u2019s world but in essence, it was Gemini and only the memories were sealed.</p><br/><p>This was Leo\u2019s quasi-world. How could the collapsed worlds mix together?</p><br/><p>Wait, Xie Xi suddenly woke up. Collapsing 12 Boundaries itself was 12 broken worlds!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart jumped at such a thought. Was the national teacher really Virgo?</p><br/><p>The quasi-worlds of two constellations became one small world?</p><br/><p>It was broken\u2026 He only cared about the little lion and completely neglected Virgo. Wasn\u2019t this ruining himself?</p><br/><p>At this time, Jiang Xie came back with the medicine.</p><br/><p>The two people said goodbye to the doctor and went back to the hotel together.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought of many things along the way. He was the beast king. If Virgo was the national teacher then they must have a pre-existing summary!</p><br/><p>Why did he disappear? What happened with the national teacher\u2019s betrayal of the beast king? In addition, how did his body become like this?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was thinking about business but Jiang Xie thought he was still troubled by this morning.</p><br/><p>He was somber as he told Xie Xi, \u201cOnce you take this medicine and become well, I..\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t understand what he was saying. \u201cHrmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cI always wanted to walk around and see the scenery of the Tiger Country.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi let go of Virgo and first appeased the little lion. \u201cWhat will you do if your estrus arrives?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie started to hate these words. In order to let Xie Xi felt at ease, he replied, \u201c\u2026I can meet the person I like when I go out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled and didn\u2019t answer.</p><br/><p>What the hell was this?</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t clarify things, the little lion would want to run. If he did, this body would kill him. In order to cure the disease, he had to go to the national teacher. The national teacher was likely to be another Jiang XIe and this\u2026 Xie Xi realized the long-lost taste of death.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t say anything else and took his clothes to go to the other room.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t sure what to do and could only let him go.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t sleep all night because he didn\u2019t want to have that dream again.</p><br/><p>Since he would dream of Xie Xi when he closed his eyes, he wouldn\u2019t sleep.</p><br/><p>Once he was too sleepy, he wouldn\u2019t have the heart to dream those messy things again.</p><br/><p>He would be leaving soon and it was absolutely impossible between him and Xie Xi. Rather than letting Xie Xi hate him, it was better to separate.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could be considered to have a good sleep and didn\u2019t dream anything.</p><br/><p>He was still a bit tired when waking up because he had too many worries.</p><br/><p>He had to find a way to see the national teacher. As long as he saw the person, he would know if it was Jiang Xie or not.</p><br/><p>Once he judged Virgo\u2019s presence, he could decide what to do next.</p><br/><p>However, how could he just meet the national teacher?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was anxious all morning and couldn\u2019t eat breakfast.</p><br/><p>He looked up and saw that Jiang Xie was also tired. He couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cYou didn\u2019t sleep well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi requested, \u201cAccompany me for a walk today.\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t make any progress staying in his room. He would go out and have a look.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly for Xie Xi, there was big progress the moment he left his room.</p><br/><p>This hotel was a three storey building and they lived on the second floor. The two people finished breakfast in their room and went out to find it was silent.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi just walked down the stairs and saw a group of kneeling person.</p><br/><p>The man in the front was particularly eye-catching. He wore a white cloak as he knelt on one knee, his cold voice incompatible with this little hotel. \u201cYour Majesty, I am requesting you to please return to the palace.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

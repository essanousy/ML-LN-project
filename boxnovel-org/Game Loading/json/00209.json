He couldn\u2019t sleep last night so he had been reading a book. At this time, he waved his hands and the stack of books on the coffee table fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>The soundproofing effect of the house was ordinary and Kang Hong asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did the doorbell scare the cat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie thought of last night\u2019s matter and how could he dare to let Kang Hong in? He went to open the door but blocked it. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I accidentally knocked some books to the ground.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong wondered, \u201cDid you stay up late reading books?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was hard to explain what happened last night or let anyone else know about it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cI will take him to the check up. You should go back first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong pleaded, \u201cBring me with you. There are many pets at the pet hospital and I want to see them.\u201d</p><br/><p>No wonder why he woke up so early in the morning. Jiang Xie refused harshly, \u201cI can do it alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>His cold face was very frightening. Kang Hong was a bit shaken but he knew that Jiang Xie didn\u2019t like to be in contact with people. Thus, he compromised. \u201cI won\u2019t go but let me see the cat.\u201d He got up too early to see a group of cats and dogs. It was fine if he didn\u2019t see the dogs but he should at least get to see the kitty!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t let him in. \u201cHe is still sleeping.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t wake him up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t step aside.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong sensed something strange and blinked. \u201cYou\u2026 is there someone else in the house?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, Kang Hong was a teenage boy. \u201cOld Jiang, you stayed silent about a partner? And you actually brought them back to bed? Oh, I\u2019m going! I won\u2019t look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie thought about last night\u2019s kiss and really felt guilty.</p><br/><p>His expression was equivalent to agreeing. Kang Hong spoke mysteriously, \u201cIf I take the cat to the check up, you can continue\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow.\u201d Thankfully, the cat strolled around and moved around Jiang Xie\u2019s legs.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cSweetie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong picked up the cat and sighed. \u201cDid you miss me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201cI think you are a big-headed ghost.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong smiled. \u201cYou must\u2019ve thought of me. Listening to these meows is too sweet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPut him down.\u201d Jiang Xie\u2019s ice cold voice was suddenly heard.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong was shocked and even Xie Xi was stunned. He looked up to see the teenager\u2019s eyes were bright. He was angry?</p><br/><p>Kang Hong\u2019s senses returned. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie grabbed Xie Xi back and slammed the door shut.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong, \u201c???\u201d What happened?</p><br/><p>Based on Jiang Xie\u2019s expression, Kang Hong thought he hadn\u2019t been holding a cat but Jiang Xie\u2019s naked girlfriend! Hey\u2026 what nonsense was this?</p><br/><p>The hugged Xie Xi clearly felt Jiang Xie\u2019s heartbeat. What happened?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi might not like being held by Kang Hong but wasn\u2019t Jiang Xie\u2019s reaction too big?</p><br/><p>After all, he was a cat now.</p><br/><p>Oh\u2026 Xie Xi changed back into a cat and this started when Kang Hong rang the doorbell.</p><br/><p>At the time, Xie Xi was afraid of being seen by people. It wasn\u2019t as simple as \u2018ghost eyes\u2019 and it was likely he would be grabbed to do research on.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi might be able to escape most danger using the god\u2019s wisdom but he didn\u2019t want to cause trouble.</p><br/><p>He was here to find the true spirit, not to turn this small world upside down.</p><br/><p>Thus, he hurriedly got up to find a place to hide.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the house was too small and there wasn\u2019t a reliable hiding spot. As it happened, he stood in the sunlight and was illuminated by the warm sun. He felt something warm flow through his body and then\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw his cat paws.</p><br/><p>He turned back into a cat? Could he change back to a cat in the sunlight?</p><br/><p>Was he a cat or a bat?</p><br/><p>There was no time to think. The little cat hurriedly hid the clothes in the bed. If Kang Hong searched the house and found the clothes then Jiang Xie\u2026</p><br/><p>After finishing this, Xie Xi strolled out to Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Who knew that Jiang Xie would actually be angry?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Xie Xi asked Jiang Xie but his words had once again became meows.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie bowed his head and saw the black and white cat in his arms.</p><br/><p>The cat was looking up at him like normal, like everything last night was a dream that never existed.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, it was a dream. How could a kitten become a person?</p><br/><p>Had he been alone for too long that he was hallucinating?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s complexion was white and his voice was hoarse. \u201cI dreamt that you became a man last night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart was empty. This feeling was too uncomfortable and unspeakable, as if it was a hard to touch star. Once he arrived at the star, he found it was just a reflection in the water.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cWhat are you thinking? How can that be a dream?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie recovered his wits and touched Xie Xi. \u201cI\u2019ll get you some food.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He just changed back into a cat and Jiang Xie was \u2018turning his back and not recognizing a person\u2019?</p><br/><p>A cat becoming a human might seem like a dream but could a dream be as realistic as that?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s head turned as he thought about the space under the blanket.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie would believe it and not think he was dreaming when he saw the clothes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi ran back to the bedroom and Jiang Xie followed.</p><br/><p>The clothes were under the covers. He drilled into them and tried to push the clothes out.</p><br/><p>However, the quilt was heavy for the cat and his pushing and panting didn\u2019t succeed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw the small body arching and was softhearted. \u201cEat first and then I will accompany you to play.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome and see!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie heard the miserable calling and thought Xie Xi couldn\u2019t find the exit. He quickly opened the quilt to let the cat out.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi showed Jiang Xie the pants he had been wearing last night using his mouth.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was really stunned.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi panted and told him, \u201cYou should believe it this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie picked up the clothes and frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t play with clothes later. It is a pity to tear them up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cHrmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>The kitten looked down\u2026</p><br/><p>He had been trying to push it out of the bed for too long and ended up tearing the thin pants into strips!</p><br/><p>The clothes under the blankets were also in strips. The evidence was ruined by his own claws, causing Xie Xi to be angry.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was thinking about last night\u2019s dream\u2026</p><br/><p>The kitten became a man and wore these pants. Then he cut a hole in the back of them.</p><br/><p>How could there be such a shameless dream?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie felt that he wasn\u2019t far from madness.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t willing. He might\u2019ve torn the pants but if Jiang Xie took a closer look, he would see the hole that was deliberately cut out. Jiang Xie, quickly look!</p><br/><p>Poor Jiang Xie didn\u2019t dare to look\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw the evidence wasn\u2019t good and could only climb up to Jiang Xie\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie thought the kitten wanted a hug and hugged him, \u201cOkay, don\u2019t tear my clothes in the future\u2026\u201d He wondered to himself, \u201cAre a kitten\u2019s claws that sharp?\u201d</p><br/><p>A kitten probably didn\u2019t have such sharp claws but Xie Xi\u2019s qualifications weren\u2019t ordinary. After becoming a cat, he kept a bit of it and turned the cat claws into a \u2018weapon.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie placed Xie Xi on his shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s go to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned him, \u201cTurn your head.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie could only hear the meows and turned his head. \u201cHrmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi kissed him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi waited for himself to become a human.</p><br/><p>Wait, wait, wait. He waited for half a minute.</p><br/><p>Cat Xie didn\u2019t give him and kissed him again, again and again\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie put him down \u201cOkay, don\u2019t eat me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026Who wants to eat you? I am kissing you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, they were all meows.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie placed the kitten in front of the cat bowl. \u201cEat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was full of anger and how could he eat? He thought about it and came up with a trick.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t believe him? Xie Xi might not be able to transform into a person at any time but he could show off his uniqueness.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi cried out, attracting Jiang Xie\u2019s attention. Then he summoned the god\u2019s wisdom and sketch pen.</p><br/><p>The kitten looked at Jiang Xie, waiting for the man who didn\u2019t believe him to be surprised.</p><br/><p>The result\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie ignored the god\u2019s wisdom and sketch pen, touching Xie Xi\u2019s small head. \u201cEat.\u201d Then he got up and left.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi froze. \u201cYou can\u2019t see it!\u201d The cat brought two things out of thin air. Did he see nothing?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie really didn\u2019t see anything. He grabbed his phone and looked up the address of the hospital to do a check up for Little Rose\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s senses returned. The god\u2019s wisdom and sketch pen were things that didn\u2019t belong to the quasi-world. Then Jiang Xie of this quasi-world couldn\u2019t see them?</p><br/><p>This trick didn\u2019t work then he could only draw something on the spot.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi picked up the god\u2019s wisdom and sketch pen and ran to Jiang Xie\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was still despondent.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi called out again and started drawing something with the sketch pen.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t see the sketch pen and god\u2019s wisdom but he could see the kitten shaking his head.</p><br/><p>His heart was tense as he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is it stuck?\u201d Did cat food get stuck while eating?</p><br/><p>You\u2019re stuck!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi drew a few crooked strokes. Fortunately, the sketch pen had a self-correcting function and it was easy to show what was painted on the god\u2019s wisdom.</p><br/><p>There was a bang and a bottle of milk appeared.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi persisted and drew a sandwich, this time with a plate.</p><br/><p>He considered that Jiang Xie was growing and had to eat more meat. Thus, Xie Xi drew a Kobe steak\u2026</p><br/><p>Well, there was cutlery as well. The knife and fork used in Love is a Dead End came to mind and he directly drew it. It seemed like he was still missing a placemat? The drawing addictive Xie Xi drew it.</p><br/><p>The teenager who was in a daze finally recovered. \u201cThis\u2026 is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His table was full of delicious food. Not just that, there were also table mats, beautiful candlesticks and beautiful cutlery inlaid with rubies\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt it was almost over. He was just about to put down a sketch pen when he remembered something and drew a laptop.</p><br/><p>There was no other reason. Jiang Xie was too poor to have a computer. He had a phone but the phone was too small for Cat Xie\u2019s claws to tap on them.</p><br/><p>After seeing the laptop, Jiang Xie pinched his thighs. It was tioo incredible and he couldn\u2019t dream of such a thing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t speak but he could type with the laptop. He opened a document and tapped, \u201cLast night wasn\u2019t a dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at the words and he forgot to blink.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi angrily continued typing. \u201cYou thought it was a dream!\u201d This morning was really exhausting.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t feel disbelief anymore and now fully believed. Great joy filled his chest and he didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Jiang Xie tried to get his voice back. \u201cDid you do all of it?\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi typed, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d It was just to communicate with him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie finally couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tapped with some embarrassment, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that I\u2019m your\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t type out the next words.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart trembled as if it had been hit by a heavy hammer. It turned out that he could become dizzy from too much joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Rose.\u201d Jiang Xie called out, as if finishing the words on the screen.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes shook and he jumped into the other person\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie cautiously held him and asked in a choked up voice. \u201cWill you stay with me all the time?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI will go wherever you are.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t understand the meows but he felt indescribable warmth.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi jumped down and tapped on the keyboard. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t drive me away, I will stay with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart tightened and he said, \u201cI will never do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi typed again, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be afraid in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t quite understand.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cIf I am here, no one can bully you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s throat tightened.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi added, \u201cI will protect you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished his words when Jiang Xie swept him up and hugged him tightly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

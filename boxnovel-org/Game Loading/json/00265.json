Now he was rebellious in adulthood?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t angry and found it strangely funny.</p><br/><p>After all, the main body was an old-fashioned man who always treated Xie Xi as a child.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told the soul, \u201cI\u2019m certainly not your father\u2026\u201d His words were on the focus to stop it from being a stumbling block to their love. \u201cStill, even as friends, I am entitled to worry about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>His mature sentence made Jiang Xie calm down and fell ashamed.</p><br/><p>What was he doing? This was clearly his fault but he was becoming angry with Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had been so kind to him. Xie Xi went to the village with such a body to treat the villagers. For what reason? It was to get Jiang Xie food!</p><br/><p>Now Xie Xi was going to accompany Jiang Xie to the city to find him a wife.</p><br/><p>The sickly man was so good to him while he was so fierce.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wanted to apologize but then he thought of his heart full of feelings the other person didn\u2019t understand and couldn\u2019t say a word.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m only going to the city to help you through estrus. I also\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Halfway through the sentence, Jiang Xie\u2019s heart sank. He remembered the bouquet of flowers and the villagers\u2019 words.</p><br/><p>Was Xie Xi going to White Tiger City to find a companion for himself?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was well aware that Xie Xi couldn\u2019t look at any tigers in the village\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI also want to visit a famous doctor to see if there is a cure for this illness.\u201d Xie Xi finished his words.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie immediately replied, \u201cYou take medicine very day and isn\u2019t the effect good?\u201d</p><br/><p>He stared at Xie Xi all day and knew that this person took medicine in the morning and before going to bed. He thought it was a cure but the cycle was long and Xie Xi would slowly recover.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was afraid this person would be worried and didn\u2019t dare say they were temporary painkillers. He only said, \u201cThe medicinal effect has worsened after a long time. I want to go to the city to find someone to help me retune it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment these words emerged, Jiang Xie abandoned his cranky thoughts. \u201cThen we will set off as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy so urgent? Pack your things and have a good night\u2019s sleep. We will go in the morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cThen I\u2019ll go and pack our things first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><br/><p>The matter of sleeping made Xie Xi\u2019s waist feel a bit sore. The three consecutive nights of dirty dreams made him feel a bit sour.</p><br/><p>The two people didn\u2019t have many things to bring with them. There were some clothes to change into and some tiger currency exchanged in the village.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi might be so weak he had to catch his breath with every step but his skill as a \u2018brilliant doctor\u2019 was enough to support him.</p><br/><p>Not only did he exchange a lot of food from the village for Jiang Xie, he also saved a lot of money and it now came in handy.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was packing up Xie Xi\u2019s clothes and saw the snow-white clothes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had used the cleaning ball for three nights and the clothes weren\u2019t dirty at all!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wondered, \u201cWhy do I remember these clothes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi cleared his throat. \u201cI wanted to say that you washed the clothes to clean. Huer\u2019s mother asked what soap you used?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie shook his head. \u201cI just washed it as usual.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d Xie Xi desperately placed the blame on him. \u201cYou can go to the laundry shop to make money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was still thinking.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi threw the killing blow. \u201cOkay, what\u2019s so good about a man\u2019s clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was like a fire that ignited a mess in Jiang Xie\u2019s head. He realized that he was holding Xie Xi\u2019s clothes. Only then did he discover that he was staring at the last barrier wrapped around Xie Xi\u2019s body without thinking.</p><br/><p>In an instant, the snowy white clothes were like a hot yam as they were placed into the bag by Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed with relief and felt that he had muddled through, as long as there weren\u2019t any more strange dreams tonight.</p><br/><p>It shouldn\u2019t happen anymore\u2026 even if it was in a dream, he had vented and shouldn\u2019t be so \u2018dissatisfied.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought for a long time before going to bed and finally took the snowy white clothes out of the bag and put them on.</p><br/><p>It was better to be safe than sorry. The old boatman used to walking on a steep rope had to understand how to carefully steer the ship.</p><br/><p>He slept and opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was immediately kissed. Why did it happen again? Xie Xi pushed away the man holding him. \u201cToday\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished when he felt a tingling from his butt. He turned and saw that he actually had a cat tail. He noticed Jiang Xie\u2019s line of sight and show his ears. Jiang Xie immediately leaned over and kissed the furry cat ears.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>How did he become like this?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie held the tail and stated. \u201cIt\u2019s so cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>The low voice made Xie Xi\u2019s legs soft and he couldn\u2019t stand it.</p><br/><p>After waking up, Xie Xi was frozen. What was this? Did he subconsciously want to dress like a cat and have sex with Jiang Xie?</p><br/><p>People said that the things you thought about during the day would appear in your dream at night but Xie Xi swore that he had never thought about something like this!</p><br/><p>Why did this dream appear?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi leaned against the bed and had to re-examine himself\u2026</p><br/><p>The lion had given up on himself.</p><br/><p>He was becoming more and more absurd. He actually dreamt of Xie Xi as a half-beastman. Was he a black tiger? The ears and tail were black and somewhat like a kitten. They were soft and sensitive, one touch making them twitch.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had slept all night but the fire wasn\u2019t turned off. This fantasy meant he couldn\u2019t wait to fall asleep again.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the movements next door made him calm down. He took a cold shower and warmed up the porridge left from last night.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi seemed to be thinking about things. He sat down and had a soulless expression.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at this person quietly. He thought that the hair was black as ink, the skin as white as snow and the neckline was very good\u2026 he was full of gestures when he was excited and raised his head to let Jiang Xie kiss him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed. \u201cLittle Xie, can you help me with the meat?\u201d He normally ate porridge because he didn\u2019t dare eat a lot. He had no appetite this morning but he would be on the road all day. If he didn\u2019t eat then his body would have even less energy.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s senses returned but he didn\u2019t dare get up. \u201cIf you eat that, you will be thirsty on the road.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt like he was still in the dream. Why did he feel that the little lion\u2019s voice was a bit\u2026</p><br/><p>He replied, \u201cIt\u2019s okay if I only eat a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyelids lowered. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He got up in a slightly awkward manner but Xie Xi was also worrying about something and didn\u2019t notice.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie went to the kitchen and looked down at the tent in his pants, his heart very uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>He really couldn\u2019t go on like this anymore\u2026</p><br/><p>Such dreams couldn\u2019t be done anymore\u2026</p><br/><p>Before they set off, many people in the village came to send them away. Everyone felt that the father and son wouldn\u2019t come back and were feeling very sad.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also felt strange. At first, he was bullied by the naughty children but after becoming familiar with them, the people here lived a very simple but steady life.</p><br/><p>Huer\u2019s mother wiped her tears. \u201cMr Xie is free to often come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Huer was still childish. \u201cLittle Xie, came back with your wife and play!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke for him, \u201cIf he really marries then we must come back for a party.\u201d</p><br/><p>People were happy and talked about city wives.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was due to the last sentence but along the way, Jiang Xie didn\u2019t talk that much to Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also couldn\u2019t be bothered to coax this person. He might\u2019ve drawn a shock-proof belt for himself but he was almost killed by this carriage!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t speak but he was paying attention to the situation and took care of Xie Xi very well.</p><br/><p>They set off in the morning and only arrived at the city at sunset. After finding a nearby hotel, Xie Xi couldn\u2019t walk anymore.</p><br/><p>The hotel staff member told them, \u201cGuests, we only have one room left. Can you share?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to find another place and replied, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie knew this person was tired and couldn\u2019t bear to say anything.</p><br/><p>The staff member replied, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll get hot water!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi previously always let Jiang Xie help him have a bath but how did he dare do that now?</p><br/><p>The little lion didn\u2019t seem to be in estrus yet but what if he tried to hook up?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to die in bed\u2026</p><br/><p>The room wasn\u2019t bad. There were one bedroom and a bathroom. There was a set of table and chairs in the bedroom as a place to drink tea or even write something.</p><br/><p>The bathroom was separate but there was only one bed for sleeping.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was slightly nervous. After four days of dreams, he had lost confidence in himself. If they slept together, would he do something to Jiang Xie in the middle of the night?</p><br/><p>Oh, he would be dead after finishing\u2026</p><br/><p>This joke was really cold.</p><br/><p>Before going to sleep, Jiang Xie suggested, \u201cYou sleep in the bed and I\u2019ll sleep on the floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi reluctantly told him, \u201cThe bed is so big and there are two quilts. We can sleep together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie feared that Xie Xi would discover his thoughts and didn\u2019t dare protest too much.</p><br/><p>In special circumstances, it was normal for two males to sleep together. He only felt it was suspicious because he had a ghost in his heart.</p><br/><p>The two men were wrapped in their own quilts, one on the outside and one in the inside, as if there was a river in the middle.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told Jiang Xie, \u201cHave a good dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie felt itchy when he heard these words but he replied gently, \u201cHave a good dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>Still, he didn\u2019t fall asleep immediately.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie opened his eyes in bed as he heard Xie Xi\u2019s breathing sound. His entire body seemed to be floating in the clouds\u2026 his body and mind were floating but there was a risk of falling from a high altitude.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi fell asleep.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie also slowly fell asleep.</p><br/><p>The two of them woke up in the garden at the same time.</p><br/><p>The wonderful thing was that this time they had a bed and were sleeping while holding each other.</p><br/><p>For a moment, Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t tell if this was a dream or reality. He knew after hearing Xie Xi\u2019s seductive sounds\u2026</p><br/><p>It was a dream. Jiang Xie kissed the other person the neck and roughly undressed him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi half-pushed him away and half gave him permission.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie simply loved Xie Xi like this. He wished he could stay in this dream forever and never wake up.</p><br/><p>However, it was a dream that he would wake up from. Jiang Xie felt the warmth in his arms and it should still be a dream\u2026</p><br/><p>He bowed his head and kissed the dry lips. Then Xie Xi opened his eyes, the black eyes full of panic. In an instant, Jiang Xie was like a frozen ice cave.</p><br/><p>White Tiger City\u2019s palace.</p><br/><p>The silver-white hall was magnificent. The dome was a beautiful glass window carved with numerous blooming roses and the sun shone down, as if scattering the brilliance of the flowers into the hall.</p><br/><p>There was a mall in the hall who was fully covered by a white cloak, not even a single strand of hair exposed.</p><br/><p>At this time, the door opened and a guard hurriedly entered, kneeling on the ground. \u201cNational Teacher, His Majesty has returned to the capital!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man turned sharply, snow-like white hair slipping out of the cloak because of the fast movement.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

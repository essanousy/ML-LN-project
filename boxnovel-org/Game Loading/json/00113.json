The silver-haired teenager who was called brother was cold and unmoved.</p><br/><p>He went straight to the sun before stopping. \u201cYou dared to rush here without caring about life or death.\u201d</p><br/><p>The frosty voice fell and the flowing silver light suddenly accelerated and spread out through the entire hall. The vine-covered hall spread in an instant and the people standing in it seemed like they were on top of a majestic Milky Way.</p><br/><p>There was a stinging chill in the beautiful landscape. It was unknown what the silver-haired teenager was doing when the light suddenly solidified.</p><br/><p>Zhu Li shouted, \u201cWatch out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, it was too late and the silver aura froze everyone in place. There were some who quickly reacted and raised their legs but it was useless. Their surroundings were covered with silver and there was no place to settle at all.</p><br/><p>Zhu Li was used to standing on one leg and it took longer for him, but it was too much. The other leg was frozen and it was just wasting strength.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced around and found there was no ice at the feet of the sun. Only he wasn\u2019t trapped.</p><br/><p>It was unknown if the moon was showing mercy or the sun\u2019s physique was special and he couldn\u2019t be trapped by the silver aura.</p><br/><p>At this time, a tingling sensation came from the soles of his feet and Xie Xi\u2019s expression changed slightly. Kong Rongliang shouted, \u201cThere is a problem with this ice!\u201d</p><br/><p>Those with poor physical quality screamed, \u201cI\u2026 my legs\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This beautiful ice didn\u2019t just freeze people, it also turned them into zombies!</p><br/><p>The frozen feet started to stiffen and decay. As the ice slowly moved upwards, all covered areas started to lose their senses\u2026 if this kept going, they would become zombies once the ice covered their entire body!</p><br/><p>Many people pulled out knives to cut the ice but the texture of this ice was bizarre. It was incredibly hard and had a certain degree of toughing. It couldn\u2019t be cut at all.</p><br/><p>Zhu Li and Cao Yan both had fire-related skills. They bombarded the ice but unfortunately, it was no use.</p><br/><p>What to do? They couldn\u2019t get near the moon, let alone suppress him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at the little sun.</p><br/><p>The miserable little sun\u2019s spirit returned and his body blazed with a golden light. It instantly covered the ice on the ground and the ice that couldn\u2019t be cut or burned miraculously melted.</p><br/><p>The more amazing thing was that their original zombie parts had been restored.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was slightly startled and couldn\u2019t help thinking of the countless zombies outside.</p><br/><p>Speaking of which, this world was strange. Apart from the players, there was no normal people, only zombies.</p><br/><p>At first, Xie Xi thought it was a feature of the open world and didn\u2019t ask Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Now that he thought about it, every world was real. The zombies didn\u2019t come out of nowhere or breed on their own. Then how did they get here?</p><br/><p>Seeing the ability of the silver-haired teenager\u2026 Were the normal people turned into zombies by the moon?</p><br/><p>He recalled Xifu\u2019s words about how this world belonged to the moon good! Then the so-called suppression wasn\u2019t killing but\u2026 returning the world to its original form?</p><br/><p>Then the silver-haired teenager turned to star at the sun. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m not going to kill you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t see the moon\u2019s expression from this side but his voice felt creepy. It was feminine and gentle but clearly contained a strong killing intent.</p><br/><p>The bright sun\u2019s eyes slightly dimmed and his lips trembled. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt Mummy.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words caused Xie Xi, the man who was forced to be a woman, to also tremble in his heart.</p><br/><p>The silver-haired teenager scoffed. \u201cMummy? Do you have a family?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little sun looked up and shouted, \u201cI have a brother and now I have a mother and father!\u201d</p><br/><p>His yell was naive and sincere but couldn\u2019t help making people feel sad.</p><br/><p>His mother and father were fake while his brother was murderous towards him. The poor little sun really had no family.</p><br/><p>The silver-haired teenager actually smiled. His eyes were still dull but the thin lips that curved were like dark clouds scattered by the moon. \u201cThey are just tricking you and using you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little sun was startled.</p><br/><p>The silver-haired teenager approached him and spoke cruel words in a cold voice. \u201c\u2026Me too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little sun\u2019s eyes widened and his radiant eyes were covered with fog.</p><br/><p>The silver-haired teenager wandered behind the little sun, hands on the sun\u2019s shoulders and eyebrows raised coldly. \u201cTell me, which one is your mother?\u201d The little sun glanced at Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>The silver-haired teenager stared at Xie Xi and sneered, \u201cA man?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little sun bit his lower lip and cried out, \u201cHe is my mother!\u201d</p><br/><p>The silver-haired teenager bowed his head, long silver hair falling on the small sun\u2019s shoulder as he whispered, \u201cGo to ask him. He isn\u2019t your mother. He might\u2019ve cheated you but he won\u2019t dare lie to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little sun was shocked and stared at Xie Xi in a pitiful manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not his mother.\u201d Xie Xi didn\u2019t wait for the little sun to open his mouth and replied first.</p><br/><p>The silver-haired teenager\u2019s thin lips curved and the small sun seemed like he was struck by lightning.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi got straight to the point. \u201cSo what if I\u2019m not your mother? The feelings in this world aren\u2019t limited. There might be no family relationship but there are many feelings that we can fight to protect!\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice fell and he snatched the little sun!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Why did he have to resist? What was he fighting against? Was it because he thought of leaving?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi seemed to capture something but before he could think about it, he heard the conversation between Jiang Xie and Yan Zhe.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe whispered, \u201cIs Little Chirp sleeping?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was staying in Jiang Xie\u2019s chest pocket and just woke up. Of course, Jiang Xie didn\u2019t know he had woken up since he would normally poke out his head or look at the scenery from Jiang Xie\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie nodded and said, \u201cHe is still sleeping.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was still early and Little Chirp usually wasn\u2019t awake at this time.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe obviously wanted to talk to Jiang Xie. Xie Xi pricked his ears and wanted to hear what they were talking about.</p><br/><p>He heard Yan Zhe say, \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie froze.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe opened his mouth, \u201cI know that you like Little Chirp but he is..\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t expect them to be talking about this.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cI think he is good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe felt that their feelings were extraordinary and he naturally didn\u2019t want to see them sad. He said, \u201cLittle Chirp definitely doesn\u2019t understand your heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if he doesn\u2019t understand. I\u2019ll always be with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe sighed. \u201cThat is all you want to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cHe is still small.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is a bird. Such an adult bird can have children.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie frowned. \u201cHe has just adapted to his human form\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe told him, \u201cThat\u2019s why I hope you will think clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was silent.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe continued, \u201cLittle Chirp can\u2019t leave you even if he becomes a person. The master\u2019s contract is acknowledged but he doesn\u2019t understand. Do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe\u2019s intentions were good. He hoped that Jiang Xie would understand his own heart and teach Xie Xi these things. He hoped Jiang Xie could be together with the beauty instead of dragging things out like this.</p><br/><p>However, Xie Xi also understood Jiang Xie. \u2018God Yan, your words are too ambiguous and a certain someone won\u2019t understand!\u2019</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Jiang Xie turned slightly pale. \u201cThere is no need to say anymore. I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi inwardly cried out, \u2018What do you understand?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe apparently overestimated Jiang Xie as he said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi once again directed to Yan Zhe, \u2018What damn thing does he understand?\u2019</p><br/><p>It was a pity that no one could hear Xie Xi\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>Did this world require falling in love? He had to be in love with Jiang Xie or even marry to form a family?</p><br/><p>Due to their conversation, the inexplicable emotion that Xie Xi felt faded away and it was very difficult to capture it again.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had talked about love many times and was experienced.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t easy to get married? He could do it in minutes!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi soon found a natural and excellent opportunity.</p><br/><p>People had been rebuilding homes for so long that their interpersonal relationships eased.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie and Yan Zhe also had neighbours.</p><br/><p>They helped each other a lot so after building the house, the neighbours invited them to visit.</p><br/><p>It was difficult to find such kindness so they got along with each other.</p><br/><p>The neighbours were a young couple on a picnic in the park when the earthquake occurred. They were lucky to survive but unfortunately, there were no other family members.</p><br/><p>They were both transformed people but they weren\u2019t very strong. The man could simply separate the air while the woman\u2019s hands heated up enough to fry fish.</p><br/><p>There were many transformed people like this and they were doomed to be ordinary people in the post-disaster world.</p><br/><p>Still, ordinary people had the happiness of ordinary people. They didn\u2019t ask for much apart from a home and a stable life.</p><br/><p>The female, Li Qianyi\u2019s palms could heat up but the male was the chef.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie and Yan Zhe sat together while Xie Xi also had a small seat.</p><br/><p>Li Qianyi liked Xie Xi and prepared various types of nuts for him. Little Chirp was very happy.</p><br/><p>They took care of Xie Xi so Jiang Xie and Yan Zhe were in a good mood. They happily ate the meal.</p><br/><p>The male host opened a bottle of wine and Jiang Xie and Yan Zhe followed him in drinking.</p><br/><p>After drinking, their relationship became closer. Li Qianyi was a lively person and her gaze turned to Jiang Xie and Yan Zhe. She asked with the courage from the wine, \u201cAre you lovers?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her husband knew that his wife was drunk and rushed to stop her.</p><br/><p>Her question frightened the bird opposite her.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi jerked. What the hell?</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the two parties involved were very calm. Yan Zhe\u2019s lips thinned and he tilted slightly away from Jiang Xie. \u201cI don\u2019t like men.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was more poisonous as he pointed to Little Chirp, \u201cI like him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young couple, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>The straight Yan Zhe added, \u201cYes, he likes Little Chirp.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Qianyi was grabbed by her husband and she sobered up, speaking with some embarrassment, \u201cHa, haha, I drank too much and talked nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s senses returned and he felt distressed for Li Qianyi. It was estimated that normal people couldn\u2019t imagine the fairy-like God Yan to be straight or think that the promising Jiang Xie was a pervert who liked birds!</p><br/><p>Thanks to this meal, Xie Xi found an opportunity.</p><br/><p>Back in their room, Xie Xi became a person and asked Jiang Xie, \u201cWhat are lovers?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s hands on the clothes halted.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him and asked, \u201cWhy does Li Qianyi say that you and God Yan are lovers?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s senses returned as he found the clothes and carefully helped Xie Xi wear them.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him in a motionless manner.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s throat was dry as he said, \u201cLovers are\u2026 two people who are together forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi put on a lost expression. \u201cDo you want to be with Yan Zhe forever?\u201d God Yan, sorry for using your name!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cThen we will be together forever, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie quivered as he said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hit him in the face with a straight ball. \u201cAre we lovers?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke again, \u201cWe will be together forever and lovers are always together. Thus, we are lovers!\u201d</p><br/><p>This question was dealt and let\u2019s see how he hid!</p><br/><p>The thing he didn\u2019t know was that there were several chirps in his long sentence.</p><br/><p>Such wonderful contents and tone caused Jiang Xie to be breathless.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that simple\u2026\u201d Jiang Xie gasped as he tried to speak.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi cocked his head. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The action along with the intonation meant Jiang Xie heard, \u2018What is chirp?\u2019 and he couldn\u2019t figure out what Xie Xi said.</p><br/><p>Then Xie Xi repeated it again.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stated, \u201cLovers, lovers also like each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was surprised. \u201cThen we must be lovers. I like you the most!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t give him a chance to back down. \u201cDon\u2019t you like me too? I heard you say that you liked me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had spoken these words while eating.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t explain and was almost sweetened by the warm words.</p><br/><p>The faint sense of alcohol rushed up and Jiang Xie\u2019s voice was low, \u201cIf we are lovers then we will do something special.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned towards him, eyes falling on the clean lips.</p><br/><p>He seemed to be bewildered as he clasped Xie Xi\u2019s waist and kissed the lips.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was funny and sweet but he was also embarrassed by this innocent kiss.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s kissing was very undisciplined, messy and had no skills.</p><br/><p>Still\u2026 Xie Xi\u2019s heart thumped.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie released him and questioned in a low voice, \u201cIt is like this. Do you hate it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s voice became light and his cheeks red. \u201cI don\u2019t hate it\u2026 very comfortable\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he licked his lower lips. This made Jiang Xie\u2019s head buzz. By the time he realized his reaction, he had already pressed the other person against the wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Chirp\u2026\u201d Jiang Xie leaned towards him and called out.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard that name in this situation and was embarrassed. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe with me always? Forever and never apart.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was also what Xie Xi hoped for. \u201cYes, we will never separate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t suppress the joy in his heart and said, \u201cI always feel like I\u2019m dreaming.\u201d</p><br/><p>At first glance, Xie Xi didn\u2019t think too much. Anyone who got what they wanted would have such thoughts.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s low voice continued. \u201cOnce I left the black fog, everything was too smooth. Everything is going too well and I feel that something will happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words poured cold water on Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>After coming out of the black fog\u2026 everything was going too well\u2026</p><br/><p>Why did Jiang Xie think there would be something?</p><br/><p>A chill went down Xie Xi\u2019s spine as his heart sank.</p><br/><p>It turned out to be an illusion but this time it wasn\u2019t his, it was Jiang Xie\u2019s illusion.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was aware of his anomaly. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his mouth but didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>He had been very calm when he broke his own illusion because he knew that as long as he passed the 12 boundaries, he would return to Central and the complete Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>For the Jiang Xie in front of him, breaking the illusion was too cruel.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie seemed to realize something. He held Xie Xi\u2019s arm and spoke with a big smile, \u201cNo\u2026 isn\u2019t it good to be together forever? Here\u2026 we\u2019re together forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing his trembling voice and his self-deceptive words, Xie Xi felt like he swallowed a flint as his heart was burned.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s spiritual power meant it was impossible not to see through the illusion.</p><br/><p>The moment they left Dream Come True, he had asked Jiang Xie, \u201cHave you ever encountered such illusions?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had told him, \u201cMany times.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, Jiang Xie encountered many illusions but he had never been addicted. It was because he was aware it was a fantasy and he could easily leave.</p><br/><p>Yet in Dream Come True, Jiang Xie \u2018died\u2019 once.</p><br/><p>The choice of the Jiang Xie here was the same.</p><br/><p>Once Xie Xi was present, the illusion became a reality worth sticking to.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very distressed but he had to pull this person out.</p><br/><p>It was because beyond the illusion, they had a better truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cJiang Xie\u2026\u201d Xie Xi wondered, \u201cWe\u2019re still in the black fog, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s pupils shrank and there were resistance and defeat in them.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi held this person\u2019s face and stared into his eyes, stating in a very firm tone, \u201cBelieve me, we will still be together forever after leaving the dark fog!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie held him as if afraid he would disappear into smoke. \u201cIsn\u2019t it good to stay here? We will be happy here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hugged him back, his voice like he was coaxing a helpless child, \u201cWe will be very happy once we leave here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jiang Xie cried out. \u201cIt is chaotic outside and very dangerous. I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, he said such things because he already recognized that he was in the black fog. Once he woke up, the illusion would be broken.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi whispered to him, \u201cWhy did you go into the black fog?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed. \u201cIt was because you didn\u2019t want to escape. You wanted to know what it was and you would rather face death than stay still, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Needless to say, this was the principle of life that Jiang Xie had always believed in.</p><br/><p>He believed in himself and wanted to face everything, no matter the suffering.</p><br/><p>He worked hard to come to the Zone and heard the words of the guard captain. Once he knew that the people in the Zone were also organizing an exploration of the black fog, Jiang Xie strengthened his determination to explore the black fog.</p><br/><p>To put it mildly, he only believed in himself. He believed that if he couldn\u2019t solve the problem then no one could.</p><br/><p>Thus, he entered the black fog.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are like this\u2026\u201d Xie Xi spoke to him. \u201cWhy do you want to escape?\u201d</p><br/><p>Staying in the black fog and the illusion with Xie Xi meant escaping.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie buried himself in Xie Xi\u2019s neck and said nothing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked him, \u201cWould you like to leave with me? Believe me, we will be better off than in this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a long time, Jiang Xie\u2019s voice rang in his ears. \u201cLike in the rose garden?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shocked.</p><br/><p>The illusion of the garden was his but Jiang Xie was also in it and saw the scene of Central.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xie Xi felt that they weren\u2019t talking about the black fog but about the collapsed world.</p><br/><p>\u2026There seemed to be nothing wrong.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi promised him, \u201cYes, I will love you no matter where I am. We will always be together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he finished speaking, Xie Xi felt a pulling sensation. He really had left the world of Cancer.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

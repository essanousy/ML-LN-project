If it wasn\u2019t a poison arrow then he would\u2019ve been able to recover on his own in a few days.</p><br/><p>Even if there was poison, it wasn\u2019t a problem with Houqing present.</p><br/><p>Xie XI lay in bed and joked while looking at the frowning white-haired youth. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve been injured. Stop panicking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing gazed at him, eyes somewhat strange.</p><br/><p>Then Houqing lowered his eyelashes and carefully treated the wounds. \u201cI will catch the person who hurt you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cDon\u2019t be so nervous. I don\u2019t know how many people whose interests I touched after ascending to the throne.\u201d There were countless people who wanted to kill him.</p><br/><p>Houqing replied, \u201cNo matter how they are, I will make them pay in blood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Xie Xi felt that this person was a bit too stressed. \u201cIt is nothing to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing no longer spoke and only carefully treated the wounds.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi woke up.</p><br/><p>He opened his eyes and found that Houqing was gone. Was it because he left that the dream ended?</p><br/><p>It was strange since entering the little lion\u2019s dream didn\u2019t need two people to be present.</p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t the same. The little lion slept and they saw dreams. Here, he saw Houqing\u2019s real memories.</p><br/><p>This was probably the two directions of his ability?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi guessed like this.</p><br/><p>He recalled the dream. From the perspective of an onlooker, he knew this was an important node.</p><br/><p>During the war, Xie Xi was injured many times. Houqing was pained but he was able to endure it.</p><br/><p>However, Xie Xi was still in danger once the war was over and this touched his nerves.</p><br/><p>It could be understood that the war might be dangerous but as long as it ended, there was peace and always hope. Yet the eight countries were unified and Xie Xi was still fatally wounded under his nose. This was very unacceptable for Houqing.</p><br/><p>There was no way that the heart wouldn\u2019t fall and it wasn\u2019t strange to fell panic all day.</p><br/><p>Houqing\u2019s experiences and encounters meant he was destined not to be a normal person. His psychological quality was extremely strong but also extremely fragile if the right string in his heart was touched.</p><br/><p>Obviously, this string was touched.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed, turned around and went to sleep.</p><br/><p>By the time the lion\u2019s estrus was over, Xie Xi had watched the complete emotional summary.</p><br/><p>As he thought, since Xie Xi was attacked, Houqing\u2019s status wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was ill for a month, during which he gave most of his affairs to Houqing.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t a problem. He was most reliant on Houqing and believed in this person\u2019s ability. The things he couldn\u2019t handle could only be entrusted to Houqing.</p><br/><p>Houqing did a good job and everything was carried out in accordance with Xie Xi\u2019s ideas. There were no mistakes at all.</p><br/><p>After his recovery, Xie Xi exclaimed, \u201cIf I die, this country will be handed to you. I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished when Houqing interrupted. \u201cYou can\u2019t die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t take it too seriously. \u201cI just giving an example.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing looked up, a faint halo of red light in his eyes. \u201cThat example can\u2019t be given.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t be overly nervous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing didn\u2019t say anything and continued carefully dressing Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at this person through the mirror. \u201cYou are now the national teacher. You shouldn\u2019t do this type of work.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing replied, \u201cI don\u2019t trust them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought he meant the maids couldn\u2019t do these things well and said, \u201cIn these matters, they are the professionals.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing didn\u2019t refute or admit it. He insisted on everyone leaving as he kept taking care of Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi only thought that because he was injured, Houqing\u2019s concern was chaotic and somewhat neurotic. Xie Xi didn\u2019t take it too seriously.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until half a month later that Xie Xi discovered Houqing wasn\u2019t normal.</p><br/><p>It was difficult to use this term to describe the person living with him.</p><br/><p>However, he had to admit that Houqing was very normal.</p><br/><p>First, he sent away the personal maid. Then he handed Xie Xi the dishes and bathed him. Eventually, Houqing didn\u2019t allow any other person to serve Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>At this time, Xie Xi could still joke, \u201cDon\u2019t you like to be clean? Don\u2019t to this type of dirty work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t do it well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw that Houqing didn\u2019t intend to back down and had to scold him. \u201cHouqing, you are the national teacher and the spiritual symbol of the Rose Empire. You can\u2019t treat yourself like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, the things that Houqing did were simply self-abuse.</p><br/><p>Houqing told him, \u201cThe entire Rose Empire is yours. It is natural for me to serve you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi held his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing\u2019s eyelashes trembled but his voice was soothing. \u201cYour Majesty, please let me do these things. I can only feel at ease by doing them personally.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned. \u201cAre you still afraid?\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing pursed his lips.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed. \u201cHow long has it been since the assassination attempt? Why haven\u2019t you let it go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t caught the perpetrators yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stated, \u201cYou know, I have countless enemies. Even if you catch them, there will be another one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing suddenly raised his head. \u201cThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t give anyone a chance to hurt you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cYou can\u2019t trust anyone in the palace?\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing didn\u2019t open his eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t trust anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xie Xi understood the true meaning of Houqing\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>He said helplessly, \u201cDon\u2019t think like this. The people here have all been personally screened by us and are the most loyal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing sneered. \u201cWhat about their loyalty? I can\u2019t trust their abilities!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shaken.</p><br/><p>Houqing looked up at him. \u201cThere were so many guards at that time. Why were you still injured?\u201d At that time, only Houqing wasn\u2019t around Xie Xi. He was in the rank of ministers.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled bitterly. \u201cWell, I was careless. I lost my wartime vigilance but after this, I will certainly tighten my nerves and not let myself get hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing blamed himself. \u201cYou have to worry about so many things every day, how do you have the energy to focus on yourself? Leave it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tried to comfort him. \u201cDon\u2019t take it on. You are busier than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Xie Xi was defeated by Houqing who almost begged. \u201cYour Majesty, please let me stay close to you. I am scared and it is nothing to be tired. I just want you to be safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help giving in to this person\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>If it was just this, the two of them wouldn\u2019t be in such a mess.</p><br/><p>Facts proved that a psychological problem shouldn\u2019t be dragged out. Once signs of it were discovered, it should be uprooted and completely eradicated.</p><br/><p>Indulging in it would only make it more intense and it would eventually spiral out of control.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s indulgence didn\u2019t make Houqing reassured but only contributed to his uneasiness.</p><br/><p>He was completely entangled in fear and self-blame, constantly reflected on what he had done and what he was doing.</p><br/><p>He became more and more clear that he only had Xie Xi in his heart and Xie Xi was the only thing he thought about.</p><br/><p>This made him more aware of Xie Xi\u2019s tiredness and couldn\u2019t be to let Xie Xi worry about these trivial things\u2026</p><br/><p>He started to help Xie Xi do more things and to deal with government affairs. Slowly, he pushed Xie Xi out.</p><br/><p>It was true that the ministers were their confidants and knew that the relationship between Xie Xi and Houqing was extraordinary. However, in the face of power, even the closest people could turn against each other.</p><br/><p>Houqing\u2019s actions caused a lot of speculations. Could it be that the two top people had started fighting for power?</p><br/><p>Once the news reached Xie Xi\u2019s ears, he immediately dragged the people to him for a scolding.</p><br/><p>However, this rumour was like a dandelion seed blowing in the wind. Once it was let go, it couldn\u2019t be stopped.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi slowly found out that Houqing was making him a mere figurehead.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t believe that Houqing would be blinded by rights but the facts before him didn\u2019t allow him to think too much.</p><br/><p>He was wounded for a while and it was natural for Houqing to take things on. However, he was now recovered but there were many things hidden from him. This\u2026</p><br/><p>There was a ripple in Xie Xi\u2019s heart but this wasn\u2019t something that could be solved casually.</p><br/><p>Once he tried to limit Houqing\u2019s rights, he found that many things were already out of his reach.</p><br/><p>It was true that he was the emperor but when the courtiers asked a question, Houqing\u2019s decision was fast and stable. Even if he asked for Xie Xi\u2019s opinion, Xie Xi couldn\u2019t give a better answer.</p><br/><p>In this way, everyone was more convinced by Houqing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s close companions were all military commanders. They couldn\u2019t interject in matters of the court and Xie Xi couldn\u2019t rely on them.</p><br/><p>In this case, he finally planned to talk to Houqing.</p><br/><p>With their relationship, if Houqing wanted the throne then Xie Xi would give it to him.</p><br/><p>Originally, he didn\u2019t want to ascend the throne. It was only when Houqing said it was easier to implement decrees that he became the emperor.</p><br/><p>If Houqing could do it better then he could step down.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought this and some of the problems in his heart seemed to be resolved.</p><br/><p>He found Houqing and explained his decision.</p><br/><p>Houqing was stunned. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke sincerely. \u201cThis position is more suitable for you. I am better at leading wars and I believe in you when it comes to political matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke sincerely but Houqing\u2019s expression sank. \u201cThis country is yours.\u201d If it wasn\u2019t for Xie Xi, why would he have worked so hard?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe country is the people and the leader should be able to let them live. I will go to the border and punish the rebels.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought his decision was more and more right. Houqing would stay in the city while he went to clean up the gang of thieves who weren\u2019t dead. Wasn\u2019t this just right?</p><br/><p>They really fit together!</p><br/><p>Who would\u2019ve expected Houqing\u2019s voice to be as cold as ice? \u201cYou want to leave the palace?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought Houqing didn\u2019t believe him and replied, \u201cI really don\u2019t care about the throne! I would rather lead the soldiers to fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing didn\u2019t seem to hear him and asked, \u201cYou are leaving the palace?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi noticed this person wasn\u2019t right. \u201cHouqing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing\u2019s uneasiness that he suppressed for a long time completely broke out and he whispered, \u201cYou can\u2019t go anywhere. You can only stay here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Going to the border? Taking the soldiers to fight?</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t this person suffer enough injuries? Didn\u2019t he experience enough danger? Didn\u2019t he know how much Houqing worried about him?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t respond to the meaning of this sentence for a while.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until there was no one around him and he couldn\u2019t even leave the palace that Xie Xi discovered he was under house arrest.</p><br/><p>The little white tiger he saved, his close comrade-in-arms, the person he trusted with his body and mind, actually put him under house arrest.</p><br/><p>Why? Xie Xi couldn\u2019t understand it. Was it power\u2026 was the charm of power so great?</p><br/><p>However, he already said he wanted to give up everything. Didn\u2019t Houqing believe him?</p><br/><p>The knots in his heart, which had been unlocked for the most part, were tied together again. Once he saw Houqing, he felt extremely strange.</p><br/><p>Such eyes stung at Houqing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked him, \u201cWhat do you want to do? I already said I would give you the throne. Why don\u2019t you let me go?\u201d</p><br/><p>The words about leaving became Houqing\u2019s nightmare. He couldn\u2019t hear them and his tight nerves seemed to break.</p><br/><p>He declared in a hoarse voice, \u201cYou are the beast king. You can\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was fired up and punched him. \u201cHouqing, what the hell do you want to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Houqing didn\u2019t evade and blood flowed from his mouth. He ignored it as he said, \u201cI can\u2019t let you go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was crazy. After all, he was the beast king who was brave and militant. Once he really moved, no one could stop him.</p><br/><p>At this time, there was an accident. It was unknown how long the rebels were lurking but they found an assassinating opportunity. They hated Xie Xi, they hated the man who took away their power.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was exhausted from handling the guards when he met these people.</p><br/><p>By the time Houqing came, Xie Xi was standing there holding a pike. The attackers were killed by him and he was shaking.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He could go directly to the vampire and survive the seven days.</p><br/><p>Would it be that simple? Xie Xi hadn\u2019t forgotten what day it was today.</p><br/><p>If he went to the vampire, would he have to accept the first embrace? What was involved in the first embrace? He couldn\u2019t forget what the vampire said last night\u2014Satisfy him. How could he satisfy the vampire? Was it just sucking blood.</p><br/><p>It couldn\u2019t be\u2026 no\u2026</p><br/><p>Was selling his body a shortcut to clearing the game? Xie Xi\u2019s scalp was numb and he didn\u2019t dare think about it.</p><br/><p>If this was an ordinary computer game, Xie Xi would\u2019ve long deleted it and reported the author. Unfortunately, this wasn\u2019t a computer game but a real world game that couldn\u2019t be explained by common sense.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t quit or give up. Xie Xi couldn\u2019t know about the consequences of this death without loading the file.</p><br/><p>He could only keep going!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Xie is really fucking shameless. What type of dog game is this? The silver-haired and silver-eyed elf with a natural prince-like attitude, but his image was completely gone once he opened his mouth. He exposed his nature as a dog wagging its tail.</p><br/><p>The man opposite him was extremely well dressed, neckline tied tightly to his chin. Part from his face, not a single bit of skin was exposed. However, dressing in such a way couldn\u2019t conceal his strong body. Combined with his unsmiling face, he had a strange appearance.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe stared at the water curtain. \u201cIt is really fucked up. If I was this child,I must kill Old Jiang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ge glanced at him and slightly raised his eyebrows. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the soul of Jiang Xie?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Yan Zhe rejoiced in the misfortune. \u201cHe actually put a soul in a novice world. No wonder why it is S-grade difficulty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ge asked again, \u201cIs the reason why no one passed the game because they can\u2019t enter the game?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe said, \u201cWell, to be able to receive the recognition of Jiang Xie\u2019s soul, this child isn\u2019t simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ge glanced at the beautiful boy in the water curtain. \u201cIs he underage?</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe answered, \u201cHe is 19 years old. He just became an adult.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo young?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Jiang is an old cow eating young grass.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ge asked after a moment, \u201cThe housekeeper is dead. Does he just need to accept the initial support to complete the task?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be that simple.\u201d Yan Zhe smiled. \u201cFirst, if his blood is sucked then he will become a vampire. This isn\u2019t living.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ge, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe gloated, \u201cThe fact that he could get the recognition of Jiang Xie\u2019s soul indicates that the child and Old Xie\u2019s fit is very high. Old Xie forced him into this damn game, wouldn\u2019t the child really hate him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ge argued. \u201cHe isn\u2019t suffering. The first mission is a S-grade world.If it is cleared, he can get\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe interrupted him. \u201cHe will definitely clear it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ge looked at him with amazement, wondering why he was so certain.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe explained, \u201cIt is Old Xie\u2019s soul that raised the world level. In fact, the mission isn\u2019t difficult in the novice range. The child is also smart and chose the right privilege. He has already more than half cleared the instance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ge looked at the detailed data. \u201cThere is no limit to loading the file and fatal injuries won\u2019t cause pain. This really isn\u2019t difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe smiled. \u201cUnfortunately, the content of this game is too fucking terrible. That child will have his three views broken.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ge, \u201c\u2026\u201d It really seemed like it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pity I have to go out on a mission.\u201d Yan Zhe made a regretful expression. \u201cI can\u2019t see Old Xie dying.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know this and left the scene of death.</p><br/><p>The housekeeper died and his blood flowed to the ground. Unfortunately, Xie Xi didn\u2019t have the ability to clean up and could only temporarily leave it.</p><br/><p>What should he do next? Xie Xi couldn\u2019t accept the first embrace but he also couldn\u2019t go to the promised meeting place.</p><br/><p>He could only go to the earl\u2019s house first and work on Aix-en. It was only six days so perhaps he could drag out the time for the first embrace.</p><br/><p>He thought this but Xie Xi instinctively knew it wouldn\u2019t be so easy.</p><br/><p>It was strange. The huge mansion was empty but it didn\u2019t feel like it when Randy was here. Once he died, the castle overflowing with stillness, like a grave.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t afraid. After all, he was a person who had died three times.</p><br/><p>He went to find the coachman himself, arranged a carriage and prepared to go to the earl\u2019s house to find the vampire Aix-en.</p><br/><p>Originally, his plan was to use words to motivate the housekeeper and let him deal with the vampire. He never thought that he would send the housekeeper to the road of suicide with one sentence\u2026 he could only change the plan and delay the time with Aix-en.</p><br/><p>The carriage left the manor and Xie Xi enjoyed the beautiful idyllic scenery.</p><br/><p>This was a beautiful scene that couldn\u2019t be scene in the bustling city of modern society. The sky was clear, the wind blew through the grass and the lotus flowers in the pool were shaking delicately.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi observed carefully and couldn\u2019t find any flaws in it. The game was more realistic than reality.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the carriage shook. Xie Xi held the handle firmly and barely supported his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d He was about to ask when the door of the carriage opened and the coachman stared at him with a ferocious expression.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart jumped and he got a bad feeling.</p><br/><p>The coachman\u2019s eyes were full of malice and resentment as he held a sharp dagger. \u201cThere is no Randy here. Sein Hall, let\u2019s see who will protect you!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was nowhere to hide in the narrow carriage and Xie Xi also didn\u2019t want to hide.</p><br/><p>He took the time to ask. \u201cWhy do you want to kill me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The resentment in the coachman\u2019s eyes reached the peak. \u201cYou are sinister and evil. Who in the empire doesn\u2019t want to kill you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Xie Xi couldn\u2019t finish the sentence as the coachman\u2019s dagger pierced his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, it serves you right.\u201d The coachman was crazy. \u201cI want to see if your heart is black, devil who climbed up from hell\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice drifted off and Xie Xi read the file in time.</p><br/><p>There were no extra options and he could only choose to go back to last night.</p><br/><p>Then\u2026 he couldn\u2019t let Randy die? He could get some information from the coachman\u2019s words. This body wasn\u2019t a simple aristocratic son. He had too many enemies and the housekeeper Randy wasn\u2019t simple. It was only when Randy was alive that he could avoid being assassinated by others.</p><br/><p>Was it possible for incite Randy and the vampire to fight?</p><br/><p>It seemed that his original plan was right but he had to choose his words more carefully. He couldn\u2019t let the housekeeper commit suicide!</p><br/><p>He just made up his mind when the silver-haired vampire appeared out of thin air. This was the third time and Xie Xi was used to this sneaky ghost.</p><br/><p>The vampire\u2019s lines were almost the same as last time but the confession was more unhinged. \u201cSmall Sein, I really want to dig out my heart for you, letting you see how much it loves you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was afraid his words really would make the vampire dig out his heart and spoke carefully. \u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The vampire\u2019s beautiful red eyes were full of infatuation. \u201cSee you tomorrow. My sweetest baby.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He heard it so many times that it didn\u2019t seem so disgusting anymore.</p><br/><p>The vampire went away and he dealt with Randy. Then Xie Xi finally arrived at the crucial second day.</p><br/><p>This time, he didn\u2019t muddy up the water or act unclear. He directly asked, \u201cRandy, no matter what happens, will you be loyal to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough, this was the correct way to speak. The housekeeper knelt down on one knee and spoke in a pious manner. \u201cIt is my life\u2019s wish to share Young Master\u2019s worries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at him in a condescending manner. \u201cDo you know the identity of Earl Aix-en?\u201d</p><br/><p>The housekeeper\u2019s head was lowered but he clearly stiffened up. Then he sighed. \u201cThe earl has long died. He is a vampire who only exists in the darkness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought, \u2018You\u2019ve know it for a long time!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you know what day it is today?\u201d Xie Xi stared at him.</p><br/><p>Randy looked up, a black mist in his blue eyes. \u201cHave you made up your mind?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be something that isn\u2019t a ghost.\u201d Xie Xi raised a hand to Randy\u2019s left shoulder and watched him. \u201cCan you help me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Clear flames burned in the housekeeper\u2019s eyes as his thin lips trembled. \u201cYoung Master\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is powerful and I made a deal with him to protect the house. Now he is pushing and I\u2026\u201d Xie Xi wasn\u2019t proficient at acting yet and couldn\u2019t say the rest of the words.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, this route was right. Randy held his hand and whispered to him, \u201cYou don\u2019t love him, do you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finally spoke the truth in his heart. \u201cI don\u2019t love him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The housekeeper closed his eyes, looking like someone resurrected from the dead. He kissed the back of Xie Xi\u2019s hand in a pious manner. \u201cAs long as you are clear about your mind, leave it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was anxious. \u201cHe isn\u2019t human and he is powerful. You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201d The housekeeper stared at him, eyes full of unreserved loyalty and love. \u201cWait for me to come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s concern wasn\u2019t false. The reason might be different but he said sincerely, \u201cTake care.\u201d He hoped the two of them could fight for six days and six nights to help him complete the task.</p><br/><p>Before Randy departed, he instructed Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026Please don\u2019t leave the mansion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought of the coachman who assassinated him and nodded solemnly. \u201cI won\u2019t go anywhere until you come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Randy\u2019s eyes were bright and gentle. \u201cI will live up to your expectations.\u201d</p><br/><p>He sent away the housekeeper and Xie Xi was nervous all morning and afternoon. It wasn\u2019t until it was almost evening that he was relieved.</p><br/><p>It seemed this was the right way. He had to encourage the housekeeper to deal with the vampire.</p><br/><p>The outcome wasn\u2019t known but the silver-haired vampire hadn\u2019t rushed over angrily.</p><br/><p>Randy wasn\u2019t here so the person who changed his clothing was the maid Gars.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t think too much when he saw this game again. Only one day had passed in this world but many days had passed for him. He had finally cleared a stage and he was slightly relaxed.</p><br/><p>Gars carefully helped him take off his clothes. As his shirt was being untied, she suddenly whispered, \u201cYoung Master, can\u2019t it be me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t hear her clearly. \u201cHrmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl, who was half a head taller than him, stared him in the eyes. \u201cThe things that Randy can do, I can also do it. The things that Aix-en can give you, I can as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes narrowed as he understood and looked up at Gars.</p><br/><p>Gars\u2019 cool voice became hoarse and she no longer pretended to be delicate as she was filled with a youthful anger. \u201cRandy can\u2019t come back. Look at me more, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xie Xi saw the throat of the \u2018maid\u2019 which had been obscured by lace.</p><br/><p>Gars raised Xie Xi\u2019s hand and pressed it against Gars\u2019 flat chest, which didn\u2019t have the ups and downs of a female.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you feel it?\u201d The boy\u2019s low-pitched voice was full of affection. \u201cThis heart belongs only to you.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

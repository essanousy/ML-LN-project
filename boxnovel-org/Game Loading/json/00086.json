This was actually very troublesome because the people who opened the game field were given a privilege. Players could inherit this privilege by killing them.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told Jiang Xie, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if they take Repair as a privilege. What\u2019s the point of grabbing a skill that could be used on others but not yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>He gave a lot of excuses but he actually had a soft heart.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart was also soft. \u201cYou are doing very well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s face inexplicably became hot. \u201cI don\u2019t want to save them.\u201d</p><br/><p>He immediately regretted saying this. It wasn\u2019t a cover up!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart melted. He said, \u201cOf course you didn\u2019t mean it. It was just like picking up a plastic bottle on the side of the road and throwing it into the bin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie continued, \u201cYou just coincidentally saw that there were many arms and legs. You have such a skill and it is easy to help them\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t listen anymore and stared up at him. \u201cAre you trying to coax me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The child was angry and Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cI\u2019m just praising my apprentice.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t mention that Xie Xi had forgotten to act as an apprentice.</p><br/><p>The game was too thrilling and Xie Xi used all his brain to think about business. There wasn\u2019t room to think about anything else.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suddenly couldn\u2019t call this person \u2018Master\u2019 and simply turned to stride away.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t say anything else. After all, the goodwill was -365 and he had to steady it.</p><br/><p>They emerged and found that they were in the playground. Standing here, the scenery was quite beautiful.</p><br/><p>The ferris wheel, the roller coaster, the big pendulum, the pirate ship etc, all of them were gorgeous and exquisite with dazzling lights. It was no different from an amusement park at night.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gazed at it in a slightly stunned manner.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie noticed. \u201cDo you like amusement parks?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head and replied, \u201cI don\u2019t like them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of which,\u201d Jiang Xie said. \u201cThis is my first time entering an amusement park.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned to him. \u201cFirst time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn my own words, it was too boring to come to such a place.\u201d</p><br/><p>The words hit Xie Xi\u2019s heart and he frowned. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d Were you alone for a while? Xie Xi didn\u2019t ask this question because he felt it was offensive.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie continued, \u201cI\u2019ve never been but this first time is very interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about the cut off arms and legs game and was speechless. \u201c\u2026It is quite interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wanted to give himself a few points. \u201cIt is interesting because\u2026\u201d You and I are together.</p><br/><p>Before he could finish, two oversized light bulbs came over. \u201cBenefactor!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie choked back his words and thought, \u2018The side task is right. These two goods should\u2019ve been killed.\u2019</p><br/><p>The people who came were the big idiot Kong Rongliang and the half zombie Chen Qing.</p><br/><p>Chen Qing got a pair of pants from somewhere and looked pretty good after wearing them. The zombie legs couldn\u2019t be seen at all. His face was also washed clean, revealing a pair of phoenix eyes, a high nose and thin lips.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt he was pleasing to the eye, not because he was handsome but simply because he was washed clean.</p><br/><p>Kong Rongliang saw them and was excited. \u201cI looked from afar and thought it was Benefactor. It\u2019s great that you are fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Qing wondered, \u201cHow many projects have you done? We just got out of the second one. It was so terrible!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cYou finished two projects?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kong Rongliang became excited again and the tears in his eyes were really unbearable to look at. \u201cIt is thanks to Benefactor! We really have to thank Benefactor!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled.</p><br/><p>Chen Qing slapped him before solemnly bowing to Xie Xi. \u201cFortunately I have these zombie legs or we wouldn\u2019t have survived the game just now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi and Jiang Xie were about to play the next game and it was good to know more information. Chen Qing understood this very well and didn\u2019t wait for Xie Xi\u2019s questions as he spoke about their experiences.</p><br/><p>It was probably because of the side task. Kong Rongliang picked the carousel and they were in team mode so they entered together.</p><br/><p>This carousel wasn\u2019t the childlike game of an ordinary amusement park. In the words of Chen Qing, there was nothing similar apart from the name.</p><br/><p>As soon as they entered, they were on a zombie horse that was rotted and rancid. It was like riding a piece of shit. Those with weak tolerance instantly vomited.</p><br/><p>Once the game started, the zombie horses started to spin but it wasn\u2019t the spinning of the carousel. The hoses spun in place and got closer to each other. The horses bumped into each other but kept spinning. They were extremely crazy and horse eyeballs were thrown all over the ground\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt disgusted when he heard this and prayed that he would never draw this game.</p><br/><p>Chen Qing continued, \u201cThe speed of the zombie horses kept increasing and fire appeared on their backs, just like a fire wheel.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cThen how is the game cleared?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kong Rongliang replied, \u201cHold on for 10 minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi imagined the scene and felt that these 10 minutes would probably feel like 10 years.</p><br/><p>Chen Qing said, \u201cOne of the rules of the game is not to fall off the hose. Once you fall, you will be trampled on by the zombie horse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kong Rongliang added, \u201cThe second rule is that the zombie horse can\u2019t stop. If it stops, even the person on the horse will be crushed with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s scalp became numb. \u201cThe zombie horses can be killed?\u201d Stopping was impossible then they could only be killed.</p><br/><p>Chen Qing replied, \u201cYes, the venue is very small. 20 horses are standing together and it is a mess once they start spinning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kong Rongliang continued, \u201cIf your horse dies, you can grab someone else\u2019s horse.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was easy to imagine how fierce this 10 minute game was.</p><br/><p>The zombie horse itself was disgusting and it kept spinning faster and faster. A person with poor psychological quality would probably fall off early and be trampled on.</p><br/><p>Even if a person was steady, they had to be careful about their horse dying. If someone took the initiative to steal the horse, the chaos produced would be indescribable.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn our game, there were two groups of people who were enemies. They took the opportunity to retaliate against each other and finally\u2026\u201d Chen Qing sighed. \u201cFour people survived in the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>The carousel was limited to 20 people and 16 people died in 10 minutes.</p><br/><p>Kong Rongliang said, \u201cMy position was very good. In addition, my father has a horse pedigree and I can ride well. Thus, I managed to survive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Qing was emotional. \u201cI really have to thank Benefactor. I definitely wouldn\u2019t have survived without this pair of zombie legs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi paused for a moment. \u201cAre the legs convenient?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t convenient but\u2026\u201d Kong Rongliang was thrilled. \u201cAh Qing has an undead body.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought he misheard. \u201cUndead body?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Qing was extremely grateful. \u201cYes! I seem to be a zombie. No matter what happens to my body, I can always recover.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was surprised. \u201cBut I just\u2026\u201d He used the Repair skill. Jiang Xie said, \u201cIt seems to be a blessing in disguise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finally reacted. \u201cIt should be that you were previously bitten by a zombie. You were infected but survived\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have survived if Benefactor hadn\u2019t given me these legs!\u201d Chen Qing spoke sincerely\u2026</p><br/><p>This was really a mistake\u2026</p><br/><p>Then Xie Xi remembered his side tasks and thought about how many times \u2018kill them\u2019 appeared.</p><br/><p>If he had really chosen to kill them\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Qing had an undead body? How could he be killed? If he couldn\u2019t be killed then Xie Xi would\u2019ve offended the \u2018zombie with a brain\u2019 and things would\u2019ve become very troublesome.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cOr you are very blessed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Qing was very emotional. He was the typical person who died and was born again.</p><br/><p>The carousel took very little time. They passed and played the next game. This time it was according to Chen Qing\u2019s quest and he picked I love you VS shameless.</p><br/><p>Of course, they weren\u2019t in the same venue as Xie Xi, They met a zombie boy, not a zombie girl.</p><br/><p>The rules of the game were the same but they had the bug called Chen Qing. Chen Qing voluntarily took the punishment three times and once the Opposite Card was released, everyone understood what was going on. They quickly used it and two sides confessed to each other, smoothly ending the game.</p><br/><p>Chen Qing asked Xie Xi about their game. Xie Xi told them.</p><br/><p>Kong Rongliang sighed with relief. \u201cOur game was still quite simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was sad. Compared with these two, he felt that he wasn\u2019t worthy of being called the emperor of luck.</p><br/><p>Chen Qing spoke again, \u201cUnfortunately, all those who emerged from here cleared the I love you VS shameless game. There isn\u2019t too much information about other games.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only a handful of people completed two projects. Most completed one or died in the project.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t expect to get too much information. If those who cleared the games could gather together then the difficulty of the game field would be greatly reduced.</p><br/><p>Kong Rongliang paused before saying, \u201cUnfortunately, there is no way to form a team in this open world or we could be together.\u201d It really would be much easier with Chen Qing\u2019s bug.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told them, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t have any big problems on my side.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them were reassured. Xie Xi had such a skill and they had also seen Jiang Xie\u2019s abilities. If they entered the carousel game then Jiang Xie could probably kick everyone off the horses.</p><br/><p>Due to the time limit, they didn\u2019t speak anymore and split up to select the next project.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi and Jiang Xie arrived at the place to draw a card and Xie Xi told him, \u201cThis time you pick.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were a small team. If one person picked then the other would follow.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie immediately said, \u201cYou do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if I pick a bad one?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him seriously, \u201cIf I pick, I will most definitely draw the hardest project in this game.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled. \u201cDo you have bad luck?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue me. My history is full of blood and tears.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was strangely curious. \u201cHave you encountered similar worlds before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve encountered them many times.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you live?\u201d</p><br/><p>For example, the I love you VS shameless game might not be all about luck but a person with bad luck would be very miserable.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied quietly, \u201cIf it was me, I would probably go directly through the forest towards the underground labyrinth.\u201d He would rather go through the zombies then come here and rely on luck.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His luck was bad to this extent? It was too bad that he had to avoid ht usual path?</p><br/><p>Over the years, Jiang Xie had become deeply aware of his bad luck. He never relied on luck for anything and resolved everything with strength. In a situation where 99% of people could live, he was only 1%.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt a bit distressed and praised him, \u201cMaster is so strong. You don\u2019t need luck.\u201d Jiang Xie answered, \u201cI still want good luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was so pitiful that Xie Xi didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, I have become much luckier after meeting you.\u201d Jiang Xie blinked. \u201cPerhaps I saved all my years of good luck for meeting you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Who would be distressed over this damn guy? Luck wasn\u2019t given to him!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took a deep breath and picked a card. The name of the next project appeared\u2014 chicken mobilization.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt sounds good.\u201d Jiang Xie stated.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cIs there such a game in an amusement park?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe I love you game isn\u2019t present in a normal amusement park.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said \u2018I love you\u2019 slowly and Xie Xi unexpectedly felt his ears become itchy.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be taken lightly.\u201d Xie Xi told him. \u201cJust like the carousel, this chicken mobilization is probably no better.\u201d</p><br/><p>The zombie boy responsible for the cards told them, \u201cThe multi-person project supports a team entry. The current number is full and the game is about to begin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Xie Xi and Jiang Xie were transmitted to the game area for chicken mobilization.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled. The scene in front of him was too normal. It was the ordinary waiting area for an amusement park. Five people were standing in front of them, as if waiting.</p><br/><p>Were they players or\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was still thinking with a long-haired woman among the five people opened her mouth. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d She asked Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie slightly raised an eyebrow.</p><br/><p>A man next to the long-haired woman cried out, \u201cMiss Yun asked you a question. Quickly answer!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told them his name.</p><br/><p>The woman known as Miss Yun was very disdainful. \u201cThis is a group confrontation game. I have enough information about it. There will be two cars after entering and they are each limited to six people. We are still lacking a person so come over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cNo, I\u2019m with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Miss Yun glanced at Xie Xi before telling Jiang Xie, \u201cDon\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t remind you. This game is very cruel. You will definitely die here if you don\u2019t enter my team.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is better to die than to enter your team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He often got angry at Jiang Xie but it was quite refreshing to see others become angry at him.</p><br/><p>Miss Yun froze. She didn\u2019t expect someone to be so ignorant. The people around her were heated up. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything! Do you think we would take you if your body wasn\u2019t intact?\u201d</p><br/><p>Another man added, \u201cYou have an exaggerated opinion of your own abilities. Do you think this is really an amusement park?\u201d</p><br/><p>Miss Yun looked at Jiang Xie and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cI will give you another chance. It is very dangerous here. No matter how strong you are, you can only die if your teammates aren\u2019t sufficient.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told her, \u201cMy teammates are very strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>A man scoffed. \u201cOnce you see them, you will know what type of teammates you have!\u201d</p><br/><p>Miss Yun still wasn\u2019t giving up.</p><br/><p>The man next to her said, \u201cMiss, it is about to begin. Let\u2019s not waste time. The person before was fine\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Miss Yun stared at Jiang Xie before giving up. \u201cStupid!\u201d</p><br/><p>They stepped aside and Xie Xi discovered that there were still people behind them\u2026</p><br/><p>The chicken mobilization game had 12 people with six people to a car. Things were still unclear but it was necessary for the six people to work together.</p><br/><p>Miss Yun had gathered a group of powerful people while the rest were \u2018repulsive.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared intently and realized why Miss Yun\u2019s group had been waiting for someone.</p><br/><p>Of the five people who fell there, two had no arms, two had no legs while one person was in a better state and was missing a hand. Thanks to Jiang Xie\u2019s refusal, Miss Yun had to fill up the numbers in her team and took him.</p><br/><p>The young man with no hand was moved to tears and excitedly joined Miss Yun.</p><br/><p>Miss Yun was disgusted. \u201cYou are lucky.\u201d</p><br/><p>The four people left behind were ashen-faced.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

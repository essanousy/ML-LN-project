It was Nan Yi. \u201cAm I the type of waste who would cry over a broken leg?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe didn\u2019t have a good temper. \u201cThen who is the dog who is calling out now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi spoke grievously, \u201cI am\u2026 I don\u2019t care. Come and treat me quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then a languid voice was heard. \u201cAh Zhe, he broke his third leg.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi shouted, \u201cGong Rui, can you fucking not gloat? If I\u2019m not able to have children anymore, I will cut yours off and put it on!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Rui\u2019s voice was still languid. \u201cMy size is bigger than yours and won\u2019t match.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi replied, \u201cI am fucking going to.. ouch, I am going\u2026\u201d He probably pulled something and his grumpy voice finally softened, sounding a bit like a child. \u201cAh Zhe, Zhe Zhe, my god, please heal me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe was silent for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m not a male doctor!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t bear to look straight. Was it that things with similar characteristics gathered in groups or did they become like this after spending a long time with Jiang Xie?</p><br/><p>He and Capricorn had arrived at the dungeon but due to the enchantment, the people in the prison couldn\u2019t see them.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi determined that the \u2018intruders\u2019 were all acquaintances.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe, Nan Yi, Gong Rui\u2026 they were all friends of Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi remembered that five of them had gone to be planets? Had they completed the task?</p><br/><p>It was possible. Don\u2019t look at the millions of years spent playing as planets. The time of the small worlds was different from Central.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi and Jiang Xie hadn\u2019t returned to Central but they had already passed through six quasi-worlds. According to the principle of worlds meeting, Yan Zhe should\u2019ve returned to Central.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was curious about what they had experienced in order to nurture new life\u2026</p><br/><p>He heard Yan Zhe say, \u201cThe thing on my wrist is containing my strength and I can\u2019t use my healing technique.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi cried, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be an eunuch ahhh\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Rui still had a cold air. \u201cWait for this task to finish and once we go back, I\u2019ll buy you a dozen. You can leave them somewhere safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi went crazy. \u201cAhh, this fucker is cursing me. I want to fight with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s lips twitched. How to say it\u2026 these big guys were in good spirits.</p><br/><p>At first, Xie Xi had doubted if they were just existences that originated from the souls and not real. Just like Yan Zhe in Cancer, they were based on the souls\u2019 memories.</p><br/><p>Now he had no doubts. They were definitely the god players. They took a task before entering this world. The task was obvious.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed with relief as he thought about how to talk to God Yan. He wasn\u2019t familiar with Nan Yi and Gong Rui. He knew they were friends of Jiang Xie but he had to be cautious when it came to life and death matters.</p><br/><p>He had faith in Yan Zhe. Based on Yan Zhe and Jiang Xie\u2019s past, Yan Zhe would never hurt Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had also thought about the possibility of Yan Zhe receiving the erasure task.</p><br/><p>After all, there were only a handful of people who could accept such high-level tasks.</p><br/><p>Yunge\u2019s master could and Yan Zhe could also. It was better to meet Yan Zhe then it was to meet the master of Yunge.</p><br/><p>Capricorn put Xie Xi down and Xie Xi asked him, \u201cAre all the intruders caught?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he opened his mouth, the lively dungeon instantly became quiet. Apparently, they couldn\u2019t see outside but they could hear.</p><br/><p>Capricorn sighed. \u201cThree people escaped. Aquarius and Pisces are pursuing them.\u201d He paused and added, \u201cScorpio failed. The person used an unknown spell to counter him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood. That\u2019s how Scorpio became seriously injured and had to summon Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>His eyebrows twisted as he couldn\u2019t figure some things out.</p><br/><p>He knew Jiang Xie\u2019s friends. The ones he were most familiar with were Yan Zhe and General Qin. The remaining three people included the captured Nan Yi and Gong Rui and Zong Xia.</p><br/><p>It was the ball who was the first to breed a lower life form only to accidentally kill it.</p><br/><p>This was five people. How could there be six?</p><br/><p>Three people had been captured. Apart from Qin Ge and Zong Xia, who else had escaped?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know. In addition, who hurt Scorpio? A spell counter\u2026 who had this ability?</p><br/><p>There were many mysteries in Xie Xi\u2019s heart but he was sure that he could solve more than half of them as long as he met Yan Zhe.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told Capricorn, \u201cI will go and see them. You wait for me here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Capricorn\u2019s eyes flashed slightly and the chain of the monocle shook unpredictably. \u201cThe three men have their magic contained but their melee ability can\u2019t be underestimated. You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him. \u201cAre you defying my order?\u201d</p><br/><p>Capricorn immediately bowed, his left hand against his heart. \u201cCapricorn wouldn\u2019t dare. Master, please forgive me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait here,\u201d Xie Xi\u2019s heart softened and his voice was lighter. \u201cRest assured, nothing will happen to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Capricorn bowed slightly and his eyes under his narrow eyelashes were unusually calm. \u201cThank you, my god.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi walked through the barrier and at the same time, drew a sound isolator to block God Yan\u2019s shocked, \u201cLittle Rose?\u201d in the enchantment.</p><br/><p>Capricorn outside couldn\u2019t hear the conversation inside.</p><br/><p>However, the three male gods in the prison choked with surprise.</p><br/><p>Even the lazy Gong Rui, who would sleep without changing his expression no matter what happened, couldn\u2019t help sitting up straight.</p><br/><p>The shocked Nan Yi\u2019s mouth was so wide open that an egg could be stuffed inside it.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe stared at Xie Xi and blinked.</p><br/><p>The little rose in front of him was both familiar and strange.</p><br/><p>He was wearing a black robe and the black cloak framing his handsome face more him look whiter.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t like a captured prisoner but the master of this gloomy castle.</p><br/><p>After recalling the name that he called out\u2026</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe\u2019s senses returned after a long time.</p><br/><p>Nan Yi had an impulsive character and wasn\u2019t able to control his mouth. \u201cX-Xie Xi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked over, his expression strange.</p><br/><p>Gong Rui\u2019s eyes narrowed and he used his fingertips to pinch Nan Yi\u2019s legs.</p><br/><p>This was to remind this stupid boy to control his brain and not fill the pit himself.</p><br/><p>Nan Yi was a bit brash but he definitely wasn\u2019t stupid if he could reach the present time. He calmed himself down.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was looking at them. The more he looked, the more certain he became.</p><br/><p>They were obviously guarding against him, unsure of his identity.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled bitterly and spoke respectfully to Yan Zhe. \u201cGod Yan, I haven\u2019t seen you for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe was amazed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi bowed to the other two people.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe got up while looking at Xie Xi. \u201cIt\u2019s really you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He paused before asking, \u201cIs this Old Jiang\u2019s quasi-world? Where is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>The question was simple but there were many things to answer. For a time, Xie Xi didn\u2019t know how to start talking.</p><br/><p>He looked down at Nan Yi who couldn\u2019t stand up and first untied God Yan\u2019s wrist. \u201cDid you accept the erasure task?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked first.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe could finally use his divine magic. As he cured someone\u2019s third leg, he muttered, \u201cIt is really Old Jiang\u2019s quasi-world\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi couldn\u2019t speak because of the treatment and Gong Rui returned to his usual lazy appearance. He was too lazy to even open his mouth.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Yan Zhe explained the situation while he conducted the healing.</p><br/><p>During this period, Nan Yi was very panicked. He was afraid that Yan Zhe would be distracted while curing him.</p><br/><p>Although he could casually replace parts when returning to Central but this thing\u2026 it was originally more emotional!</p><br/><p>This exchange basically resolved the doubts in Xie Xi\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe explained, \u201cOnce we cleared the quasi-world you designed, we saw that Old N released a team mission.\u201d</p><br/><p>According to the calculation of the Central time, Yan Zhe should\u2019ve come out of the world of the five balls just after Xie Xi left Aries. But they saw it was just\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pondered on it. Perhaps the first six small worlds were counted as one whole and the last six would be erased as a whole?</p><br/><p>Thus, when he entered the world that would be erased, it was a new task?</p><br/><p>It should be like this. That\u2019s how Yan Zhe could synchronize with his time and they entered the quasi-world together.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cIs the sixth person the master of Yunge?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is the captain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t surprised. The searched tasks might be random but the range wasn\u2019t. Low level players wouldn\u2019t randomly receive a high level erasure tasks.</p><br/><p>The number of people who could receive such a high level task was limited.</p><br/><p>Excluding Jiang Xie, N was definitely the one most preferred.</p><br/><p>The Central Government assigned the task to him and he accepted it, just as Jiang Xie and Xie Xi speculated.</p><br/><p>However, he wasn\u2019t that reckless\u2026</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe added, \u201cOld N originally wanted to team up with Jiang Xie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although N was suppressed by Jiang Xie and wanted to win again him, N definitely couldn\u2019t be hot-minded and impulsive if he managed to set up an organization that covered most of Central.</p><br/><p>The most rational method was to team up with Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>However, Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t in Central and N could only contact Yan Zhe.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe heard it was a super level task and his heart immediately tensed.</p><br/><p>He explained, \u201cOld Jiang left me a message before leaving\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood that this person had guessed there would be such a possibility!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s luck had always been poor and he encountered many things, causing his thinking to go in the worse direction.</p><br/><p>It was true that this life was a bit tiring but the crisis-ridden tasks meant he could carefully sail the ship for many years.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe continued, \u201cHe reminded me that if there is a super god level task, I should try it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of the current existing small worlds in Central, there were probably none that could be promoted to super god except for Jiang Xie\u2019s worlds.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know much about the task of erasing the world and asked, \u201cIf you accept it and don\u2019t finish the task\u2026\u201d Would they stay here forever?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can rest assured that the erasure tasks are different from that of the quasi-world tasks. If we can\u2019t finish it then we can give up and leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>It turned out to be like this. Xie Xi sighed with relief.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe added, \u201cOf course, there is a limit on the number of times\u2026\u201d He paused. \u201cIn short, you can rest assured since we all accepted it for the first time. It will be fine even if we give up and return to Central.\u201d</p><br/><p>The rules for erasing a world were very complicated. The tasks received after entering were graded and a thorough erasure might require dozens or hundreds of tasks. During this period, the player could give up three times but as long as the world wasn\u2019t completely erased, they would have to enter again. They had to do the tasks until the world was erased or.. .die.</p><br/><p>Of course, Yan Zhe didn\u2019t need to say these things to Xie Xi because he knew that Xie Xi was the only Repairer.</p><br/><p>As long as Xie Xi could repair the world, there would be no follow-up tasks!</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe also asked Xie Xi, \u201cWhere is Old Jiang? How is your mission going? Do you need us to do anything?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

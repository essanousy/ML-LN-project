He poured a glass of water onto soil and wiped the soil on his face.</p><br/><p>The contrast between skin and mud was so clear that people couldn\u2019t help stopping to look.</p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t necessary.</p><br/><p>Whether it was digging up mud or painting it on his face, it was like there was a film. The slimy mud didn\u2019t leave any traces on his hands and face.</p><br/><p>The hand could pick up the mud but the face was more exaggerated. It would slip down just after application, the mud falling to the ground and unceremoniously printing a large face on the ground.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened and he couldn\u2019t help letting out an exclamation that entered the ears of others as a chirp.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t expect there to be such a physique.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe explained, \u201cMy hair can\u2019t be cut and my body won\u2019t be stained by any dirt.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had been tortured for so long, hated his situation and thought about resisting and running away. It was just that his constitution was too poisonous and he couldn\u2019t change his appearance. Everyone could recognize him with one glance.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t mention the long silver hair and snow-like skin, his face alone was unforgettable.</p><br/><p>It was too easy to recognize him.</p><br/><p>It was reasonable that Yan Zhe\u2019s physique was so powerful. It was probably the principle of full healing. His blood could not only heal others but also himself. Therefore, his hair could be recovered and his skin protected from infestation. Perhaps the circulation of blood allowed him to recover from any dirt instantly and he couldn\u2019t be dirty in the eyes of others.</p><br/><p>It was highly likely that the Central Yan Zhe also had such a physique. It was precisely because of this physique that he could become a god-level player with the class of healer.</p><br/><p>It was true that God Yan in the Central Government was strong enough to protect himself but what about the initial stages?</p><br/><p>What about Yan Zhe who had this physique but was still weak?</p><br/><p>He must\u2019ve suffered as well.</p><br/><p>After seeing this, Jiang Xie was keenly aware of something strange. \u201cDidn\u2019t Little Chirp\u2019s roses fall on your hair?\u201d</p><br/><p>How did the white roses get stuck in the hair?</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe felt even more helpless and embarrassed. \u201cGood things can\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe glanced at Xie Xi and continued, \u201cLittle Chirp\u2019s roses look very good and they are like jewellery on the hair\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It could be seen that the physique was like Mary Sue but the essence of God Yan was a pure man. Thus, he was dying of embarrassment when he described it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was also speechless.</p><br/><p>What was this toxic power?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it only the legendary fairy women who were like this?</p><br/><p>There were too many things that Xie Xi didn\u2019t know where to start from!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was also speechless. If this was the icing on the cake\u2026</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe was already eye-catching. If Little Chirp\u2019s beautiful rose was added\u2026</p><br/><p>Even if his blood couldn\u2019t save people, Yan Zhe would still face many setbacks.</p><br/><p>In view of his real tragedy, Jiang Xie\u2019s attitude towards him changed greatly. Yan Zhe\u2019s situation was even more helpless for Xie Xi. There were many ways to make people act politely\u2026</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that the god\u2019s wisdom couldn\u2019t do it. Xie Xi hadn\u2019t been exposed to this type of product and couldn\u2019t create it.</p><br/><p>It was no wonder why Yan Zhe wanted to give up. Walking into the Zone full of people was like walking into the black fog.</p><br/><p>However, after the battle, the surviving Yan Zhe\u2019s mental state changed a lot. He picked up the weapon he previously used and asked Xie Xi, \u201cIs this done by Little Chirp?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie also wanted to know this. His long knife had been damaged as early as when he killed the first monster. Fortunately, Little Chirp gave him new weapons or they would\u2019ve died a long time ago.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe heard him say, \u201cChirp meow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie heard, \u201cChirp.\u201d</p><br/><p>Both men were stunned and the complicated mood they were felling was swept away.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe was really reluctant to separate from this big hairball and asked again, \u201cIt seems that Little Chirp can\u2019t only create roses but also other things?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a good reason!</p><br/><p>He had only created roses previously but this didn\u2019t mean it could only be roses. Other miscellaneous things were also okay.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi patched up his ability. \u201cI was worried about you and wanted to help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie translated for Yan Zhe and Yan Zhe was so moved he wanted to touch the round hairball.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie separated them and his eyes told Yan Zhe, \u2018Please have some self-respect.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe wanted to sneak a touch but he couldn\u2019t. Who let Little Chirp not belong to him?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked Xie Xi, \u201cDo you have any special feelings when using your ability?\u201d It was a bit unsettling to create things out of thin air. He was afraid that Xie Xi would have to pay something for it according to the law of conservation of energy.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cI\u2019m fine, only my wings are tired.\u201d He couldn\u2019t lift them up!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie gently massaged the large wings.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke again, \u201cI drank Yan Zhe\u2019s blood and feel much better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie heard Yan Zhe\u2019s name and wasn\u2019t happy. This tone felt a bit intimate\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart was moved. If Little Chirp called out his name, what would it be like?</p><br/><p>However, Yan Zhe was in front of him and he didn\u2019t dare ask. He could only endure it first.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe wasn\u2019t able to understand these words but he felt Xie Xi\u2019s eyes on him and asked, \u201cWhat did Little Chirp say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie started to mix private words into his translation. \u201cHe said he is tired and wants to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe was surprised. \u201cHe is still tired after drinking my blood? Maybe he is too big and needs to drink more\u2026\u201d He cut his wrist as he spoke.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shocked!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stopped him by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, he just needs to sleep. Don\u2019t use your blood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hurriedly shook his head and explained, \u201cI was just thanking you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe stared at the lying Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie frowned but didn\u2019t dare fool the idiot. \u201cLittle Chirp said thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe realized something and cast a suspicious look at Jiang Xie. \u201cAre you messing around with the translation?\u201d</p><br/><p>God Yan managed to find the essence of this guy!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded violently like a chicken pecking at rice. Sorry, it was a giant chicken!</p><br/><p>It seemed that Jiang Xie was born with this thick-skinned nature and his expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cSometimes there are mistakes.\u201d There were at least three chirps in a sentence, causing his ears to chirp. It was understandable that he would get some things wrong.</p><br/><p>Xie Shi and Yan Zhe: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, this young Cancer had the prototype of the stinky Old Jiang in Central!</p><br/><p>It was the middle of the night and they definitely needed a good rest.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t mention the matter of going to the Zone again. Xie Xi was still a bit worried and afraid that Yan Zhe would run away in the middle of the night.</p><br/><p>One person and one bird returned to the bedroom and Jiang Xie stared at him. \u201cDo you care that much about him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Why was there the taste of a husband going home, only for the wife to ask about the perfume smell?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was speechless. Was Cancer\u2019s sense of possession that strong?</p><br/><p>Besides, he was a little\u2026 big bird and acknowledged Jiang Xie as his master. What was this damn person so worried about?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his mouth. \u201cDad said that many friends will lead to more roads.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes drooped gently.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt a bit of regret. It was true that these words could appease Jiang Xie but it would also remind him of the grief in his heart.</p><br/><p>Father Jiang had mentioned such a thing. Jiang Xie had gone to school and he talked to himself and Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned close to the huge hairball. \u201cIt is enough if I have you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t be greedy. He just wanted to protect his last family member.</p><br/><p>Friends were too fragile.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed and patted the other person with his big wings. \u201cHowever, he is already our friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were in the same boat and suffering together. Wasn\u2019t this friendship?</p><br/><p>There was no talking about friendship but it was already there.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s back was stiff and he whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he won\u2019t give up on you.\u201d His tone seemed a bit sour.</p><br/><p>It was convenient that they could communicate with each other.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie expressed the doubts in his heart. \u201cThose knives and guns\u2026 did you make something else?\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, Xie Xi wanted to pretend that this was Jiang Xie\u2019s power. Since they would always be together, it wasn\u2019t a problem to pretend that the shield was Jiang Xie\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>It was just that Jiang Xie was clever and wasn\u2019t easy to fool.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at him with narrowed eyes. \u201cDid you do it before acknowledging me as a master?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw this person wanted to debunk the reason for helping Yan Zhe and could only say, \u201cAt the time, I was afraid you would have an accident. I wanted something to protect you and there was a transparent eggshell.</p><br/><p>The space shield was very much like an eggshell.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes slightly curved and he said thank you before continuing, \u201cIt seems that this ability was gained before acknowledging the master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wondered, \u201cAfter acknowledging the master, did you gain an ability other than creating roses?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was too lazy to mention this ability. It was useless and full of a non-lucky person\u2019s characteristics. Xie Xi suspected this was the welfare that came from acknowledging Jiang Xie as a master!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone about this, including Yan Zhe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood that it wasn\u2019t about not trusting someone. It just wasn\u2019t necessary.</p><br/><p>Many times, saying things that shouldn\u2019t be said harmed not only themselves but also others.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi should say, \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie heard, \u201cI chirp\u201d and couldn\u2019t help laughing. It was good to hear this lovely voice.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know about this and asked, \u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s lips were still curved. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi cared about him. \u201cWhat about your ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>There were two battles and Jiang Xie didn\u2019t show any special ability. He just had a good physique and high strength.</p><br/><p>As for fighting skills, Xie Xi thought it likely came from the main soul. After all , Cancer was only a high school student.</p><br/><p>An ability was just an ability and experience was irrelevant.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cDo you feel any force surging in your chest?\u201d It felt like this when he created roses.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie shook his head. \u201cNo, I feel no different from before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was silent. This senior unlucky person, was there no change?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt he had poked at the truth.</p><br/><p>He cried out, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019re strong now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t worried. Perhaps it was due to Yan Zhe\u2019s physique but Jiang Xie felt it was good that he hadn\u2019t completely changed. He never had good luck and if he really changed then it might be more pitted than Yan Zhe\u2019s ability.</p><br/><p>Based on the sky, it wasn\u2019t too early. They should rest and start on the road tomorrow.</p><br/><p>Before going to bed, Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t help telling Xie Xi, \u201cCall out my name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d What was this for?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned against the wings so Xie Xi couldn\u2019t see him. \u201cYou know, my name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi certainly knew it. \u201cJiang Xie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chirp Xie was indeed a hundred times better than Chirp Zhe.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

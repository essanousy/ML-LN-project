He summoned X in the Fairytale Town. This wasn\u2019t Jiang Xie\u2019s quasi-world and he shouldn\u2019t be able to see the live broadcast.</p><br/><p>The summoning in Atlantis was quite normal and there was nothing to see. Xie Xi sighed with relief.</p><br/><p>Then Jiang Xie exposed himself. \u201cI didn\u2019t see it, I personally experienced it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>In the past, Xie Xi was afraid of exposing himself and didn\u2019t use the summoning. Now this skill was an ornament and he didn\u2019t need to summon Jiang Xie. Thus, Jiang Xie confessed. \u201cYour summoning skill is a high rank and you can summon me directly.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shocked. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a puppet?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was impossible. If he could casually summon god players then wouldn\u2019t it be troublesome for the god players?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cIf I am busy, I can let the puppet accept the call.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about X in the Fairytale Town\u2026</p><br/><p>He tried to test it out. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have accepted the call at the time\u2026\u201d They had just met and how could the greatest designer in Central be so idle?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou needed my help? How could I not fight personally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was silent. He was wrong. This designer was idle enough to sit in Central and watch the live broadcast. How could he not accept the call?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about his \u2018two-faced actions\u2019 and was embarrassed. \u201cAt that time, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cYour goodwill for me at the time was -99 so it was natural to have me take care of that rubbish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie added, \u201cBesides, how could I let you do that dirty work? I was happy to be able to help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the time, the dragon heart was buried under a pile of disgusting corpses. Xie Xi had no skills or items at that time. How could he get such an important item apart from going down and grabbing it personally?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was different. He could randomly pick up the dragon heart.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was warm. \u201cYou clearly saw the -99 goodwill but you still came to help me.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had been really disgusted with Jiang Xie but he didn\u2019t hate Jiang Xie. He had been dragged into an unknown world and the game called Love to the Left or Right. The game ruined his three views and even after the rewards, he disliked this designer.</p><br/><p>It was just like the university entrance examination when the questioner gave a bunch of super-hard questions. Even if the candidates were admitted to the university, they would hate the questioner.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cYou can imagine what my mood was when my world showed up for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The words were a pun.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s quasi-world met Xie Xi and received salvation. Jiang Xie\u2019s inner world had Xie Xi and radiated a new life.</p><br/><p>The double emotions intertwined. Don\u2019t mention the -99 goodwill. Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t willing to let go even if it was -999. What drowning person would push away driftwood?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi only vaguely understood it in the past but now he fully understood.</p><br/><p>He was moved and then once he saw the garden full of roses that had recovered their vitality, he knew that Jiang Xie was okay.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi whispered, \u201cOnce Dream Come True happened, my dreams really did come true.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a really sweet confession and Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cDon\u2019t watch the live broadcast. Let\u2019s do happy things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no concept of time in Central. I declare that it is now tomorrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>This guy dimmed the garden\u2019s light so it was late at night. There were even stars and fireflies flying.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or cry. \u201cI\u2026 um\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie kissed him. \u201cYou seduced me first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pushed him away. \u201cI\u2019m talking to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I endured it for an entire quasi-world. Enduring any longer is bad for the health.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat sophistry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie said, \u201cIn particular, you are young and can\u2019t stand it. I will check just in case\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s tone changed. \u201cGet lost\u2026 ah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He scolded fiercely but it was only scolding. Jiang Xie ate fully and held the child. \u201cCome, let\u2019s look at our quasi-world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi fought to keep his eyes straight. \u201cHmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie kissed his eyes. \u201cIf you are tired then sleep. I\u2019ll record it for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI\u2019m not tired.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn fact, there is nothing good to look at. This quasi-world will be a piece of cake for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason why everyone went was because they were purely curious about Jiang Xie\u2019s designed world. Otherwise, the difficulty was too low for them.</p><br/><p>If these few people opened all their power, the newly born universe could collapse again.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi requested, \u201cI want to see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie took out a golden pill and fed it to Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t guard against him. His lips slightly opened and the pill entered in an instant. A sweet taste spread through his mouth and he asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA Perfect Big Repair Pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment, his physical exhaustion was swept away and his entire body was full of energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld N isn\u2019t a good person but his pharmaceutical abilities are excellent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was still surprised. This pill was truly amazing. Now only had he physically recovered, it seemed there was a gain effect in terms of qualification\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cThis pill can also enhance the five senses?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie nodded, \u201cIt is estimated to double your existing qualifications. If I eat one then mine will increase by 20%.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was even more shocked. \u201cSo great!\u201d</p><br/><p>It must be known that Jiang Xie\u2019s qualifications and resistance were too great. Ordinary medicine was useless for him.</p><br/><p>Yet this pill could increase Jiang Xie\u2019s qualifications by 20%. It was a godly medicine and there was no such thing in Central\u2019s mall.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s head hurt. \u201cWhy did you waste such a good thing?\u201d He could recover after a break.</p><br/><p>N was the master of Yunge? Was he good at pharmaceuticals? Xie Xi didn\u2019t know much about this person but from a previous chat with Jiang Xie, he knew that N had a godly skill.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie opened his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. After eating, I just need to look for Old N.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two\u2026\u201d He thought they had an antagonistic relationship.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cHe placed a reward on the training field. Whoever beats him can get a pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had a faint hunch.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI still have 30 more so rest assured.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Winning obtained one pill. To have 30\u2026 did the owner of Yunge originally have this style? Was he a living M? Being beaten like this yet still offering the reward?</p><br/><p>Master Yunge, not only are you an ATM, you are a conscience machine that is still persevering after being hammered!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi no longer felt pained by the pill and was more distressed for the ATM\u2026 ah, no, the master of Yunge.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had already opened the live broadcast. Xie Xi was quite curious about what Yan Zhe would encounter.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill they appear in the new universe?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie answered, \u201cIt should be. We put the world\u2019s will in and in theory, the new universe has already been born.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. He watched the broadcast and heard Yan Zhe\u2019s voice, \u201cNan Yi, stay away from me! You are sucking away the air I managed to save!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi also shouted, \u201cOld Qin, can you not do that? The light isn\u2019t enough!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ge was buzzing. \u201cWait for me to study.\u201d</p><br/><p>What did they encounter? The image lit up and Xie Xi didn\u2019t see the familiar figures. Instead, he saw\u2026 a galaxy?</p><br/><p>Gong Rui\u2019s lazy voice was heard. \u201cI\u2019m really confused. Did we really come to Old Jiang\u2019s quasi-world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zong Xia added, \u201cI have invertebrates here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe asked excitedly, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a pause and then Zong Xia\u2019s cold voice was heard. \u201cGod Yan, can you heal this invertebrate?\u201d</p><br/><p>The invertebrates that were hard to raise died again.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe roared, \u201cI\u2019m not a damn veterinarian!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the invertebrates didn\u2019t seem to be animals.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could understand their situation. His face was shocked as he asked, \u201cThey\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was calm. \u201cYes, they have become five balls.\u201d</p><br/><p>To be precise, they were a star and four planets, real planets! Four big gods and a god\u2019s milk, Central\u2019s male gods team went to an SSS-grade quasi-world and their task was to play planets!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s senses didn\u2019t return for a long time. \u201cThere was originally such a task.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie cleared his throat. \u201cAfter all, it is SSS-grade.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can they play as planets?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are doing a very good job.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was very good. One gave up on treatment and became a meteorite (Gong Rui), one was full of poisonous gas (Nan Yi). Forget organic manner. The sun didn\u2019t even shine and he wanted to swallow the next asteroid (Yan Zhe).</p><br/><p>The only normal one, Zong Xia killed the invertebrates that were hard to appear\u2026</p><br/><p>Then look at Old Qin\u2019s big sun flickering. Forget shining on the stars, he looked like he was going to explode.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw this and gained insight. \u201cYou\u2026 your old worlds were pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>He might always be a cheater as well as a fish and flower, but at least it was within the range of his cognition. If he directly became a planet\u2026</p><br/><p>According to this situation, they had to make a similar livable star for the life in the hard drive before they could clear the world?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt that he would have to watch for hundreds of millions of years to see the end.</p><br/><p>Of course, the Central Government didn\u2019t have the concept of time. He could go to a quasi-world now and then come back and meet them. However, if he watched the live broadcast then he really would go to Heaven.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t expect that his and Jiang Xie\u2019s world would be so pitted. Jiang Xie comforted him. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Haven\u2019t they experienced big winds and waves? This is kid\u2019s play.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could only comfort himself this way. Then a message appeared on their water curtain.</p><br/><p>[Announcement: Yunge is inviting god level players to team up to challenge an erasure task.]</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shocked. Jiang Xie knew what he was thinking. \u201cThere is no way.\u201d</p><br/><p>A task that exceeded SS-grade and was about erasing a world\u2026</p><br/><p>There might be Xie Xi but Xie Xi was the only repairer. He obviously couldn\u2019t keep up with the speed of the worlds collapsing and there was always a world that had to be abandoned.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the next world.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had to repair it quickly or he was afraid the quasi-worlds that contained Jiang Xie\u2019s souls would be obliterated.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart warmed. \u201cHave you searched for a new task?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll search now.\u201d</p><br/><p>He clicked on the search and the small funnel turned for a while.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked, \u201cHow is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at the name and had a terrible hunch. \u201cCollapsing 12 Boundaries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sighed. \u201c12\u2026 ah\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

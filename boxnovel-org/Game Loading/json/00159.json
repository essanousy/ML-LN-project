This shouldn\u2019t be automatically generated on the roster. Thus, he hadn\u2019t completed the task yet and wouldn\u2019t leave this quasi-world.</p><br/><p>The reason for entering the god\u2019s wisdom was the unique romance he prepared for the souls. This was the moment he would tell if it could be done or not.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his eyes and found himself sleeping in a sea of flowers. The flowers circled around him. \u201cLord Flower God, you are awake!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the time?\u201d</p><br/><p>No one replied to his question. Then a little flower called out, \u201cLord Azure Dragon is back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi turned his head and saw Azure Dragon approaching through the sea of flowers.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s lips curved as he smiled. Azure Dragon kissed him on the forehead. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA new world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t answer. Instead, he pulled Azure Dragon by the collar and kissed him on the lips.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon still had questions but he couldn\u2019t stand the sweet kiss. He simply bent over and returned a lingering kiss.</p><br/><p>The flowers covered their eyes and hummed shyly. Xie Xi remembered that there were others present and wanted to push away Azure Dragon. Then Azure Dragon picked him up and carried him back to the house.</p><br/><p>No one else was present and the different coloured eyes returned. Nevertheless, he pressed Xie Xi to the bed and kept going. Xie Xi was trying to refuse and really pushed hard. However\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 okay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cYou have seduced me like this. How can I not live up to your expectations?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi cried out, \u201cWe\u2019re not here to be alone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA lone man will do these things when alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>What a wrong idea! Xie Xi\u2019s reason was completely ruined by the hands that heated him up everywhere. Once the fire was put out, Jiang Xie was finally willing to speak.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cWe\u2019re in the god\u2019s wisdom.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie retorted, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I sealed the souls in it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s lips curved. \u201cI mean, are you sure this is the god\u2019s wisdom?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned. Jiang Xie added, \u201cThis might be outside the god\u2019s wisdom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Xie Xi\u2019s eyes were wide. \u201cI clearly\u2026\u201d He suddenly stopped and couldn\u2019t say it.</p><br/><p>If he held the god\u2019s wisdom, did it mean he was outside the god\u2019s wisdom? Must he be in the god\u2019s wisdom if he entered the god\u2019s wisdom?</p><br/><p>If he thought of the god\u2019s wisdom as a door that allowed him to travel back and forth, how could he distinguish between the inside and the outside?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie opened his mouth. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. The important thing is that we\u2019re together.\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew Xie Xi\u2019s thoughts and was sweetened by them. It made no difference if they were inside or outside the god\u2019s wisdom.</p><br/><p>The flower god drew the Holy Mountain and Demon Sea but did he really draw them?</p><br/><p>Perhaps when he picked up the pen, he entered the flower world of the drawing and met Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird and Nine Tails. Giving them names and recognizing their existence was bringing them out of the painting. Those \u2018sealed\u2019 in the god\u2019s wisdom might also come out of the painting.</p><br/><p>Of course, this was just a guess. It was as Jiang Xie told him: there are no boundaries between reality and falsehood.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was still thinking. \u201cThen\u2026 are we in the world outside the painting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is our world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Investigating the inside and outside of the painting was like pursuing the past and the future. There was no point. It was because there was no painting at all. There was only this time.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled and looked at him. \u201cWhat type of core task would\u2019ve triggered if I hadn\u2019t been the one to enter this quasi-world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew what he meant and told him, \u201cMake a guess.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t make a guess.\u201d Jiang Xie pecked Xie Xi on the lips. \u201cOnly you can enter my world so there is no other possibility.\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, no matter what the heart of the world was, there was only one core after Xie Xi entered.</p><br/><p>It was Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled and scolded him. \u201cA love brain.\u201d He knew that the worlds actually bored many of Jiang Xie\u2019s ideas. Nonlinear time, superimposed space, the so-called real and illusory\u2026</p><br/><p>More importantly, Xie Xi felt the uneasiness and longing of Jiang Xie. He was almost enlightening Xie Xi, helping him through the door of a designer and touching some of the most basic but core things.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s mind was obvious. He wanted to be with Xie Xi for a long time, rather than overnight.</p><br/><p>His will affected the souls but also the world, making Xie Xi the flower god.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his mouth. \u201cThere isn\u2019t much time left. You sleep well and I will go to the next one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cOnly hold the puppet to sleep. Don\u2019t mess around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Jiang who didn\u2019t expect this, \u201cI want to hold the real person!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really nice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he released a puppet and pushed it into Jiang Xie\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>The puppet had long been set up by Xie Xi. Its only function was to sleep. Xie Xi had written many words before entering the god\u2019s wisdom. It was wonderful. No matter the drawing, the flower god could use the pen to dominate the world.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought of this and his heart was as sweet as honey. He was the flower god and this world was Jiang Xie. His pen dominated Jiang Xie\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi first went to see White Tiger. He coaxed the hot-tempered White Tiger before making Jiang Xie hold a puppet to sleep. Then he coaxed Vermilion Bird, followed by Nine Tails and Houqing.</p><br/><p>This was the best solution that Xie Xi could think of. There were five hours in this world.</p><br/><p>Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Nine Tails and Houqing. The length of an hour was almost 24 hours on Earth.</p><br/><p>They represented the change in the sun and the moon. Whenever Azure Dragon woke up, the other four would sleep and so on. They would never meet.</p><br/><p>This was Xie Xi\u2019s inspiration when opening this world. Like the sun and moon, they would alternate and support the whole world. The souls were clearly arranged by him in this way.</p><br/><p>During the day, they would meet the real Xie Xi and at night, they would sleep with the puppet.</p><br/><p>After two rotations, Jiang Xie ordered, \u201cGo back to Central!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi joked, \u201cAren\u2019t you happy? There are five of me here.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was taking care of Jiang Xie by not making six.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s teeth were painful. \u201cVe, ry hap, py.\u201d</p><br/><p>He made the souls happy and bullied Jiang Xie. Xie Xi had a very big smile on his face when he returned to the Central World.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She looked 15 or 16 and should be in the most beautiful flower season yet at this moment, she was skinny and worn clothes hung on her body, making her look skinnier.</p><br/><p>She held a huge broom as if she was cleaning the yard.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie approached and the knuckles of the hands holding the broom protruded. She was terrified. \u201cPlease go quickly, you will die. She will\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled, his handsome face giving off a calming strength. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, we won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl stared, cheeks red and voice still scare.d \u201cNo, she will hurt you. She\u2026 my\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She cried while she spoke, her sad expression really pitiful. Xie Xi looked on from the side and didn\u2019t feel much. This girl was miserable but there was a sense of violation.</p><br/><p>The girl told them to leave but if she really wanted them to go, why not say it clearly?</p><br/><p>Such vague words combined with the miserable appearance would make people feel pity and curiosity and they wouldn\u2019t want to leave.</p><br/><p>Of course, maybe Xie Xi was thinking too much. After all, this was a girl who was scared and timid. It was normal for her words to be a mess.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t act rashly and just quietly watched.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie reached out to the girl. \u201cGet up first. Kneeling on the ground is very painful.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words caused the girl\u2019s eyes to flash.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked down and found that below the girl\u2019s short skirt, her knees that had been placed against stone were smooth and delicate with no wounds.</p><br/><p>It seemed that Xie Xi\u2019s gaze was noticed as blood slowly oozed from the knees.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi raised his eyebrows. This wasn\u2019t simple.</p><br/><p>The girl suddenly shouted, \u201cGo! You go! Grandmother has woken up!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment she finished speaking, the door suddenly opened and a black figure pounced along with a cool wind.</p><br/><p>It was an old woman with an unkempt face.</p><br/><p>She wore black clothes covered with blood, the smell making people sick.</p><br/><p>The old woman was very fast as she rushed to Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>She stretched out her claws, the slender nails on her fingers like dead wood that were about to pierce Jiang Xie\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie gently held her hand.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled by the scene.</p><br/><p>The image was quite strange, the elderly hand and Jiang Xie\u2019s hand forming a sharp contrast.</p><br/><p>There was one terrible hand that didn\u2019t look human and a perfect hand like white jade.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie held the old woman\u2019s hand like snow being covered with mud.</p><br/><p>The old woman didn\u2019t move. The girl squinted and her eyes swiftly turned to her grandmother.</p><br/><p>At her gaze, the old woman moved again. She made a squeaky noise like a monster and her face was fierce and terrible as she opened her mouth.</p><br/><p>Her body writhed madly like she was going to tear the main in front of her to pieces.</p><br/><p>However, Jiang Xie just held her with one hand like it was a cage, not letting her break free.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi paid attention to the girl who displayed a deeper fear on her face.</p><br/><p>According to reason, the mad grandmother was subdued and the girl should be relieved. Instead, she was even more afraid.</p><br/><p>What did this mean?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke softly, \u201cIt\u2019s been hard on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was talking to the old woman. The old woman groaned and her muddy eyes suddenly overflowed with clear tears.</p><br/><p>The girl\u2019s pupils shrank and she stared at Jiang Xie with horror. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie removed his hand and the old woman lost all her strength, falling softly to the ground.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie questioned the girl. \u201cWhat have you done to her?\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl held the broom and gazed hesitantly at Jiang Xie and Xie Xi. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s gentleness disappeared. He moved a finger with an expressionless face and a red cage fell on the girl.</p><br/><p>The girl was shocked. \u201cYou\u2026 you aren\u2019t human!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What a mess.</p><br/><p>He looked at the old woman. Jiang Xie had used a heart-clearing pill on this woman and the vicious demeanour had changed.</p><br/><p>The still yellow face was soaked with tears and looked every uglier.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi approached her and asked, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old woman stared at Xie Xi and couldn\u2019t say a word. She could only cry silently.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at the girl and declared, \u201cYou are the real witch.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young girl was frightened by the cage that appeared out of thin air and stuttered, \u201cW-What are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t admit it then I\u2019ll kill you. Then this village will be safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he finished, a few long swords hovered in the air above the cage. As long as they fell, they would pierce the girl in the cage.</p><br/><p>In such a narrow cage, the girl had nowhere to escape.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help giving a reminder in the team channel: We are here to fix the world, not erase it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie: Baby, rest assured. If I was erasing it then she would already be dead.\u201d There wouldn\u2019t be so much nonsense.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He always felt that this repair task wasn\u2019t a cure at all. It was full of violence!</p><br/><p>This might be hard to ignore but it was really easy.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the girl who asked for mercy but the old woman. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t hurt Mother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The old voice was as rough as sandpaper but they could be spoken with such strong love.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared blankly.</p><br/><p>The \u2018girl\u2019 in the cage revealed her true face. \u201cShut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>The old woman huddled up, looking pitiful. Her muddy eyes seemed to be washed clean by the tears, revealing purity and cleanliness.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked the old woman, \u201cYou are Nalene?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old woman didn\u2019t dare say yes. She only carefully stared at the young girl in the cage.</p><br/><p>The girl removed her disguise, her pitiful appearance becoming vicious and cruel. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie glanced at the girl and then the old woman.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked in the team channel, \u201cThey swapped their bodies?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie: It is unlikely. The fit between the soul and the body is very high.\u201d If it was an exchange then he would see it instantly.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t have this eyesight and asked: Go to the rest of the house to see?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie: Don\u2019t go in. It must be disgusting inside.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi: What should we do?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie: Look directly at her memory.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Was this okay?</p><br/><p>Facts proved it was fine. Jiang Xie who could use skills was like a giant chat affecting the existence of the game balance.</p><br/><p>Thus, they saw the ins and outs of the story.</p><br/><p>It was reasonable to say that if this wasn\u2019t Jiang Xie and other people were doing the task, there would still be grinding to find the answers.</p><br/><p>The girl and the old woman didn\u2019t exchange their bodies but the old woman was indeed Nalene and the girl was Nalene\u2019s mother.</p><br/><p>Putting aside all the fog, the truth was upsetting.</p><br/><p>Nalene\u2019s mother, Lina was a very beautiful woman who wanted to leave the village and marry someone in the city.</p><br/><p>However, Nalene\u2019s father forced her to marry him.</p><br/><p>Soon, Lina became pregnant and the nightmare started from this time.</p><br/><p>After the pregnancy, Lina started to become ugly. She didn\u2019t love her husband or the poor village life. She yearned for the city, yearned for prosperity and longed for the life of the rich.</p><br/><p>She was forced to stay in the village and became uglier because of her pregnancy, causing her to feel resentful.</p><br/><p>She hated Nalene\u2019s father and more so, the unborn Nalene.</p><br/><p>Nalene was born and Lina soon discovered the beauty of her daughter.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t love the child and even felt that the child had stolen her beauty.</p><br/><p>Nalene\u2019s father was also a jerk. After seizing Lina and taking advantage of his power in the village, he spent all day drinking and acting willfully.</p><br/><p>Lina hated him more and more.</p><br/><p>After another act of violence against her by Nalene\u2019s father, Lina fled.</p><br/><p>However, she was caught before she left the village and this was followed by more brutal abuse.</p><br/><p>Lina was locked up in the dungeon and in the midst of her endless resentment, she discovered a secret passage hidden deep in the dungeon.</p><br/><p>There was a black book with some writing in it.</p><br/><p>As long as she followed the instructions, she could make her dreams come true.</p><br/><p>Lina tried to collect the materials and cast the spell.</p><br/><p>The spell was successful and Nalene\u2019s father was jailed for a murderous crime in the city. Her lost beauty came back but her daughter Nalene became a sacrifice, suffering by aging.</p><br/><p>The 40 year old Lina became a young girl of 15 or 16.</p><br/><p>The young girl of 15 or 16 became an 80 year old woman because of her mother\u2019s curse.</p><br/><p>Did Lina\u2019s dream come true? No\u2026</p><br/><p>She soon discovered a new tip in the black book. She had to eat a fresh heart every day to maintain her youthful beauty or she would grow old overnight. She saw the ugly look of the 80 year old Nalene and didn\u2019t want to be like that.</p><br/><p>Thus, disaster struck.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned after seeing these memories.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cThe task is completed as long as the book is destroyed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crux of everything was the book and it would be over once it was destroyed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at the old Nalene with a strange feeling in his heart.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie took his hand.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him. \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a collapsed quasi-world. Many bad things happened and there was a lot of despair.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie quickly found the black book.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi went to Nalene, crouching in front of her and gently wiping the tears from her cheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>From start to finish, Nalene was the most innocent one.</p><br/><p>She had no choice to be born in such a family with such parents.</p><br/><p>She grew up with her father\u2019s violence and her mother\u2019s resentment, still clinging to the warmth of a family.</p><br/><p>In the face of her mother who gave her countless pains and disasters, she finally spoke in her old voice, \u2018Don\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t hurt Mother.\u2019</p><br/><p>The girl was broken and she long had blood-covered hands under the control of Lina.</p><br/><p>Her mind wasn\u2019t sound because no one had ever given her a healthy environment for growth.</p><br/><p>Yet she still knew how to love.</p><br/><p>Her loving nature made her sadly attached to such a cruel and selfish mother.</p><br/><p>After destroying the black book, the spell was lifted and Lina grew old and died.</p><br/><p>Nalene was restored to the appearance of a young girl and fell asleep.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked Jiang Xie, \u201cCan you erase her memories?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>They erased Nalene\u2019s memories and sent her to a seaside village thousands of miles away, giving her a new beginning.</p><br/><p>The mission was over.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie and Xie Xi returned to the garden.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Xie Xi was still slightly frowning, Jiang Xie opened his mouth. \u201cNow time, I won\u2019t pick up Old N\u2019s quasi-worlds. What broken tasks are there?\u201d It made his family unhappy.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cAre your tasks good?\u201d</p><br/><p>In addition to imagining many things, their brains liked to make him a slag!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cHow is it bad? My words are all about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart sweetened and the shadows in his chest were scattered.</p><br/><p>He opened his system panel and clicked on the data column.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn fact, I\u2019ve always wanted to know.\u201d He pointed to his father\u2019s column and asked Jiang Xie, \u201cWho is my father?\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>His mother was Xie Su but his father was a fog that couldn\u2019t be shown.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had never seen his data and at this moment, he made a strange expression.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was aware of it and glanced at this person.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at the fog. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 a player\u2019s ability to hide his or her own information.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned. \u201cA player?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie nodded. \u201cYes, advanced players can purchase an item. Once used, Central will hide their information.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi jerked. \u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour father is probably a player of Central.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s back was tense as he asked, \u201cThen he\u2026 he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie kissed him on the forehead. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, he might\u2019ve passed away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi froze.</p><br/><p>In fact, he had thought about it. Once he knew the rules of entry to Central, he knew he had no parents.</p><br/><p>Only those who were abandoned could come to Central. Xie Su gave up on him and his biological father gave up on him, causing him to come to Central.</p><br/><p>His father\u2019s life and death had become meaningless from the moment he entered Central.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saying he was dead was probably to comfort Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi leaned against Jiang Xie. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019ve very good now.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was because he was abandoned and lost everything that he met Jiang Xie. Losing didn\u2019t mean an ending. This was a new beginning.</p><br/><p>-\u3010 The End \u3011-</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s Note: Every time I finish a story, I feel very sad. The story of Old Jiang and Little Rose might be over but their lives are still going on. We can\u2019t see it but they are still repairing the collapsed worlds, bringing warmth to misery, bringing light to the darkness and bringing hope to despair!</p><br/><p>It\u2019s finally over! I will miss Jiang Xie\u2019s dog blood plots and seeing what else he will come up with for the long-suffering Xie Xi. However, like the author said, I will just imagine them still out there, designing and repairing worlds.</p><br/><p>For my next projects, I will finally be truly starting on Shh, There\u2019s a Beast in the Imperial Palace that I started a while ago over on Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

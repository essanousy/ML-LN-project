Wasn\u2019t the setting for the six princes to fight over the throne?</p><br/><p>What were all of them doing? Giving up their inheritance for a merman?</p><br/><p>Too incompetent!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to marry such incompetent people!</p><br/><p>Then he looked at the progress bar and stabbed himself. No, he had to. He couldn\u2019t think about whether he wanted it or not\u2026</p><br/><p>The third prince\u2019s eyes were bright, there was a bit of nervousness in his heart as he spoke awkward.ly, \u201cCough\u2026 I know it is sudden and you\u2019re probably happy\u2026 cough, you might be too happy that it seems like this is a dream. Still, I have to tell you seriously. It isn\u2019t a dream. Colin Hall, I am really proposing to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really hoped this was a dream. He wanted it to be a nightmare he could get rid of!</p><br/><p>\u201cYour\u2026 Highness\u2026\u201d Xie Xi barely found his voice. \u201cWe haven\u2019t known each other for long. You suddenly did this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince disagreed. \u201cWhat does the length of time matter? I like you and you have to be responsible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was speechless. He wanted to say that many people liked him!</p><br/><p>He hesitated and the third prince\u2019s eyes sank. \u201cYou still don\u2019t like me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at the progress bar and couldn\u2019t accept it. He hurriedly said, \u201cMy heart is the same as Your Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince was coaxed and smiled happily. \u201cSince we are the same, there is no need to waste time. Life is short, we should seize every minute and second!\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince\u2019s words of love were good to hear, especially after understanding his personality. Every word he spoke was from the heart and his whole future was filled with thoughts of love.</p><br/><p>It was impulsive to propose after such a short amount of time but this was the most romantic impulse in the world of love.</p><br/><p>In particular, in the face of a lover whose status was lower than himself, such active behaviour would give the other party a sense of security.</p><br/><p>The third prince might seem reckless but he was actually thinking wholeheartedly about Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know what to do. On one hand, he felt guilt. On the other hand, he was afraid of overturning the boat. After all, there was the second prince\u2026</p><br/><p>The third prince once again spoke sweet words. \u201cIn the past few days when you went home, I have missed you every day. Cough, I mean, I have been thinking about you and I every day, yes, it was about us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t explain. You\u2019re thinking about Daddy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pinched his ears. Could this kitten stop talking and die?</p><br/><p>The third prince cleared his throat and continued, \u201cThe more I think about it, the more I don\u2019t want to waste time. Since you like me, I have to take responsibility. I have to live up to your heart and can\u2019t let you have no name.\u201d</p><br/><p>The translation: Don\u2019t waste time. Since I like you, I have to quickly tie you to me. Otherwise, I will cry if you run away.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was so touched that he didn\u2019t dare to move. \u201cYour Highness, I am surprised but also\u2026 very, very happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Happy to die!</p><br/><p>The third prince was joyful and took Xie Xi\u2019s hand. \u201cThen you are willing to be with me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi no longer wanted to hear about marriage so he gritted his teeth. \u201cI am willing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun, \u201cOh~\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wanted to rub this little kitten until he was bald!</p><br/><p>The third prince hugged Xie Xi, directly pulling Xie Xi onto his lap.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Oh, this strength was really remarkable.</p><br/><p>The third prince pulled him down and the prince\u2019s eyes lit up like stars falling to the bottom of the sea. \u201cI will never disappoint you and never betray you. As long as I have all of you, I will give you whatever you want. Colin, I won\u2019t let you regret marrying me. I mean, marry me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt guilty and was too lazy to care about the words.</p><br/><p>As expected, after agreeing to marry the prince, the progress bar rose to 16.66\u2026% and turned from bright red to green.</p><br/><p>The third prince was done!</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Xie Xi wasn\u2019t happy. He took care of this and now had to get on another boat\u2026</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t think about it. Think about Roast Pork Bun being bald!</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will go tell Father and then tell everyone about us\u2026\u201d The third prince was worthy of being an active person. He just proposed and wanted to get married the next second.</p><br/><p>Since Xie Xi dared to agree, he naturally had a way to deal with this.</p><br/><p>He coaxed the third prince, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Your Highness\u2026 can we not tell anyone about this for the moment?\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince didn\u2019t understand. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pretended to be embarrassed. \u201cYou are a prince, I am just an ordinary person. We will surely cause a sensation\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince told him, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. No one would dare to bully you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is easy to dodge a spear in the open but hard to avoid an arrow fired in the dark.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a reminder to the third prince that while he might have the confidence to take care of Xie Xi, he also had to sacrifice some of his freedom.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to become a rare sight for spectators\u2026 not to mention,\u201d Xie Xi continued, \u201cThe time we\u2019ve spent together is too short. I hope to spend more time with Your Highness and get to know each other better. If Your Highness regrets this then I\u2026\u201d He bowed his head and looked pitiful.</p><br/><p>The third prince\u2019s heart instantly softened and he spoke softly, \u201cHow can I regret it? Now that I have said this, I will be responsible to you for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi whispered, \u201cThen please give me this time Your Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>His cautious appearance made the third prince very distressed. \u201cI will listen to you. I will do whatever you say as long as you don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Who was crying?!</p><br/><p>He managed to convince the third prince and said, \u201cIt is late. I should go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince didn\u2019t want to let him go. \u201cWhat is the hurry? Tonight\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was embarrassed. \u201cit will be suspicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince felt slightly annoyed. \u201cWe are about to get married. Why does it feel like we are having an affair?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t answer. After all, the second half of the third prince\u2019s sentences were true.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, this face was very deceptive and the third prince had a filter. He thought Xie Xi was angry and replied, \u201cFine, I will listen to you. Go back and I\u2019ll come find you tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt guilty but he was already walking this rope and had to endure it. \u201cYour Highness, don\u2019t casually come find me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince wasn\u2019t happy. \u201cWe can\u2019t meet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s strange for you to always show up at the guards\u2019 quarters.\u201d Xie Xi quickly added, \u201cPlease let me come to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third prince raised his eyebrows at the words and smiled. \u201cOkay, think of me and come see me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had a toothache. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>His cute appearance made the third prince fell full of sweetness. \u201cDon\u2019t go out and then come back.\u201d People who loved each other naturally thought of each other al the time.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t have a toothache. His teeth were almost falling out!</p><br/><p>He controlled his heart and stated, \u201cI will send you a message.\u201d</p><br/><p>The silly prince was happy again. \u201cOkay, send me a message if you miss me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded and then fled.</p><br/><p>The third prince was handled and Xie Xi went directly to the second prince.</p><br/><p>The vertical and horizontal directions were dead ends so he had to gamble!</p><br/><p>As soon as he arrived at the second prince\u2019s palace, Xie Xi knew that he wasn\u2019t mistaken.</p><br/><p>This \u2018shabby\u2019 palace had never looked so much like a palace!</p><br/><p>Why would the second prince work so hard to take care of his palace unless something big was happening?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw the second prince and was stunned.</p><br/><p>The second prince was always the most fashionable one. He had silver hair, white skin, delicate facial features and eyes that were slightly curved in a smile. It was estimated that most girls couldn\u2019t resist him.</p><br/><p>At this time, he changed into a silver uniform that clung to his body, perfectly outlining his slender figure. He was like an elf prince.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shocked by his \u2018dressing up\u2019, not his appearance.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t the second prince asking for marriage? Why did it seem like he was going to get married directly?!</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Xie Xi was thinking too much. The second prince just paid attention to the first big event in his life and made it so grand.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi bowed to him.</p><br/><p>The second prince didn\u2019t get straight to the point like the third prince. He asked carefully about Xie Xi\u2019s return home.</p><br/><p>This appearance was really gentle but Xie Xi felt anxious. Hurry up and propose so Xie Xi could rush to the next one! However, the second prince talked a lot and didn\u2019t get to the point for a long time.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s time was limited and he took the initiative to open his mouth. \u201cYour Highness, you said that you wanted to find me for something. Is it important?\u201d</p><br/><p>The second prince\u2019s eyes became hot at these words.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had been proposed to twice today and couldn\u2019t feel any panic or nervousness the third time. He just wanted it done quickly!</p><br/><p>The second prince was very cautious for the first time in his life. \u201cI had a dream while you went home these past few days.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>Why did it feel like he was laying the groundwork for 10,000 words?</p><br/><p>Sure enough, the second prince made a decision and said, \u201cI had a dream that you were married to someone else. That person was rude, barbaric and very bad for you. He even drove you out of the house\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew about this dream. After all, he personally accompanied the prince in the dream.</p><br/><p>Once the groundwork was finally laid, the second prince stared at him affectionately. \u201cI thought about it and feel that this dream is a warning. If I delay any longer, perhaps that tragedy will happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sorry, you\u2019re too late. Your brother has already made a strong start.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was in a daze and the second prince wasn\u2019t surprised. He took Xie Xi\u2019s hand and whispered, \u201cPerhaps you think this is a bit sudden but I have been thinking seriously. Can you give me a chance? I want to be with you for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He spoke so much, no wonder why he was a step slower. His brothers proposed marriage as soon as they opened their mouths!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was an expert and had ridden this train three times. He acted very surprised, \u201cYour Highness, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you hate me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi whispered, \u201cI don\u2019t hate you. Who would hate you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The second prince still had confidence and his voice was gentle, \u201cDo you hate that I like you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought it would be better to blush but he couldn\u2019t do it. He just trembled as he replied, \u201cYou are joking with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there is a lie in my words, let me be struck by lightning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hurriedly cried out, \u201cYour Highness, don\u2019t say such a thing!\u201d He was so anxious that the second prince thought this guy really liked him too and felt peace of mind. \u201cNo hurry, we have a lot of time. I will slowly let you know that I am serious and really want to be with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are a prince, I am just a small guard. We\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d The second prince was worthy of being brothers with the other two. Their brain circuits were exactly the game. \u201cI won\u2019t inherit the throne and don\u2019t need to worry about what anyone else thinks. Besides, I\u2019m not a little boy who doesn\u2019t understand the world. I can make decisions for my own business.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was really true. With the second prince\u2019s power, no one could easily shake his decision as long as it wasn\u2019t too big.</p><br/><p>The second prince spoke again, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be afraid. We will take it slowly. No matter what problem I encounter, I will solve it and not let you feel troubled.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt it was almost there and gritted his teeth. \u201cI am very happy to hear you say this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The second prince\u2019s heart jumped and he asked, \u201cYou are willing to accept me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at the progress bar and nodded.</p><br/><p>Whoosh. The purple progress bar rose to 16.66\u2026% and turned green.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi relaxed and fell into the second prince\u2019s arms. Aix-en hugged him and spoke in a tone full of uncontrollable excitement. \u201cThis is the happiest moment of my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, that joy would turn to sadness.</p><br/><p>Xie Xie Xi continued his routine. \u201cYour Highness, I feel like I am dreaming.\u201d</p><br/><p>The second prince\u2019s lips curved. \u201cRest assured, I will make sure that reality is better than the dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled before becoming slightly worried. \u201cThere are many people who like you. If they know that I am with you, they will\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will protect you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was still worried. \u201cIt is very painful to lose a person forever. I am afraid that the people who like you will do irreversible things.</p><br/><p>This sentence reminded the second prince of another matter.</p><br/><p>He naturally knew that the third prince liked Colin. Knowing the temper of his third brother, wouldn\u2019t Gars be upset after finding out about this?</p><br/><p>Little Colin was very timid. What if the third prince did something?</p><br/><p>The second prince sobered up and told Xie Xi, \u201cGive me some time. I will handle everything properly so that you have no worries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will listen to Your Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201d The third prince\u2019s voice was warm. \u201cI won\u2019t let you be in danger, let alone cause trouble for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He bit the hook on his own but Xie Xi unexpectedly felt guilty.</p><br/><p>No, he couldn\u2019t feel guilty! He had to run down this road or he would be dragged down to death! After taking care of the second prince, Xie Xi returned to the fourth prince to accept his proposal.</p><br/><p>2,3,5 and 6 were full, leaving only 1 and 4.</p><br/><p>Once the fourth prince was full, he would pretend to be the resurrected Sein and take care of the eldest prince.</p><br/><p>As long as the eldest prince\u2019s progress was full, he could leave this world. The rest\u2026 it had nothing to do with him!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was arriving at the palace of the fourth prince when Roast Pork Bun reminded him, \u201cDaddy, aren\u2019t you changing your face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled and realized he was wearing the second face.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, he had the kitten or he would\u2019ve fallen into a pit.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, there were so many people and so many faces\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was really a scum man pedalling N boats. In the end, he pushed himself into such a desperate situation!</p><br/><p>He changed faces, steadied his mood and went to see the fourth prince.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince saw him coming and looked surprised. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi adjusted his emotions and said, \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince had a slight smile on his face. \u201cThere\u2019s no hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Xie Xi took a deep breath and looked at him. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for tomorrow. I want to tell you right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince was stunned and his throat was a bit tight. \u201cYou\u2019ve really thought about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi solemnly replied, \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth prince confirmed again, \u201cDo you want to marry me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded.</p><br/><p>Okay\u2026 Xie Xi glanced at the progress bar, wanting to see the harvest after his lower limit was broken\u2026</p><br/><p>Black 16.61%, white 16.66%.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>Black was the eldest prince and white was the fourth prince.</p><br/><p>Why wasn\u2019t it full? Why didn\u2019t it turn green? He said yes to the proposal.</p><br/><p>The fourth prince hugged him and asked, \u201cWhat type of wedding would you like?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned. Did he have to actually wed the fourth prince to fill it up?</p><br/><p>The question was how could he marry the fourth prince, not let the third and second prince know about each other while pretending to be resurrected to cope with the crazy first, fifth and sixth princes?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finally realized\u2014</p><br/><p>What he needed wasn\u2019t the Camouflage skill but the body dividing skill.</p><br/><p>Now he couldn\u2019t attend to so many things at the same time!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

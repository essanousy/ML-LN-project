Old Qin\u2019s forehead was big and he had one more character written on it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was still immersed in his previous conversation with Xie Xi and his mind didn\u2019t return for a while.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe took the initiative to open his mouth. \u201cOkay, don\u2019t stare at us like we\u2019re enemies. We have something to tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s senses returned and he glanced at Yan Zhe. \u201cGod Yan, what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Compared to talking to Old Jiang, Yan Zhe preferred Little Rose. \u201cWe have all received a new task.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t responded yet when Yan Zhe and the others opened their system panel.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw five different quasi-worlds, all of which were SSS-grade. The designers were X and IE. In other words, Jiang Xie and Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stated, \u201cThey are just the 12 repaired quasi-worlds.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi was sour. \u201cDesigning 12 quasi-worlds in one breath, you are crazy! The outside is boiling up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at Jiang Xie with doubts in his eyes. They hadn\u2019t gone to the designer\u2019s hall yet. How was the design completed?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie waved his hand and spoke to Nan Yi. \u201cWhat is 12? There will be 120, 1200, 10,000\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yi immediately cried out, \u201cstop! In the future, all the high level worlds in Central will be designed y you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s lips curved and he humbly admitted it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mouth twitched as he understood the meaning of Jiang Xie\u2019s smile. It was more than a high level world, they even designed a Central Government.</p><br/><p>However, this was too alarming that Jiang Xie didn\u2019t mention it to anyone.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie might love to brag but he had a sense of proportion. He was clearer than anyone else about what should be said and what shouldn\u2019t be said.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked them, \u201cWhy, do you want to play?\u201d</p><br/><p>The men who played as the five balls all had complicated expressions. They were afraid of speaking and being pitted. They spent billions of years as a foolish planet. Anyone who heard this would be sad enough to shed tears.</p><br/><p>They could say they didn\u2019t want to go but they were too curious. The tasks they could accept now were very limited. The erasing tasks were to fight and kill. This was repetitive and monotonous. They had been tired of it long ago.</p><br/><p>The tasks of other quasi-worlds were too low and they simply couldn\u2019t enter. Oh, they could enter like Old Jiang by evil exchanging a price but who knew what they would lose? They didn\u2019t have an extremely lucky physique.</p><br/><p>Thus, it was tempting to have many unknown small worlds of their level.</p><br/><p>In fact, Xie Xi was also very curious but he was now a designer. He couldn\u2019t enter the worlds of his own design and could only watch them.</p><br/><p>Finally, Yan Zhe cried out, \u201cWhy won\u2019t we go? Don\u2019t keep goods within your family!\u201d</p><br/><p>They might\u2019ve acted foolishly for several billion years but the rewards were very rich and there were many good things that could be encountered.</p><br/><p>They entered the mission world in front of Jiang Xie and Xie Xie.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi curiously asked Jiang Xie, \u201cIn the new civilization, God Yan and the others really stayed for billions of years\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What a terrible amount of time.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smirked. \u201cThe life of a planet can\u2019t be measured from a human perspective, just as a fly can\u2019t imagine the lifespan of a human.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having experienced so much, he was still easily bound by time and space.</p><br/><p>At first glance, it was terrible that they lived for billions of years as a planet. Then what about humans who had a long life compared to mayflies? They didn\u2019t feel that their life was short. The same was true for planets.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at Jiang Xie and spoke sincerely. \u201cI still need to learn.\u201d</p><br/><p>In terms of understanding, the gap between him and Jiang Xie was very large.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie laughed and held his waist. \u201cRest assured, I will teach you well. This pose\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He would give this trash teacher a hammer!</p><br/><p>After fighting for a while, Xie Xi asked, \u201cWe didn\u2019t go to the designer\u2019s hall. Why was the design of the quasi-world a success?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is because these quasi-worlds are the new Central.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cThe 12 worlds formed a new Central but they aren\u2019t mature enough so players need to clear them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce cleared, they are the beginning of a new Central!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jiang Xie nodded. \u201cAfter being cleared, the new Central will select the first generation of players from the new worlds.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then there would be a new cycle, just like the current Central.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cThen we designed these 12 quasi-worlds in the new Central Government?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were many unknowns ahead but as long as they were with each other, they would always find the answer. This was the joy of life.</p><br/><p>It was because he was looking at the system panel that Xie Xi saw a friend application.</p><br/><p>He looked at it and was N, master of Yunge.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced towards Jiang Xie. His panel was open to Jiang Xie and Jiang Xie could also see it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained to him, \u201cIE is a code name but there are items that allowed people to search for you using it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, low level players couldn\u2019t get this type of item but N certainly could.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke again, \u201cYou can set permissions here so that people can\u2019t find you even if they have items.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi first accepted N\u2019s friend request before turning off the search permission.</p><br/><p>12 quasi-worlds had been designed in a row and there was a chance IE was now bigger than X. People would want to add him as a friend.</p><br/><p>Rather than inviting trouble, it was better to close it as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie opened his mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t take Old N seriously. He\u2019s just looking for a naive and capable person to do his work.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t agree. \u201cHe isn\u2019t hostile to you. He knew it was your quasi-world but happily gave up the task.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie XI and N\u2019s negotiations might be a mutually beneficial transaction but if N had other ideas, he could still do something.</p><br/><p>Yet he didn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>He honestly told Xie Xi what he saw after touching the centre and easily gave up the task.</p><br/><p>Compared to the scum members of Yunge that he previously met, the master wasn\u2019t so annoying.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stated, \u201cHe only values your identity as a Repairer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at him. \u201cHe was bullied by you yet doesn\u2019t want to kill you. I think he is very broad-minded.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because he is weak.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Xie Xi not understand this person\u2019s small mind. He smiled and asked, \u201cCan\u2019t you grow up a bit? Why must you always drink a pot of vinegar?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie kissed him. \u201cWho made you so good?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or cry. \u201cOkay, let go!\u201d</p><br/><p>His heart was as sweet as honey. He obtained a new task and it even\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw this and became sourer. \u201cYou really want to repair his garbage world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, Xie Xi found the collapsed world that N had designed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mouth was curved and he looked very happy.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie became even unhappier.</p><br/><p>Then Xie Xi spoke and the old vinegar instantly sweetened to honey.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cThen your souls are truly all recovered.\u201d</p><br/><p>If there was still a collapsed world out there, Xie Xi would definitely be the first to find it.</p><br/><p>Now\u2026 it was someone else\u2019s world. This meant he brought back all the souls.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was in a good mood and the name N wasn\u2019t so disgusting.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi added, \u201cIt\u2019s quite a coincidence. The first time I randomly searched for a world, it turned out to be N\u2019s world.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, N who was added as a friend sent a message to Xie Xi: I received the world that you and X designed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Out of 12 quasi-worlds, the male gods received five and other god level players must\u2019ve received it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also replied to him: I also received the task of repairing your quasi-world.</p><br/><p>N replied very quickly: Thank you very much.</p><br/><p>They were simple words but anyone could see his nervousness and excitement.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at N and couldn\u2019t help thinking of the previous Jiang Xie, his heart sad.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Jiang Xie didn\u2019t forget to devalue the \u2018dangerous element.\u2019 He said, \u201cit isn\u2019t a coincidence. There is a high probability. It is unknown how many of N\u2019s quasi-worlds have collapsed in these years. All of us have received a task to erase them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The worse the collapse, the higher the chance it had of being selected.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi remembered this matter and asked, \u201cWhy is N so obsessed with designing a quasi-world?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be what he saw.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi paused before asking, \u201cDid he see me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cHe couldn\u2019t see you because\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t finish but Xie Xi understood and smiled at Jiang Xie. \u201cYes, because I don\u2019t belong to any future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie corrected his words. \u201cYou don\u2019t belong to any destined future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi expressed the words in his heart. \u201cYou saved me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was slightly shocked.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up at him and pointed out the thing that Jiang Xie deliberately spoke vaguely about.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the destined future, I died early. It is because of your efforts that I am no alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s lips quivered before he hugged Xie XI. \u201cThe future that doesn\u2019t happen is false and non-existent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also hugged him. \u201cI know that only what we believe is real.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Jiang Xie did see it.</p><br/><p>He saw Xie Xi\u2019s death and the worse ending. Then he smashed through all the thorns, carrying countless sufferings as he waited for Xie Xi, guarding him from the beginning.</p><br/><p>At a time when Xie Xi didn\u2019t know and when he couldn\u2019t think about it, Jiang Xie had been waiting for him.</p><br/><p>What was Xie Xi\u2019s good luck?</p><br/><p>His good luck was that he encountered Jiang Xie from the beginning.</p><br/><p>He went from nothing to the present situation and was very satisfied.</p><br/><p>It was because someone had been paying for him silently.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What was the truth? He just had to test it.</p><br/><p>He went to get another present and headed to the palace of the fifth prince.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun hung from his neck. \u201cYour heart is beating fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t say anything. He was so frightened, how could he not be unhappy?</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun asked again, \u201cIt is because you have seen your sweetheart?\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s steps paused. \u201cWho is my sweetheart?\u201d</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun replied, \u201cThe handsome man just now. His pair of eyes were really handsome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi remembered how Roast Pork Bun said that Xie Xi was ugly when just hatched. Xie Xi didn\u2019t feel it himself but other people said he wasn\u2019t ugly\u2026 then what was Roast Pork Bun\u2019s aesthetics?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was afraid of his fantasies and explained, \u201cHe isn\u2019t my sweetheart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun asked again, \u201cIs your heartbeat accelerating because you are about to meet your sweetheart?\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this mess?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s chin struck the cat\u2019s forehead. \u201cShut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun was afraid he would be sold in this quasi-world and didn\u2019t dare ask anything else.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince lived far away and his palace was as big as a town. It was fortunate that he could swim as a mermaid. If he used two legs to walk then he would probably die.</p><br/><p>To tell the truth, even swimming was exhausting. Xie Xi\u2019s swaying tail quickly cramped up.</p><br/><p>Finally, he arrived at the fifth prince\u2019s palace. Xie Xi saw a luxury that was quite different from the sixth prince\u2019s palace.</p><br/><p>It was obviously the same architectural style but one was cold and depressing, while the other was magnificent with shining lights.</p><br/><p>The two brothers had very different personalities.</p><br/><p>One was lonely and the other was passionate. It was like the progress bar. One was deep blue and the other was a hot orange.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to accept this conjecture. He refused to admit that the different colours on the progress bar represented different princes!</p><br/><p>The fifth prince\u2019s birth mother was the queen of the underwater kingdom. He was the only legitimate prince who by all accounts, should inherit the throne. There was no reason to hesitate.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the fifth prince himself was extremely disgusted with the court and political affairs. He was accomplished in art and was a famous artist in the underwater kingdom.</p><br/><p>Such a prince must inherit the throne if there were no other brothers. However, his four older brothers and even his younger brother were very good. Don\u2019t look at the fourth prince\u2019s illness and the sixth prince\u2019s different coloured eyes. They had clear minds and were extremely adept at government affairs. One was a powerful person who tamed the Lord of the Abyss.</p><br/><p>Not to mention that the first, second and third princes each had their own supporters and their voices were extremely high.</p><br/><p>In contrast, the fifth and legitimate prince had the highest popularity and most noble bloodline. However, even his most enthusiastic fans felt he wasn\u2019t suitable for the throne.</p><br/><p>Of course, it didn\u2019t matter if he could become king or not. His treatment was excellent, meaning the palace was gorgeous and extraordinary. Xie Xi arrived and was greeted by a beautiful female mermaid. \u201cRoyal Guard, thank you for the trouble of coming in person.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a gift from His Majesty. According to etiquette, as long as the prince was in the palace, he must come forward and thank Xie Xi in person.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told the maid, \u201cI will trouble you to inform him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The maid replied, \u201cPlease wait a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>A while later, the maid came out and said to Xie Xi, \u201cPlease come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gave the gift to the shrimp soldier beside him, followed the maid and walked into the well-deserved \u2018Crystal Palace.\u2019 Even if he had seen the sea floor, the sight in front of him was extremely beautiful.</p><br/><p>The coral groves had beautiful colours that had never been seen on land and little fish swam freely, like beautiful butterflies among the flowers. Not to mention the pearl white luster of the porch, the fine carvings and the shiny jellyfish stretching out in the sea\u2026</p><br/><p>It was like Xie Xi was entering the Grand View Garden and he was dizzy from the sight.</p><br/><p>Then once he got to the main hall and saw the scene inside, he felt that the luxuries outside were nothing but embellishments.</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s eyes were drooping as he fiddled with the harp and sound emerged. In an instant, there seemed to be countless flowers blooming. In the wide hall, there seemed to be beautiful dancing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened with amazement.</p><br/><p>The sound of the harp stopped and the illusion disappeared. The fifth prince got up and walked straight towards him. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi bowed to him. \u201cI have seen Your Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince helped him up and asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The tune was nice and there was an indescribable allure. Under normal circumstances, XIe Xi would find it hard to say he liked it but now\u2026</p><br/><p>He hung his head and whispered, \u201cI like it.\u201d He felt like his teeth were hurting when he heard this!</p><br/><p>The fifth prince grabbed his hand. \u201cThere is another one that I have specifically written for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d They only met once. What damn song did he write?</p><br/><p>He was in a complicated mood as he watched the orange progress bar rise again.</p><br/><p>Did it still need an explanation? Was he going to keep deluding himself?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t willing and tested it a bit more. \u201cYour subordinate still has more orders. I have to go to the other palaces\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t there anyone else in the royal guards? Why do you have to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is your subordinate\u2026\u201d Xie Xi gritted his teeth. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for this errand, this subordinate wouldn\u2019t be able to hear your heavenly voice.\u201d The implication was that he took this job for the prince!</p><br/><p>He had just finished speaking when the orange progress bar shot up!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d The damn self-centred X!</p><br/><p>The fifth prince\u2019s eyebrows rose as he said, \u201cI was thoughtless. I should\u2019ve sent someone to pick you up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cYour Highness is noble. Why should you remember these little things?\u201d</p><br/><p>The orange progress bar rose again at his words. To some extent, the prince was really simple!</p><br/><p>The fifth prince said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry over it. I will immediately\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no need.\u201d Xie Xi patiently explained, \u201cThis subordinate has just entered the palace. I have neither an identity or background. It will be hard to gain a foothold so I hope you will be considerate.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince frowned. \u201cCome to me and I will take care of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cIf Your Highness really appreciates me, wait for my position to be higher. Once I can apply for deployment then serving you will be more logical.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth prince stared at him for a long time. \u201cThen I will listen to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart beat like a drum. Why? Why was he doing this?</p><br/><p>He was about to leave when the fifth prince asked again, \u201cHave you been to see Sixth Brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t understand before but he did now. Was the prince thinking about the meal they had together?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was a good youth yet he was experiencing a slag man\u2019s dilemma.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t say anything and the fifth prince\u2019s expression became more subtle.</p><br/><p>XIe Xi\u2019s brain turned quickly. He couldn\u2019t hide this type of thing since the fifth prince might check.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI have seen him first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough, the orange bar dropped a bit.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi swore at X in his heart!</p><br/><p>The fifth prince wondered, \u201cWhy go to him first?\u201d</p><br/><p>The slag Xie Xi forced out, \u201cIn past years, people neglected their duty and didn\u2019t go to the sixth prince. This year, they specifically told me to go to the sixth prince first\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He had only spoken half his words when the orange progress bar rose again.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt a bit guilty. \u2018Don\u2019t be so gullible!\u2019</p><br/><p>The very good fifth prince was distressed. \u201cIt has been hard for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He wouldn\u2019t be able to hold it in if he didn\u2019t leave now!</p><br/><p>He left the fifth prince\u2019s palace and looked at the progress bar. His heart was like a mirror.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hadn\u2019t gone to the other princes yet but the facts in front of him were quite illustrative.</p><br/><p>If there was only the orange progress bar, he could suspect that the fifth prince and sixth prince were swapped.</p><br/><p>However, the sixth prince also had the blue progress bar.</p><br/><p>What did that mean?</p><br/><p>It meant that the mission task of collecting the love of the sixth prince was collecting the love of all six princes, not just the sixth prince!</p><br/><p>Six and sixth\u2026</p><br/><p>X, was your Chinese taught by your PE teacher!?</p><br/><p>The Central Garden.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s garden was covered with snow.</p><br/><p>He had been watching the live broadcast and naturally knew what Xie Xi had experienced.</p><br/><p>If Yan Zhe was present, he would pat his thighs and laugh at him. \u201cOld Jiang, you are green with jealousy of yourself. Are you kicking your own head with a donkey?\u201d</p><br/><p>He would also say, \u201cAren\u2019t you going crazy because of love?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t like this. Before he met Xie Xi, he didn\u2019t think about love. After meeting Xie Xi, he was really excited. He wanted to get along with this person.</p><br/><p>However, he couldn\u2019t be so stupid.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t just a pit for Xie Xi but also a pit for himself!</p><br/><p>There was no need to mention anything else. He just had to look at the goodwill falling like a waterfall to know how miserable he was.</p><br/><p>Why did the two worlds turn out like this?</p><br/><p>Things were a bit complicated.</p><br/><p>Lost Atlantis was a complete quasi-world. Not only was the seabed designed in great detail but the shore was also a complete structure. Jiang Xie had only designed the planet but if cleared, the missing parts would be spontaneously filled it by the laws of causality.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie poured a lot of effort into such a complete world. It was obvious just by the number of souls.</p><br/><p>Love to the Left or Right only had three souls while this world had six.</p><br/><p>The quasi-world was released after a review from the Zone. Due to his souls, the world wasn\u2019t activated until Xie Xi met the conditions and was selected.</p><br/><p>The core tasks of the quasi-worlds were mostly derived from the strongest will in the quasi-world.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t Xie Xi but someone else clearing the world, they might receive serious tasks like seizing the position of the prince, fighting for power, racial conflict, marine protection\u2026 These were very serious tasks. Still, it was Xie Xi who entered. The souls were basically branches of Jiang Xie. They inherited things from their master and were very concerned about Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>The previous three souls were still weak. In Love to the Left or Right, they preferred the death of the demonized Sein Hall and the task was to survive for seven days.</p><br/><p>Lost Atlantis had six souls, meaning six souls wanted to be close to Xie Xi. This will was too powerful and the task became\u2014collect the love of the six princes.</p><br/><p>They were eager to fall in love with Xie Xi, thus setting this core mission.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie looked at Xie Xi\u2019s appearance on the water curtain and felt pained and worried.</p><br/><p>What should he do?</p><br/><p>Should he wait for Xie Xi to clear the instance and hope Xie Xi would listen?</p><br/><p>Based on this bloody goodwill, he was afraid that the little guy wouldn\u2019t even bother giving him a fake smile.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

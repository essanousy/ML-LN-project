At this moment, he was impassioned and he shook the mood of the people on the seabed.</p><br/><p>There was originally an irreconcilable contradiction between the sea and land. Now the prince\u2019s death caused it to ignite and explode in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe land people are too deceitful!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare they kill our prince! It is outrageous!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe pro-land dogs are too optimistic. The land people are pooping on our heads!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDown with the land people! Down with the land people! Down with the land people!\u201d</p><br/><p>This slogan was chanted, the loud noise causing waves to surge. Xie Xi was in the centre and became unstable from this vortex.</p><br/><p>The fifth prince grabbed him by the waist and pulled him to the side.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up while in this bad posture and saw hatred in the fifth prince\u2019s carefree eyes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart thumped.</p><br/><p>He checked the information and was very clear that the fifth prince was part of the land-faction. He dissociated himself from the struggle for the three and borrowed his mother\u2019s attitude, supporting the peace-minded monarch.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to start a war with the land people and hoped that the two sides would live in peace, not interfering with each other. Now\u2026 the death of the sixth prince broke this possibility.</p><br/><p>If even the fifth prince of the pro-land faction felt hatred towards the land people, imagine the others.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince wasn\u2019t valued but he was still a prince of the empire, a symbol of the empire.</p><br/><p>The land people killed him, which was tantamount to declaring war on the sea floor!</p><br/><p>Putting aside his task, Xie Xi didn\u2019t like war at all, not to mention that he couldn\u2019t let the sixth prince die.</p><br/><p>There is a new tip in the lower right corner: [Please note that the current save point will disappear after 10 minutes.]</p><br/><p>This meant there was no chance if he didn\u2019t load the file now. Did he still need to think about it? Xie Xi chose to read the file.</p><br/><p>After a slight dizziness, Xie Xi returned to two days ago and stood in front of the sixth prince.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince was asking him, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t recall the situation for a moment and replied in the same way, \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he remembered the save point and felt a bit flustered. Xie Xi sighed and tried to ask, \u201cWhen will Your Highness leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>He shouldn\u2019t have asked. It was only after he finished speaking that he remembered.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, the sixth prince said, \u201cTomorrow morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis subordinate knows this is offensive but\u2026 \u201cXie Xi looked up seriously. \u201cYour Highness, can you not go to the land?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince was shocked.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi decided to play a straight ball. \u201cThe land is dangerous. Why should your noble body take the risk?\u201d</p><br/><p>These words flowed into Sirius\u2019 heart like a warm current. His eyes lightened and he said softly, \u201cThe land isn\u2019t as dangerous as you think. I\u2019ve been up there many times and it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>How was it fine? He lost his life!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked anxiously, \u201cMust you go?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince\u2019s heart was warm. He normally didn\u2019t speak many words but now he was talkative. \u201cRest assured, I will come back in two or three days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t care about the progress bar rising and asked again, \u201cCan this subordinate go with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince\u2019s body stiffened. He obviously didn\u2019t expect Xie Xi to say such a thing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t let him die again. He stared at the prince and wondered, \u201cIs it okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince looked at him with puzzled eyes. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>The excuse that Xie Xi came up with was very lame. \u201cThis subordinate hasn\u2019t been up to land and wants to see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just said that the land is dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xie Xi blocked him. \u201cDidn\u2019t Your Highness say that the land isn\u2019t as dangerous as I think?\u201d</p><br/><p>The prince was so worried that he had forgotten.</p><br/><p>However, the more he thought about it, the faster his heartbeat became.</p><br/><p>For so many years, almost no one had taken the initiative to speak to him, let alone wish him well. The person in front of him gave him food and sent him his father\u2019s gift. Now\u2026</p><br/><p>The sixth prince\u2019s eyes were extremely gentle. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I really will be fine. I will come back in two or three days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xie Xi was obstinate. \u201cIf there really is nothing wrong, why can\u2019t you take a subordinate? Your Highness, do you have anyone to serve you while travelling?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The sixth prince was used to being alone and there was no one to serve him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said this but he hadn\u2019t thought the sixth prince actually went alone and died in a foreign land. This was too miserable.</p><br/><p>He slowed down his voice. \u201cYour Highness, take this subordinate to see the world. I have never left the sea.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince couldn\u2019t refuse this softness. \u201cOkay, I will take you to see it. The land is also very interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was a land person and how could he be curious about the land? However, he was happy to be able to block the sixth prince\u2019s death and smile. \u201cYes! Your Highness, I will see you tomorrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince was swayed by his smile and called out his name. \u201cSein.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was used to this name and replied, \u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. You still have errands to run so go ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he smiled. The different coloured pupils gave off an unknown feeling but once he smiled, the colour lightened. It was as if the clear sky was merging with the gentlest sunrise, creating a gentle and beautiful light.</p><br/><p>Xie Xie Xi felt awkward and left with a bow.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun screamed, \u201cReally handsome! He is worthy of being my future father!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi raised the bun and rubbed his little head. \u201cWho is your father, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun spoke unclear words, \u201cMommy is baba, ouch ouch\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi rubbed harder.</p><br/><p>Thanks to his last experience, Xie Xi didn\u2019t waste time going to the eldest prince and fourth prince. He used the Camouflage technique to fill in the identity of his other two faces, giving himself a fake identity.</p><br/><p>It was lucky he had the reserve faces or these things would\u2019ve worried him to death.</p><br/><p>Even so, it was troublesome. Xie Xi could only hope that this time, the sixth prince was successfully saved and he wouldn\u2019t have to load the file again!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi held Roast Pork Bun and went to sleep. The next day, he was full of energy and psychologically prepared.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince was really \u2018poor.\u2019 The fifth prince could freely go to see a concert while the sixth prince had to go on a business trip, only bringing Xie Xi. In addition, Xie Xi was the one who volunteered to go.</p><br/><p>Halfway through the bow, the sixth prince smiled and helped him up. \u201cThe land is different from the sea. There is no need to be so courteous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis subordinate is stupid. There are some things I don\u2019t understand so I am asking Your Highness to forgive me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince corrected him. \u201cDon\u2019t call me Your Highness or call yourself my subordinate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pretended to be surprised. \u201cHow can this be done?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince explained, \u201cThe land is different from the sea. They have abolished the monarchy and their social structure is more equal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi certainly knew this but still had to pretend to be surprised. \u201cThe land people are really wild. They don\u2019t understand courtesy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince was patient. \u201cIsn\u2019t equality good? No matter the status, everyone has a chance to get ahead.\u2019\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s brain circuits were attuned to the undersea people. \u201cStill, how can civilians compare to the royal family?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t they compare?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly the royal family has strong mana and can transform their perfect legs.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince\u2019s pupils shrank. \u201cIf you eat enough, who can grow these two pieces of meat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was surprised.</p><br/><p>Roast Pork Bun was different and cried out with wonder, \u201cA handsome guy speaking such words!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d The good atmosphere was destroyed by this roast pork.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince glanced at Xie Xi. \u201cIf you go ashore, you have to walk on legs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had walked on legs for 19 years and was probably more proficient than the sixth prince. It was a pity he still had to act. \u201cIs it hard?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will be hard at first but don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will trouble Your Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCall me Sirius.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi called his name and the sixth prince smiled. \u201cIt is the first time I\u2019ve felt that my name is so nice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The damn Roast Pork Bun shouted, \u201cAhhh, the handsome man can talk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really wanted to throw this roast pork away!</p><br/><p>The sixth prince spoke again, \u201cWe will arrive on land in one hour. I will first help you transform your legs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mana wasn\u2019t sufficient enough to have legs but the sixth prince could help him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince asked Xie Xi to sit on the chair with his tail to one side.</p><br/><p>Then the sixth prince knelt before him and placed a hand on the fish tail. It was really quite wonderful. The sixth prince always had a sullen face in the past and didn\u2019t look at strangers. After people became familiar with him, they would find that his character was simple. It was just that he didn\u2019t know how to get along with people.</p><br/><p>It made Xie Xi think of himself. Before coming to this inexplicable world, he was also like this. He was abandoned by his father, abandoned by his mother and isolated by the whole world. He could only live alone in his own world, dazed and helpless\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt might be a bit uncomfortable. Please bear with it.\u201d The sixth prince softly told him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s spirit returned and he nodded. \u201cIt is fine\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish, he experienced an unbearable itching. It would\u2019ve felt better to experience pain than this terrible itching. It was as if his whole tail was lightly electrocuted.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince look up and asked in a slightly hoarse voice, \u201cIs it painful?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi bit his lower lip and shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have controlled the strength so it shouldn\u2019t hurt. Still, I will do it a bit slower.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi would rather he hurry up and finish it. This was too uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>The always unpleasant Roast Pork Bun covered his eyes with a paw, squinting through a slight gap. \u201cGood, good se*ual air!\u201d</p><br/><p>If Xie Xi could move then he would grab this roast pork and throw him away!</p><br/><p>There was some silence in the cabin. Once the sixth prince\u2019s hands were removed, Xie Xi was finally freed from this damn numbness. He took a breath and calmed his emotions.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince\u2019s Adam\u2019s Apple moved as he whispered, \u201cTake a break. I will call you when we are almost at the shore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t sure when the accident would happen and didn\u2019t want to be separated from him. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Your Majesty, stay here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t notice any problems with his words but the progress bar rushed to 13%, surpassing the fifth prince!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned and couldn\u2019t figure out exactly what was going on.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince coughed, the tips of his ears slightly red as he asked, \u201cDo you want to get up and try walking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, who was afraid the prince would die after leaving his sight, replied with a simple, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had been walking for 19 years. How could he forget it right away? Unexpectedly, he found that his legs were powerless and useless once he stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026\u201d Xie Xi almost fell.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince quickly held him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi grabbed his arm as support and barely managed to stand.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince was afraid Xie Xi would be disappointed and explained, \u201cYou are used to a fish tail. Now that it has become two legs, you need to slowly adapt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was a genuine two-legged being! Unexpectedly, he couldn\u2019t walk after a few days of having a fish tail!</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, sit down? I\u2019ll try while supporting myself against the wall.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. You can hold onto me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was still worried about the prince dying and wasn\u2019t polite. He held onto the prince\u2019s arms and tried to adapt to his legs.</p><br/><p>After Xie Xi gritted his teeth for more than 10 minutes, the sixth prince smiled. \u201cVery good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d How was this good? He was bow-legged.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince continued, \u201cWhen I just gained legs, I treated it as swimming with two tails.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were very young at the time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy big brothers could walk on their feet when they were three years old.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart stirred as he thought about the sentence the sixth prince just said. If everyone could eat well, would they grow legs? Were the legs innate from birth?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cYou are no worse than anyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he said this, the blue progress bar shot up again to 15%!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was a bit excited. If the sixth prince\u2019s progress exceeded 17%, did this mean he didn\u2019t have to pick up so many fish?</p><br/><p>By the time they finally landed, Xie Xi had adapted to his legs and could walk steadily with the sixth prince\u2019s help.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince said, \u201cDrink this.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a water retention agent developed by the underwater world. After taking it, the mermaids wouldn\u2019t become dehydrated on land. However, there was a time limit on it. It only lasted for up to three days.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi drank it.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince saw the white neck. His eyes widened and he looked away.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi put down the empty bottle. \u201cIt tastes good. It is sweet.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sixth prince smiled. \u201cGet ready. We\u2019re going ashore now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>What was the problem? He was a native land person! It was a pity that this thought disappeared as soon as he left the water.</p><br/><p>It was dry, hot and uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned. It was like he was walking into a sauna. He couldn\u2019t open his eyes from the hot air blowing into his face.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince\u2019s voice was heard in his ears. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. Try to breathe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi held his arm, closed his eyes and breathed for a bit until he finally got used to it.</p><br/><p>Who would\u2019ve thought of this? A land person wouldn\u2019t be able to adapt to the air on land one day.</p><br/><p>A faint coolness came from the palm of the sixth prince. Xie Xi found that he was covered with a thin layer of water and the hot feeling faded. He was suddenly more comfortable.</p><br/><p>The sixth prince told him, \u201cAdapt slowly. There are no land people here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s body was covered with a faint layer of water. If ordinary people saw this then they would probably yell.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw the thin beads of sweat on the sixth prince and knew that maintaining the water was draining his power. Xie Xi shook his head and said, \u201cNo, I have to adapt sooner or later\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished when he felt the air splitting apart.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was surprised but his dull body couldn\u2019t avoid the incoming bullet.</p><br/><p>It was aimed for the middle of his forehead and he would undoubtedly die.</p><br/><p>Then the sixth prince took Xie Xi into his arms, blocking the bullet with his back.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes widened.</p><br/><p>Sirius\u2019 brow was furrowed and his different coloured eyes extremely gentle. \u201c\u2026Go back to the boat.\u201d Blood spilled from the corners of his mouth.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t delay and immediately loaded the file!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The Central Garden.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie looked at the degree of goodwill.</p><br/><p>The many days of \u2018red rain\u2019 finally stopped but he felt a bit complicated about the floating green +1.</p><br/><p>The goodwill had gone up. It was green.</p><br/><p>It was really doing something for the occasion.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They knelt neatly and even their breathing was so quiet that it was inaudible. Black and white, hard metal armour and soft white robe, the guards and the man in front formed a sharp contrast, like a moon in the dark winter night.</p><br/><p>However, this moonlight wasn\u2019t gentle. It was a coldness that condensed everything.</p><br/><p>It was enough for Xie Xi to take a look.</p><br/><p>This was Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>He had fallen when entering the quasi-world and truly touched Virgo. He promised two Jiang Xies at the same time so two worlds were brought together!</p><br/><p>Leo Jiang was the little lion of the Lion Country while Virgo Jiang was the national teacher of the Tiger Country. He was Beast King Rose of the Tiger Country.</p><br/><p>Just based on these identities, Xie Xi could see how much of a play that Jiang Xie had arranged.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s brain started hurting.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t make a sound and the hotel remained in a frozen state, no one daring to make a sound.</p><br/><p>There were many ordinary people kneeling in the corner.</p><br/><p>The little employee who served Xie Xi was stunned. \u2018Your Majesty? This weak man who would be blown away by the wind, the one who must be supported while walking, the man who only drank half a bowl of porridge is their beast king? National Teacher, you have the wrong person!\u2019</p><br/><p>The diners who had been eating breakfast were stunned Who would think it? They were leisurely chatting and eating in a small black when guards of the palace arrived, headed by the greatest power of the Tiger Country!</p><br/><p>What\u2019s more, the national teacher came here to meet the king? Who was the king? Don\u2019t bully them! They had never seen a national hero before!</p><br/><p>Of course, the most shocked one was Leo.</p><br/><p>The little lion had suffered from internal torture and couldn\u2019t sleep. He saw the scene in front of him and thought he was dreaming.</p><br/><p>What was going on? Who were these people? Who were they calling a king?</p><br/><p>At this time, Xie Xi raised a hand by his side. \u201cGet up.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s pupils shrank and he turned to look at Xie Xi.\u201dYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi took his hand, half as support and half as comfort.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s senses returned and he woodenly followed Xie Xi down the stairs.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi reached the last step and the white-robed man stood up. As he rose, the armoured soldiers behind him stood up as if they had been given instructions.</p><br/><p>The soldiers looked like elites and they stood straight like tall pines.</p><br/><p>Under such awe-inspiring pressure, the white-robed man was still outstanding and his momentum wasn\u2019t suppressed at all.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was nearly a head shorter than him. At this time, he stood on the last step and just managed to look into this person\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>However, the white-robed man bowed his head respectfully and didn\u2019t look at Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at Virgo and felt complicated for a while.</p><br/><p>Among the many souls, the poor sixth prince of Atlantis and Houqing of Wonderful Painting of the Mountains and Seas were definitely the most pitiful and distressing.</p><br/><p>Virgo in front of him looked exactly the same as Houqing.</p><br/><p>It was true that this soul had long been taken back but Jiang Xie had just many faces. There were more souls and there was inevitably repetition.</p><br/><p>In Central, Jiang Xie had asked Jiang Xie about the basis for the souls\u2019 appearance.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had replied, \u201cOf course, they are all handsome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExplain it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie said, \u201cI have a variety of appearances when doing my tasks. These are all the appearances I have used before.\u201d</p><br/><p>The same was true for Xie Xi. The tasks required a role in the quasi-world and it was normal to have different faces.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie placed a layer of gold over himself. \u201cAren\u2019t they all handsome?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi unceremoniously poked at him. \u201cYou only picked a few handsome people from thousands of bodies, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The unlucky Jiang who had walked through thousands of worlds was stabbed in a painful part and started to madly plant strawberries.</p><br/><p>Virgo in front of Xie Xi wasn\u2019t Houqing but he was clearly Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t good for Xie Xi to keep staring. He could only retract his gaze and speak lightly. \u201cThe national teacher has worked hard.\u201d After all, Xie Xi had been a president and could still put on airs.</p><br/><p>The national teacher\u2019s voice was calm. \u201cIt is this subordinate\u2019s duty to welcome Your Majesty back to the palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t say anything more and just walked past this person.</p><br/><p>From beginning to end, he held Leo\u2019s hand. The little lion\u2019s mind was blank. It was only when he saw the magnificent Rose Palace that his senses slowly returned.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was Beast King Rose, the great leader who unified the eight countries and created a prosperous age.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s mind wandered. The words and sentences were clear but put together, he couldn\u2019t equate the legendary man with this person who was so weak that the wind could blow him away.</p><br/><p>How could Xie Xi be Beast King Rose?</p><br/><p>How could this man who saved his life and raised him into adulthood be such a distant figure in the sky?</p><br/><p>Then he saw Xie Xi walking ahead of the group. This person might be weak but there was a superior air about him.</p><br/><p>It turned out that there was a natural distance between them.</p><br/><p>He had talked a lot about taking care of this person but in fact, Xie Xi never needed him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at the roses that were like a carpet in the palace and it was as if he entered the dream again.</p><br/><p>It was strange that he clearly didn\u2019t know Xie Xi was the beast king yet he still dreamt of this rose garden.</p><br/><p>He heard that the palace of Beast King Rose had the most beautiful garden. The white roses were like winter snow and had the magic to wash everything.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had never seen it but he seemed to have dreamt it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s return to the palace was ostentatious. The entire palace was respectful and there was even a quiet murderous air.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was steady on the surface but he was actually inwardly panicking.</p><br/><p>It was rumoured that the beast king was betrayed by the national teacher before he disappeared.</p><br/><p>It was rumoured that the real power of the Tiger Country was the national teacher.</p><br/><p>It was rumoured that the national teacher tried to kill the beast king in order to seize power.</p><br/><p>It was rumoured that the country\u2019s ruler was extremely strict and the decrees were harsh\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt regret. If he had known earlier that there was another Jiang Xie, he would\u2019ve probed the situation.</p><br/><p>Now he was welcomed back to the palace but he didn\u2019t know the script!</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Xie Xi firmly believed that Jiang Xie wouldn\u2019t harm himself (it was hard to say there was no pit or to know how deep the pit was). It definitely wouldn\u2019t be dangerous to return to the palace and it was an opportunity to cure his body.</p><br/><p>In line with the principle of constant change, Xie Xi decided to pretend to the end. In any case, he was the king and there was no problem with being cold!</p><br/><p>The national teacher never looked at Leo and acted like this little lion was a worthless existence.</p><br/><p>He whispered, \u201cYour Majesty, do you want to bathe and change clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded before turning to the little lion. \u201cYou didn\u2019t sleep well last night. Go and rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little lion stared at him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi calmed him with a smile. \u201cWait and I\u2019ll find you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSir\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi patted him on the back of the hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hide this from you. I just didn\u2019t have a chance to talk about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The lion looked down and Xie Xi spoke again. \u201cDo you think I look like the beast king at all? If I told you, would you believe it?\u201d In any case, Xie Xi was a senior \u2018scum\u2019 and knew how to coax people.</p><br/><p>Leo replied, \u201cIf you said it then I would\u2019ve believed you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s lips curved. \u201cYou weren\u2019t so obedient when you were in the village.\u201d</p><br/><p>The lion immediately thought about the matter of marrying and a sharp sting occurred in his chest. He couldn\u2019t speak and his heart was empty. There was the distant feeling of the earth shaking, the pressure causing him to be breathless.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told the lion warmly, \u201cGo to rest and I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>The lion nodded and left with the servant.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi got rid of Leo in order to explore the situation on the national teacher\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Why on earth did he leave the palace? The national teacher didn\u2019t show signs of wanting to rebel. So what happened between them?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had a great imagination but he couldn\u2019t guess the script of Old Jiang.</p><br/><p>What should he say to the national teacher? Xie Xi didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>At this time, a servant came and saluted first to Xie Xi. \u201cYour Majesty.\u201d Then he spoke to the national teacher. \u201cIt has been arranged.\u201d</p><br/><p>The national teacher nodded and the servant retreated.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t look at this servant saluted to Xie Xi first. It seemed very respectful but he was actually watching Jiang Xie the whole time.</p><br/><p>This was also normal. After all, he had been missing for so long. It was true that the eight countries were in chaos but it wasn\u2019t difficult for the national teacher to suppress the Tiger Country.</p><br/><p>The national teacher told Xie Xi, \u201cYour Majesty, please.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi entered the hall.</p><br/><p>The palace of Tiger Country was very characteristic of Jiang Xie and had roses everywhere.</p><br/><p>The sunlight passed through the dome and the glass pattern of the glass window reflected on the smooth floor, making people feel like they were among flowers.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi walked into the spacious bathroom and was bathed in a pool of blue light shining from the lake.</p><br/><p>This should be a hot spring pool. A hot fog surrounded the entire space. On the exquisite rockery above, water poured down like a miniature waterfall. There were also three pools of water.</p><br/><p>The colour of the water was very beautiful. It was crystal clear so that the bottom was seen and there was even a light fragrance.</p><br/><p>There were no bystanders in the bathroom and the national teacher told him, \u201cI will help you undress.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought in his heart, \u2018Aren\u2019t you the national teacher? Is the national teacher still responsible for this type of work?\u2019</p><br/><p>Never mind the fact that this national teacher was the \u2018master\u2019 of the Tiger Country.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gently nodded.</p><br/><p>The master of the country first took off his cloak. The long hair that was like snow spread out. This wasn\u2019t the silver of Yan Zhe\u2019s hair. It was a pure white and looked like cold snow even in this hot bathroom.</p><br/><p>It was very beautiful but inexplicably brought some sorrow.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi noticed that there was a ruby encrusted jade in this person\u2019s hair. The bright red formed a sharp contrast with the white hair, as if blood had fallen onto snow.</p><br/><p>Was this\u2026 a rose?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi remembered the villagers saying that Beast King Rose was born with a stud earring on his left ear.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t wearing any earrings now but the ruby jade was as small as an earring.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi kept an eye on the details and tried to guess the situation.</p><br/><p>The national teacher helped Xie Xi with his clothing and Xie Xi didn\u2019t act uncomfortable. They were like an old husband and wife.</p><br/><p>As the clothes were pulled down, the national teacher saw the wound on Xie Xi\u2019s chest and his eyelids trembled. However, he said nothing.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t say anything and Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t take the initiative to open his mouth. In the end, he didn\u2019t even know the national teacher\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi got in the water and he sighed as he soaked in the pool. It was really comfortable.</p><br/><p>His body was tired from the long walk and it was wonderful that it could rest like this.</p><br/><p>He had just sighed with relief when he saw the national teacher kneeling by the pool.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t on one knee but on both knees, like an unforgivable man waiting for the death penalty.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard the national teacher\u2019s quivering voice in the empty bathroom. \u201cYour Majesty, please come back. I\u2026 this subordinate will never ask for that again.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

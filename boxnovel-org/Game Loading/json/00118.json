This guy was really diligent when preparing drinks and didn\u2019t let Jiang Xie do it at all.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tasted his favourite hot cocoa and his heart warmed, but his face was very stable. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked him, \u201cIs it good to drink?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, it was good to drink. Xie Xi was used to the taste. The temperature, concentration and sweetness were just right. There wasn\u2019t a single point that was off and only Jiang Xie who slept with him for 60 years knew how to make it. Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare praise him in case this person\u2019s nose went higher and asked, \u201cWhat is the sun and the moon?</p><br/><p>In addition, were those zombies human?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t have to ask. He just needed to look at the corners of Xie Xi\u2019s eyes and the raised lips to know the drink was delicious.</p><br/><p>The dream created countless details that belonged to each other. Jiang Xie sincerely felt\u2026 it was a huge profit!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie also poured himself a cup of hot cocoa. He put it down after a sip because he really couldn\u2019t drink it. \u201cThe open world also has a world story. Do you want to experience it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked curiously, \u201cExperience it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we can act out a role and walk their script.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was such a thing? Xie Xi wondered, \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cExperience is growth. This type of script is very safe and we can get a small amount of experience by walking through the steps.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cIs it beginner, intermediate or even senior experience?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is experience for becoming a designer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cAfter all, all players are working to become designers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, aren\u2019t there very few designers? What happens if they can become a designer?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t answer and instead repeated a rule that Xie Xi had long known. \u201cBeginner players can only stay in Central for two days, intermediate players for two weeks, senior players for two months and only god level is unlimited.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood that beginner, intermediate and senior players weren\u2019t good because they couldn\u2019t stay in the Central World. They had to constantly accept the quasi-world tasks while the quasi-worlds were dangerous. Entering meant continuing to face death.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke once again, \u201cThe only known god-level occupation is the designer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Therefore, players wanted to become designers. It was only be becoming designers that they could freely stay in Central and obtain a certain degree of freedom, allowing them to embrace eternal life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned. \u201cOnly know god-level occupation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t we talk about it before? This Central World might be designed by others. Then who designed this world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood. \u201cDesigners can\u2019t design a world of designers.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was very circular. Someone \u2018designed\u2019 the designers. This person wasn\u2019t necessarily a designer. In other words, there was an existence on a higher level than the designer.</p><br/><p>However, the Central World was only one layer of the doll and they couldn\u2019t see the larger doll.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled down at him. \u201cThese matters aren\u2019t pressing since you haven\u2019t reached intermediate level yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked down at his experience. \u201cIt is at 75 piints. As long as I pass a S+ quasi-world, I should be able to upgrade.\u201d</p><br/><p>The open world gave 15 points of experience. It wasn\u2019t bad. It was less than Love to the Left or Right but more than the Fairytale Town.</p><br/><p>Lost Atlantis gave him 30 points of experience. According to this ratio, he would be able to upgrade as long as the next world was S+.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wanted him to quickly rise to the intermediate level. He wouldn\u2019t be able to see the goodwill value after Xie Xi reached intermediate level. Wouldn\u2019t it be beautiful if it was permanently locked at 999?</p><br/><p>Thus, he asked eagerly, \u201cHave you searched for the next world?\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glared at him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes curved. \u201cIs it mine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was impossible to avoid it. The words \u2018Wonderful Painting of the Mountains and Seas\u2019 were printed there!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie coaxed him. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I will accompany you to the next world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him. \u201cWill you lose your brain again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cLast time was an accident.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart wasn\u2019t stable. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t mess around.\u201d It was too dangerous. Previously, Xie Xi wanted Jiang Xie to suffer from his broken world. Now\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart was as sweet as honey. \u201cWe agreed to go together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI can handle it myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cNo, I feel uncomfortable at the thought of a group of bastards taking advantage of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Aren\u2019t you the bastard?\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was silent before dealing the fatal blow. \u201cIf you go, will they ignore me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The souls were destined to be attracted by Xie Xi, just as he had long been fascinated by this person. The difference with him going was that he would wear a green hat live.</p><br/><p>Old Jiang felt malice from the world but he was stubborn. \u201cI will still go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about it. \u201cBy the way, the Beginner Repair skill was brought out by me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was shocked. Xie Xi explained his skill. The perpetual unlucky Old Jiang was shocked by the Emperor of Luck Xiao Xie.</p><br/><p>How exaggerated was this good luck? It was almost unheard of.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to bring it back either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was silent for a long time before opening his mouth. \u201cYou were born a lucky A and I\u2019m a lucky E. We are truly a natural pair.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t care about him and spoke seriously, \u201cIf I promote this skill, is it possible to repair what you lose?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart warmed.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi explained, \u201cOf course, it can\u2019t be repaired in the quasi-world but\u2026 I mean, in case\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t want to say it but he had to think the worst. \u201cIn case you can\u2019t regain what you exchanged, is it possible for me to fix it for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Beginner Repair was so powerful. What about after it was upgraded?</p><br/><p>If he could repair Jiang Xie\u2019s lost things, he didn\u2019t have to be afraid of Xie Xi accompanying him through the worlds.</p><br/><p>This problem couldn\u2019t be answered by Jiang Xie but he felt Xie Xi\u2019s worry and nervousness for him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was reluctant to let him do. \u201cIt might be possible but the promotion task will randomly appear in the quasi-world. Thus, you will still have to go to the next world.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next world belonged to Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi suggested, \u201cCan I go alone to the next quasi-world? If I upgrade Repair first\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie said seriously, \u201cNo, I will lose half my life after being separated from you for a long time. In addition, you can\u2019t repair fatal injuries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d This was just nonsense!</p><br/><p>As he scolded\u2026 well\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was keen to go and they were already in a team. Xie Xi also didn\u2019t want to shake him off.</p><br/><p>He asked Xie Xi again, \u201cDo you want to experience the story of the sun and the moon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi hesitated, \u201cCan we become the sun and the moon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is possible to experience it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi said, \u201cBut I\u2026\u201d He just wanted to see how the little sun and moon were. He remembered the pitiful little sun.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t finish but Jiang Xie understood. Xiao Xie had a hard mouth and a soft heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. If we can\u2019t experience it then we can just watch.\u201d It was just a loss of some experience.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cWill it bother them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Jiang Xie answered. \u201cThe open world is also a real world. We freed them when we left.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked again, \u201cThen what will we see?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is just a flash of the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie held Xie Xi\u2019s hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Let\u2019s go and see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt at ease and decided it was good to look. Jiang Xie opened the world plot and Xie Xi saw the word \u2018exclusive\u2019 below.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked, \u201cDid you buy it out?\u201d Could the plot of the open world be brought out? How much did it cost?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie cleared his throat. \u201cThat boy was also our son so we should give them some privacy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s mouth curved and he didn\u2019t tear off this person\u2019s excuse.</p><br/><p>In the last part, Jiang Xie was too much of a foul and simply bullied the big boss, the moon.</p><br/><p>There were many witnesses at the scene but they were all low-level players. They would at most feel surprised and not think too much.</p><br/><p>However, any high-level player who bought the world plot would figure out something wrong at first glance.</p><br/><p>Then the news that Designer X was in a low-grade open world would burst\u2026</p><br/><p>Old Jiang would have no face!</p><br/><p>Old Jiang had no face in front of his wife but God X needed to maintain his position in front of many people.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had been in a trance after leaving the open world and hadn\u2019t paid much attention to the little sun who grew up.</p><br/><p>Now he saw this red-haired youth and didn\u2019t really recognize him.</p><br/><p>The contrast was too much. This hearty and handsome person with a smile that warmed the world by several degrees was the small crybaby?</p><br/><p>As his \u2018mother\u2019, Xie Xi didn\u2019t recognize him.</p><br/><p>The thing that made Xie Xi stunned was the little silver-haired guy lying on the sun\u2019s shoulder. His silver hair was very long and covered his entire body. His small face was delicate and soft. He raised silver-grey eyes and cried out fiercely, \u201cI told you not to help them. It would be easier killing them!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

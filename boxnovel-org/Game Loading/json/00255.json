Yan Zhe hadn\u2019t expected to see such a scene.</p><br/><p>Little Chirp had no clothes after changing into a person. The white feathered cloak shielded him well from the back but the front was bare.</p><br/><p>Little Chirp didn\u2019t understand but they couldn\u2019t let others see him like that.Therefore, Yan Zhe 100% approved when Jiang Xie took him back into the room.</p><br/><p>However, after returning to the room, the two people\u2026</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t dressing!</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe was frozen for three seconds. He didn\u2019t know if he should turn away and leave or yell at Jiang Xie to hurry up.</p><br/><p>Wait a minute\u2026 it was more like Little Chirp was holding down Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe, \u201c\u2026\u201d What the hell was this situation!</p><br/><p>The two men close to each other were also shy.</p><br/><p>Needless to say, the clothes were put on at a rapid speed, causing one to wonder if this was the person who couldn\u2019t even walk before?</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe experienced a fierce psychological struggle before finally asking, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi only just remembered Yan Zhe. He was about to get up when Jiang Xie suddenly held his waist.</p><br/><p>The hot hands touched slippery skin and both of them trembled.</p><br/><p>There were white feathers blocking it so Yan Zhe couldn\u2019t see the situation. He was about to come over but Jiang Xie patted Xie Xi\u2019s head and stated in a low and hoarse voice, \u201cLittle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi changed back into the little bird that was the size of two fingers.</p><br/><p>The white feathered beauty disappeared and the atmosphere calmed down.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s throat surged as he held Little Chirp, \u201cHe hasn\u2019t adapted to the human body. He wanted to walk and we ended up wrestling.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was what happened but Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you, how could I no manage to walk?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie only heard chirping and he patted Xie Xi\u2019s little head, coaxing, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll teach you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Fine, he was right.</p><br/><p>Just now, Jiang Xie refused to let Xie Xi get up because he would be exposed in front of Yan Zhe.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t know the reason but he didn\u2019t want anyone to see such a Xie Xi, even if it was Yan Zhe.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe still felt doubts but he asked, \u201cDo you need any help?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll teach him myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe hesitated.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie changed the topic. \u201cCan I trouble you to help him find clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe didn\u2019t react at first.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cHe can\u2019t wear our clothes. He needs tailored ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>His mouth was a bit dry as he spoke.</p><br/><p>There was no doubt that the body of the white feathered beauty was completely human but it also retained the characteristics of a bird.</p><br/><p>For example, the beautiful feathers mixed with black hair and the white feathers that spread from the shoulders down to the ground.</p><br/><p>The white feathered cloak wasn\u2019t the type that could be taken off. It grew from the shoulders, forming a fluffy ring around the round shoulders, revealing a slender neck and sexy collarbone. It was similar to a skirt around the shoulders but this was a cloak and exposed the entire body.</p><br/><p>Presumably, this was the incarnation of the previous feathers. It was impossible to take off and ordinary clothes couldn\u2019t be worn. They had to consider the location of the cloak.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe had seen the previous human form and could understand. \u201cI will go and look for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought, \u2018I can draw my own!\u2019</p><br/><p>It was just that Jiang Xie and Yan Zhe didn\u2019t understand him.</p><br/><p>Once Yan Zhe left, Jiang Xie didn\u2019t immediately turn Xie Xi into a human.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi spoke from his hand, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie looked down and couldn\u2019t imagine how such a cute little guy could become the heart-stopping feathered beauty.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke to himself, \u201cI always feel like\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished his words before he shook his head and told Xie Xi, \u201cShall I teach you how to be a man?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was curious about the unfinished words but he was soon distracted by the second sentence.</p><br/><p>Teach Xie Xi how to be a man?</p><br/><p>He understood that it literally meant this but he still wanted to spit!</p><br/><p>After all, the \u2018praise\u2019 that Jiang Xie received most in Central was: old evil!</p><br/><p>Now Jiang Xie wanted to teach Xie Xi to be a man!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was more than an individual\u2026</p><br/><p>He gave out a helpless cry.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie thought Little Chirp was worried and spoke to him in a warm voice. \u201cIt isn\u2019t difficult. I will first teach you to walk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi once again cried out.</p><br/><p>How could he be happy?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie took a deep breath, psychologically prepared himself enough and patted the small head. \u201cBig.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t feel any different from when he transformed into the big Chirp. It was just that he became a person.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at the white neck, fine white feathers and\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had to ask, \u201cBrother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The red brother found his voice. \u201cLet\u2019s find some clothes to wear first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it necessary to dress first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s ears heard, \u201cIs it necessary to chirp first?\u201d</p><br/><p>What was instantly being emptied of blood? People would understand just looking at Jiang Xie!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t know about the chirping or his ashamed and angry self would want to commit domestic violence.</p><br/><p>Big Chirp gave two chirps in seven chirps. Once he became a person, Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t face the chirping!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cClothes are very important, just like a bird\u2019s feathers. You can\u2019t be without them and they have to block you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie corrected, \u201cI mean, you must wear them well. Right, wear them well!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no need to explain. The explanation was the biggest cover-up!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi helped him calm down. \u201cAre there any clothes that suit me?\u201d The white feathered cloak could be manipulated and felt a bit like wings. Thus, he gently shook it to remind Jiang Xie not to forget the white feathers.</p><br/><p>However, this in turn caused Jiang Xie to look at\u2026</p><br/><p>The snow-like white feathers and the white body, it was unknown which one was whiter or more dazzling.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d The two people had done everything and he could tell what this person was thinking by looking into his eyes!</p><br/><p>He honestly asked again.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s senses returned. He tried to stabilize himself and said, \u201cWear mine first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare shake his cloak and directly asked, \u201cWhere are the clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cI will make the collar bigger for you to fit it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cloak grew from the shoulders and the clothing could only be worn over the cloak.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had no opinion while inwardly he was thinking, \u2018How much resentment does Jiang Xie have for my clothes?\u2019</p><br/><p>There was Gemini where he couldn\u2019t wear clothes and in Cancer\u2019s world, he became a birdman who couldn\u2019t wear clothes\u2026</p><br/><p>Was it related to Xie Xi putting on clothes every time he was tired and didn\u2019t want to let Jiang Xie mess around?</p><br/><p>Come on, if he wasn\u2019t dressed then this guy couldn\u2019t stay in control!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was thinking this when Jiang Xie found his own clothing.</p><br/><p>The pants were good. They might be big but they covered his white legs.</p><br/><p>The clothes took a lot of effort. Jiang Xie was afraid of damaging Xie Xi\u2019s white feathers. After all, it was a part of his body and painful to lose the small feathers.</p><br/><p>In fact, these white feathers might be soft but it wasn\u2019t easy to pull them off the neckline.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was sweating hard but he somehow managed to dress Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi actually felt a bit of dislike. It was so troublesome to wear clothes that it was better not to wear them.</p><br/><p>Oh\u2026 was this what a certain someone intended?</p><br/><p>After wearing clothes, Jiang Xie could teach Xie Xi to walk like a person.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could walk but he hadn\u2019t adapted to it. He needed to be familiar with stepping instead of jumping.</p><br/><p>Seven or eight days passed and Xie Xi was already used to being a person.</p><br/><p>Walking and eating had no problems but wearing clothes was very problematic.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had tailored clothes but unfortunately, there was the white feathered cloak. It was very troublesome to dress by himself.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie took the initiative to volunteer for this difficult task, helping him dress and undress.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe had reservations about the fact that it took them half an hour to dress every time!</p><br/><p>Did it need to be so slow? Was Jiang Xie doing something bad to Little Chirp?</p><br/><p>So many days had passed and Yan Zhe had long seen Jiang Xie\u2019s mind. He obviously liked Little Chirp.</p><br/><p>It was understandable since the original Jiang Xie and Little Chirp were dependent on each other and regarded each other as the most important existence.</p><br/><p>Previously, Little Chirp didn\u2019t have a human form and Jiang Xie didn\u2019t have such thoughts. Now that Little Chirp was like this, how could Jiang Xie not like him?</p><br/><p>Little Chirp was originally placed at the apex of the heart and it was normal to want him now.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>In the end, Yan Zhe was older and could see more thoroughly.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie liked Little Chirp but what about Little Chirp? Could a bird understand the feelings of a human?</p><br/><p>In these days, Xie Xi accompanied Cancer.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the example with Yan Zhe, Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t willing to let outsiders see Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>The human Little Chirp was too good-looking. He might not have Yan Zhe\u2019s physique but Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t reassured.</p><br/><p>After all, Little Chirp had the ability to create anything.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also agreed with the need to be careful.</p><br/><p>Besides, it was just not letting anyone else see him. This didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t see others.</p><br/><p>As long as Jiang Xie made him small and he sat on Jiang Xie\u2019s head, he could see whatever he wanted to see.</p><br/><p>The black fog receded and the entire world was busy rebuilding their home. Jiang Xie was no exception.</p><br/><p>Since he was the only one to come out of the dark fog, everyone was very respectful to him and didn\u2019t dare look down on his young age.</p><br/><p>This meant people no longer tried to go after Yan Zhe\u2019s physique or tried to hurt him.</p><br/><p>Of course, it might only be temporary. After a long time, the happiness of escaping death would fade and new contradictions and disputes would be born accordingly.</p><br/><p>The world was different and the people who survived were no longer ordinary people. Those with strong abilities were bound to breed greater ambitions.</p><br/><p>The world\u2019s patterns had been broken and a new beginning was sure to have a new class of rule.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t too worried about these things. This was just a small world that had collapsed. After the repair, it would be redesigned and the final independence was nothing.</p><br/><p>The thing that made Xie Xi confused was that since the black fog scattered, why hadn\u2019t he left this small world?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t the repair completed yet?</p><br/><p>However, what was the danger of the current situation?</p><br/><p>Everything was moving in a good direction. Did he have to wait for a new city to be established before it was completed?</p><br/><p>Or\u2026 did Cancer still long for a home at the bottom of his heart?</p><br/><p>Did he need a home to end the world?</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t quite right.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t they have a small home right now?</p><br/><p>The meaning of home wasn\u2019t just one\u2019s flesh and blood. The three people were dependent on each other. Wasn\u2019t this a home?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t think of a reason.</p><br/><p>What was still wrong with this world? What else did he need to do to pull Cancer away?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi just had an idea when a strong resistance formed in the bottom of his heart.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

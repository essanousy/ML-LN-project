It was natural not to recognize since his appearance was too different and they only met once at school.</p><br/><p>Even so, Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare go that way or deliver anything to the table.</p><br/><p>Xiao Li told him excitedly, \u201cThat person is really handsome! A heavenly dish!\u201d Xiao Li was gay.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi reluctantly smiled at him.</p><br/><p>Xiao Li continued, \u201cI don\u2019t know who he is but did you see the watch on his wrist? It costs enough to buy us food and drinks for half our lives!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi remembered his classmates\u2019 gossip during the day and knew that the young professor\u2019s family was very good.</p><br/><p>Xiao Li gave high praise. \u201cHe is rich and has good looks. The best in the world!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t say anything. He hadn\u2019t told the people in the bar that he was still studying, let alone that this was his teacher.</p><br/><p>Xiao Li knew that Xie Xi wasn\u2019t interested in men and after sensing his disinterest, left to talk to others.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi went to the bathroom to try and calm himself down.</p><br/><p>He stared at himself in the mirror and comforted himself, \u2018I wasn\u2019t recognized, I definitely wasn\u2019t recognized!\u2019</p><br/><p>He washed his face, the cold water dripping down his cheeks onto his neck. It was very cold. Xie Xi quickly dried his face but he still felt cold. The bar maintained a constant temperature and he shouldn\u2019t be cold wearing this. Sure enough\u2026</p><br/><p>Did he catch a cold from running while sweating? Xie Xi felt some panic. He didn\u2019t want to catch a cold because the cost of illness was too high. A box of cold medicine was more than 20 yuan and he couldn\u2019t afford it.</p><br/><p>In fact, a cold would go away on its own after seven or eight days but it was still too much trouble. Dizziness and headaches would affect his classes and also work. If his boss found out, he would definitely be forced to take some days off.</p><br/><p>One missed day of work meant less money and Xie Xi didn\u2019t want that. He couldn\u2019t catch a cold, he couldn\u2019t. Xie Xi poured himself a large glass of hot water and gulped it.</p><br/><p>Once his body was slightly warmer, Xie Xi suppressed some of his worries. He would go home and boil ginger soup. Maybe it would be fine!</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, tonight was particularly busy. Xie Xi ran back and forth to serve drinks. After running a few laps inside and outside, he started sweating again.</p><br/><p>He was already dizzy during his break. The human body wasn\u2019t made out of iron. He hadn\u2019t eaten well every day, was malnourished and worked very late. He had insufficient sleep and fatigue so it was natural to fall sick.</p><br/><p>Xiao Li noticed his condition. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Your face is a bit red.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I just need to the bathroom.\u201d It was almost 11 o\u2019clock and almost time to get off work. He intended to persist until then.</p><br/><p>Xiao Li urged him, \u201cIf you aren\u2019t feeling well, leave first. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss would call names after work and deduct money for those who left early. Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>His body was hot and cold and he was so miserable that he wanted to go home and hide in bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Xie.\u201d Suddenly, a rough voice speaking in a flattering tone was heard behind him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tensed as he turned his head. \u201cMr. Wang, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Behind him was the middle-aged man who had been staring at him for the past month.</p><br/><p>Wang Qingshu stared at him greedily, his eyes filled with shameful desires. He handed a glass to Xie Xi and said, \u201cAccompany me for a drink. You can see that I have been coming here for one month.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi retreated. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mr. Wang, I can\u2019t drink.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Qingshu urged him, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with some wine? Drink it and you\u2019ll see.\u201d He held out the glass with a tough gesture.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t good. \u201cMr. Wang, please don\u2019t embarrass me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou call this embarrassing you? Is it so hard to have a glass of wine? I\u2019m been coming here for almost a month!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi retreated to the wall, the cold wall making his head numb. \u201cI\u2019m just working here, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want money?\u201d Wang Qingshu\u2019s tall body covered Xie Xi. \u201cFollow me, how much do you want me to give you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s head buzzed and he raised his hand to punch the other person. Wang Qingshu\u2019s face was cold as he was hit in the face. \u201cYou aren\u2019t giving me face!\u201d</p><br/><p>Under normal circumstances, Xie Xi could run away but now his physical condition was extremely poor and his legs were like lead. He couldn\u2019t lift it at all. The previous punch had used all his strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou might not drink but you will have to drink today. Once you drink this, you will see\u2026\u201d Wang Qingshu wanted to use strength to pour it into his mouth.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew there must be something added to the wine. He shook his head and cried out\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the glass fell to the carpet and red liquid splattered all over the place. Wang Qingshu was stunned and shouted angrily, \u201cWhat fucker is meddling?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then a foot came over and kicked him in the middle of the chest. This force was very big and Wang Qingshu fell down.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 cough\u2026\u201d Wang Qingshu touched his chest and kept coughing.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie walked out of the shadows with a cold face, hands in his pockets as he declared in a condescending manner. \u201cGet lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Qingshu\u2019s face changed as he struggled to get up. \u201cWait, you wait for me!\u201d He spoke these words but staggered away.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi leaned against the wall in shock. Jiang Xie stared at him with a light frown.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi bowed and muttered, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare look at Jiang Xie for fear of being recognized. It was very embarrassing to work here and now something like this happened\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt indescribable humiliation. He wasn\u2019t afraid of poverty, suffering every day or of being hungry. He just didn\u2019t want to be treated by the public as a beggar.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t say anything but Xie Xi felt his gaze like sharp thorns. He couldn\u2019t stay a moment longer and suppressed his body\u2019s trembling as he turned to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cXie Xi.\u201d Jiang Xie accurately called out his name.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stopped, the blood draining from his face. This person recognized him and even remembered his name.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie approached him and asked, \u201cWhy work here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stiffened as he felt dumbfounded by this question. Why? How could a person with Jiang Xie\u2019s family background understand his life?</p><br/><p>Would he work here if there were any other options? If it wasn\u2019t for a lack of money, how could he do this?</p><br/><p>There was no way Jiang Xie could understand. The wine he drank tonight was a few months of salary for Xie Xi. How could Jiang Xie understand?!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t look back as he replied stubbornly. \u201cI\u2019m an adult and it has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cThe thing that just happened, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Humiliation rushed to Xie Xi\u2019s brain and he couldn\u2019t help raising his volume. \u201cI could\u2019ve solved it even if Teacher wasn\u2019t there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he left. He didn\u2019t dare go anywhere with few people. He could only stay in front and work hard.</p><br/><p>By the way, Xie Xi regretted what he said and wanted to slap himself. It was Jiang Xie who helped him just now. If the teacher hadn\u2019t been present, it was unimaginable what would\u2019ve happened to Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>He should\u2019ve thanked Jiang Xi and explained things clearly, instead of saying something so unreasonable.</p><br/><p>Still, he couldn\u2019t help it because he couldn\u2019t suppress his mood. Jiang Xie must be very disappointed to get such a response after his help. Xie Xi\u2019s heart trembled and he only felt more powerless.</p><br/><p>In any case, he and Jiang Xie were two different types of people and there would be no further intersection. There was nothing to regret.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stayed until midnight and his head buzzed once he got off work.</p><br/><p>Xiao Li asked him, \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at him and only reacted after a long time. \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t do. I\u2019ll call a car.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi quickly shouted, \u201cNo! No need!\u201d His place wasn\u2019t far but it cost 10 yuan for a taxi. He wouldn\u2019t take a taxi unless he was dead.</p><br/><p>Someone was waiting outside for Xiao Li and he couldn\u2019t afford to care too much about Xie Xi. \u201cThen I\u2019ll go first. If you really aren\u2019t feeling well, you should take a day off tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cYes, rest assured.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Xiao Li left, Xie Xi changed his clothes, drank a large glass of hot water and prepared to go back.</p><br/><p>He went outside and the cold wind of early winter hit the back of his neck. Xie Xi hugged himself tightly, shivering from the cold.</p><br/><p>The weather in November was extremely cold. He only wore a thin coat and felt like he would really die of the cold. This should be a fever.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was freezing and couldn\u2019t help stopping after a few steps. He huddled by the road and suddenly remembered the little girl who sold matches.</p><br/><p>People wouldn\u2019t realize helplessness and despair without facing a real predicament. Unfortunately, Xie Xi didn\u2019t have matches and didn\u2019t even deserve dreams.</p><br/><p>A black car slowly stopped in front of him. The window fell and Jiang Xie glanced at him. \u201cGet on the car.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stood motionless where he was.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie frowned, removed the seat belt and got off the car. He approached and saw the blankness in Xie Xi\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>The youth had overly beautiful facial features and there was a layer of redness on his white face. He was like petals blooming in the early morning, fragile and delicate.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s heart tightened and he asked, \u201cDid you drink that wine?\u2019</p><br/><p>No, he should\u2019ve arrived in time. Even if Xie Xi drank a bit, the drug shouldn\u2019t be that strong.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared blankly and couldn\u2019t respond at all. Jiang Xie reached out and touched his forehead. \u2018How are you so hot?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finally saw the other person and his feeble pride soared again as he removed Jiang Xie\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you to the hospital.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Xie Xi immediately exclaimed, \u201cNo, I won\u2019t go to the hospital. Don\u2019t take me to the hospital!\u201d</p><br/><p>How could he only go to the hospital when he only had a few yuan?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke softly, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, you don\u2019t necessarily have to get an injection. Just a checkup\u2026\u201d He thought that Xie Xi was afraid of needles.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head violently and resisted. \u201cDon\u2019t take me to the hospital. I won\u2019t go to the hospital\u2026\u201d He begged. \u201cPlease, please Teacher Jiang, I don\u2019t want to go to the hospital.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was hoarse and he sounded petulant\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was startled and his voice became slightly dry. \u201cOkay, I won\u2019t take you to the hospital. Get in the car and I\u2019ll send you home. Take some antipyretics and have a good rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cOkay\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie opened the door and helped him into the car. Xie Xi was cold and couldn\u2019t help sinking into the hot wind coming from the car. The heater in the car was very comfortable, confusing Xie Xi. For a time, he couldn\u2019t tell where he was.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sighed and drove the car to find a pharmacy. He would first buy some medicine and then have Xie Xi take it when he got home.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie bought the medicine and returned to the car, only to find Xie Xi had fallen asleep. He was huddled into a ball, his white wrists exposed to the outside. He was too thin to hold.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie remembered when he had seen Xie Xi eating in the cafeteria. It would be strange if he could gain fat after eating those types of meals.</p><br/><p>Of course, Jiang Xie hadn\u2019t really thought that Xie Xi was trying to lose weight. He said those words so he didn\u2019t burst Xie Xi\u2019s self-respect.</p><br/><p>At the bar tonight, Jiang Xie recognized him at first glance. Jiang Xie guessed that Xie Xi\u2019s family situation wasn\u2019t good but hadn\u2019t expected him to be working here.</p><br/><p>It might be a clean bar but it was still a place where fish and dragons mixed together. It didn\u2019t feel safe for a youth who just turned 18 years old to be working there.</p><br/><p>In particular, since the growing child\u2026 looked a little too good.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie called out to him. \u201cXie Xi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi frowned and shrank even smaller. Jiang Xie\u2019s heart was tugged and his voice softened. \u201cWhere do you live? I will send you home?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi instinctively shook his head. His place was very cold and he didn\u2019t want to leave this warm place.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie bent his head and whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll take you back with me first. You can\u2019t be alone like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know Xie Xi\u2019s specific situation but a student working so desperately meant there must be something with his family. It was likely that he couldn\u2019t count on his parents.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was dazed and in his trance, he seemed to return to the time when he was very young\u2026</p><br/><p>At the time, he was ill and his mother stayed by his bedside. She fed him, wiped his sweat and kept telling him in an incredibly gentle voice, \u2018Don\u2019t be afraid. Mother is here. Everything is fine.\u2019</p><br/><p>Was this a memory that belonged to him? Did his mother really love him?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi always felt this was his own delusion. He was too eager to be loved and created this illusion.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t real\u2026</p><br/><p>His father left him and his mother didn\u2019t want him. He was alone, always alone, and didn\u2019t know how to live.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d A low gentle voice entered his ears, filled with deep heartache. Xie Xi suddenly opened his eyes and the scene that entered his eyes was completely strange.</p><br/><p>The chandelier on the ceiling was like a beautiful crescent moon and there were even stars flashing around\u2026</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t his home. He didn\u2019t have such beautiful lighting.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi got up, the sharp pain from his head made him groan.</p><br/><p>At this time, the door opened and Jiang Xie wore a dark grey t-shirt and cotton trousers. He held a plate of hot porridge. \u201cHave you woken up? Are you feeling better?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi fell dull. He looked down and found that his clothes had been changed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cYou started sweating after taking an antipyretic last night. I helped you change your clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie continued speaking, \u201cDo you want to take a bath first or eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi opened his mouth. \u201cI\u2026\u201d His voice was hoarse.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie placed the plate on the bedside table and his lips curved. \u201cYou said you were an adult but you kept crying last night. That\u2019s why your voice is hoarse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d His face flushed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie said, \u201cI said I would take you to the hospital but you cried that you wouldn\u2019t go. I fed you medicine and you started crying. I helped you change clothes and you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt his body was burning up. This was impossible!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie chuckled. \u201cOkay, don\u2019t pretend to be an adult. A little kid crying is very cute.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If he disappeared and Sein Hall came back., it was better for this body to be dead. Sein was already cynical. Combined with such a strong power, this world\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi soon felt he was thinking too much. This was a game, not a world. Once he left, the game was over. Would there be any follow-up?</p><br/><p>Of course, the task demanded that he kill himself.</p><br/><p>This time, he didn\u2019t make Aix-en sleep and the silver-haired vampire finally finished his words. \u201cSmall Sein, you\u2026 used the summoning magic?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh, it turned out this was the name of the forbidden technique.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en froze and his eyes moved to Greenton, who had lost his heart. \u201cThe person you love most is him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this situation?</p><br/><p>Aix-en stared at him again, his handsome face in a frown. \u201cIf I remember correctly, the sacrifice is someone you love deeply.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi understood and wanted to say, \u2018You are remembering incorrectly. The sacrifice is someone who loves me deeply.\u2019 Then he stopped. Why explain it? Wouldn\u2019t this misunderstanding irritate the vampire?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stared at his cousin with a sad expression.</p><br/><p>This look was equivalent to an agreement. Aix-en looked like he was struck with lightning and killing intent overflowed from his eyes. \u201cYou approached me just for this forbidden technique?\u201d</p><br/><p>His brain patched things together so well that Xie Xi was saved the trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d Gars looked up and stimulated his predecessor. \u201cHow could Young Master like a person like you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en turned sad and angry eyes towards Gars. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gars bit his lips. \u201cI am also a sacrifice. Young Master loves me.\u201d</p><br/><p>If the atmosphere wasn\u2019t so serious, Xie Xi would think that they were schoolboys competing for his favour.</p><br/><p>Aix-en was sharp as a knife. \u201cThus, you are a failure.\u201d</p><br/><p>The words caused Gars to blow up. \u201cIt failed because the other conditions weren\u2019t enough, not because Young Master doesn\u2019t love me!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the only person who knew the truth, Randy couldn\u2019t listen to this any longer and revealed the truth. \u201cThe condition of the sacrifice is for them to love Young Master, not for Young Master to love them.\u201d The young master only loved him. What were these people?</p><br/><p>Gars was stunned.</p><br/><p>Aix-en\u2019s gloominess was swept away by these words and he looked eagerly at Xie Xi. \u201cIs that right? Did I remember it wrong? I\u2026\u201d He stopped forward and took Xie Xi\u2019s hand, his voice trembling. \u201cMy Small Sein, you only love me right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The eyes of his old and new housekeeper pierced him.</p><br/><p>Even if he was bent on dying, he didn\u2019t want to die like a scum man! Oh, it wasn\u2019t his fault. He wasn\u2019t a scum man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is also good.\u201d Aix-en was pitiful. He was obviously still skeptical but he deceived himself. \u201cWe can be together forever\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could only grit his teeth and become a scum man. \u201cI don\u2019t love you. Initially, I was afraid you would kill me and then I used you.\u201d It was finally said.</p><br/><p>Aix-en\u2019s red eyes widened and his handsome face looked incredulous.</p><br/><p>The originally disturbed Gars was thrilled when he heard these words and stared at Xie Xi in a devout manner. \u201cYoung Master, you have been wronged. I will deal with this evil thing and stop him from pestering you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was afraid of losing a \u2018general\u2019 and opened his mouth. \u201cYou are no different from him.\u201d After he spoke, he wanted to stab himself. People shouldn\u2019t say these things!</p><br/><p>Gars\u2019 long eyelashes trembled and his voice was a bit dry. \u201cI, I have become a vampire but I am still your Gars\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had to annihilate his only hope. \u201cGars, I used you too because I needed a sacrifice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gars\u2019 face instantly lost all colour, becoming paler than a blank piece of paper. \u201cY-Young Master, don\u2019t joke\u2026\u201d His eyes were wide and the red colour seemed like it was bleeding.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t love them but he couldn\u2019t help feeling some heartache when he saw their broken expressions. This was human nature. He couldn\u2019t bear treating people so cruelly, even if they were a stranger.</p><br/><p>The housekeeper Randy was older and not as overwhelmed as Gars. He didn\u2019t say anything or ask anything. Now that he \u2018eliminated\u2019 two people, it was clear that Randy was the only winner.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t let him go. Aix-en and Gars were hovering on the edge of blackening. What if Randy protected him from them?</p><br/><p>His idea was to have the three people work together to kill him. Perhaps it would fail if there was one less person?</p><br/><p>Being half-dead was too much of a torment. Xie Xi wasn\u2019t interested in tasting it again.</p><br/><p>He hurriedly said, \u201cI\u2019m not kidding. I don\u2019t love you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gars screamed, \u201cDo you love Randy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had been waiting for this. He perfectly acted the role of a scum man. \u201cHe is nothing but a servant. What qualifications does he have to gain my love?\u201d</p><br/><p>The silent Randy suddenly looked up.</p><br/><p>Xie Xie Xi\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change and he even spoke with some arrogance, \u201cA monster who isn\u2019t a ghost and a servant of low status, how can I love you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Was it almost there? Xie Xi prayed, \u2018Please be sure to attack me at the same time, killing me together.\u2019</p><br/><p>The first one to blacken was Gars. His face was gloomy and his pale lips bloodless. His whole body was like a tightly wound string, filled with despair and pain. \u201cYou have been lying to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The real Sein Hall would probably trick him but Xie Xi was bent on dying and adding oil to the flames. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Aix-en also couldn\u2019t bear it. There was no affection in his eyes. It was replaced by bloodthirst and disdain. \u201cSmall Sein, I will forgive you if you go back with me to the earl\u2019s house.\u201d In other words, go back with him and become a prison of the house, never thinking about any forbidden techniques again.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi scoffed. \u201cDo I need your forgiveness?\u201d</p><br/><p>The housekeeper\u2019s low voice came from the bottom of a deep cliff. \u201cYou aren\u2019t Master Sein. Who are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was inspired. This was a really good idea (trick).</p><br/><p>His lips curved. Dressed in a tuxedo and under a black rose hat, the gorgeous boy smiled and his voice changed. \u201cYou discovered it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSummoning magic\u2026\u201d Xie Xi\u2019s eyes were dark as he stared at them. \u201cWho do you think your Master Sein summoned?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was very different from Sein Hall\u2019s temperament and it completely infuriated the three people. Their despair found a breakthrough point and they launched their deadliest attacks at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou demon, bring him back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi finally got what he wanted and died.</p><br/><p>The timing was just right. They fought and at the end of the seventh day, Sein Hall\u2019s life came to an end.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw in the lower right corner: [Congratulations, the mission is complete.]</p><br/><p>In an instant, his eyes darkened like he was being dragged away by something. He left Sein Hell\u2019s body and left the world.</p><br/><p>The Central Garden.</p><br/><p>A man\u2019s lips thinned as he leaned against a wide back chair, his slender legs crossed at the ankle and his sitting posture relaxed. The lines of his body were so good that even with this posture, he looked like a resting lion hiding his power with laziness.</p><br/><p>He stared at the water curtain in front of him.</p><br/><p>An image was fixed there.</p><br/><p>It was a teenager in fine clothing. His back was straight and he had a very thin waist. The black rose and gorgeous lace became the most wonderful embellishments to his dark eyes, delicate face and cold and arrogant demeanor.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned forward and smiled at this delicate face.</p><br/><p>The water curtain flashed and the image disappeared. Then a line of words floated up.</p><br/><p>[S-grade quasi-world \u2018Love to the Left or Right\u2019 has been cleared. The designer: X.

Nine Tails didn\u2019t turn into Jiang Xie, meaning they weren\u2019t alone.</p><br/><p>This was an empty place but maybe Nine Tails brought an attendant or perhaps it was the fireflies?</p><br/><p>This was too embarrassing so Xie Xi first placed Roast Pork Bun back in the pets bar.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails face was like frost. The originally gentle eyes were demon-like and Xie Xi felt scared as he saw Nine Tails in the moonlight.</p><br/><p>He clearly didn\u2019t do anything bad but it felt like he was caught in bed!</p><br/><p>This\u2026 blame Jiang Xie!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie watched some goodwill being lost but couldn\u2019t do anything.</p><br/><p>He had obviously followed this person into the world but why didn\u2019t it seem different from watching the live broadcast?</p><br/><p>Old Jiang felt very wronged.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was a man who had pedalled six boats and his legs were still stable. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked innocent and confused.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails squinted and his cold demeanor was somewhat shaken. \u201cYou have a red dot on the back of your neck.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was so pitiful that Xie Xi felt slightly ashamed hearing it.</p><br/><p>Dammit, this was done by him!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi touched the back of his neck and responded steadily. \u201cThere is? I have been walking outside for a long time and must\u2019ve been bitten by mosquitoes.\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t see how big the hickeys weer but could only blame them on bugs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails stared at the red mark the size of the pad of the little finger\u2026 could a bug make such a big mark?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked at him and smile. \u201cHow is it a hickey? What are you thinking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Who could handle this acting?</p><br/><p>Nine Tails was probably reluctant to believe it was a hickey so his filter went ten metres deep. He found himself a reason, \u201cYour flowers are really afraid of bugs. Just a simple bite turned out to leave such a big mark.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was\u2026 Xie Xi was very embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Nine Tails was in a corner and his heart wasn\u2019t very solid. \u201cIs it really not?\u201d He didn\u2019t want to say the word hickey again.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t let this continue and said, \u201cWhat are you suspecting?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails was silent.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glanced at him with flushed cheeks. \u201cThere is no\u2026 if you check it yourself, you will know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails\u2019 heart jerked.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t remove his gaze. \u201cIf it is really a hickey, will it only be on the neck?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine Tails\u2019 throat was tight. \u201c99\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s voice was becoming smaller. \u201cCome back to my room with you and you can check it yourself.\u201d This was too shameful! It was leading Nine Tails to be alone with him but this was breaking his lower limit!</p><br/><p>Nine Tails was gone. He hugged Xie Xi and returned to Xie Xi\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, he was a demon beast and his speed was okay.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was relieved and thought no one should be here. He didn\u2019t believe that Nine Tails would let other people see his body.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Nine Tails\u2019 eyes changed colour.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie took off his clothes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi snapped, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChecking it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glared at him. \u201cDo you still think you are Nine Tails?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cI forgot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh, the souls didn\u2019t meet and their memories weren\u2019t exchanged. This fool forgot everything that happened last night.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie felt unwilling. \u201cIt definitely isn\u2019t Houqing. Who the hell is it? Who on the Holy Mountain?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi captured the key point in his words. \u201cIs Houqing really a soul?\u201d \u201cHe is Sirius.\u201d</p><br/><p>It turned out to be the sixth prince. It seemed that Nine Tails and Houqing met in the Demon Sea, allowing Jiang Xie to have the memories of these two souls.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pressed his hand to stop him. \u201cTell me about their situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cI want to know about last night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was helpless. \u201cWhat do you think you did?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie felt sour about himself. \u201cIt must\u2019ve been your strawberry but also\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He shamelessly spoke in detail and Xie Xi blushed. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s vinegar barrel was overturned. \u201cNo! I forgot all about it and I want to know!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt angry and amused. \u201cYou will know when you go to see Azure Dragon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie found out that it was Azure Dragon. He could go to get the memory but\u2026 it would be cool if there were two memories.</p><br/><p>He said, \u201cThe Demon Sea and Holy Mountain mind their own business. It isn\u2019t easy for Nine Tails to see Azure Dragon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi could guess his mind. \u201cThat\u2019s your business!\u201d</p><br/><p>The scoundrel Jiang Xie said, \u201cYou are like this. You only like the me last night and don\u2019t like me now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Was this what people could say? However, this man was still right.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie succeeded with this cheap wave and started to kiss the other person.</p><br/><p>Their decades of sex life wasn\u2019t in vain and Xie Xi was able to push back.</p><br/><p>After another wave of helping each other, Xie Xi exclaimed, \u201cYou have to hurry and see all the souls!\u201d If every encounter was like this, he would be exhausted!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie would definitely see them but didn\u2019t want to admit it.</p><br/><p>Just like Jiang Xie understood the sensitiveness of Xie Xi\u2019s body, Xie Xi 100% knew him. \u201cIf you lie to me, there won\u2019t be a wedding when we go back to Central!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was too serious and Jiang Xie was forced to compromise. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll find a way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was now free to tell him the information that was collected during the day.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie helped him sum it up a bit. \u201cAzure Dragon is the fourth prince, Nine Tails is the second prince and Houqing is the sixth prince. My guess is that Vermillion Bird is the fifth prince and White Tiger is the third prince.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also guessed this. After all, they were related to the flower god and Xie Xi currently had the name of the flower god. These people were likely to be souls.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre there other sacred beasts and demon beasts?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cYes but they shouldn\u2019t be my soul.\u201d Otherwise, they would definitely force a relationship with Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed with relief. \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie always felt that these strange words caused him to feel a chill but who could blame the child? Who could say \u2018it\u2019s okay\u2019 after making the simple child pedal five boats?</p><br/><p>It was himself. Jiang Xie swallowed down the words.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked about the situation of Nine Tails.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie knew quite a bit and told him, \u201cYou were originally Houqing\u2019s sweetheart. After Nine Tails saw you next to Houqing, he was emotionally affected and couldn\u2019t help using an enchantment on you and you fell in love.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Second Prince, you are too indulgent and really love dog blood drama!</p><br/><p>No, it was Jiang Xie. Xie Xi turned and glared at him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie defended himself. \u201cI won\u2019t be like this in reality. After all, you only like me.\u201d Xie Xi raised his eyebrows. \u201cIf I don\u2019t like you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was silent. Sure enough\u2026 the second prince\u2019s dog blood was from the original person!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie held him and whispered, \u201c\u2026Don\u2019t dislike me.\u201d Xie Xi\u2019s anger disappeared. There was a tug on his heart and his voice softened, \u201cWhat are you thinking? If I don\u2019t like you, why would I care about these souls breaking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled softly. \u201cSay it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSay you like me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t bear his pitiful voice and whispered it. Jiang Xie was resurrected. \u201cLet me hear it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Listen to your big head!</p><br/><p>Nine Tails also stayed the night. Before it was too bright the next day, the contented small silver fox left.</p><br/><p>He also had something to do in the Demon Sea. He had to take care of his enemies before marrying the little rose.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi slept lazily and had just gotten up when he heard a noise again.</p><br/><p>Their little Rose Mountain hadn\u2019t been so lively since the construction of this mountain!</p><br/><p>\u201cMy god, this time it is the servant of Houqing demon ancestor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m so scared. I heard that any place that Ancestor Houqing goes to becomes barren!\u201d The timid rose shivered.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard Houqing and his head was sore. Had Sirius also come to give a betrothal gift?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi still felt guilty towards the sixth prince and was distressed for him.</p><br/><p>In particular, the thought that Jiang Xie might have such a cursed past made him even more pained.</p><br/><p>Only Houqing\u2019s servant appeared outside but it was already dark, cold and hazy.</p><br/><p>The servant ordered, \u201cHurry and return Nine Tails\u2019 betrothal gift!\u201d</p><br/><p>The roses, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this situation?</p><br/><p>The servant spoke again, \u201cThe white rose is bewitched by Nine Tails and I hope you don\u2019t aide him!\u201d</p><br/><p>The roses understood but also didn\u2019t understand. The two ancestors of the Demon Sea were fighting over an unknown, small white rose?</p><br/><p>They thought that Xie Xi being given the name of the flower god was already a miracle. Now one white rose gained the favour of two demon ancestors at the same time?</p><br/><p>The white roses glanced at each other. They were the same white roses but how was the gap so big?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

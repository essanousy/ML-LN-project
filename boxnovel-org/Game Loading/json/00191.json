If they used a knife to force an emotional to join the army, the emotional person couldn\u2019t kill!</p><br/><p>What was this thorny head? The army\u2019s management tasted bitterness.</p><br/><p>Who didn\u2019t know that emotional loved freedom and were afraid of restraints? The discipline in the army was strict and even harsh. How could an emotional stand it?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t in a hurry and watched Jiang Xie\u2019s act.</p><br/><p>The civil servant responsible for the registration said, \u201cThe environment in the military camp is very bad. Training is from 6 a.m to 6 p.m. It is hard and boring and there is a lot of repetitive training. It is very painful.\u201d</p><br/><p>J cried out, \u201cAre you telling me an emotional can\u2019t join the army?\u201d</p><br/><p>The civil servant muttered, \u201cYou can join the army as long as you are 13 years old and have reached the A-grade\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>J was SSS-grade. He might be emotional but he could still beat the entire United States. J replied, \u201cThen I meet the standards.\u201d</p><br/><p>The civil servant was really sincere for his own good. \u201cHowever, in the training camp, you can\u2019t leave for a year, your food, drinks and sleep are all according to standards. You can\u2019t have any ideas of your own and there are only rational people in the training camp. You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>J raised an eyebrow. \u201cAre you a sexist?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a felony and the frightened civil servant shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not! Don\u2019t talk nonsense!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi found it funny. This was Jiang Xie and the average person wasn\u2019t his opponent.</p><br/><p>Ignoring the fact that no emotional had ever joined the army, Jiang Xie gathered enough eyes and successfully signed up!</p><br/><p>In the whole process, Xie Xi had no words and watched this person self-direct the play.</p><br/><p>They entered the training camp and the allocation of dormitories was another problem.</p><br/><p>This might be a high-tech society but the environment in the army was very bad. This was mainly to train the soldiers\u2019 self-care ability.</p><br/><p>The main battlefield these days were outer planets. On some undeveloped planets, forget technology, there wasn\u2019t even a basic civilization. The environment was extremely harsh and if soldiers adapted to a high-tech life, they would depend on their limited equipment on barren planets and caused major accidents.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the conditions in the training camp were very ordinary and weren\u2019t much better than the Earth age.</p><br/><p>One dormitory was for eight people, each person to a capsule bed. It was being squeezed in a variety of senses. They were all rational and no one said anything when sneaking into another capsule bed.</p><br/><p>Now they were mixed with an emotional. What should they do? Assign an emotional together with rational people? It didn\u2019t matter to rational people but what about the emotional? What would they do if the emotional person because fascinated by a rational?</p><br/><p>In particular, such a young age was filled with rational people who indulged in their impulses. This was too tempting and dangerous for an emotional! Inducing en emotional to like a rational meant they would be accused by the whole United States for going against ethics and morality. It was insane!</p><br/><p>Therefore, three emotional people liking the rational Xie Xi was really \u2018moral decay\u2019 and \u2018insane\u2019 to the extreme!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi who had no expression, \u2018Don\u2019t push the blame on me.\u2019</p><br/><p>After worrying about it, the training camp had to empty a room to specifically accommodate this emotional.</p><br/><p>This way, Jiang Xie got his own luxury single room. Xie Xi didn\u2019t understand the meaning of this at first until he heard the emotional whispering about the rational and suddenly realized.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie acting in such a big manner was actually protecting Xie Xi. J became the most eye-catching person and the only topic of conversation, the most ostracized one.</p><br/><p>In this way, Xie Xi\u2019s little strangeness seemed normal. J subconsciously remembered Xie Xi\u2019s isolation so he dreamt about joining the army and protecting Xie Xi from the beginning.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t help smiling as warm syrup dripped in his heart.</p><br/><p>The even more interesting thing was that due to the emotional J, the troops ordered the rational people, \u201cDon\u2019t mess around, don\u2019t have an X life!\u201d This was already forbidden but after all, they were underage. It was like putting a ban on middle school students. It was really difficult to put an end to indulging in these impulses.</p><br/><p>The same was true for the army. There were requirements but considering the nature of emotional people, these requirements weren\u2019t too strict.</p><br/><p>It was different now. There was a real emotional person present and they had to purify the environment!</p><br/><p>As a result, Xie Xi\u2019s days became more comfortable. He wasn\u2019t treated as different, even if he didn\u2019t enter Big Jiang\u2019s Fourth Army.</p><br/><p>This was Jiang Xie\u2019s good intentions but Xie Xi thought of his nonsense and couldn\u2019t help laughing. He was enjoying it but this man really didn\u2019t know how to be low-key!</p><br/><p>The next days were ordinary and the dream moved quickly. He could see that someone was trying to hook him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had long adapted to this shift in the dreams.</p><br/><p>The fast forwarding stopped and Xie Xi was standing at the penalty station. He didn\u2019t know what mistakes he made and perhaps the dreamer didn\u2019t think of it. After all, J was an artist and didn\u2019t know the specific situation of the army. Xie Xi was punished and had to stand until 10 o\u2019clock in the evening.</p><br/><p>He stood for so long that his legs were sore and he was very hungry. He went to the cafeteria to check but there was naturally no food to eat. Xie Xi didn\u2019t panic at all. He didn\u2019t believe that a certain someone wouldn\u2019t come out.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Jiang Xie made an appearance. \u201cYou are eating so late?\u201d</p><br/><p>The \u2018weak Xie Xi explained, \u201cI was punished to stand for five hours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was surprised. \u201cWhat did you do wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glared at this person in his heart. Who knew what mistake Jiang Xie had him do!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie muttered, \u201cSurely you didn\u2019t mess with people\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cI\u2019m just joking. I heard that you are very rational.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young boy Jiang Xie smiled like this and Xie Xi didn\u2019t dare look. He replied, \u201cNot all rational are like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was slightly surprised and asked curiously, \u201cNot all rational are the same?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi resented his words. \u201cYou are being sexist.\u201d</p><br/><p>The stunned Jiang Xie laughed. \u201cYou are very different.\u201d</p><br/><p>This good old-fashioned love story, the old man who talked about N times of love thought too much.</p><br/><p>After this was a logical development as Jiang Xie split his hidden dinner with Xie Xi. Xie Xi was really hungry and gobbled up the food.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cSlow down and be careful not to choke.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the dream master, he had the magical skill to make his words come true. So\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi choked on something and coughed in a terrible manner.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie hurriedly patted him on the back. \u201cWhat is your hurry? No one will rob you and if you are hungry then I will give you food.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought, \u2018Speak less and go back. I am so hungry I can eat all your food tomorrow!</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Jiang Xie was afraid that Xie Xi would be uncomfortable. Thus, Xie Xi might be coughing fiercely but his discomfort was just a bit of hunger. Jiang Xie hastily pushed his share of the food to Xie Xi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi shook his head. \u201cHow can I do this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI ate a lot at noon. You can eat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are hungry then you won\u2019t sleep well at night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie said with a smile, \u201cYes, you won\u2019t grow taller if you don\u2019t sleep well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi who was shorter than him, \u201c\u2026\u201d Who felt bad about this person? He would eat!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi accidentally ate a lot more. Oh, this much be Jiang Xie\u2019s intention. If he ate too much then they could take a walk together.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie laughed at him. \u201cLook at you. You are until you are bursting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d Shut up!</p><br/><p>\u201cJust on the basis of eating, you really are a different type of rational.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, a rational was restrained and calculated. They would never eat to the point of bursting.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t a rational but he didn\u2019t eat to the point of bursting. It was just that Jiang Xie wanted this so he would\u2026</p><br/><p>Well, it was Jiang Xie\u2019s dream and he should be happy. Let him do what he wanted!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stated, \u201cI am a rational.\u201d</p><br/><p>The implication was that even if he was different, he was still rational. This person should wake up.</p><br/><p>It was too bad he was talking to the dreamer. Jiang Xie just smiled at him. \u201cIn any case, you are very interesting. Let\u2019s go, I will accompany you to walk off the food.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I will go to the training ground myself and walk around one lap.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wondered, \u201cIsn\u2019t it boring by yourself?\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was just being polite. In fact, he would definitely be going with this person.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie blinked and then spoke, \u201cIn addition, it is dark and what will you do if there is a ghost?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi really wanted to say, \u2018Young man, I am the biggest ghost in your dream!\u2019</p><br/><p>Later, they naturally walked together. Xie Xi looked disgusted but his heart was happy.</p><br/><p>Under the starlight and in the thin breeze, the two people walked together in a leisurely and relaxed manner. Unfortunately, they couldn\u2019t hold hands. Well, it was their first day meeting and Xie Xi was still a rational. He had to be reserved!</p><br/><p>The two of them walked around and round until Jiang Xie unwillingly asked, \u201cHow about it? Is the food digested?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought, \u2018What digestion? If this wasn\u2019t your dream then my legs would be broken!\u2019</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cI\u2019m going back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoodbye.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled at him before laying. \u201cGoodbye.\u201d</p><br/><p>The 13 year old J stayed in place, stupidly standing until the morning.</p><br/><p>Then the emotional J started acting like a fancy and high-maintenance demon again. He went to the logistics department and asked, \u201cWhy does everyone have roommates and I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>The logistics minister\u2019s face was dark. \u2018Little brother, you really don\u2019t know why? We are protecting you!\u2019</p><br/><p>J questioned, \u201cDo you think that emotional people only have love on ht e brain? Is my head only full of love?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, who accidentally heard this, thought to himself, \u2018It isn\u2019t?\u2019 The logistics minister was afraid to say this.</p><br/><p>J sacrificed his amulet. \u201cYou are sexist!\u201d</p><br/><p>The logistics minister quickly wondered, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d He was afraid of this person.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want a roommate.\u201d</p><br/><p>The logistics minister smiled. \u201cYou are the only emotional person here.\u201d How could they find him a roommate of the same gender?</p><br/><p>J wondered, \u201cDoes the law stipulate that an emotional can\u2019t be roommates with a rational?\u201d</p><br/><p>How could the law stipulate such a thing? Finally, under J\u2019s \u2018rights protection campaign\u2019, the logistics department agreed to pick a rational as a roommate.</p><br/><p>The method was a no-brainer. J was hard for a rational and the rational people would also be noisy. The fair method was to pick a name. Xie Xi was naturally drawn.</p><br/><p>J looked surprised. \u201cWhat a good coincidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also looked surprised while scolding him, \u2018What damn coincidence? If this isn\u2019t your dream, could you pick me when you are so unlucky?\u2019</p><br/><p>In any case, J dreamt very well. \u201cPlease advise me in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi smiled. \u201cPlease advise me.\u201d</p><br/><p>They lived together and Xie Xi\u2019s reputation in the training camp improved. The rationals felt that his sacrifice was huge and were sympathetic to him. Thus, they became kinder to him.</p><br/><p>What Xie Xi felt wasn\u2019t the goodwill of the rationals but the car derived from Jiang Xie\u2019s inner heart. He wanted Xie Xi to be happy and hoped to make him happy in every way, at any time and under any circumstances.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had to remind himself, \u2018I\u2019m here to coax this person, not be coaxed by him.\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment the training period was over, they had to join the army and enter the real battlefield.</p><br/><p>In reality, Xie Xi chose the Fourth Army. Here\u2026 Jiang Xie suggested, \u201cLet\u2019s leave the army.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wasn\u2019t surprised but had to ask, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cIt is fine in the training camp but if I really go to the army, I am afraid of causing trouble.\u201d Jiang Xie\u2019s ability was sufficient but the gender issue would lead to communication obstacles. The army required unity, not individual power. Jiang Xie had the self-knowledge that this wasn\u2019t possible.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi pretended to hesitate.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cWe can do a lot when we leave the army.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up at him. \u201cWhy is it \u2018we\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s lips curved. \u201cWhy can\u2019t it be us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am rational.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie corrected him. \u201cYou are Xie Xi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Who cared about a rational who wasn\u2019t rational or an emotional who wasn\u2019t emotional? The only thing he saw was the person in front of him. No matter what, he didn\u2019t want to let this person go.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi whispered, \u201cBut\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie pulled Xie Xi into his arms and spoke softly, \u201cYou might find this incredible but we were loved in our first round. You were rational and I was emotional but we were together for more than 200 years. In the end, I entered reincarnation and you didn\u2019t want me to leave you or forget you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought of this memory and the tip of his nose became sour.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie made a warm promise. \u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t leave you or forget you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had endured it for a while and finally couldn\u2019t help it. Who could bear this?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw Xie Xi\u2019s lips tremble and his heart was moved. \u201cDo you like me?\u201d</p><br/><p>They had spent a year together in the training camp. Xie Xi gazed at him and whispered, \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie hugged him hard, restrained but also uncontrollable. They retired and returned to the Capital Star. Once they were adults, Xie Xi saw a message.</p><br/><p>\u2014The commander of the Fourth Army has died for his country.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>How much was this hatred? J, you directly dreamt Big Jiang to death?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He only had the god\u2019s wisdom and sketch pen.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was in the bag and he had these two things appear out of thin air. He imagined a different space shield in his mind and drew a circle.</p><br/><p>The different space shield was invisible to people in the quasi-world and only Xie Xi saw the transparent arc.</p><br/><p>It was fast and wrapped around Jiang Xie the moment the car approached.</p><br/><p>In fact, in this dangerous moment, Jiang Xie still tried to minimize the damage. He knew he couldn\u2019t hide and lowered himself, trying to go underneath the car to avoid a direct collision.</p><br/><p>This reaction ability was terrible. It was necessary to know that Xie Xi could call out the god\u2019s wisdom and draw the different space shield in such a short time because his qualifications were full. In an ordinary world, he was equivalent to Superman.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was just an ordinary teenager yet he had such reaction speed. It was enough to see that he was strong before entering Central.</p><br/><p>The car was an off-road SUV and the chassis was very high. Under the protection of the different space shield, Jiang Xie was unharmed.</p><br/><p>The car stopped and everyone was in shock.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong\u2019s face was white as he yelled. \u201cJiang Xie!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi also jumped out of the schoolbag to check this person\u2019s situation. He knew Jiang Xie wouldn\u2019t be hurt but he was still scared.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sat up with a furrowed brow.</p><br/><p>The SUV owner hurriedly got off the car and he was covered in sweat. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine!\u201d He had been on the phone and quarrelled with the other person on the line. In a fit of rage, he hit the steering wheel but unexpectedly didn\u2019t see the person in front of him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie whispered, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Then he stood up.</p><br/><p>The driver saw he was fine and sighed with relief. \u201cWould you like to go to the hospital?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong was about to open his mouth when Jiang Xie waved his hand. \u201cI have no injuries.\u201d</p><br/><p>The driver was full of happiness. He had been scared but fortunately, a miracle happened and the person was fine. Still, his conscience couldn\u2019t let it go. The driver opened his wallet and pulled out thousands of yuan. \u201cYou are fortunate but this was indeed my fault. Please take this money as compensation for your mental loss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong was worried. \u201cYou should go to the hospital for a check up.\u201d It was too terrible. A car had crashed straight into Jiang Xie. How could there be nothing?</p><br/><p>The driver also said, \u201cYes, go to the hospital to check!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stubbornly shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d He was indeed fine and he didn\u2019t want to see more people.</p><br/><p>Finally, the driver handed over the money and left.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong exclaimed with shock, \u201cThis time it was thanks to you. If you hadn\u2019t pushed me away, I would be finished.\u201d He didn\u2019t have the ability to go below the car. If he was hit, he would definitely fly out and be half dead.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t say anything. He just picked up his bag and walked away quietly. Xie Xi saw Jiang Xie\u2019s trembling hand and could guess what this kid was thinking.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong chased after them. \u201cThis driver was really distracted. It was too dangerous!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie accelerated his pace and opened the distance. Kang Hong ran over. \u201cWhat are you doing by walking so fast?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie suddenly stopped, his eyelids lowered. \u201cYou still don\u2019t understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong froze.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cYou were almost hit by the car because you were close to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw Jiang Xie\u2019s tightening on his bag. The youth had good-looking fingers and at this moment, the joints were white because of the force. They were like stretched out rubber bands.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong frowned. \u201cHow can you say that? It is because you were there that I didn\u2019t die today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you weren\u2019t near me then you wouldn\u2019t be hit by the car.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong was a good boy of this scientific society. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t there then the driver wouldn\u2019t be talking on the phone? This is illogical.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie didn\u2019t say anything else. He just restored his indifferent appearance and headed straight back to the community.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong just met up with his mother who returned home after work and didn\u2019t chase them. He instead turned to talk to his mother.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie returned him and shut the door. Then all his iciness disappeared like it evaporated in the heat.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi poked out his head, climbed up his arm and licked his chin. Jiang Xie\u2019s senses returned and his lost eyes focused on the black and white kitten.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi told him, \u201cIt isn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie stared at him before suddenly asked, \u201cWas it you who saved me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was shocked. Then Jiang Xie shook his head and laughed at himself for being stupid. How was it possible? This was just a kitten.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s senses returned and he asked, \u201cDid you see it? Did you see the different space shield? Or did you see me drawing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, all his words were still meows. Jiang Xie just said, \u201cI will prepare food for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d He really didn\u2019t want to eat. It was too bad that Jiang Xie didn\u2019t understand the cat language.</p><br/><p>Once the cat food was set in place, Xie Xi found Jiang Xie sitting next to him in a daze. The incident today had a great impact on the teenager.</p><br/><p>Nothing happened to Kang Hong but he encountered a car accident after just one day of contact with Jiang Xie. Who knew what would happen afterwards?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t eat and could only arch up against this person.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie glanced at the food bowl and asked, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you eating?\u201d He picked up the kitten and the kitten licked his palm, as if to comfort him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was warmed by this feeling and his mood became much better. He patted the kitten\u2019s head and said, \u201cThank you.\u201d The kitten couldn\u2019t do anything but it could bring him unlimited warmth and comfort.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi gave up on the exchange and went back to dinner.</p><br/><p>After a while, Jiang Xie\u2019s doorbell rang. The sound was so strange that Jiang Xie didn\u2019t react for a moment. It was only when Xie Xi jumped up and ran to the door that Jiang Xie knew someone was ringing the doorbell.</p><br/><p>He went to open the door and Kang Hong was standing there with two preservation boxes. \u201cMy mother\u2019s pickled fish is especially delicious. I brought you some!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s senses didn\u2019t return for a long time.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong added, \u201cMy parents also wanted to thank you but I know you don\u2019t like to meet people. Thus, I didn\u2019t let them come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie finally recovered and he opened his mouth. \u201cI said\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong didn\u2019t listen to these superstitious words and sneaked in. \u201cLittle Clever, are you welcoming me?\u201d He dropped down to pounce on the cat and Xie Xi dexterously avoided this abnormal person!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t say anything as Kang Hong told him, \u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten yet. Try it. It won\u2019t be delicious if it is cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>He opened the box and the fragrance of pickled fish emerged. Cat Xie moved his ears.</p><br/><p>Kang Hong shook his head at the cat. \u201cYou can\u2019t eat it. There are many seasonings in this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi scoffed. \u201cI\u2019m not eating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t good to be petulant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018You are petulant, you are petulant day and night!\u2019</p><br/><p>They finished eating and Kang Hong did his homework (played with the cat). Once he left, the tired Xie Xi felt sleepy.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw the kitten\u2019s eyelids lowering and said, \u201cSleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi climbed into his arms and found a comfortable position to sleep. At 2 or 3 in the morning, Xie Xi woke up. He had big things to do.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t always speak like a cat. He had to find a way to become a person. Jiang Xie had already untied some knots and once Xie Xi became a person, he could help Jiang Xie out of the shadows more quickly.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, he suspected that Jiang Xie\u2019s constitution had a problem. It was too inconvenient to protect Jiang Xie as a cat.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he had to work hard to transform. How to transform? It was naturally with the help of the god\u2019s wisdom.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought hard for a long time and didn\u2019t find any clues from the world of Wonderful Painting of the Mountains and Seas.</p><br/><p>By all accounts, that world should have a transformation pill. After all, the beasts and flowers there could transform.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Xie Xi only contacted people who independently transformed and they didn\u2019t need to rely on a transformation pill.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi tried to imagine the effect of the transformation pill in his head and then drew a spherical shape in the god\u2019s wisdom.</p><br/><p>The god\u2019s wisdom was indifferent. Not only was the transformation pill not created, it also wiped out Cat Xie\u2019s drawing that he put effort into.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t believe it was impossible and tried to think of several transformation pills, drawing 17 or 18 spheres.</p><br/><p>The transformation pill wasn\u2019t created and the eraser function of the god\u2019s wisdom became quicker.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi threw the pen. He wouldn\u2019t draw! It seemed that he couldn\u2019t draw things he hadn\u2019t seen. Xie Xi could only give up on drawing the transformation pill. However, how could he become a person if he couldn\u2019t draw?</p><br/><p>The unsuccessful Xie Xi returned to the bedroom and climbed onto Jiang Xie to sleep. Jiang Xie\u2019s chin lay on the soft fur and he slept very well.</p><br/><p>There were no dreams and the next day, Xie Xi continued to follow Jiang Xie to school.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t surprising that yesterday\u2019s incident had spread throughout the school. After all, the location wasn\u2019t far from school and there were many students coming and going. It was normal for them to see it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie reached the classroom and heard the whispers inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cI talked to Kang Hong but he didn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is really too evil. Who hasn\u2019t been unlucky after being looked at by him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that he killed his mother when he was born and his father was also seriously ill. His grandfather died and any family who took him in are in tatters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else you say? After he came to our school, anyone who had contact with him was unlucky!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was probably used to these words and his attitude didn\u2019t change at all. Even so, he didn\u2019t enter the classroom and seemed to be afraid of them.</p><br/><p>There was one person who couldn\u2019t listen anymore. Kang Hong strode into the classroom and cried out, \u201cCan you stop talking nonsense? If it wasn\u2019t for Jiang Xie saving me yesterday, I would be lying in the hospital right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>The students were stunned and spoke the same words as Jiang Xie yesterday. \u201cIf you stayed away from him, you wouldn\u2019t have encountered a car accident.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong was extremely angry. \u201cAccording to what you said, I would be dead and Jiang Xie wouldn\u2019t have saved me. Now, not only am I fine, Jiang Xie himself isn\u2019t hurt!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was quite unusual because the previous people were unlucky without any exception.</p><br/><p>Their classmates couldn\u2019t refute the words and Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t willing to listen anymore. He walked straight in and headed for his seat.</p><br/><p>It was a safe day. Once school ended, Kang Hong once again followed and Jiang Xie didn\u2019t refuse him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t calm down. His ears were pricked as he watched intently for any trouble, but nothing happened.</p><br/><p>A few quiet days passed and the weekend was ushered in.</p><br/><p>On Friday night, Kang Hong suggested, \u201cI\u2019ll go to the hospital with you tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>They made an appointment with the pet hospital to give Xie Xi a check.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t care about the check and vaccination but sterilization was another matter\u2026</p><br/><p>He stared at Jiang Xie. \u201cIf you dare to sterilize me, I will\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t think of anything and eventually said, \u201cYou will regret it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong added, \u201cWhat about a name? Do you like any of the ones I sent you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will look again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t just look at it yourself. You have to ask the little cat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi heard those words and was stunned.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie replied, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll ask tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong saw that it wasn\u2019t early and was afraid of being scolded. He asked before leaving, \u201cYou really don\u2019t need me to go with you tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang Hong really wanted to go together but Jiang Xie said this and he couldn\u2019t follow.</p><br/><p>Regarding Xie Xi\u2019s name, Jiang Xie had been very hesitant.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi knew what he was hesitating about. A week had passed but Jiang Xie was still unsure whether he could raise a cat. Giving it a name might be blessing or cursing it. Thus, Jiang Xie was uncertain. However, it couldn\u2019t be lacking a name forever.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie sighed and asked Xie Xi, \u201cDo you want to be with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo kidding!\u201d Then Xie Xi arched his head against Jiang Xie\u2019s palm.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cThen I\u2019ll give you a name, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a name.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI always feel that you can understand me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToo bad you can\u2019t understand what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie took out his phone from his pocket and read the list of names Kang Hong had sent him. \u201cMeng Meng?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSweet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBaby?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSweetheart?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi batted the phone away. Jiang Xie was slightly startled before laughing. \u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrap!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also don\u2019t feel it is very good\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi cried out, \u201cMy name is Xie Xi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was holding the cat when he suddenly had a thought. \u201cLittle Rose\u2026 is this name good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi just wanted to be called Xie Xi but in comparison to the previous names, um\u2026 this was very good.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cShall you be called this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had no way of saying his name and could only grudgingly accept it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Rose,\u201d Jiang Xie called out to him. Xie Xi looked up at him. The teenager had a rare childishness to him as he called out, \u201cLittle Rose.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s ears moved. It was too noisy. Jiang Xie hugged you. \u201cYou will be my little rose in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt at ease and rubbed his head against the teenager\u2019s chest. Jiang Xie\u2019s mood was very good and called his name a lot, as if making up for the previous days.</p><br/><p>Once it became dark, one cat and one person snuggled up to sleep. It had rained during the day and the clouds dispersed at night, the bright moonlight shining through the window.</p><br/><p>Wisps of silver fell on the two sleeping people and Xie Xi felt something that caused him to wake.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie muttered in his dream, \u201cLittle Rose\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart warmed and he licked this person\u2019s chin, comforting Jiang Xie in his own way.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled in his sleep and unexpectedly bowed his head slightly, lips touching Xie Xi\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned as he felt a cool breath flowing through his body. He felt that his body was strange and when he opened his eyes, he found himself slowly getting bigger\u2026</p><br/><p>This also shocked Jiang Xie. By the time the ray of moonlight faded, Xie Xi found himself becoming human.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie felt something slipper in his arms and opened his eyes to find himself holding a naked\u2026 teenager?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

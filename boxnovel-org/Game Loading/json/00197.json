He wanted to explore, to study and to get the final answer.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed and found himself standing in the Hall. He froze as he felt that something wasn\u2019t quite right.</p><br/><p>He habitually went to the water curtain and took a look at his task rewards. After all, it was his first repair task and he was very curious about the completion and rewards.</p><br/><p>There was an orange-yellow line in the quasi-world column of the system panel.</p><br/><p>[Congratulations on repairing the S-grade quasi-world Collapsed God. The repair is 100% complete and the repair level is SS.]</p><br/><p>This message conveyed a lot of information and Xie Xi carefully read it.</p><br/><p>The quasi-world Collapsed God had an S-grade rating. This wasn\u2019t surprising since there were three souls, which was similar to Love to the Left or Right.</p><br/><p>Of course, the integrity of the whole world was much higher than Love to the Left or Right. However, Love to the Left or Right was a novice trial and the so-called S-grade wasn\u2019t up to the standards.</p><br/><p>The repair completion rate of 100% made Xie Xi feel very pleased. At least he didn\u2019t do anything half-baked.</p><br/><p>The repair level of SS, Xie Xi didn\u2019t quite understand. What did this mean? Was it his task difficulty level?</p><br/><p>After all, he entered this quasi-world and there wasn\u2019t a clearance mission. Then the task level wasn\u2019t linked to the quasi-world but the repair level?</p><br/><p>Then how was this repair level assessed?</p><br/><p>In fact, Xie Xi felt that this world was still very easy. He was in a high position and his actions were very convenient. He was never in danger and Big, Medium and Little Jiang didn\u2019t do anything, instead completing the task together\u2026</p><br/><p>This was SS level? It wasn\u2019t easy to assess the standard. Xie Xi was bewildered by the authorities. Forget the fact that he was the only Repairer, it was infinitely dangerous to be in the world alone.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t have the identity of the Repairer and if the souls weren\u2019t like that to him, it was estimated that he wouldn\u2019t know about the collapse of the universe and would look for the collapsed god in the United States. Then the universe would be destroyed and blow him up. In order to fix it, he had to be buried inside it.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi went to see the task rewards and there was a clatter as gold coins landed. Xie Xi counted the 0s and was surprised. \u201cSix zeros?\u201d</p><br/><p>Well\u2026 he somehow felt a bit pleased. It was such an easy task yet he got so much money\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi cleared his throat and felt he was thinking too much. He might not be short of money but who would hate money?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was going to check the special rewards when he suddenly found that his experience value had reached 50%!</p><br/><p>He had just been promoted to the intermediate level and this experience bar was empty. Now it was halfway filled? Was the repair task so powerful? He could be promoted to the advanced level with two tasks?</p><br/><p>Compared to gold coins, Xie Xi preferred the experience value. He couldn\u2019t help smiling as he went to see the special rewards.</p><br/><p>There were special rewards for S-grade and above tasks. Xie Xi\u2019s rewards so far were good so he looked curiously\u2026</p><br/><p>Item: Sketch Pen.</p><br/><p>Grade: Purple (Lifetime Binding).</p><br/><p>Item Description: With this pen, you are the greatest sketcher. Go to the roadside and put up a booth to draw portraits. You will surely get gold!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was stunned. This special reward wasn\u2019t that great. A sketch pen that allowed people to draw was really useless to players in Central. What was the use of drawing? It was better to get a purple weapon?</p><br/><p>Yet this pen fell into Xie Xi\u2019s hands and he had a powerful item to match it, the god\u2019s wisdom. Previously, Xie Xi was too bad at drawing and the things he drew were twisted and not recognized. Now with this pen, couldn\u2019t he easily use the god\u2019s wisdom?</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt like he was suffocating because he couldn\u2019t take the god\u2019s wisdom out in the Hall.</p><br/><p>There were too many people here. If he drew something and it appeared in the air, it would be too eye-catching. It wasn\u2019t good to expose this so-called wealth and it was better to be cautious.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi went to his skills column to see what he took from the world.</p><br/><p>His passive skill was to randomly take away one thing from the world but every time, the things he brought out were very scary.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was mentally prepared but once he saw what he actually brought out\u2026</p><br/><p>!!!!!!!</p><br/><p>10,000 exclamation points couldn\u2019t describe Xie Xi\u2019s mood at this moment. He immediately sent a message to Jiang Xie with shaking hands. My god, how did he bring this back?</p><br/><p>His hand was shaking so much that he couldn\u2019t write a message for a long time. Then Xie Xi remembered he had authority to the garden and went straight to Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>As he clicked into the garden, he finally realized the strange feeling he got after leaving the quasi-world.</p><br/><p>Why wasn\u2019t he in the garden after leaving the quasi-world? Why did he show up in the Hall despite being bound to the garden? Previously, Xie Xi was used to landing in the hall so he didn\u2019t think about it. Now\u2026</p><br/><p>It must\u2019ve been Jiang Xie who deliberately refused to let him into the garden. This guy\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt anxious and hurriedly entered the garden. Fortunately, Jiang Xie didn\u2019t dare shut off his access.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi had a faint guess but his hands and feet were cold when he actually saw it.</p><br/><p>The breezy garden in the past had no more wind. Instead, there was a bone-chilling cold that made people\u2019s teeth tremble.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw the large number of withered roses that had lost their beautiful colours and lay on the ground with no life. This was Jiang Xie\u2019s spiritual garden and reflected his state.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi trembled as he screamed, \u201cJiang Xie!\u201d He called out the name with all his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine\u2026\u201d Jiang Xie\u2019s weak voice was heard from the pavilion. Xie Xi quickly ran over and saw the man sitting in the chair. The black clothes on his body were completely wet and it was only when looking closely that he realized it was blood.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart buzzed and his heart hurt. \u201cIs it because of that white space?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cYou must not cry. The pain of my body is nothing. I am most afraid of your distress.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi cried, his heart feeling like hot magma. Xie Xi was pained and angry at this person who didn\u2019t cherish himself. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you were okay?!\u201d He actually believed this!</p><br/><p>How could something that clearly violated the rules of the quasi-world be allowed to be used?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cI\u2019m fine, it just looks scary. Wait for God Yan to use his healing techniques.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi anxiously asked, \u201cWhere is God Yan?\u201d Unfortunately, his Repair was unable to repair this type of injury.</p><br/><p>He said God Yan and God Yan would arrive.</p><br/><p>The moment he entered the garden, he saw this person\u2019s miserable appearance and snarled, \u201cOld Jiang, do you fucking have a grudge against yourself? Do you want to die? I don\u2019t think I need to heal you but there is Little Rose. If you are dead, he will be widowed\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>God Yan\u2019s mouth was fierce but he walked quickly to the pavilion. Then he was stunned when he saw the Little Rose who would be widowed.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect Xie Xi to be here.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was concerned and didn\u2019t notice God Yan\u2019s collapse or the name \u2018Little Rose.\u2019 He didn\u2019t even notice the mention of being a \u2018widow.\u2019 He only heard God Yan\u2019s lecture.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, God Yan.\u201d Xie Xi carefully explained. \u201cThere was a moment when I was mentally in danger and he opened a white space to wake me up. I was wrong and it wasn\u2019t his fault. Please make sure\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished when the pained Jiang Xie laughed. \u201cXiao Xie, cough, he is joking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi froze.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fuck, he really didn\u2019t want to heal this guy! How could such a good child be eaten by this old animal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Yan Zhe was afraid of Xie Xi\u2019s worry and told him, \u201cThe injury isn\u2019t serious. It just looks frightening.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t waste much time and used the divine healing.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi watched with his heart in his throat, not daring to open his mouth to disturb the healing. Yet he was also afraid that Jiang Xie was in pain and wanted to help distract him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw this and felt sweet. If he wasn\u2019t unable to move, he really wanted to take Xie Xi into his arms and kiss this person. His strong friend would only show such a fragile and lovely appearance to him.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe felt like he really was a fucking dog.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t get paid a doctor\u2019s fee and he also ate dog food. It was so much dog food that he didn\u2019t have to eat for three days and three nights!</p><br/><p>In fact, Jiang Xie\u2019s injury was very heavy. If it was someone else, they would\u2019ve probably be dead by now.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s skin was thick and his unlucky experiences over the years made him accustomed to all types of serious injuries. 60~70% of Yan Zhe\u2019s superb healing was due to helping this guy!</p><br/><p>Around 30 minutes later, the wounds were all healed and Jiang Xie had returned to his original state.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was relieved and sincerely told Yan Zhe, \u201cThank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe didn\u2019t often hear people thanking him. The dogs in his group treated his healing as routine and they also judged his \u2018milk\u2019 volume.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough\u2026\u201d Yan Zhe replied, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be polite with me. I don\u2019t know how many times I would\u2019ve died if it wasn\u2019t for him so healing him is paying off my debts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke lazily, \u201cThat can\u2019t be. Xiao Xie, you have to thank God Yan. He was terrified all day that you would accidentally become a widow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe, \u201c\u2026\u201d This old beast!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was startled and finally remembered what Yan Zhe said when he entered.</p><br/><p>Yan Zhe\u2019s thick-skin couldn\u2019t endure it and he cleared his throat. \u201cIf there is nothing then I\u2019ll leave.\u201d Once he finished speaking, he ran.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi glared at Jiang Xie. \u201cThat\u2019s rude.\u201d He knew that Jiang Xie deliberately sent Yan Zhe away.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie pulled Xie Xi over. \u201cWho told him to be a lightbulb\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stopped his hand and said, \u201cYour body has just recovered. Don\u2019t mess around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t inclined to listen.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi seriously told him, \u201cIF you don\u2019t cherish yourself, I will never take you to the next world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d He was well-behaved.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi got up and grabbed a small kettle to take care of the withered roses. Jiang Xie told him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about them\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t move, rest there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang.henpecked.Xie could only sit there and heal. He watched the small flowers growing and spoke in the group chat, \u201cDon\u2019t call me to the training field anymore. I quit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c????\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this situation? Old Jiang changed and didn\u2019t want to fight and kill? Who would believe it?</p><br/><p>Old Qin was an honest person and he knew Yan Zhe went to treat Jiang Xie. Thus, he asked, \u201cAre your injuries very serious?\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke so seriously that the others were a bit worried. Nan Yi also wondered, \u201cWhat is the situation? Didn\u2019t you go with your wife? Can you be seriously injured in an S-grade world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie poked at him. \u201cMy injuries are fine but I have to cherish myself later. If I go to the training field and get injured, my family will be distressed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of male gods, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie recovered from his bad mood. \u201cA man needs to have a family to be stable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then everyone found that the group name was changed from \u2018Lonely Male God Online Chat \u2018to \u2018Good Man at Home.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was half a second of silence before the group exploded.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Jiang, do you have any shame!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie\u2019s mood was good as he watched his wife.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xie Xi remembered something. \u201cBy the way, I brought back something quite terrible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d The souls had returned and he knew everything.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi replied, \u201cI brought back the hard drive\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

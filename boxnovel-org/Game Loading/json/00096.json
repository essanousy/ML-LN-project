It really needs your help. My contract with my previous housekeeper expired and I didn\u2019t like her 60 minutes blind date routine. I wanted to change\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What lies! No domestic housekeeper would introduce herself to her employer so unprofessionally! It was a pity that Xie Xi was inexperienced and fooled by Jiang Xie.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you come to help, I won\u2019t have to bother finding someone else.\u201d Jiang Xie asked, \u201cYou won\u2019t introduce yourself with your preferences, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The topic shifted and Xie Xi was completely taken in. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi saw the teasing in his eyes and finally recovered. \u201cI\u2019m not a professional and haven\u2019t done this type of work\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie interrupted him, \u201cYou have already satisfied me. That\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi paused. Jiang Xie added, \u201cYou need work and I need you to work. We hit it off so why not?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was still hesitating.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie started to talk nonsense again. \u201cYou are still young and don\u2019t know the pains of a single and handsome man. I am busy with work and don\u2019t have time to clean up. I have to use a housekeeper but they\u2019re mostly women. I don\u2019t dare use anyone too young but it isn\u2019t easy to use the old. You have to work anyway. Why not work for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>He started fooling people again. \u201cThey saw that one day as a teacher is a father for life. Shouldn\u2019t you help your poor, lonely and helpless old father?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t a teacher for a day, a father for life. It was a teacher for a day and fall into a pit for life!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie saw the child\u2019s face finally loosening up and asked, \u201cHow about it, my snail boy?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was probably because he practiced talking as a teacher. Jiang Xie\u2019s voice was particularly good and made people\u2019s ears numb.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s ears trembled and he finally opened his mouth. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was stunned and thought that his fooling around plan had failed. The next minute, the child said, \u201cI\u2019m not a snail but I will accept the job.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Jiang was as happy as a few billion yuan falling from the sky. Xie Xi bowed to Jiang Xie. \u201cMr. Jiang, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was aware of Jiang Xie\u2019s kindness. The reason he hesitated wasn\u2019t because of the job but because he felt the debt owed to Jiang Xie was too big.</p><br/><p>Still, this was really tempting. He didn\u2019t have to go to the bar to work and wouldn\u2019t have to see many people. It was great. Moreover, Jiang Xie really needed a housekeeper. If the contract with his previous housekeeper had expired then Xie Xi wouldn\u2019t be stealing someone\u2019s job.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to miss such a good thing. Jiang Xie was in a good mood and he slightly showed off. \u201cIt is decided. Then how about 200 an hour for the salary?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi looked up and blinked.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Was 200 too low? How much was the tuition fee? He previously asked an assistant to buy a computer and seemed to spend 50,000 yuan? Well\u2026 he had too many inheritances and didn\u2019t have much concept about money.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi wondered, \u201cHow can it be so much? Teacher, which housekeeping company did you find before? They swindled you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Too high? Jiang Xie continued speaking without hesitation, \u201cIs 200 a day a lot? You have to clean up and can also prepare breakfast and dinner.\u201d So what if he didn\u2019t eat breakfast? It wasn\u2019t bad to get up early when he was in good shape.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was obviously relieved. \u201cI heard you say 200 an hour.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was calm. \u201cYou heard it wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. 200 a day is also very high. I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate the job. I help you can take the time to help me source documents and also act as a small assistant.\u201d Teacher Jiang racked his brains to rationalize the money.</p><br/><p>In fact, 200 a day wasn\u2019t high for full-time housekeeping but Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t aware of the supermarket and kept watching Xie Xi\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s eyes also lit up. \u201cI-I can also be your assistant!\u201d It was so surprising that he used honorifics.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie corrected him. \u201cIt is a small assistant.\u201d He said this while thinking the child was cute.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought of his lacking experience and nodded solemnly. \u201cGood, I will live up to your expectations!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was full of: cute, cute, too cute!</p><br/><p>At Jiang Xie\u2019s insistence, Xie Xi called the bar in the afternoon and resigned from his job.</p><br/><p>The boss already knew about what happened last night and felt very guilty towards Xie Xi. He knew Xie Xi had some circumstances and said, \u201cThat\u2019s fine, you a temporary worker and you can quit if you don\u2019t want to continue. You can rest assured that I will have the finances department send you the remaining wages tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was very grateful and thanked him.</p><br/><p>The boss also appreciated this child. The child might have a face that was easy to get into trouble but he was diligent, low-key and followed the rules. It was impossible to not like the young man who worked diligently.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi let go of his worries and Jiang Xie told him, \u201cLet\u2019s add each other on WeChat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xie Xi scanned Jiang Xie\u2019s QR code and added him as a friend.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie looked at the second-hand domestic mobile phone and felt pained, but there wasn\u2019t much he could do.</p><br/><p>After adding each other as friends, Xie Xi received a message from Jiang Xie. He opened it and was startled.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie had transferred him 6,000 yuan! Xie Xi didn\u2019t have a chance to open his mouth before Jiang Xie told him, \u201cIt is a one month advance of your salary.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi exclaimed, \u201cNo! I haven\u2019t done anything yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to listen to your teacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d What was this?</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie took his phone and accepted the money. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with giving you the money first? You won\u2019t run away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi watched the 6,000 yuan and his soul flew away. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to do this. The bar would pay me tomorrow. I\u2026\u201d He was lacking money but he would have enough once the bar settled his wages.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was absentminded. \u201cOh, there is almost money to buy food.\u201d</p><br/><p>He held the two mobile phones directly, using his phone to transfer to Xie Xi and accepting it on Xie Xi\u2019s phone.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi watched this operation and was dumbfounded as his account received 10,000 yuan more!</p><br/><p>Classmate Xie who had never seen such a huge sum in his life, \u201c!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie returned the phone., \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll give myself to you for the next month.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was too shocked that he was oblivious to the problems in the words. \u201cThis is food money for one month? There were only two meals a day. What did he eat?!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie answered, \u201cHow can it be one month?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi sighed with relief and was about to say, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to give me so many months\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie continued, \u201cHow can 10,000 yuan last one month? It is a week.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie spoke again, \u201cTry it first. If it isn\u2019t enough then tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi couldn\u2019t endure it anymore. \u201c1,000 is enough for one week, let alone 10,000. Teacher, what have you been eating?\u201d</p><br/><p>In addition\u2026 the teacher\u2019s salary was so high! Xie Xi wanted to be a teacher as well!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie leaned down. \u201cIn short, don\u2019t worry about saving my money. If you want something expensive then eat it.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t run out anyway.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s spirit returned after a long time and he said, \u201cI\u2019ll keep the books otherwise I shouldn\u2019t use it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie thought about the child\u2019s careful bookkeeping\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to the supermarket.\u201d He would buy a bookkeeping book!</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought it was buying the evening ingredients and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go on my own.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll drive you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about it and didn\u2019t refuse. He just started working and it was natural for the boss to review his purchasing ability.</p><br/><p>The two of them went out and appeared in the parking lot together. They got into the car and Jiang Xie said, \u201cFasten your seatbelt. We\u2019ll be going to a supermarket far away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked dutifully, \u201cDo you always go there?\u201d He would have to keep buying ingredients later.</p><br/><p>How could Jiang Xie often go to supermarket? The number of times he had been to a supermarket could be counted on one hand.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie smiled. \u201cFar away is good since it will avoid suspicion.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were supermarkets around the school that were large and very lively.</p><br/><p>However, there were so many students at these supermarkets. If they went\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Xi felt warm. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d He thought that Jiang Xie wasn\u2019t willing to let the students know Xie Xi was his housekeeper.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie let Xie Xi keep this idea and opened his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m too handsome and if we go to the supermarket to buy food together, I\u2019m afraid they will misunderstand us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie felt a bit nervous but he thought it was worth it when he saw the child\u2019s red ears.</p><br/><p>Xie Xi stuttered, \u201cNo, no that won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t?\u201d Jiang Xie wondered. \u201cFine, we won\u2019t detour and will go straight there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi was anxious!</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie understood and his lips curved. \u201cI\u2019m just joking. In fact, I don\u2019t want to go there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s nerves were still tight as he asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie explained, \u201cI\u2019m a big celebrity and will certainly be mobbed by little girls if I go to the surrounding supermarkets.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie was serious. \u201cYou saw it before. The girls from the class next door blocked me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t want to talk. He turned to look out the window while inwardly thinking, \u2018Teacher Jiang can never be serious!\u2019</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie drove for half an hour before finding a good supermarket. The two of them got off together since they didn\u2019t have to be afraid of meeting acquaintances.</p><br/><p>Coming out so far, how could they meet anyone? Xie Xi pushed a small cart and carefully selected ingredients. Along the way, he asked for Jiang Xie\u2019s preferences. Jiang Xie couldn\u2019t say anything and just replied, \u201cLet\u2019s see it first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi asked him, \u201cDo you like to eat fish?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like freshwater fish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi nodded and went to the seafood area. Jiang Xie seemed particularly fond of seafood and asked, \u201cCan you make takoyaki?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi blinked.</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cI used to eat it when I was very young but I didn\u2019t eat it later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi thought about it. \u201cIt isn\u2019t very difficult. It just needs a special machine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes the supermarket sell it? Hurry and buy it. We\u2019ll eat takoyaki at night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or cry. \u201cThis place doesn\u2019t have it. I need to search on the Internet and it will arrive in a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie felt slight regret. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xi\u2019s heart was moved. \u201cDo you want to eat it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no hurry. I can wait a few days.\u201d Xie Xi suggested, \u201cIt is generally sold in malls. If you want to eat it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xie told him, \u201cI want to eat the things you make.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

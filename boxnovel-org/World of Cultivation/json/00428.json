Ming Lei\u2019s posture was as straight as a sword, his two sharp brows tilted upwards into his hair, his eyes narrow and had a sharp presence.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? Likely better than us! I\u2019m really sick of this ghastly place,\u201d a round-faced youth beside Ming Lei muttered. On his back was a normal Pine Script Sword. He looked as though he hadn\u2019t woken up from his sleep. He was Ming Lei\u2019s shidi, Song Yuan.</p><br/><p>Ming Lei\u2019s expression was slightly helpless as he said, \u201cYou, you, you have no ambition, so many people want to get in and earn more merit! You, from the first day, you\u2019ve been muttering about going back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Yuan snorted. \u201cMerit? One needs their little life to experience that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Lei smiled. \u201cThe more afraid you are on the battlefield, the easier it is for you to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only have one life, I won\u2019t get more if I die.\u201d Song Yuan glanced at Ming Lei. \u201cI\u2019m different from battle maniacs like you. Ye likes peace!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Lei knew Song Yuan\u2019s temperament and wasn\u2019t angry. He said in puzzlement, \u201cI\u2019m just wondering why Shidi is so nervous? In terms of the past, the yaomo were greatly wounded in the great war three thousand years ago, and our xiuzhe\u2019s Four Realm Heaven is full of talents, and have reached the most prosperous moment of our recent ten thousand years! It is easy to see who is weak and strong with a glance. Recently, Eldest Shixiong used a scheme and the yao were greatly wounded. Even in this Bloody Sky Metropolis Jie, we are not losing. What is Song Yuan Shidi worried about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Yuan smiled coldly. \u201cI\u2019m just worried you guys are underestimating the heroes of the world!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Lei stilled and then said with a smile, \u201cKun Lun, Xi Xuan, Xuan Kong, and Tian Huan which realm isn\u2019t full of heroes? To say nothing else, just our Kun Lun has as many battle generals as the clouds, experts like rain! Are so many disciples unable to satisfy Shidi\u2019s worries? What about Eldest Shixiong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Yuan was silent for a beat before he said, \u201cEldest Shixiong\u2019s genius is undoubted.\u201d He raised his head to look into the distance and said in a light voice, Actually, not just Eldest Shixiong, even you, Ming Lei Shixiong, are a top battle general. How can I not know what we are good at? But for some unknown reason, my heart beats wildly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Lei showed a thoughtful expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know when people like me cultivate to such a level, our sword heart is strong and not affected by outside demons, but I still feel unsafe,\u201d Song Yuan said with a sigh and spread his hands, \u201cmaybe I\u2019m just worried needlessly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Lei was a detail-oriented person. He studied as a battle general, and Song Yuan cultivated the sword scripture of the sect, and had a more sensitive intuition of danger. \u201cDoes Shidi feel that something is not right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Yuan shook his head. \u201cI do not know, which is why I feel so uncertain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just at this time, a sword light flew from the horizon. Song Yuan beckoned with his hand and the sword light landed in his palm. He moved his hand and there was a little sword on it.</p><br/><p>Ming Lei picked up the little sword and light flashed through his eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s go, we have a mission.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Liang Wei\u2019s expression was cold as he stared at the little black boat. When he had received the order, he had been roaming around this area and coincidentally seen the Black Turtle break through the Black Leech defense line. But he hadn\u2019t expected that the Black Turtle would so easily go through the Black Leech defense line.</p><br/><p>As a silver battle general, of course he knew how powerful this Black Leech defense line was!</p><br/><p>The grade of this nondescript little black ship was far greater than he had predicted, if it was able to easily go through the defense line. Even the stupidest person knew now that the identities of the xiuzhe inside the little ship were definitely not ordinary.</p><br/><p>Maybe the people inside were major \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Liang Wei unconsciously licked his lips, the fire of battle-thirst flickering in his eyes. The scar on his handsome face was abnormally sinister.</p><br/><p>He forcibly suppressed the battle intent burning inside. Yao and mo were allies but the other definitely would not let them enter the defense line easily. Receiving permission to enter the defense line was only possible under one situation, when they were unable to hold it.</p><br/><p>This little ship was definitely not simple, and its defensive capabilities would not be so weak.</p><br/><p>Liang Wei was like a lone wolf in the wilderness that was silently waiting for an opportunity.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The breakthrough of the Black Turtle past the Black Leech defense line was like pouring a bucket of cold water into a pot of boiling oil. The situation instantly exploded!</p><br/><p>Three groups of mo soldiers came from three different directions like three floods.</p><br/><p>With the strange corpse gone, the pressure Pu Yao felt greatly decreased. He became lively again, and resumed acting as though he was the leader. \u201cBattle generals are different. Xiuzhe battle generals emphasize deduction, while yao battle generals emphasize consciousness; both emphasizing control of the troops. But Mo battle generals? They emphasize bravery!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmphasize bravery?\u201d Zuo Mo was slightly shocked. It had to be said that individual bravery was not so important in large scale battle. If one jindan xiuzhe encountered one or two dozen ningmai, then it was a secure victory. If a jindan encountered a well-trained troop of fifty, then that was a very dangerous situation. If they encountered one hundred well-trained ningmai, then they had to run.</p><br/><p>Jindan were high level soldier types among the military, but they were cannon fodder used to wear down high level soldiers. This was an ancient tactic that was still very effective. So in the military, each jindan would also have the protection of an entire troop of ningmai.</p><br/><p>So the effects of personal bravery were not evident in large scale battles.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know when you see it.\u201d At this important time, Pu Yao kept a secret again.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was so angry he almost swore but he still managed to resist. Inside, he recorded another mark against Pu Yao.</p><br/><p>But Pu Yao\u2019s words still successfully stirred Zuo Mo\u2019s interest. He started to pay close attention to these mo soldiers.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The three groups of mo soldiers raced from three directions. The Black Turtle that just broke through the Black Leech defense line ended up surrounded once again.</p><br/><p>Gongsun Cha was motionless, his eyes straight and his expression still.</p><br/><p>Some people from the Shield Guard Platoon discussed in low voices.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Daren daydreaming? Daren has seemed slightly weird since his seclusion last time!\u201d The person who spoke was slightly worried. This kind of thing had happened multiple times before. Ever since the last seclusion period, Gongsun Cha frequently wandered off in his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen was Daren ever normal \u2026 \u2026\u201d Another person rolled his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so true!\u201d Everyone nodded. These words really struck their hearts.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, this is good, better than Daren smiling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaren\u2019s bashful smile \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone simultaneously shuddered. They seemed to recall something terrible and all of them felt cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh,\u201d An ambiguous sound came from Gongsun Cha\u2019s mouth. His dull eyes became focused again as he smiled shyly, \u201clet us begin!\u201d</p><br/><p>Receiving the order, Vermillion Bird Camp instantly charged out!</p><br/><p>In the air, many sword lights shot out of the Black Turtle at the same time. The dazzling and beautiful sword lights were like fireworks that exploded in the air!</p><br/><p>The suddenly appearance of the Vermillion Bird Camp frightened everyone!</p><br/><p>No matter if it was Xi Ye and Ming Qing, or the three groups that were forming a circle at the front, or Liang Wei hiding in the bloody mist, they all changed expressions!</p><br/><p>The multi-colored sword lights were sparkling in the air but the yaomo were not in a mood to admire this beauty. Sharp inhales rose.</p><br/><p>No one had expected this nondescript little ship was able to hold so many sword xiu!</p><br/><p>The average outer appearance, the strong defensive capabilities, the carrying capacity that could rival intermediate and large sized treasure ships!</p><br/><p>What kind of ship was this?</p><br/><p>No one knew, but every mo battle general that had any experience could smell the danger contained inside! This kind of ship was like the assassin in the dark that could strike a fatal blow at the crucial moment!</p><br/><p>Thinking about thousands of sword xiu being transported to the backlines without any signs and at the moment the fighting was the fiercest, thousands of sword xiu appearing behind them \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>The yaomo\u2019s hearts suddenly felt cold!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Xi Ye gave a sky-shaking bellow. His eyes turned green!</p><br/><p>From the day he joined the military, it was the first time that any enemy had broken into his territory so easily! He felt shame at his display just now, complete shame!</p><br/><p>He charged at the very front!</p><br/><p>All the mo soldiers at the front shouted angrily in unison. Without hesitating, they followed Xi Ye and leapt at the black ship!</p><br/><p>At this time, the thousands of multi-colored sword lights filled Xi Ye and Lan Qing\u2019s visions. They were completely stunned!</p><br/><p>Bone-aching coldness caused their limbs to feel cold!</p><br/><p>Xi Ye suddenly howled angrily. His eyes were almost completely crisp green, and his body made to charge!</p><br/><p>Lan Qing\u2019s eyes and hands were fast. He pulled Xi Ye back and shouted. \u201cSend the news! Quick! Send the news to Daren!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ye shook and reacted. He looked gratefully at Lan Qing and hurriedly took out a black insect from his bosom. He closed his eyes. A moment later, a drop of blood welled up on his fingertip. Xi Ye swiped the bead of blood on the head of the armored insect and the blood bead burrowed into the head of the armored insect rapidly.</p><br/><p>The armored insect hissed and then suddenly disappeared from Xi Ye\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Looking dazedly at the sky full of sword lights, Liang Wei did not detect that his limbs were so cold they were freezing. There was only one thought in his mind.</p><br/><p>This was a conspiracy! A conspiracy of the xiuzhe!</p><br/><p>A devious ambush!</p><br/><p>Liang Wei\u2019s expression was ferocious, his hands tightly balled, his eyes filled with hate as he stared at the sky full of sword lights. Gradually, he relaxed his fists, and his eyes became calm again.</p><br/><p>He did not start moving immediately to go help the allies even though he knew that the other would definitely accept their help. But if this was a planned ambush, then the moves of the xiuzhe would not end with just this!</p><br/><p>Calmed down, Liang Wei displayed astounding powers of judgment. With quick thought, he was able to judge\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014the xiuzhe definitely would have reinforcements coming!</p><br/><p>He instantly sent out concealed scouts that stood guard in the surroundings.</p><br/><p>The scouts quickly passed back the information. A xiuzhe troops were approaching at a fast speed.</p><br/><p>A thread of coldness flashed through Liang wei\u2019s yes. The scar on his face was also murderous.</p><br/><p>As expected, they had come!</p><br/><p>Translator ramblings: You guys remember Liang Wei, right?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

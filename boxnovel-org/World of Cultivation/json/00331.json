He Xiang felt a rush of blood rush up his throat and he almost fainted. The expressions of the other elders were also terrible. They had achieved great victories recently, and saw the hope of survival.</p><br/><p>But at this time, they were hit over the head with a stick.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho! Motherf***ing who!\u201d an elder lost control of his emotions, and shouted at the top of his lungs.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt definitely is that group! It has to be them!\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd was furious. All of the elders were like a pack of wolves that were pushed to the precipice, their faces red as they breathed heavily.</p><br/><p>He Xiang steadied his mind. He tried to calm himself down. He raised a hand and stopped the shouts of the elders, saying, \u201cWe need to retaliate! A hard counterattack! Old Forefather is watching at us. All of Little Mountain Jie is watching us. If we are so easily defeated, no one will listen to us again. Old Forefather will lose his last thread of patience, and we will be finished!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCatch them! Defeat them! At any cost!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Xiang gritted through his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe final battle has started! This is our final battle! This battle will determine if we live or die!\u201d</p><br/><p>No one spoke. The eyes of every elder were red, their faces twisted.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Ji Wei and Sun Bao carefully entered the tunnels. Their eyes uncontrollably looked at the complex formations on the walls of the tunnels with intoxicated expressions. They were like unworldly country bumpkins that had entered the city for the first time, feeling as though their eyes were not enough to take in the sights.</p><br/><p>Their gasps occasionally rang out in the silent tunnels.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at this, it can be interlocked like this!\u201d Ji Wei pointed at a place, and praised. \u201cI don\u2019t know what is inside Boss\u2019 head that he can think of a solution like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Sun Bao replied, but his gaze didn\u2019t bear to move away. \u201cBoss\u2019 learning in formations is growing deeper.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I feel that Boss might be able to get a Formation Grandmaster medal to play with,\u201d Ji Wei said.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss won\u2019t be interested,\u201d Sun Bao got a hint, and contentedly shifted his eyes away. \u201cWhat use is that Formation Grandmaster jade medal to Boss? Will Boss depend on it for his meal ticket? We should probably get some so that we won\u2019t end up without the qualifications to be Boss\u2019 assistants. Look at these formations, they are as beautiful as a picture. There\u2019s nothing to say about Boss\u2019 skill with fire. I say that if Boss forged, we could only be his assistants. Think about it, how old is Boss?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Ji Wei nodded emphatically. \u201cYou are right. We need to work on the little group of brats. Ai, it would be great if they had half the talent of Boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Bao smiled scornfully and said, \u201cHalf of his talent, don\u2019t dream. We aren\u2019t young people, but have you ever seen someone as monstrous as Boss? Heavens, he isn\u2019t a person. He built this Golden Crow City by himself, and used fire forging methods. You might not have noticed but I was dumbstruck on the spot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Wei nodded with empathy. \u201cYes, I was also stunned. Even with all of us assisting, we almost didn\u2019t manage to keep up the supply. I didn\u2019t sleep well any of those days in fear we couldn\u2019t keep up. Boss\u2019s fire paper technique, tsk tsk, it is a pleasure to see, I didn\u2019t want to move away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun bao snickered. \u201cEveryone is the same. Who has seen such wonderful fire forging technique? It is enough to scare me to death. And those formation battle watchtowers. Thirty six towers. Motherf***er, we\u2019re lucky Boss is Boss. If it was any other person, everyone else would lose their meal ticket.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith the city, and the formation battle watchtowers, our Golden Crow City is probably unique among Little Mountain Jie,\u201d Jie Wei said, full of pride.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Sun Bao also had a proud expression. He looked around, and then lowered his voice to say, \u201cBut from what I see, Boss might not stay in Little Mountain Jie. Look at these tunnels, this formation belt. It is very big. Other than jindan, I can\u2019t think of anyone who needs such preparations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Wei was silent for a moment before saying, \u201cIn any case, I\u2019m planning on going with Boss. I\u2019m not young anymore, I see the world clearly. There\u2019s nothing to say about how Boss treats us. As to the other, life and death, I\u2019m too lazy to think.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour words are wasted on me,\u201d Ji Wei said unconcernedly. \u201cNo one among us will run now. If any of the brats dare run, watch me break his legs. I\u2019m confident in Boss. Just this Little Mountain Jie cannot trap Boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why are you saying this?\u201d Ji Wei glanced at the other out of the corner of his eyes.</p><br/><p>Sun Bao said excitedly, \u201cAren\u2019t you excited? We are going to deal with a jindan! Jindan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Wei rolled his eyes, and said rudely. \u201cYou\u2019re a pretty old person, why are you still so childlike? Quick, quick, stop wasting time. We need to deliver this to Boss, he\u2019s waiting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t excited at all? Jindan, that is a jindan \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, very excited.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t excited at all, how can you not be excited? You \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you have this much energy, go back and forge some more Black Processing Meditation mats. The slender bamboo almost can\u2019t meet the demand \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Bao Yi looked at the mountains of jingshi and materials in the storeroom and his face blossomed. Boss was right. The domino effect was really too fast! After that Head had left, several more group of xiuzhe had arrived shortly after. Some people had bought Black Processing Meditation mat from others, and then came in search of more. Others were just passing by.</p><br/><p>They had to thank the Outer Hall. As the Outer Hall pushed forward, the xiuzhe along the way continued to retreat, and run. Consequently, many xiuzhe would pass by Golden Crow City. Every xiuzhe that passed by would gape when they saw Golden Crow City, so shocked they would almost drop from the sky.</p><br/><p>And what the city was selling made everyone go crazy.</p><br/><p>The appearance of the Black Processing Meditation mat was a great explosion. The number of people that came to buy Black Processing Meditation mat everyday was so much they had lined up. It wasn\u2019t realistic for each person to by one. Usually it was a group and they would buy a few dozen each time. About three people would share a single mat and could satisfy their daily needs.</p><br/><p>However, the direct result of the Black Processing Meditation mat was the jingshi that everyone had thrown to the side before increased in value. With the Black Processing Meditation mat, jingshi was equivalent to ling grains. Many xiuzhe couldn\u2019t bear to use jingshi to purchase, and mostly traded using materials.</p><br/><p>So all kinds of materials flooded towards Golden Crow City, causing Bao Yi to increase the standard for taking in materials.</p><br/><p>Bao Yi\u2019s face was flushed, his mind excited. He had been a black market dealer for so long, but had never done business like this. What he was selling now would directly change the situation of Little Mountain Jie. He felt so happy he was going to faint.</p><br/><p>The supply was not keeping up with demand, and gave him enough space to express \u201cblack\u201d to its limits.</p><br/><p>Talismans, materials, jingshi \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>We\u2019ll take them, take them all!</p><br/><p>Expensive? Oh, very sorry, we don\u2019t have discounts!</p><br/><p>The feeling of richness that he never had before took over his entire body.</p><br/><p>His life like this, what else could he ask for!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The sky was dark and bloody, the ground was barren. This was a certain place in Bloody Sky Metropolis Jie.</p><br/><p>A troop of yao camped surrounding a spring that looked like fresh blood. This was a blood spring. Blood springs were frequently seen in Bloody Sky Metropolis Jie. For yaomo, blood springs were very good places. Yao could use it to calm their energies, and mo could directly consume the spring blood to recover their strength. But for xiuzhe, blood springs were a terrible place. The closer it was to the blood spring, the more brutal and restless the ling power was. The spring blood of the blood spring was also a fatal poison for xiuzhe. If xiuzhe under jindan came into contact with the slightest bit of it, they would be poisoned. If they were not careful, they would die.</p><br/><p>This troop of yao was about one thousand people.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow far away are we from Little Mountain Jie?\u201d the leading commander asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout fifteen days of travel,\u201d his vice commander hurriedly said.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a bead on the bracelet on his wrist lit up with a blue light. He made a light sound. \u201cBlue Hyacinth! Orders from the Elder Council!\u201d</p><br/><p>He took down the bead glowing with blue light and threw it onto the ground. Pia. As the bead landed, it burrowed into the ground. Quickly, a blue plant grew with speed visible to the naked eye, flowered, and produced fruit.</p><br/><p>From beginning to end, it took just two breaths.</p><br/><p>The blue fruit produced a faint blue mist. The mist moved and roiled, forming an old face.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Tian Sheng, after the discussion of the Elder Council, you have been commanded to move your division at the fastest speed possible to Little Mountain Jie, take over and hold the jie river of Little Mountain Jie to Sky Water Jie, and are not permitted to fail!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Tian Sheng gravely responded.</p><br/><p>Pah, the mist dissipated. This blue hyacinth quickly withered and turned to dust. With a gust of wind, nothing was left.</p><br/><p>\u201cSend the order down. Gather immediately to travel,\u201d Tian Sheng said gravely.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d the vice commander hurriedly followed the order.</p><br/><p>Tian Sheng was still thinking over the order just now. In all the military orders of the yao military, only the orders from the Elder Sect could use blue hyacinths. In other words, this order had come directly from the Elder Council. This kind of situation was extremely rare, and the first time he had encountered it.</p><br/><p>Something definitely had happened in Little Mountain Jie.</p><br/><p>Even though they had not rested for long, and everyone had not recovered from their exhaustion, the good discipline of the yao military was fully expressed now. They quickly packed up.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Mountain Jie, travel at our fastest speed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Dong Cheng idly stretched out. It was very hard to be able to live such an idle life in Little Mountain Jie. He was secretly proud of his perceptiveness. As the first faction to submit to the Outer Hall, he became the example, and was put in charge of the first cadet branch of the Outer Hall.</p><br/><p>The first one of the Outer Hall. He narrowed his eyes, and enjoyed the sunlight falling on his face. Just this name was enough for him to have a good life in the future.</p><br/><p>Even though each month\u2019s jobs were not light, but it was a great improvement over his past life.</p><br/><p>Oh, he had to make a request for a batch of xiu slaves from the main hall.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a subordinate stumbled into the yard and shouted in panic, \u201cDaren! Daren! It\u2019s not good, it\u2019s not good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dong Cheng\u2019s dream was disturbed, and he was very discontent. He furrowed his brow. \u201cWhat are you panicking about. I haven\u2019t died yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not good! Daren! It really isn\u2019t good \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, say, what isn\u2019t good?\u201d Dong Zheng was even more discontent. He decided that if this guy couldn\u2019t mention a great matter, he would punish the other well.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone has attacked us \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy ass!\u201d Dong Cheng snorted. \u201cIn Little Mountain Jie, no one dares to come to our Outer Hall to \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice suddenly stopped, his body freezing as he looked dazedly at the sky.</p><br/><p>In the sky, a troop was looking down at them.</p><br/><p>Suddenly thinking of something, Dong Cheng\u2019s face was drained of blood in an instant, his limbs went cold!</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: I wonder if Zuo Mo knows that he can gain a formations jade medal \u2026 \u2026 he\u2019s only ever focused on getting the ling farmer one so I wonder. If this was a time of peace, he would be making loads of jingshi.</p><br/><p>As the chapter title says, this will proceed \u201cgradually.\u201d Patience is needed \u2026 \u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

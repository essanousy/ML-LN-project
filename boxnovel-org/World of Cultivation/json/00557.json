Little Brother Xiao Mo Ge has stepped onto a new level with this battle, it really is an occasion to celebrate.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one that spoke was an old man that Zuo Mo did not recognize. Zuo Mo started to act humble when he heard Lan Rong bow and say, \u201cLan Rong greets City Master!\u201d</p><br/><p>City Master! Shi Yue Yi?</p><br/><p>The average-looking old man in Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes instantly appeared to be more scholarly and deep. As expected, reputation made the person. Zuo Mo felt great admiration towards people that were knowledgeable. This time, he was sincerely humble. \u201cCity Master is too generous!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Yue Yi smiled slightly, the faint wrinkles on his face clear to the eye. He looked at Lan Rong, and said warmly, \u201cYou are a child of the Lan Family, right? Not bad, you have some sense of honor.\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned his face to look at Zuo Mo, introducing, \u201cLet me introduce these two to Little Brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChang Yuan Hao.\u201d A deep voice came from the shadows.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis one is Yu Shuang.\u201d There was a slight smile on Yu Shuang\u2019s face. He bowed slightly and was warm and elegant.</p><br/><p>Without needing Lan Rong\u2019s introduction, he knew who these two were, first and second ranked on the Great Peace Mo Ranking! Even though Xiao Mo Ge was full of confidence in himself, he was still shocked that these two personages had come. He returned a bow. \u201cI am Xiao Mo Ge! Please take care of me!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the side, Lan Rong was so excited he wasn\u2019t able to speak. He had attended the banquet of the City Master many times but it was the first time he met these three major personages. He felt as though he was dreaming to have been complimented by the City Master.</p><br/><p>Shi Yue Yi smiled slightly at Lan Rong. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, we have come to find Little Brother Xiao to discuss some matters, please accept my apologies!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Rong seemed to wake up and immediately recovered. He said perceptively, \u201cThis junior needs to go search for my Brother! Goodbye, City Master, goodbye, Elders!\u201d</p><br/><p>He bowed respectfully and then retreated.</p><br/><p>Matters to discuss? Zuo Mo was puzzled. It was the first time he met these three. What was there to discuss?</p><br/><p>Shi Yue Yi did not clarify and motioned with a hand. \u201cLittle Brother, let us go over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d</p><br/><p>The four of them entered a quiet room. When they entered the room, the noise from the outside instantly disappeared. Zuo Mo noticed that there were jinzhi set up in the room that could prevent eavesdroppers.</p><br/><p>\u201cI had not expected Little Brother to cultivate the Reversed Stellar Revolution.\u201d The one who spoke first was Shi Yue Yi. With those initial words, he attracted Zuo Mo\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cReversed Stellar Revolution? This?\u201d Zuo Mo raised his right wrist and the crimson bracelet that slowly spun around.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Shi Yue Yi glanced at Zuo Mo. \u201cIt appears that Little Brother does not know much about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I do not understand, City Master, please give me guidance,\u201d Zuo Mo said obediently.</p><br/><p>Shi Yue Yi smiled slightly. \u201cReversed Stellar Revolution is a kind of killing move. However, killing moves of this kind are usually only obtained after those with star-type mo physiques comprehend Domain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStar type mo physiques?\u201d Zuo Mo shook his head. \u201cI cultivate the Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Yue Yi nodded and said, \u201cThis is where Little Brother is special. It is true that Little Brother cultivates the Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus that is ranked third among general rank physiques, and I also noticed that while the [Domain] that Little Brother has comprehended has not fully taken form, it is already crimson red. If I am right, Little Brother has already reached the doorway to the [Ten Crow Celestial Domain.]\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve reached the doorway to Domain?\u201d This time, it was Zuo Mo\u2019s turn to be shocked. His mind shifted and the suns suddenly gave off a strange power. A crimson ring of light appeared under his feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected, it is the Ten Crow Celestial Domain!\u201d Yu Shaung couldn\u2019t help but speak. \u201cAs expected of the top ranked Domain among the general ranks. Even though it has not taken form, it is so strong and domineering.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was filled with admiration.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt increasingly puzzled. However, he knew that the other would explain the cause since the other had come to find him.</p><br/><p>As he expected, Shi Yue Yi continued. \u201cIt is the first time that I saw a situation like Little Brother\u2019s. Little Brother, you clearly cultivate the Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus mo physique, and the Domain you comprehend is the Ten Crow Celestial Domain, how could you cultivate the Reversed Stellar Revolution?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStar type mo physique? What is the mo physique you cultivated previously?\u201d Yu Shuang couldn\u2019t help but ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Day mo physique,\u201d Zuo Mo said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond among colonel level mo physiques!\u201d Yu Shuang couldn\u2019t help himself. \u201cA strong mo physique as well. And before that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJade Metal Head.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, even Shi Yue Yi was slightly surprised. Yu Shuang looked at Zuo Mo as though he was looking at a freak. \u201cRanking fifth among captain level, are you from an ancient family?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Zuo Mo gave an embarrassed grimace. \u201cI know nothing about my birth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Yue Yi and Yu Shuang both showed slight surprise but they quickly recovered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is also another possible cause.\u201d Chang Yuan Hao suddenly spoke from within the shadows.</p><br/><p>The three turned their gazes onto him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf one cultivates yao arts to a certain level, they can also cultivate the Reversed Stellar Revolution.\u201d Chang Yuan Hao\u2019s words were a surprise to hear.</p><br/><p>Yu Shuang stilled and then slapped his forehead with his palm. \u201cHow could I forget that? Stars and yao, star power is one of the powers that yao favor the most. There is probably more yao than mo that have the Reversed Stellar Revolution. Oh, I remember, you seem to know yao arts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA bit,\u201d Zuo Mo said as he nodded his head. When he had fought against Miao Jun, he had used little yao arts so he openly admitted it.</p><br/><p>The gazes of the trio turned strange when they looked at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that this is the cause.\u201d Shi Yue Yi nodded and said, \u201cThere have been those in the past that cultivate mo and yao together, but I haven\u2019t ever heard of anyone that cultivates Reversed Stellar Revolution and the Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus together. As expected of what my master said, people that can drink more than ten jars of Granny Meng Ghost Wine are all special people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is your yao art Domain?\u201d Yu Shuang asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cYao art Domain? I do not have one.\u201d Zuo Mo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did not cultivate a yao art Domain, but you comprehended the killing move. This \u2026 \u2026 this is too \u2026 \u2026\u201d Yu Shuang didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>Shi Yue Yi saw his deeply impacted state and comforted. \u201cIf your [Thousand Coil Threads] is complete, you can definitely break through to marshal level.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Shuang rolled his eyes and said in a negative tone. \u201c[Ten Crow Celestial Domain] is my bane.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c[Ten Crow Celestial Domain] is everyone\u2019s bane.\u201d Shi Yue Yi comforted skillfully. \u201cLook at Yuan Hao, he is even worse off than you are. He is completely subdued by it in every way.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shadow stilled when he heard this.</p><br/><p>Yu Shuang\u2019s expression turned from depressed to sunny. He clapped and said with a smile, \u201cHaha! Yes, in any case, anyone else that comes to fight will be worse off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo listened to Shu Yue Yi and Yu Shuang\u2019s conversation. His heart jumped wildly. He was worried the other would decide to kill the threat in its infancy. Then it would be over for him. The two old mo were not people that Shen Yu could compare to. Added that, even now, Zuo Mo did not understand how he had defeated Shen Yu.</p><br/><p>Shi Yue Yi saw Zuo Mo\u2019s uneasiness and couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cI can see that Little Brother doesn\u2019t have such intentions. You should reinforce this perception after just having a breakthrough. Little Brother, at your leisure, let us gather in a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Zuo Mo immediately fled as though he was being pardoned.</p><br/><p>After Zuo Mo\u2019s figure left, the room became quiet again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis birth is not simple.\u201d The one that spoke first was actually Chang Yuan Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not bad.\u201d Yu Shuang said with a smile, \u201cNot a bad boy, I hope that Princess Xia won\u2019t tempt him away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Yue Yi shook his head and said, \u201cLittle Xia will probably fail this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Such a young boy, it wouldn\u2019t be simple for him to resist the power of Princess Xia.\u201d Yu Shuang looked gossipy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long has it been since Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus appeared last?\u201d Shi Yue Yi suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery long ago.\u201d Yu Shuang wasn\u2019t sure. Thinking about what Zuo Mo had said just now, he couldn\u2019t help but gape. \u201cJade Metal Head, Great Day, Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus, this is the best evolution path! If this was made public, how many would be jealous! Even I am jealous hearing that. It is infuriating to compare myself to him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Yue Yi automatically ignored Yu Shuang\u2019s mutterings. He had a thoughtful expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Chang Yuan Hao suddenly spoke.</p><br/><p>Shi Yue Yi slowly said, \u201cI am thinking about that specialness that my master talked about. I wonder if the specialness refers to this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it refers to this!\u201d Yu Shuang\u2019s tone was certain. \u201cIf this isn\u2019t what\u2019s special, then there isn\u2019t anything else that is special. This boy is definitely a freak among the freaks, the greatest freak of them all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Yue Yi said gravely, \u201cI have always persisted in making the Granny Meng Ghost Wine because of the words that my master said. In my memories, my master rarely used the word \u2018special\u2019 to refer to anyone. Every word that my master said was carefully selected and had its own profound meaning. In these years, I have always pondered what the \u2018specialness\u2019 that my master spoke of referred to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Yue Yi caused Yu Shuang to quiet down. For everyone in Great Peace City, Shi Zi Ming was like an all-powerful god.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the time has not arrived, let us first observe,\u201d Yu Shuang said.</p><br/><p>Shi Yue Yi nodded and the three sank into silence.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cPu, is this really the Reversed Stellar Revolution?\u201d On the road back to the compound, Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t resist asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is the Reversed Stellar Revolution.\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s expression was slightly grave. \u201cHowever, your Reversed Stellar Revolution is not the same as the normal Reversed Stellar Revolution, you have sun shen power inside it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then warned, \u201cYou should spend some time now on practicing your yao arts. Without a yao art Domain, you will not be able to express much of the power of the Reversed Stellar Revolution.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei slowly spoke, \u201cA Zuo, you have just reached the doorway to the Ten Crow Celestial Domain, you cannot let it lie. This is the first ranked Domain of the general level, it is not something that Reversed Stellar Revolution can compare to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Pu Yao smirked coldly and said, \u201cYou are ignorant! You really think that the Ten Crow Celestial Domain is invincible? The Reversed Stellar Revolution is full of variations and this one contains shen power. The Ten Crow Celestial Domain might not be a match.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei was not angry and said with a smile, \u201cIt cannot be called invincible, but it is not me that gave it the title of the top Domain in general level.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo looked at the duo that was arguing and said helplessly, \u201cDon\u2019t you two find it very strange? I practice the Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus, but what developed was the Reversed Stellar Revolution?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it strange?\u201d Pu Yao asked in response.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d Wei\u2019s expression was matter of fact.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was speechless.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: No no no, must keep fa\u00e7ade of cool elder spirit up. Also, it was Wei that caused the Stars in Daytime. He set it off to \u201cheal\u201d himself.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He didn\u2019t dare to look away from Zong Ru\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Zong Ru\u2019s appearance had changed greatly. While Zong Ru had been of average appearance before, he had a strong body like most dhyana xiu. Yet now Zong Ru\u2019s body was thin, his cheeks sunken. Only his eyes were bright as though he could see through everything. There was always a small warm and friendly smile on his face.</p><br/><p>The red lotus on his forehead was like holy fire.</p><br/><p>Zong Ru\u2019s withered fingers moved away from Yi Zheng\u2019s Shixiong\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Zong, how is my shixiong? Are there any solutions?\u201d Yi Zheng\u2019s heart was in his throat.</p><br/><p>Yi Zheng\u2019s Shixiong also opened his eyes which flashed with shock. Actually, he had been greatly shocked when he saw Zong Ru. The other\u2019s thin body had clearly been caused by the constant corrosion of wish power, but that pair of shining eyes seemed to pierce straight into his heart.</p><br/><p>It was the first time that he had the feeling that someone was unfathomable in power.</p><br/><p>And when Zong Ru\u2019s two fingers touched his wrist, the gentle and pure shen power caused him to feel a rare comfort and made him relax.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are no big problems.\u201d Zong Ru smiled, his voice filled with a comforting power. Yi Zheng\u2019s heart immediately calmed.</p><br/><p>Joy came onto Yi Zheng\u2019s face. \u201cI just knew that Master Zong could heal Shixiong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zong Ru smiled slightly. A jade scroll appeared on his hand that he handed to Yi Zheng\u2019s shixiong.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a record of some of the things I learned during my seclusion and a method to cultivate shen power. As long as you cultivate according to this, in a short time, you will heal. Your skill in Samadhi is rare and will be beneficial to your cultivation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zong Ru then turned and said to Yi Zheng. \u201cCultivate together with your shixiong. If you have any questions, ask your shixiong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks, Master Zong!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two gratefully thanked him.</p><br/><p>Zong Ru waved his hands. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be so courteous, but you will not be able to tell others of this cultivation method.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two gravely acknowledged with solemn expressions.</p><br/><p>A moment later, Zong Ru suddenly raised his head and with a deep gaze said, \u201cIn a few months, your wounds will start to recover. There is something that I want to ask of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi Zheng hurriedly said, \u201cMaster Zong please speak of any matter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi Zheng\u2019s shixiong also said, \u201cMaster Zong, please tell us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn our Mo Cloud Sea, the dhyana xiu branch is weak. Other than myself, there are no others with significant achievements,\u201d Zong Ru said with a smile. \u201cMy path as a dhyana xiu was rocky, and only received good fortune after meeting Daren. I only managed to develop this after seclusion. If I hide this method, it will be a great pity. Daren also wishes to increase the number of dhyana xiu in Mo Cloud Sea. However, I have no mind for this matter and so will ask the two of you to carry it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi Zheng scratched his head. \u201cThere are too few dhyana xiu in Mo Cloud Sea, and the ones here are not strong. Everyone isn\u2019t willing to be a dhyana xiu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi Zheng was right. In Mo Cloud Sea, dhyana xiu was a rare occupation. This was related to the fact that Mo Cloud Sea lacked a top ranked dhyana xiu. In the past, the strongest had been Zong Ru. Even though he was powerful, he was still weak when compared to others in Mo Cloud Sea.</p><br/><p>Most in Mo Cloud Sea cultivated the sword. Wei Sheng\u2019s terrifyingly unparalleled power was revered by countless followers. The famed Vermillion Bird Camp was also mostly comprised of sword xiu. Most importantly, Mo Cloud Sea had created an unique sword cultivation method, such as the sword essence comprehending formation.</p><br/><p>Then it was the seal xiu. A seal xiu with a good foundation could find a relatively good job in Mo Cloud Sea. Also, Golden Crow Camp possessed a complete set of seal cultivation jade scrolls that could teach seal xiu to cultivate.</p><br/><p>There were not many roaming xiu and dhyana xiu in Mo Cloud Sea.</p><br/><p>Yet what people did not know was that Xuan Kong Temple\u2019s Sutra Pavilion had landed in Zuo Mo\u2019s hands. That was the biggest factor in Zong Ru being able to come out of seclusion. It was these profound dhyana xiu records and Zuo Mo\u2019s shen power jade scrolls that had formed the foundation for Zong Ru to comprehend another kind of shen power.</p><br/><p>After stealing Xuan Kong Temple\u2019s succession, Zuo Mo felt it really was a waste to leave it lying unused.</p><br/><p>Then there was the matter of Heart Leaf Dhyana Sect\u2019s attack. While Mo Cloud Sea had pressed the Heart Leaf Dhyana Sect, the other had presented documents and said that these people had been exiled from Heart Leaf Dhyana Sect half a year ago.</p><br/><p>Angered, Zuo Mo started to think of other solutions.</p><br/><p>The two biggest powers that held back Kun Lun and Tian Huan were Xi Xuan and the Nine Great Dhyana Sect. While the Nine Great Dhyana Sect also possessed a top battle general in Yang Yuan Hao, they had many inner conflicts to deal with.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo had originally thought of selling shen equipment to increase the power of the Nine Great Dhyana Sects to fight against Kun Lun and Tian Huan. The matter of Heart Leaf Dhyana Sect caused Zuo Mo to smell danger. Kun Lun\u2019s and Tian Huan\u2019s infiltration of the Nine Great Dhyana Sect had progressed far more than he had predicted. If a conflict did erupt, there probably would not be many sects that would really fight back.</p><br/><p>Since Kun Lun and Tian Huan could infiltrate the Nine Great Dhyana Sects, why couldn\u2019t they do the same?</p><br/><p>Zong Ru asked, \u201cWhat do you think of the Nine Great Dhyana Sects?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi Zheng was slightly puzzled. He didn\u2019t understand what Master Zong was talking about but Yi Zheng\u2019s shixiong did. After a moment of thought, he said, \u201cToo many people, too many desires, a group of rabble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWould you be willing to go to the Nine Great Dhyana Sects?\u201d Zong Ru asked.</p><br/><p>Yi Zheng\u2019s shixiong suddenly understood, his eyes brightening. \u201cDoes Mo Cloud Sea plan to infiltrate the Nine Great Dhyana Sects?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Zong Ru did not refute it. It was better to speak of this matter clearly. He continued, \u201cThe present Nine Great Dhyana Sects cannot stop Kun Lun and Tian Huan. I do not know about the Great Buddha Temple, but sects like the Heart Leaf Dhyana Sect have been completely infiltrated.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi Zheng\u2019s shixiong was silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Kun Lun and Tian Huan take down the Nine Great Dhyana Sects, Mo Cloud Sea will not have a barrier any longer. This is why we came up with this idea,\u201d Zong Ru said.</p><br/><p>\u201cMo Cloud Sea does not want to swallow the Nine Great Dhyana Sects?\u201d Yi Zheng\u2019s shixiong suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not that we do not want to, but we cannot,\u201d Zong Ru said honestly. \u201cWe need a barrier more than increasing our territory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to turn the Nine Great Dhyana Sects into a bog to delay Kun Lun and Tian Huan?\u201d Yi Zheng\u2019s shixiong had a sharp gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou overestimate the Nine Great Dhyana Sects,\u201d Zong Ru said coolly.</p><br/><p>Yi Zheng\u2019s shixiong was silent. Zong Ru was right. The Nine Great Dhyana Sects did not have this power unless someone could unite the Nine Great Dhyana Sects. However, this was impossible, even Xuan Kong Temple had not been able to do it.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter if it is Kun Lun or Tian Huan, if they win, the dhyana xiu will become subordinates. If Mo Cloud Sea luckily wins, you will not have to worry about this. Please do not worry. No matter if you are willing to complete this task or not, I will not take away this jade scroll.\u201d Zong Ru looked at Yi Zheng\u2019s shixiong.</p><br/><p>A moment later, Yi Zhengi\u2019s shixiong said, \u201cWhat do I need to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, you need to recover, cultivate shen power and increase your strength.\u201d Zong Ru\u2019s eyes flashed with intelligence. \u201cOnly when you are strong will you have the right to speak.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, we will give you more support, including money and resources to help you obtain a higher status in the sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know the situation of Great Buddha Temple better than I do. Based on my knowledge, the Great Buddha Temple is not ranked high among the Nine Great Dhyana Sects. For you, this is a chance. If you can increase the influence of Great Buddha Temple, you will receive more support from inside the temple.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi Zheng twisted his mouth, his face unwilling. He was very displeased about returning to Great Buddha Temple. He had felt the cold-heartedness of the world there, and what had been left were not good memories.</p><br/><p>His shixiong listened carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur personnel support will be very limited, Mo Cloud Sea has too few dhyana xiu.\u201d Zong Ru was helpless but he quickly gave other suggestions. \u201cHowever, we will help you investigate the other sects for disciples that are strong but overlooked. It will be up to you to recruit them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi Zheng\u2019s shixiong nodded. \u201cI understand. Yi Zheng\u2019s personality is not suited to this, I can go alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi Zheng was panicked upon hearing this and jumped up. \u201cNo! Shixiong \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shixiong looked sternly at Yi Zheng. Yi Zheng respected his shixiong greatly and immediately quieted down.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have a straightforward personality and cannot disguise your emotions. You are not suited to doing this,\u201d Shixiong said in a gentle voice. \u201cYou are also at a good time for cultivating, do not waste that. Do not waste the good fortune of being with Master Zong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut \u2026 \u2026\u201d Yi Zheng started.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, while there are many things wrong with the temple, I grew up in the temple since childhood, how can I watch as it declines? Great Buddha Temple\u2019s situation is already terrible.\u201d Shixiong had a nostalgic expression as he said emotionally.</p><br/><p>Yi Zheng could not find anything to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoth for the common good and for me personally, Yi Qing needs to thank Zong Ru and Zuo Mo Daren.\u201d Yi Qing bowed to Zong Ru. \u201cIf there is a day that the Nine Great Dhyana Sects are defeated, Yi Qin requests to enter Mo Cloud Sea for protection.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zong Ru looked deeply at Yi Qing and thought inside, these large sects were full of geniuses. In his view, Yi Zheng was a good talent, and he hadn\u2019t expected the other\u2019s shixiong to be even better. The other had good vision, and if it wasn\u2019t for being hampered by his injury for a long time, he would not have declined to such a state.</p><br/><p>After being reborn now, this person would soar in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can promise you this. Mo Cloud Sea will accept even the yao, how can we not accept the dhyana xiu?\u201d Zong Ru said gravely.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Qing is willing to do this!\u201d Yi Qing bowed the bow of a subordinate.</p><br/><p>Zong Ru\u2019s expression was slightly happy. Yi Qing\u2019s bow expressed that he accepted his status with Mo Cloud Sea. He reached out and helped Yi Qing\u2019s up. \u201cThis matter is greatly dangerous, be careful. If it cannot be accomplished, prioritize your safety, you are more important than anything else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi Qing\u2019s heart felt warmed. \u201cYi Qing understands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zong Ru said in a deep voice, \u201cI have not named this shen power. Starting from today, you will be its creator.\u201d Seeing Yi Qing about to speak, Zong Ru waved his hand to stopped the other and said, \u201cReputation is meaningless to me. However, it can help up accumulate fame. Reputation is a kind of power. If you can use it appropriately, it can save you great effort in your mission.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi Qing was full of admiration. He had never heard of Zong Ru before yet the personality and strength that Master Zong displayed were all that of a great dhyana xiu.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I need to speak to you of the origins of this shen power,\u201d Zong Ru said gravely. \u201cThis shen power has been greatly influenced by Daren\u2019s [Mo Cloud Shen Power] but its origin is Xuan Kong Temple\u2019s secret [Empty Meditation]!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi Qing and Yi Zheng seemed to be struck by lightning, motionless like statues, when they heard this.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Yi Zheng\u2019s shixiong finally gets a name! And Zuo Mo is finally expanding towards the xiuzhe lands.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

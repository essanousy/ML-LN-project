The campground below was very busy. His gaze turned to the empty darkness that held unpredictable dangers. He knew that many eyes were staring back at him from the darkness. The people were waiting for tomorrow to come.</p><br/><p>But \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Thick clouds blanketed the entire sky. There wasn\u2019t one thread of moonlight. A hint of mirth floated at the corner of his lips.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Ma Fan was sneaking in the darkness like a ghost. His movements were soundless. What was even more astounding was that none of his movements created any ripples of ling power. Lei Peng and the others that were watching from far away had expressions of admiration.</p><br/><p>Ma Fan had taught all of them hidden movement spells, but when Ma Fan activated the spells, he wasn\u2019t just slightly more familiar with them. His actions were light, and relaxed.</p><br/><p>As expected of the core that Lil\u2019 Miss had appointed!</p><br/><p>Ma Fan crouched as he moved stealthily like an intangible shadow, he was merged into the darkness. The noises from Hundred Flower Valley could be heard from afar, and contrasted against the silence of the surroundings. He suddenly thought of his life in the past, before he had encountered Boss. He had frequently had to do work that required travelling in the night.</p><br/><p>He did not like darkness.</p><br/><p>At that time, he had only wanted to find a steady job and not have to fight for his life in the shadows. After the calamity of Little Mountain Jie, his situation had deteriorated even more. Fortunately, he had several good skills and managed to survive, but the desire for a stable life had gotten stronger.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t a person with ambition. Being appointed the core by Lil\u2019 Miss had not made him happy. It was the opposite. The training that he had done far surpassed everyone else. He improved very quickly. Even now, he was one of the two people that had the most influence in Sky Peak Platoon.</p><br/><p>He had originally assumed he would quickly feel tired. This life of training every day was not something he wanted. But to his shock, he found he did not dislike it like he had predicted. He had started to accept this troop and gradually started to like this troop.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t for the stimulation of battle, or for those spells and formations, but for hope. This troop, without him noticing it made him feel hope, feel sunshine. Even if he was walking in the darkness, he didn\u2019t have any negative feelings like he did in the past. Every person behind his back made him feel safe and trusted.</p><br/><p>Thinking about that, his eyes unconsciously glanced to his side. The space there was empty. Usually Xie Shan would appear at that spot. A few days ago Xie Shan had entered secluded meditation, and had not come out even now. He couldn\u2019t help but feel slightly worried. After being paired together for such a long time, they cooperated very well, and had great feelings for each other.</p><br/><p>His expression suddenly shifted. He stopped his nonsensical thinking, and his figure paused.</p><br/><p>Everyone instantly became nervous.</p><br/><p>Without any words, everyone spread out and silently advanced forwards.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Two people were hiding in a tree.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, I want to see how long these people from Little Mountain Jie can be happy for!\u201d one of the people said furiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, daylight will be the time of their execution!\u201d The other person said greedily, \u201cSupposedly, they are swimming in wealth. I wonder if we can get one or two items?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, we\u2019re just assigned to watch the wind, what hopes do we have of getting anything good? It\u2019s already pretty good to get some third-grade jingshi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, the sect is pretty generous this time. Twenty pieces of third-grade jingshi, that\u2019s enough for us to use for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwenty pieces? Hmph, I wonder how much will remain by the time we get them?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people suddenly felt a cold flash against their necks. Their pupils suddenly expanded but they were not able to make any sound. Several shadows appeared by their corpses. It was Ma Fan and the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cTenth one!\u201d Nian Lu said lightly.</p><br/><p>The other side really had sent out a great number of scouts around Hundred Flower Valley. In this little while, they had gotten rid of ten scouts. It was smooth sailing for these people of Sky Peak Platoon that comprehended sword essence to do ambushes.</p><br/><p>Ma Fan carefully stripped the two people clean. Seeing there was nothing suspicious, he raised his head. \u201cWe need to be quick. It is almost one o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone had hurried expressions.</p><br/><p>Almost one o\u2019clock\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Ma Fan led everyone to quickly leave and search for the next target. They were silently but rapidly advancing along a path that was very out of the way. Along the way, they occasionally got rid of some scouts. But this road was really far out of the way, and they did not encounter too many scouts.</p><br/><p>When they came out of a mountain valley, they could see Bright Water City and its lights. Bright Water River was serene and silent in the night. Ma Fan released a breath.</p><br/><p>It was not yet one o\u2019clock.</p><br/><p>He nodded at Lei Peng and Nian Lu behind him. The two understood and quickly disappeared into the night. The remaining people were divided into several groups that disappeared behind the two people.</p><br/><p>Ma Fan looked at the three people remaining beside him and said lightly, \u201cEveryone, rest for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing, he crossed his legs and sat. The other three did not waste words and also meditated.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>In a deep valley that was once the area that Hundred Flower Alliance kept its flower slaves. The location was very out-of-the-way and hidden. Zuo Mo had already looted the entire mountain valley, and left nothing behind. This empty mountain valley was filled with seated people at this moment.</p><br/><p>Zong Ru said in a light voice next to Gongsun Cha\u2019s ear. \u201cDaren, it\u2019s one.\u201d</p><br/><p>The smile on Gongsun Cha\u2019s face grew with a bashfulness that could not be hidden. He opened his eyes that flashed with a pressuring sharpness. \u201cDepart.\u201d</p><br/><p>A troop silently advanced along a narrow mountain valley. It was possible to see figures flashing along the two sides of the mountain valley. The troop did not slow down at all. Everyone knew that those were the members of Sky Peak Platoon. They had swept this path clean.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Guarding at the mouth of the valley, Ma Fan suddenly opened his eyes, and saw a shadowy troop. His heart finally landed. They had not failed the mission that Lil\u2019 Miss had given them.</p><br/><p>The troop silently streamed and flew out of the valley. The dense woods outside the mountain valley gave them the best concealment.</p><br/><p>When Gongsun Cha walked out of the mountain valley, he suddenly stopped in his steps and turned to look at the highest mountain peak. He couldn\u2019t help but lightly laugh.</p><br/><p>Shixiong, enjoy getting blown on by the wind.</p><br/><p>After watching as the troop disappeared in the night, Ma Fan moved away his eyes and said contentedly, \u201cLet\u2019s go back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Wood Sword Sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, let this disciple be first tomorrow!\u201d a xiuzhe with handsome features couldn\u2019t help but say. He was Yan Yang\u2019s beloved disciple, Gao Xiu, and in charge of Wood Sword Camp.</p><br/><p>Yan Yang looked with benevolent affection at Gao Xiu. He had put great effort onto Gao Xiu. Gao Xiu had not failed his expectations to be in charge of Wood Sword Camp before he was twenty-five. What many people did not know was that Gao Xiu had just received the White Silver battle general jade medal.</p><br/><p>To be able to become a White Silver battle general at twenty five, this talent was enough to dominate all of Sky Water Jie and no one could rival him.</p><br/><p>He could understand his disciple\u2019s desire for battle. Just having received the White Silver battle general jade medal, he desired to use real combat to train himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you can\u2019t even avoid the fight if you wanted to tomorrow,\u201d Yan Yang said with a smile. Then his expression became serious. \u201cBut you have to be careful. There are two troops under the command of the Master of Golden Crow City. To be able to kill their way out of Little Mountain Jie, they naturally are very strong. You are familiar with Rong Wei. That little girl\u2019s eyes aren\u2019t bad. If she thinks they are elite, then they are definitely elite!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis disciple will definitely fight with everything, and not fail the reputation of our sect!\u201d Gao Xiu said.</p><br/><p>Yan Yang shook his head. \u201cYou are wrong. My demand of you is not to make great achievements, but to make no mistakes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xiu raised his head in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why did I make the wager with He Qiu when I know the other is an elite force?\u201d Yang said meaningfully. \u201cWood Sword Camp is like a sword, and it needs to be sharpened before it can show its power. This Master of Golden Crow City is the whetstone. But we need to be careful or we may break against it. You need to be especially careful of your safety. As long as you are here, Wood Sword Camp is here, and you will not want for opportunities.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xiu was moved, and he respectfully bowed. \u201cThis disciple understands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yang suddenly asked, \u201cWhat is the situation at Hundred Flower Valley?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xiu hurriedly said, \u201cThe Little Mountain Jie xiuzhe of this area have almost all gathered at Hundred Flower Valley. There are also many Little Mountain Jie xiuzhe that are heading over from all places.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Master of Golden Crow City really has skill to have such a high reputation among this group of people!\u201d Yan Yang praised, \u201cIf we give him the time, he may become a warlord. Right, where is he now? Keep track of his movements.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is on the main peak of Hundred Flower Valley. Our people have been keeping an eye on him from afar.\u201d Gao Xiu said with a smile, \u201cSupposedly, he has been standing in the wind. He must be having a headache over tomorrow\u2019s battle!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA strong dragon cannot suppress the local snakehead, you have to securely remember this, and not do as the Master of Golden Crow City is doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis disciple understands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo stood at the top of the mountain as the cold wind blew. He couldn\u2019t help but swear, \u201cWhat stupid plan needs ge to stand up here in the wind for the whole night. If this keeps on going, ge will go crazy in the wind!\u201d</p><br/><p>A Gui silently sat next to him. Other than when he fought, wherever Zuo Mo went, she would follow him like a puppet. Lil\u2019 Black was snoozing on A Gui\u2019s head. Lil\u2019 Fire and Lil\u2019 Pagoda were full of energy as they rolled around on her body happily. Silly Bird was silently standing next to A Gui. When she heard Zuo Mo\u2019s words, she couldn\u2019t help but roll her eyes.</p><br/><p>Somewhat bored, Zuo Mo reached out to Lil\u2019 Fire. \u201cLil\u2019 Fire, come over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Lil\u2019 Fire instantly joyfully flew in front of Zuo Mo. Zuo Mo grabbed Lil\u2019 Fire. It was very soft, and nice to grasp. Both of his hands were grasping Lil\u2019 Fire as he put Lil\u2019 Fire in front of his eyes in curiosity. He tightened and loosened his grip. \u201cHm, why aren\u2019t you sprouting fire?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Pagoda who had also wanted to join in saw the situation and instantly shrank back.</p><br/><p>The pitiful Lil\u2019 Fire was kneaded in Zuo Mo\u2019s hands until it sprouted a small flame. However, it never could have thought Zuo Mo was even more motivated, and kneaded even more happily.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo interesting! Very interesting!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fire became a bag that could sprout fire. With a squeeze, it would sprout a thread of fire. Lil\u2019 Fire chirped sorrowfully, but no matter how it struggled, it could not escape these demonic hands, and could only sprout fire in humiliation.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Pagoda ran to A Gui\u2019s head, and watched sympathetically with Lil\u2019 Black at Lil\u2019 Fire.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s hand suddenly felt pain and uncontrollably relaxed. Lil\u2019 Fire took the chance and broke free of the demonic hands.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo turned his face. What welcomed him was Silly Bird\u2019s gaze filled with scorn. Just now, it had been her that pecked Zuo Mo\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>He looked dazedly at Silly Bird and was astounded.</p><br/><p>That peck \u2026 \u2026 was so strong!</p><br/><p>He had the Great Day mo physique \u2026 \u2026 but he couldn\u2019t keep his grip under the peck \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>He looked with disbelief at Silly Bird but the scene that followed shocked him even more!</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: So one sect leader has now explained his motivations. It\u2019s an acceptable reason though it is risky. True combat is needed to gain experience so one can survive in such chaotic times. he\u2019s a good leader and master like Tian Song Zi, even if he is underestimating the danger.</p><br/><p>How many of you thought that Zuo Mo was going to wait with his troops for the other group to come and then have a fight at the arranged time? This is the guy that used formations in a Sword Test Conference, created a great trap when he was the weaker side, and also loves to to gang up on opponents. Sneak attacks is a rational path to take.</p><br/><p>The balance between peace and war chapters is hard to maintain. I\u2019m afraid that Fang Xiang likes to make his peaceful parts peacefully long, and his battles long at the buildup with a short payoff. I would offer the chapter when this arc ends \u2026 \u2026 but \u2026 .. it\u2019s going to be a secret.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

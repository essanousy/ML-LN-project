She was still beautiful, but there was authority at her brow, and that pair of spirited eyes had become as deep as the ocean.</p><br/><p>No one cared about her age any longer. Everyone was fearful in front of her and didn\u2019t dare to breathe.</p><br/><p>Over the last ten years, Ming Yue Ye had successfully eliminated her political enemies. There was only one voice in the yao. The Council of Elders was had no power. All of the important departments and elite battalions were in her control.</p><br/><p>After reading the reports, Ming Yue Ye\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cLiang Wei?\u201d</p><br/><p>She had a reminiscing expression. This name clearly stirred many of her memories. \u201cLiang Wei of the Ice Frost Corps?\u201d</p><br/><p>She had some recollection about this name. He was a silver battle general that had accomplished a great victory in the war against Kun Lun. Then he had been relieved of his duties and sent home. This had been an example of corruption she had used to attack the Council of Elders and it had created some big waves.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Youqin Lie said cleanly but certainly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did he get to Nether Realm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d Youqin Lie said calmly, \u201cShould this be investigated?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no flaw to be seen on his face. While he had buried the matter that he had interacted with Liang Wei in the past, he had not relaxed. As he hid in the shadows for long and longer, he became even more careful. He would not leave behind this one opening.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Youqin Lie promoted all the subordinates that had participated in that meeting, and gave them more power.</p><br/><p>In this past decade, the biggest mission carried out was the cleanse. Youqin Lie was the sharpest blade in Ming Yue Ye\u2019s hands, and his subordinates naturally had to participate in these missions. Promotion meant that they needed to take harder and riskier missions.</p><br/><p>Therefore, these people slowly decreased in number.</p><br/><p>Liang Wei had been politically silent for ten years, and these people had forgotten him long ago. These people would never have thought that the matter of Liang Wei was the cause of their deaths.</p><br/><p>Because they had died for the public good, their families were taken care of. They could enter the best yao arthouses, and they could get steady jobs.</p><br/><p>Violent times was the best concealment. No one noticed the systematic sacrifice of these people. Even these people did not detect it.</p><br/><p>Too many people had been sacrificed in these ten years. Even Youqin Lie had been heavily wounded multiple times and almost died a few times.</p><br/><p>Youqin Lie rejoiced at his past cautiousness. If any of the people were still alive, he would be in trouble. If his past subordinates were still here, and Liang Wei suddenly appeared under the command of the Nether King, everyone would find it strange.</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Ye did not respond and sighed in regret, \u201cI misjudged. In the past, I thought that he was just an average silver battle general not worthy of recruitment. I hadn\u2019t thought that his talent would rival Mi Xu. I missed recruiting such a famed general. It is a great mistake! Also, as a yao, he leads a mo battalion. It seems that us yao will also have a battle general like Bie Han!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue Ye was filled with regret. Based on Liang Wei\u2019s status in the past, she only needed to show some attention, and he would be faithful.</p><br/><p>A thousand soldiers was easy to obtain, one general was hard to find, especially a general like this.</p><br/><p>In this battle, Liang Wei formally made it into the ranks of top battle generals.</p><br/><p>Shaking her head, Ming Yue Ye threw away her vexation. \u201cHow is the fighting between Kun Lun and Mo Cloud Sea?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two have started an all-out war.\u201d Youqin Lie paid extra attention to Mo Cloud Sea and knew it well. \u201cFrom the intelligence reports we have received, the two sides have not prepared for the final battle. Mo Cloud Sea\u2019s intentions at the beginning was to use North Tian Huan as a lure to attract Kun Lun so they could ambush from the back and expend Kun Lun\u2019s military power. Kun Lun wanted to first take Tian Huan and get rid of weaknesses as it strengthen their holdings and then use the four Minor Dhyana Sects or Gu Liang Dao as a target to initiate the final fight with Mo Cloud Sea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue ye nodded. \u201cLi Xian Er\u2019s move was beautiful. Mo Cloud Sea had to accept her proposal, and Kun Lun had to fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>She showed a smile. \u201cThe two titans will fight for a long time. We need to take this chance to rest and recover. When both sides are wounded, it will be the time for my yao to rise!\u201d</p><br/><p>The yao who had just recovered slightly from the cleanse could not move. No one knew better than Ming Yue Ye how much the yao had exhausted themselves in the ten years of internal conflict. In her view, the internal fighting in the xiuzhe and the mo world was a blessing from the heavens for the yao to recover.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaren is wise!\u201d Youqin Lie said with an expression of agreement.</p><br/><p>Inside, he smirked coldly.</p><br/><p>He had gotten in contact with Pu. While Pu had not said it, he could hear from Pu\u2019s tone that Pu had other plans!</p><br/><p>Youqin Lie was extremely smart, and he had worked in the intelligence field for many years. He was skilled in finding the truth from hints. Liang Wei had appeared in the command of the Nether King. Thinking about Pu\u2019s certainty, the return of Wei Sheng and the others to Mo Cloud Sea, and Zuo Mo\u2019s impeding return, he reached an absurd conclusion, the Nether King was possibly Zuo Mo!</p><br/><p>In reality, he frightened himself with his conclusion.</p><br/><p>But he quickly calmed down. If this was true, then Zuo Mo was unprecedentedly powerful. This was a nightmare to the other factions.</p><br/><p>In his view, the Mo Shen Temple could not withstand for long. The difference in power was too great.</p><br/><p>The mo uniting could not be stopped.</p><br/><p>If his guess was true \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Once Zuo Mo defeated Mo Shen Temple, he would possess Hundred Savage Realm, Nether Realm, and Mo Cloud Sea. He would become the strongest in the world. The only chance to resist would be for the yao and Kun Lun to ally together.</p><br/><p>But now, Ming Yue Ye decided to wait until the two sides finished fighting. Youqin Lie smirked inside.</p><br/><p>Once Zuo Mo finished uniting the mo, he would be stronger than Kun Lun. More importantly, Kun Lun would never imagine that the Nether King was the king of Mo Cloud Sea.</p><br/><p>With Zuo Mo\u2019s plans, Kun Lun would suffer a great loss!</p><br/><p>Youqin Lie understood Pu well. With Pu\u2019s style, he might not move, but if he did, it would be a fatal blow. He would not give Kun Lun a chance to come back.</p><br/><p>At that time \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Would the yao be a match for Zuo Mo?</p><br/><p>No one had expected that after all the fighting, the most outstanding general under the Nether King\u2019s command was not An Mo but Liang Wei. In the past, everyone thought that the Nether King\u2019s weakness was that he had the soldiers but lacked capable generals. This lack of generals referred to the top ranked battle generals.</p><br/><p>Hundred Savage Realm had always been fighting, and the battalions had been reduced, but they had a group of top battle generals. Mo Shen Temple, the Mo Marshals Alliance and Heroes Alliance all had top battle generals.</p><br/><p>While they were much weaker than the xiuzhe alliance, they were much stronger than the Nether Realm. Nether Realm had been relatively peaceful, especially after the Nether Realm had been united, there had been no more fighting.</p><br/><p>Without the experience of battle, it was difficult for top battle generals to mature, even for large sects like Kun Lun with their outstanding battle general training systems and enormous number of battle generals. A true top battle general would only come out of battle.</p><br/><p>Now, Nether King\u2019s shortcoming was made up. Other than Liang Wei\u2019s appearance out of nowhere there was now Qi Xing, formerly of the Heroes Alliance.</p><br/><p>Qi Xing was a large reason why the Heroes Alliance was able to survive while being squeezed between the Mo Shen Temple and the Mo Marshals Alliance. He was the most outstanding battle general of the Heroes Alliance and the only top battle general the Heroes Alliance had.</p><br/><p>But Qi Xing had terrible luck. Liang Wei cleverly avoided his position and pushed into the core of Heroes Alliance. He had immediately recognized the situation and hurried back to save the higher-ups but he was a step late. All of the Heroes Alliance higher-ups had surrendered. He didn\u2019t even have the time to fight back, he could only surrender.</p><br/><p>Qi Xing was much weaker as a warrior compared to An Mo. This could be seen from the scale of the two battalions. With Qi Xing\u2019s strength, he could only lead six thousand elites. But An Mo could easily lead ten thousand without a problem. While in terms of strategic ability and perception, An Mo was lacking.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo selected the elite of each battalion for Qi Xing to assemble a troop from.</p><br/><p>In Zuo Mo\u2019s view, top tier battle generals need top tier battalions. Qi Xing wasn\u2019t bad, but his original battalion wasn\u2019t great. What Zuo Mo had the most of right now were battalions. Liang Wei had accomplished a great victory in capturing all the higher-ups of Heroes Alliance. The collective surrender of Heroes Alliance mean the number of battalions under Zuo Mo swelled again.</p><br/><p>So many battalions. There definitely were enough to create a top battalions for Qi Xing.</p><br/><p>He did not worry about Qi Xing. He believed that Qi Xing was not so dumb.</p><br/><p>Right now, he had the two spears, Liang Wei and Qi Xing. He also had An Mo in charge, the experienced and reliable general. There almost wasn\u2019t anything for him to do.</p><br/><p>On the other side, all the jies under the rule of the Mo Sheng Temple moved.</p><br/><p>The development of the war robbed people of hope. The advancement of the Nether King\u2019s army was almost unimaginably fast. Once Heroes Alliance had surrendered, it left Mo Shen Temple to fight alone. They had no place to retreat.</p><br/><p>The Mo Shen Temple had expanded greatly in the past years, and had conquered almost half of Hundred Savage Realm. It was still the largest faction of Hundred Savage Realm. Of the five mo gods, there were top experts and top battle generals.</p><br/><p>However, they were lacking compared to the Nether King.</p><br/><p>Especially after the god-level Nether King\u2019s attack on Sky Wood Jie shook the world.</p><br/><p>People had seen the strength of a god-level through the battle at Nether King River. However, experiencing it in person was completely different.</p><br/><p>An Mo was the main commander, Liang Wei and Qi Xing were the second-in-commands. A three-pronged attack formed. An Mo was not the strongest, but he was reliable and he had the respect of the troops. Zuo Mo did not worry with him in charge of the army. Nothing more needed to be said of Liang Wei. He was the rising star of the moment. Zuo Mo also put great hopes on Qi Xing. He wanted to see Qi Xing\u2019s abilities.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was organizing the territories of Hundred Savage Realm they had conquered. He needed to first set up the political structure before he would be able to attack the Mo Shen Temple without any worries. Once they swept the Mo Shen Temple away, it was time for them to turn and pincer Kun Lun.</p><br/><p>By that time, there would be no time to deal with all of this.</p><br/><p>The battle against Kun Lun might continued for a long time. At that time, a steady rear was important.</p><br/><p>Also, managing Hundred Savage Realm was not suitable for the mo of Nether Realm to do. He needed the mo of Hundred Savage Realm. Only then would he stabilize Hundred Savage Realm as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo had met the higher-ups of Heroes Alliance but he didn\u2019t have a good feeling about them. Those people were too average in ability and would not able to fulfill their duties to his satisfaction.</p><br/><p>Others thought that Zuo Mo had no one to use, but didn\u2019t know that Zuo Mo had selected candidates a long time ago.</p><br/><p>He thought back to the time at Great Peace City with a reminiscing expression on his face.</p><br/><p>Princess Xia. The Lan Brothers, I wonder how have you been?</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: So all that setup in the Great Peace City Arc is for this throwaway sentence.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

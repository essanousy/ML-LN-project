The first thing he noticed was the pain! It was like the bones in his body had been rattled. Just the slightest of movements had caused bone-aching pain. He instantly became docile and motionless.</p><br/><p>The familiar fragrance of medicine entered his nose. He instantly realized where this was.</p><br/><p>Oh, his life was really bad. It seemed every time he attended a fight, he would enter the Fragrant Ginger Yard. It looked like he was quite heavily wounded this time.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough, Shidi, you\u2019re awake.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a familiar voice came from his right.</p><br/><p>Eldest Shixiong? Zuo Mo instinctively turned his neck to look right. Just as he moved, he couldn\u2019t help but inhale sharply. So painful!</p><br/><p>He moved his head with great difficulty. When he saw Eldest Shixiong on a bed not far away at his right, he was instantly shocked.</p><br/><p>Lying on the bed where Eldest Shixiong voice came from was a person whose body was entirely bound in bandages with only his eyes left uncovered.</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest Shixiong, is it you?\u201d Zuo Mo asked with uncertainty. This person who was wrapped up like a mummy, was he really the courageous and invincible Eldest Shixiong?</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d The person under the bandages responded. It really was him. He said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been unconscious the longest. We were all very worried about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest Shixiong, who wounded you like this?\u201d Zuo Mo asked in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, I fought with Gu Rong Ping, he did this.\u201d Wei Sheng\u2019s tone was relaxed.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo still didn\u2019t quite believe it. \u201cThat little white face shouldn\u2019t be this strong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t much better off.\u201d Wei Sheng smiled. \u201cIn the end, I managed to slice him twelve times in succession.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Zuo Mo sweated. Sliced twelve times \u2026 \u2026 even if that little white face was a big carrot, he would have been sliced into a toothpick. However, he felt that this was expected. In the same generation, how could there be anyone who could overpower Eldest Shixiong to the point he could not retaliate?</p><br/><p>seeing Eldest Shixiong worse off than he was, his mood which had been down due to his injuries instantly became much better. He felt this way even though Wei Sheng was Zuo Mo\u2019s respected and loved Eldest Shixiong.</p><br/><p>Brothers in difficulty \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Wei Sheng suddenly shouted in Zuo Mo\u2019s direction, \u201cLuo Shidi, are you better today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo unconsciously turned his face to the left.</p><br/><p>There was a bed on his left. Luo Li was lying on top. Even though it wasn\u2019t as severe as Eldest Shixiong, but his expression was withered, his complexion pale. It was easy to see he was seriously injured.</p><br/><p>So there wasn\u2019t just one brother in difficulty \u2026 \u2026 Zuo Mo was struck.</p><br/><p>When Luo Li looked at Zuo Mo, his expression was slightly unnatural. Zuo Mo immediately remembered that the person who had wounded Luo Li had been himself. That wondrous state had disappeared, but Zuo Mo clearly remembered what had happened during that time.</p><br/><p>If Zuo Mo\u2019s face could move, his expression right now would certainly be extremely unnatural.</p><br/><p>Due to the fact he had been in a strange state, he had performed beyond his abilities. Even if he was completely healed and set up the seventy-two child formation Skyring Moon Chime Formation again, he might not be able to successfully perform [Moon Chime Sound Storm] successfully one in ten times.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Shixiong better? Luo Li avoided Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes and asked Wei Sheng. His mentality was much better than before. Even though Wei Sheng had once been his sword servant, but right now, he was Wu Kong Sword Sect\u2019s Eldest Shixiong.</p><br/><p>Greater power meant a greater status, the rules of the sect had always been so.</p><br/><p>Now, no one in Wu Kong Sword Sect would doubt Wei Sheng Shixiong\u2019s strength. Facing Zuo Mo, Luo Li still had some desire to compete, but facing Wei Sheng he had completely submitted.</p><br/><p>\u201cMuch better.\u201d Wei Sheng\u2019 tone was nothing like that of a seriously wounded patient, extremely optimistic. \u201cAfter a bit of time, I\u2019ll probably heal.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them were all severely wounded, unable to move as they laid on the bed.</p><br/><p>At the beginning there was a slight barrier between Zuo Mo and Luo Li, but now that they were in the same predicament, their relations gradually improved. After a while, they conversed freely. Before, Zuo Mo hadn\u2019t liked Luo Li. Upon further acquaintance, he found that Luo Li was not as bad as he had imagined. Quite the opposite, in fact. Even though he would unconsciously reveal the pride ingrained in his bones, his personality was straightforward and he was a forthright person.</p><br/><p>The two of them had fought two times. Both times, each of them had been seriously wounded. To a certain degree, their relationship was forged in fighting.</p><br/><p>The two of them were also full of admiration towards each other\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>Nothing needed to be said of Luo Li to Zuo Mo. Right now, Zuo Mo had become one of the hottest people in Dong Fu. At the end, he had fought one on five, and it had turned into a legend in Dong Fu. No one had saw the one-on-five fight, but everyone had clearly seen the terrifyingly gigantic hole in the Great Pine Pavilion.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo knew how much his strength was really worth. Each time Eldest Shixiong and Luo Li mentioned this matter, his heart was extremely insecure. In his perspective, Luo Li\u2019s strength was much stronger than his.</p><br/><p>Suddenly remembering this matter, Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t help but ask in curiosity, \u201cShixiong, that day, I seemed to see a woman in front of you, who was that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Li was instantly slightly embarrassed. He muttered, \u201cThat\u2019s my sword spirit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Shidi is walking the road of spirit manifestation.\u201d Wei Sheng instantly realized. Seeing Zuo Mo not understanding, and then remembering this guy did not study what he should be, he painstakingly explained. \u201cThere are many ways to cultivate the sword, many of them strange. Sword spirit is one of these. It means to nurture the sword essence to made it into a spirit. However\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help but glance at Luo Li several times. \u201cI really didn\u2019t see that Luo Shixiong\u2019s emotions are pretty sensitive.\u201d Seeing Zuo Mo still not understanding, he said with a smile, \u201cPeople that cultivate a sword spirit mostly have sensitive feelings. This way of the sword uses emotion to enter this path of the sword. When the sword spirit is forming, it needs to use emotion as the guide for the sword spirit to take form.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo finally understood. Luo Li instantly blushed red.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur sect is a sword sect. Shidi must not slack off on the sword scriptures.\u201d Wei Sheng said to Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh-huh, uh-huh.\u201d Zuo Mo unconcernedly responded. He suddenly thought about the Kun Lun jade scroll, and couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cThis Sword Test Conference, has the rankings come out? Who entered the top ten?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng shook his head. \u201cWounded like this, how can we know the situation outside?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo turned towards Luo Li. Luo Li also shook his head.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo could only say, \u201cI\u2019ll ask when Xiao Guo and the others come next time.\u201d These past few days, it had been Xiao Guo, Li Ying Feng and the others who had been looking after the three of them. The sect elders were not seen.</p><br/><p>The three of them didn\u2019t know the ranking for the Sword Test Conference had become a great problem.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s last move had disrupted the competition. Tian Song Zi saw that the Great Pine Pavilion had been damaged to a such a degree had instantly stopped the competition. No competitor had opposed the decision. Having seen the terrifying collision with their own eyes, they didn\u2019t have any more interest in competing.</p><br/><p>Many of the xiuzhe that rushed to the explosion had been left shocked, dazed, and withered. What was even more unexpected was that the time those people spent with a low mood was much longer than others had imagined. Their elders started to become worried.</p><br/><p>From this, it could be seen just how much of a blow that world-shattering collision had given them!</p><br/><p>For Tian Song Zi who was hosting the Sword Test Conference, there were more things that caused a headache for him. He could slowly fix the damage in the Great Pine Pavilion but he must immediately solve the problem of the Sword Test Conference\u2019s ranking.</p><br/><p>This was an extremely troublesome problem!</p><br/><p>Because the competition had been stopped in the middle, the number of people in the Great Pine Pavilion was far more than ten. These competitors were also all people of some strength. Wei Sheng and Gu Rong Ping had both been wounded and became unconscious. The other spectacular competitor, Zuo Mo, also was seriously wounded and unconscious.</p><br/><p>It was not easy to rank the first ten.</p><br/><p>The reason that the four of Pei Yuan Ran and the others were absent was due to this matter.</p><br/><p>Who could imagine a group of jindan experts in a room shouting furiously like a group of children. Some slammed the table, others sword, some bounced back and forth. It was very boisterous.</p><br/><p>After Pei Yuan Ran and the others left Dong Fu Hall, even if they were of astounding cultivation, there was tiredness on their faces.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Su was lying on the bed. Even now, there was a layer of black gauze over her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you feel better today?\u201d Lin Qian asked attentively.</p><br/><p>Su nodded and didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian\u2019s expression was full of self-blame. He took out a jade bottle and said gently, \u201cI didn\u2019t think you would be wounded this time. It is my fault. This Youth Dan will be very beneficial for you. Consume it quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su\u2019s body gently shook.</p><br/><p>Her gaze stared at the jade bottle in Lin Qian\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>She had heard of the name Youth Dan. It was an extremely rare and expensive lingdan, especially suited for female xiu to consume. It had great benefits for cultivation. Using it to heal, she felt it was a great waste.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho really are you?\u201d Su\u2019s gaze moved from the jade bottle to Lin Qian as she asked coldly.</p><br/><p>She had heard the name of the Youth Dan but she was also very clear about its rarity. Heart Lake Sword Sect might be the top tier sect in Sky Moon Jie, but such a high grade lingdan such as Youth Dan wasn\u2019t something they could possess.</p><br/><p>She had always assumed that Lin Qian was a disciple of one of the elders, but when he took out the Youth Dan, she suddenly realized that Lin Qian definitely couldn\u2019t be a disciple of her sect.</p><br/><p>Then the other question was, where did the sect token in Lin Qian\u2019s hand come from?</p><br/><p>What goal did he have?</p><br/><p>Su\u2019s gaze was like an arrow. Lin Qian laughed lightly, his expression normal. He gently put the Youth Dan in front of Su. \u201cI am not Shimei\u2019s enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then asked, \u201cThe matter I asked last time, does Shimei have the result?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the calmness on Lin Qian\u2019s face, Su hesitated and shook her head, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian did not seem surprised at this result. He nodded. \u201cMany thanks, Shimei. Shimei, please relax and rest. As to forging your sword, you can give it to this one. I will not disappoint Shimei.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing, he left.</p><br/><p>Su looked at the figure that disappeared outside the door and felt this person was even more mysterious.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>In a distant mountain valley of Ling Ying Sect, there were two people speaking. It was Chang Heng and the yellow-faced man. The expressions of the two seemed untouched, but their complexion and alertness was much worse than before the competition.</p><br/><p>The two of them had not escaped unscathed. They had been wounded to various degrees.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is what you need.\u201d The yellow-faced man handed over a jade scroll.</p><br/><p>Chang Heng took over the jade scroll. Without looking, he put it away.</p><br/><p>The yellow-faced man saw Chang Heng didn\u2019t move and said in satisfaction, \u201cThis is the first half. It\u2019s the deposit. After the matter is concluded, I\u2019ll give you the other half. I\u2019ll notify you of the general time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Heng nodded and said expressionlessly, \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing, he turned and left.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: I was wrong, it\u2019s more like multiple reaction chapters. The story is going to vent now like a balloon slowly deflating, but it won\u2019t pop.</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng has become a mummy. Luo Li has the ghost. It\u2019s a band of monsters, the zombie, the mummy and the ghost.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

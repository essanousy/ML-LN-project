The wave of killing intent rushed at him and then would quickly dissipate.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s gaze focused and his heart shook.</p><br/><p>The old man suddenly seemed to detect something and threw out, \u201cYou have to be careful, many people have their eyes on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the next moment, his figure disappeared.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo stilled but his expression changed slightly. At this time, he found that someone was coming close.</p><br/><p>This old man \u2026 \u2026 was really strong!</p><br/><p>He thought back to what the old man had just said. The other didn\u2019t seem to have malicious intent.</p><br/><p>As he thought, he silently left. He had scouted out the nearby area a few times before entering and was familiar with it. Pu Yao and Wei\u2019s specialized cultivation was clearly effective. Even though Zuo Mo was not a master at moving under concealment, he didn\u2019t have problems fooling average experts.</p><br/><p>When he returned to his residence, he was still thinking about that old man. Such a strong old man definitely wasn\u2019t someone unknown figure. Yet what shocked Zuo Mo was that he didn\u2019t even know what power the old man cultivated.</p><br/><p>What did the old man mean in his words?</p><br/><p>Many people had their eyes on him? This was clearly a reminder!</p><br/><p>Had he exposed himself somehow? Zuo Mo shook his head. While he did not know the old man\u2019s intentions, the other\u2019s reminder did not seem to be baseless.</p><br/><p>The old man said \u201cmany people.\u201d That meant more than one. Why were those people keeping an eye on him?</p><br/><p>Earth mo weapons? This was the most likely guess. Earth mo weapons were the top mo weapon in the present mo territories and there were naturally numerous people that wanted them.</p><br/><p>But Zuo Mo who had struggled on the border of life and death had an unusually sensitive sense for danger. This most plausible cause was rejected first.</p><br/><p>Other than the earth mo weapons, what could most likely attract attention was his identity as Xiao Mo Ge and the shen power inheritance. If other people knew this, then it would be trouble!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s brow furrowed and then he put the problem to one side. He would not panic just because of some words from a strange old man. What he needed to do now was to forge a new earth mo weapon.</p><br/><p>It was not an accidental idea when he thought of using earth mo weapons to trade for the Reverse Shadow Soul Silkgrass. But now, he felt that this plan was far easier to realize than going to Nether Spring Jie himself.</p><br/><p>He was not an unknown person. No matter if it was Xiao Mo Ge or Xiao Yun Hai, both had status.</p><br/><p>If he could make a new earth mo weapon, there would be countless people that would search for Reverse Shadow Soul Silkgrass. The earth mo weapon that was peerless in value in the eyes of many people was just an object to Zuo Mo. It was profitable to trade it for Reverse Shadow Soul Silkgrass.</p><br/><p>If he, who had just forged the Sky Snake Ten Manifestation Spear, could forge a new earth mo weapon, his fame would reach an unprecedented height. At that time, his promise would be enough to drive people mad.</p><br/><p>After organizing his thoughts, the shadow over Zuo Mo\u2019s mind dissipated.</p><br/><p>Regardless if it was the old man or other people, his goal was the Reverse Shadow Soul Silkgrass. Other matters had nothing to do with him. He did not fear people finding him.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>In the dark of night, Ceng Lian\u2019er was dressed in bright red robes like a rose blooming in the night. Her movements were silent and she didn\u2019t even cause a ripple in the air as she appeared like a ghost in front of Qinghua Xue.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you? Why are you here?\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er who saw Qinghua Xue and asked serenely.</p><br/><p>Qinghua Xue felt her vision blur and then a figure appeared without warning in front of her.</p><br/><p>Her expression changed slightly. She was astounded but kept her expression calm. She asked back, \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ceng Lian\u2019er\u2019s eyes became blurry like a mist that floated in.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in to talk!\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s voice suddenly came from the room.</p><br/><p>Ceng Lian\u2019er\u2019s figure immediately disappeared from her spot.</p><br/><p>Shock finally came onto Qinghua Xue\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Qinghua Xue, I defeated her in the past. She was in the yao envoy and she recognized me so I decided to have her follow me to prevent her from going out and talking,\u201d Zuo Mo explained. Other people would not know but he was clear that Ceng Lian\u2019er really intended to kill her just now. If he had been a moment later in speaking, Qinghua Xue would probably be a corpse right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cI would not squabble with a little girl.\u201d An imperceptible smile flashed across Ceng Lian\u2019er\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>She spun, the long red dress blossoming as she elegantly sat in front of Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>Ceng Lian\u2019er was elegant and graceful in everything she did as though it was innate to her. A country bumpkin like himself could not copy it. Zuo Mo shook his head and threw this hilarious thought away. He then asked in concern, \u201cHow is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuccess!\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er said without any modesty. Her smile was like a flower, bright and eye-catching. \u201cMy bloodline has been perfected, and this would be of great benefit to my future cultivation. My shen power has grown by half!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s expression changed. For mo, their bloodline was the core of their power, and the spring of all their power. Reinforcing their core was tempting for every cultivator, and Zuo Mo gaped at her shen power growing by half.</p><br/><p>Even with his right hand that seemed to be a little shen crystal, he he would need about a year to grow half of his shen power without any other assistance.</p><br/><p>\u201cWorth! So worth it!\u201d Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t help but say excitedly.</p><br/><p>Ceng Lian\u2019er gave a small smile. Her eyes that seemed to forever be shrouded in mist flashed with emotion. Of course it was worth it. But what had been traded was an earth mo weapon!</p><br/><p>When she had heard that it would take an earth mo weapon, Ceng Lian\u2019er had given up on that set of White Ridge Snake Bones. That price was not something that she could afford. Even her father Ceng Yi, who was a jie master, would not be able to pay such a price.</p><br/><p>The person in front of her did not hesitate.</p><br/><p>This had nothing to do with love between man and woman. She suddenly understood why there would always be astounding geniuses gathered around Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng, Gongsun Cha, Bie Han \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Any of these people alone was a star, a blinding existence, but these outstanding geniuses were gathered closely around Zuo Mo. And for him, they were willing to die.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not notice Ceng Lian\u2019er\u2019s emotions. It was hard to disguise the joy on his face. \u201cGreat! You have come out of seclusion so I can rest my worries and forge earth mo weapons.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForge earth mo weapons?\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er had been in seclusion ever since she had gotten the White Ridge Snake Bones. She didn\u2019t know anything about what had happened. When she heard that Zuo Mo said he was going to forge earth mo weapons again, she couldn\u2019t help but be shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Zuo Mo nodded. He grinned and said, \u201cI thought of a wonderful idea. Use earth mo weapons to trade for Reverse Shadow Soul Silkgrass. This way, we don\u2019t have to go to Nether Springs Jie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrade earth mo weapons for Reverse Shadow Soul Silkgrass?\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er was stunned. She suspected that something was wrong with her hearing. \u201cDo we have other earth mo weapons?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the shock on Ceng Lian\u2019er\u2019s face, Zuo Mo was proud. He said with a snicker, \u201cWe can make more!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ceng Lian\u2019er was speechless. A moment later, her mouth turned into a smile. Zuo Mo\u2019s tone was casual when he spoke about forging earth mo weapons. While she was shocked, she did not doubt that Zuo Mo could accomplish this.</p><br/><p>Her gaze silently landed on A Gui. For some reason, a serene sigh sounded inside her, like a wisp of mist rising up and covering her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen are you going to start?\u201d She smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you are out of seclusion, then there is no time to day.\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s smile disappeared. His expression was solemn as he said, \u201cTomorrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed that the brutish bull didn\u2019t dare to fight me last time I visited.\u201d The old man grinned, his gaping mouth full of yellow teeth hard to look at.</p><br/><p>An youth appeared nearby, his tight clothing emphasizing the tall figure of the youth. He was lying in the air as though there was an invisible chair behind him. Half of his body was curled up in this invisible chair and his position looked strange.</p><br/><p>One hand was holding a plate piled high with blood grapes. The other hand was throwing blood grapes idly into his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare to fight Elder. I have come to eat and play.\u201d The youth said through a full mouth, \u201cHowever, Second Brother failed since Elder protected Xiao Mo Ge last time. This time, you seem to be interested in Xiao Yun Hai. Elder, leave us a path \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yun Hai? Haven\u2019t you come for Xiao Mo Ge?\u201d The old man picked at his ear. \u201cWhile I am old, and my hearing isn\u2019t as good, I am not immune to the nagging. Xiao Yun Hai is the crux to finding Xiao Mo Ge. My ears are getting callouses from hearing this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey hey, Elder, don\u2019t speak so straightforwardly. Let\u2019s discuss. Why are you squabbling with us juniors. Elders, name a price \u2026 \u2026\u201d the youth\u2019s tone was fast but his hands were even quicker yet the grapes on the plate seemed to be endless.</p><br/><p>The old man looked dryly at the youth. \u201cThe Mo Shen Temple have really set their hearts this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo so.\u201d The youth laughed. \u201cElder, you know that we are poor, don\u2019t have anything good. Don\u2019t ask too high of a price!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be modest. If I remember correctly, that Scab Fragrance Tree in your temple should be starting to scab now. This old man doesn\u2019t want a lot, five!\u201d The old man showed his yellowed teeth again with unscrupulousness.</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s body imperceptibly froze. A cold rush rose. The scab fragrance was one of the core secrets in the Mo Shen Temple. It was planted in a restricted part of the temple. Even the guards of the temple did not know of it. But this dirty old man knew it!</p><br/><p>\u201cElder, you really are wise and powerful! However, only five were produced, if you take all of them \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man snickered. \u201cTsk tsk, five? How come I heard it was eleven?\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s back immediately broke out in a cold sweat. He stared at the old man with a sharp gaze and said in a cold voice, \u201cElder, who are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: I should be in the middle of my trip home. Things might get back to a more regular schedule then.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

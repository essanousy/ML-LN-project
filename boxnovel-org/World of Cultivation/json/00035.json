But when he saw the pink little thousand crane, he wanted to faint.</p><br/><p>Could she not torment him\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo wanted to cry. But this situation wouldn\u2019t change based on his wishes, he could only adjust to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYe, it\u2019s so boring, let\u2019s play a game!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo wanted to reply with: \u201cGe really really isn\u2019t bored.\u201d But taking into account the other\u2019s strange fondness for \u201cfireworks\u201d, Zuo Mo was extremely calm and intelligent in returning \u201cI don\u2019t know how to play games.\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt he wasn\u2019t lying to the other. He really didn\u2019t know how to play games. Games, to him, it was so strange that it was like he didn\u2019t even know the word. His life, from the moment he opened his eyes, it was determined that he couldn\u2019t leisurely play games and live a life.</p><br/><p>But the other was very kind in not looking down at him and said: \u201cThat\u2019s alright, I\u2019ll teach ye.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo gave his last struggles: \u201cI\u2019m dumb and can\u2019t be taught.\u201d</p><br/><p>But, just like previous times, the other didn\u2019t give him any room to rebel. Consequently, Zuo Mo saw a string of about eight thousand characters of game rules. This time, Zuo Mo really fainted. Such difficulty, for someone like him who didn\u2019t like games, it really wasn\u2019t something he could complete. He only read a few words before deciding to give up. He persisted: \u201cI\u2019m really stupid!\u201d</p><br/><p>But considering that the probability of enraging the other was too high, he weakly added another sentence: \u201cHow about you find the simplest game?\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, what reached his hand was a set of game instructions about two hundred characters</p><br/><p>Hm, Zuo Mo\u2019s mind couldn\u2019t help but jump. Wasn\u2019t this a formation problem? He read it thoroughly again and finally was certain that this was really a formation problem.</p><br/><p>Formations was an area of systematic study. Zuo Mo, located in a small sect, naturally didn\u2019t have any experience. However, in some large sects, the disciples would learn formations. From the simplest Simple Ling Formation, to Yin Yang Formation, Compound formations and gradually increasing the difficulty. This was an extremely long process of study. To help disciples with learning, some xiuzhe skilled in formations had created a set of methods to learn formations. Included in the methods were all kinds of formation problems.</p><br/><p>Like corrections, fill in the blanks, optimization etc. There were many kinds. Over time, some xiuzhe enjoyed the process and were infatuated, creating even harder formation problems. Between many disciples, they used them as games.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo had never played this before and felt it was very interesting. The formations that were used were not complicated. Zuo Mo had learned them before. However, the problem was extremely tricky. He couldn\u2019t help but fall into thinking. The other seemed to know that he was thinking and didn\u2019t hurry him.</p><br/><p>Thinking for a long time, he didn\u2019t figure out anything.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo shook his head hard and recovered some clarity. He couldn\u2019t help but gape inside. Did those large sect disciples play like this? He couldn\u2019t help but admire them. No wonder they were so strong. Even the things they played with were this powerful.</p><br/><p>However, he decided to put this game down first. There were many things he still had to do. Games, it was fine to play when he had free time. In any case, that damned woman hadn\u2019t hurried him.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo went into the stone room to practice [Embryonic Breathing Spiritual Cultivation] and the gravestone version of [Vajra Profound Sutra].</p><br/><p>After cultivation, he took out the Water Drop sword from the ling spring. With the nourishment from the ling spring, its sheen was clearer than before. Zuo Mo caressed the Water Drop sword and then started to imprint it.</p><br/><p>One flying sword, it needed a long time to imprint it before it could move like a part of the body. And to have it move according to one\u2019s thoughts, the time needed was even longer. The flying sword was like a sword xiu\u2019s partner. The longer they were together, the more chemistry they had. Sword xiu wouldn\u2019t easily change a flying sword. This point, especially after reaching jindan, it was even more evident.</p><br/><p>These days that were spent imprinting it, he didn\u2019t waste his efforts. Right now, Zuo Mo could move the sword like it was a part of his body. It was of a higher grade than ice crystal sword and was even more nimble.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s mind moved and the Water Drop sword in his hand jumped into midair. At the same time, he gave a shout and jumped up from the ground.</p><br/><p>The sword flashed and moved easily.</p><br/><p>In mid air, a flame that seemed to be made out of water gave off a faint light. The places the sword passed, a stream of water flames burned silently.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo seemed to be drunk. Using the Water Drop sword to practice [Li Water Sword Scripture] , it was truly an experience. When he reached the peak of his enjoyment, Zuo Mo didn\u2019t follow the sword scripture anymore. The sword couldn\u2019t be detected as he moved, and the sword seemed to carry a few hints of the explosive li water sword essence in the calm, and it still spread like waves.</p><br/><p>The sword essence which had been light and wave-like, gradually turned heavier and pressuring. When it moved, it moved with great force. The explosiveness which had been barely perceivable started to burn like fire in the wind.</p><br/><p>Still as cool as before but containing a strong explosiveness. Those two conflicting feelings gathered together but Zuo Mo didn\u2019t seem to feel it and wasn\u2019t uncomfortable at all.</p><br/><p>On the Water Drop sword, the light fire-like sword energy gradually started to retreat inside.</p><br/><p>When Zuo Mo woke up from his epiphany, he finally realized, without him noticing, his [Li Water Sword Scripture] had went up a level.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t much joy. He stood there silently, finely savoring it.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t clear himself what level his [Li Water Sword Scripture]was at now. [Li Water Sword Scripture]wasn\u2019t some high level and profound scripture. Even its creator wasn\u2019t some powerful sword xiu. It was quite unusual that Zuo Mo could master a sword scripture like this to this level. However, Zuo Mo needed to explore the road ahead by himself, because the [Li Water Sword Scripture]that he had practiced ended here. Even though the creator had written some of his speculations and frameworks for the future, many of those had been rejected by Pu Yao.</p><br/><p>Based on profoundness, li water sword essence was far from the tidal sword essence Zuo Mo had secretly learned. However, this was Zuo Mo\u2019s own comprehension and the sword essence he had the greatest grasp on! His understanding of li water sword essence far surpassed tidal sword essence.</p><br/><p>Maybe, he could look and study tidal sword essence and change [Li Water Sword Scripture]. Zuo Mo\u2019s heart moved.</p><br/><p>But he only thought about it. He wasn\u2019t so proud to the point of changing a sword scripture. Also, his understanding of tidal sword essence was just a hair.</p><br/><p>At this time, he suddenly detected that someone was outside the valley. The person who was there was very docile and hadn\u2019t set off the jinzhi.</p><br/><p>Mouth of West Wind Valley.</p><br/><p>\u201cShixiong, Ling Ying Sect\u2019s people came again!\u201d The messenger was still the outer sect disciple that had come last time. However, there wasn\u2019t any of the fear that had been on his face last time, but excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey came again?\u201d Zuo Mo was dazed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d The disciple said respectfully. He couldn\u2019t disguise his excitement: \u201cThis time, five people came!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo instantly felt his scalp prickle.</p><br/><p>Five people\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Last time, three had come. Now this time, five people!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo wanted to turn and run.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey hadn\u2019t given up, and called to spar with Shixiong!\u201d This outer sect disciple completely didn\u2019t notice Zuo Mo\u2019s shift and said excitedly: \u201cThis group really doesn\u2019t know their own weight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough.\u201d Zuo Mo forced himself to come and swallowed. He asked: \u201cWho came this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe three from last time are all here, and two that I don\u2019t recognize.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s heart calmed down lightly. Good, good, at least, it wasn\u2019t that all five were people he didn\u2019t know. Two people who had lost to him. Hm, he had completely reason to disregard them. The woman, she hadn\u2019t dared to fight that day, so this time, she definitely wouldn\u2019t act rashly. The headache was those two that he didn\u2019t know. Since the others had come to settle the score, they certainly would be stronger than the last two.</p><br/><p>His mind turned quickly. Inside, he was very hesitant. Should he go or not? He was slightly regretful that he had said too much previously. He asked: \u201cWhere\u2019s the other shixiong? You can\u2019t bother just me every time with this kind of matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest Shixiong and Shijie are all outside. Luo Li Shixiong is in seclusion. Xu Yi Shixiong is forging and has ordered not to bother him. Hao Min Shijie is being punished. Only Xu Yi Xia Shijie is free. Should I notify her?\u201d</p><br/><p>That woman?</p><br/><p>Dislike instantly rose in his heart. Never mind. If she was notified, the probability that this woman would do something behind his back was very high.</p><br/><p>Fine! Thinking about the new comprehension he just got from [Li Water Sword Scripture], Zuo Mo was instantly full of confidence. He had just learned something, and some people just came over for him to test it on. This Ling Ying Sect really was full of good people!</p><br/><p>After thinking it through, Zuo Mo didn\u2019t retreat anymore. He nodded and said with great composure: \u201cGo.\u201d</p><br/><p>This outer sect disciple was instantly excited and hurried forward to led the way.</p><br/><p>When they reached the mountain gate, Zuo Mo instantly staggered when he saw the dense crowd.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are there so many people?\u201d</p><br/><p>This outer sect disciple was extremely excited: \u201cEveryone heard that Ling Ying Sect had come and all ran over to personally see Shixiong win and teach a lesson to Ling Ying Sect\u2019s new money!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, but why are there female disciples as well?\u201d Zuo Mo asked speechlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMust be coming to admire Shixiong\u2019s elegant demeanor!\u201d</p><br/><p>Goosebumps instantly rose over Zuo Mo\u2019s entire body.</p><br/><p>Seeing Zuo Mo come out, the crowd of female disciples shrieked. Zuo Mo almost tripped.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! Shixiong is so handsome!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease! It\u2019s called cool!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen Shixiong was in the outer sect, I knew then that Shixiong wasn\u2019t an average person!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally want to seduce him\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Large black lines fell over Zuo Mo\u2019s expressionless face. He decided to stay a bit further away from this crowd of crazy women.</p><br/><p>When Zuo Mo started walking towards the side with male disciples, the male disciples also expressed their emotions.</p><br/><p>\u201cShixiong, kill them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChop them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChop into eight pieces, cut of their hands and feet, pluck their tendons, break their channels, cut them up\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo uncreative! Have to sunflower\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo rapidly distanced himself from these people that were completely sunk in fighting spirit.</p><br/><p>In the short journey of travelling through the female and male disciples, Zuo Mo, who had been full of fighting spirit, almost became completely lacking in the desire to fight.</p><br/><p>Of course, in the eyes of everyone else, Zuo Mo Shixiong was stepping resolutely, with a cool expression, and extremely elegantly passing from their side.</p><br/><p>But when Zuo Mo saw the even worse expressions on the faces of the five people from Ling Ying Sect, his mood instantly became better.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: One more relaxing chapter.

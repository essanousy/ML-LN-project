Many people noticed this and, were curious about his past. Miao Jun\u2019s skill wasn\u2019t just theoretical, he was experienced, the kind of experiences that could not be obtained by just studying to be a battle general.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao had specialized lie-detecting yao arts and quickly identified the spies mixed within the crowd, techniques that broadened Zuo Mo\u2019s experiences.</p><br/><p>The Tangzi Battalion quickly formed its basic combat structure. The ones that had joined were mostly from small families and had some ability. Following Miao Jun\u2019s suggestions, Tang Fei did not recruit a large number of people but picked only the most outstanding.</p><br/><p>Compared with the other battalions, the Tangzi Battalion could only be said to be a small battalion of about eight hundred people.</p><br/><p>These eight hundred people were picked out from approximately a hundred thousand people.</p><br/><p>In terms of average individual power, they were much stronger than Ceng Lian\u2019er\u2019s Celestial Planet Guards. Xiao Mo Ge\u2019s present reputation was much more attractive to the experts than Ceng Yi\u2019s.</p><br/><p>What shocked Zuo Mo even more was that more than twenty general level mo had come to join him as well.</p><br/><p>This caused Zuo Mo to feel a bout of pride. Ge is now a major figure that could recruit general levels!</p><br/><p>There were seven battle generals among the twenty general levels and all of them were silver battle generals. This made Zuo Mo overjoyed. Right now, he did not lack for gold battle generals. Gongsun Cha, Bie Han, Miao Jun, and A Zha Ge, all of them could act by themselves. Gongsun Cha and Bie Han were top battle generals.</p><br/><p>But in a whole battalion, other than a powerful main commander, the intermediate level commanders were also very important. Especially when the battalions grew larger, more and more outstanding intermediate level battle generals were needed. Yet Zuo Mo lacked these intermediate level battle generals.</p><br/><p>When the additional manpower was accepted into the combat structure, Zuo Mo\u2019s power would undoubtedly go up another level.</p><br/><p>The stringent criteria for recruitment quickly spread between people.</p><br/><p>The people who had been watching were surprised.</p><br/><p>Who did this guy think he was? Even those marshal levels most likely couldn\u2019t compare to him! The people who had not passed the selection started to mock and furiously slandered Xiao Mo Ge. They all thought that they had strength, and it would be easy to be selected. However, they had been eliminated and they were filled with discontent.</p><br/><p>Xiao Mo Ge was so full of himself and so proud \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not pay attention to this. Since he had given the Tang Fei and Miao Jun permission to create the battalion, he did not interfere. He would never question the employed, and never employ the questionable [1]. Every commander\u2019s style was different, their way of fighting and their way of cultivation. The systematic teamwork that was required would be directed by Gongsun Cha.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo focused his time on his cultivation. He was progressing rapidly. He had benefited greatly from that hard battle against Marshal Yu. He needed a long time to digest these things. But once he did, his power would skyrocket.</p><br/><p>Luo Li and Ceng Lian\u2019er were also in the same state.</p><br/><p>The purple energy inside A Gui\u2019s body was growing daily at an astounding rate. It seemed as though that battle had suddenly opened a door in A Gui\u2019s body. Purple energy flooded out and right now, there was three times more purple energy inside A Gui\u2019s body compared to before!</p><br/><p>A Gui had become even stronger but Zuo Mo\u2019s worries increased.</p><br/><p>This strange shen power was a double-edged sword, harming the enemy meant harming oneself. However, Zuo Mo wasn\u2019t able to do anything. He could only suppress the urgency inside and focused even more on his cultivation. Maybe when he became stronger he could find the key to resolving the purple energy inside A Gui\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>His greatest improvement had come from the Ten Crow Celestial Domain.</p><br/><p>He had seen every detail of the completed Ten Crow Celestial Domain. Many areas that had been unclear before were now engraved in his mind so his improvement naturally sped up. Right now, he was just one step away from the completed state of the Ten Crow Celestial Domain. Other than his comprehension of the Ten Crow Celestial Domain, there was the great degree of maturation in his mo physique.</p><br/><p>The strange fragments of energy that had been formed from the creation and destruction of the Anti Dragon Claw\u2019s and Sun Shen Crystal\u2019s powers were the most primal power. They had strengthened Zuo Mo in all areas. Mo physique, spiritual consciousness, ling power, even his shen power, all of them had increased greatly.</p><br/><p>This was the most wondrous power that Zuo Mo had ever seen but when he thought of it, he found that it really was lucky. Both the Sun Crystal Seed and the Anti Dragon Claw were ultimate treasures of the world. Obtaining one would mean a person had great luck. Having obtained two at once, even Zuo Mo sighed in shock at his own luck.</p><br/><p>The mo matrix that had formed with the Anti Dragon Claw had become dim as the Anti Dragon Claw became silent and seemed to have gone into hibernation.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was slightly disappointed by the slumber of the Anti Dragon Claw. He had originally thought that he could carry this weapon around and dominate in all directions. Now his wish had gone up in smoke. However, it was good that he didn\u2019t need to carry such an enormous thing on his back. In Zuo Mo\u2019s sense of beauty, that thing was really ugly!</p><br/><p>The Three Thousand Threads of Worry did not change and now became the strongest weapon that Zuo Mo had.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt that he really didn\u2019t have enough time. There were all types of cultivation he could work on, but each one would take up a large amount of time.</p><br/><p>Just as Zuo Mo wanted to cut himself in half to get more work done, the black smoke yao ran over while appearing secretive.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Zuo Mo looked at the other\u2019s cunning face and muttered inside, did this guy do something bad again?</p><br/><p>Then he felt slightly puzzled. Zuo Mo would feel it was normal if it was the orange-haired yao doing this. But in his mind, the black smoke yao was usually calm, steady, and well behaved!</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, let me show you something.\u201d The black smoke yao lowered his voice and looked around.</p><br/><p>Had this guy really stolen something?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt even more puzzled. He took what the black smoke yao handed over. It was a little paper card with some words written on it. Zuo Mo looked with bewilderment at the black smoke yao and then skimmed through.</p><br/><p>When he saw the first phrase, he was stunned where he stood.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t much content on the paper card and he quickly finished reading it. Zuo Mo finally came out of his daze. Two spots of red made their way onto his cheeks. This expression would only occur in one circumstance \u2013Xiao Mo Ge had struck it rich!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe stele\u2019s text?\u201d Zuo Mo forced himself to be calm but his voice still went off-tune.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d The black smoke yao lowered his volume and said carefully, \u201cBoss, you know that I am weak. In order to stop Lin Qian and to create an opportunity for Big Orange and the others, I charged for the stele.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you remembered it?\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s voice was excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not so simple.\u201d The black smoke yao grimaced. \u201cI have a rare skill that not many know of, I have an eidetic memory. However, I only had a cursory glance as Lin Qian reacted too quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI recalled this event a while ago, and then I noticed I could recall some of the text on the stele. But it was all very blurry and I had to use [Memory Piecing Art] to slowly piece it together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMemory piercing art?\u201d Zuo Mo was slightly shocked. He had never heard of this yao art before.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao suddenly spoke, \u201cIt is a type of support yao art. It can replay past events in the mind like a puzzle coming together. It has the benefit of improving memory. When one reaches a high level, they will gain an eidetic memory and can browse their memories at any time. However, this kind of yao art is easy to learn but hard to master. It doesn\u2019t have any big uses. Only those old researchers would spend energy on things like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was very shocked. So there were yao arts like this.</p><br/><p>The black smoke yao was slightly embarrassed. \u201cMy talent is average. In order to help my cultivation, I cultivated the [Memory Piecing Art]. My eidetic memory only came about after I started cultivating this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the time has been short and I only got a short glance at the stele\u2019s text. My impression is very fuzzy but I still decided to try with the memory piecing art. This is the content that I have pieced together using the memory piecing art. It is not very complete and I\u2019m not sure if the content is accurate.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he talked about this, the black smoke yao was slightly embarrassed. He had gathered his courage for a long time before he had come to find Zuo Mo. He knew that the stele text was important but what he had pieced together was incomplete, and he didn\u2019t even dare to say that it was accurate.</p><br/><p>In cultivation methods, the difference of one character could cause a great misunderstanding. He didn\u2019t know if this thing he had was accurate and therefore have any value.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, just take a look, don\u2019t cultivate it!\u201d When the black smoke yao finished saying this, he felt his face flush. Before Zuo Mo could speak, he had run away.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo laughed. This black smoke yao seemed calm usually but he was truly adorable.</p><br/><p>His gaze landed quickly on the little card in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are some mistakes but the general parts seem correct.\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s voice was filled with excitement. \u201cSo that is how it is! So that is how it is!\u201d</p><br/><p>In comparison, Wei was much calmer. \u201cNot bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two quickly picked out the mistakes on the paper. Of the two, one was an old yao that was thousands of years old, the other came from an ancient tribe, and their knowledge was not something that Zuo Mo could rival.</p><br/><p>As expected, Zuo Mo found that the places in the content where he had felt that it was rough were now much clearer.</p><br/><p>Shi Zi Ming had not tried to shroud this in mystery.</p><br/><p>The few phrases caused Zuo Mo to see a whole new world.</p><br/><p>Almost unconsciously, the shen power in Zuo Mo\u2019s body started to move!</p><br/><p>This time, there was no delay. When his thought formed, his shen power would follow.</p><br/><p>A strange feeling formed!</p><br/><p>His spiritual consciousness spread from the dantian in his head, while the dantian in his abdomen was unusually active. Threads of ling power spread happily from his abdomen and flowed endlessly along his channels. The power grew like branches from the main channels and innervated every inch of blood and flesh.</p><br/><p>Ling power, spiritual consciousness, and mo physique formed a complex and gigantic system.</p><br/><p>A phrase from the paper card flowed across Zuo Mo\u2019s mind and he suddenly had an epiphany.</p><br/><p>He finally understood what the key to the loss of shen power was!</p><br/><p>The origin of spiritual consciousness was the head. The power was formed from the inside, from the soul and then released. The mo physique was the exact opposite. Power originated from the physical body and the power went from the outside to the inside. Ling power was the bridge between the two. It was formed in the dantian and spread throughout the body by the channels. It permeated the blood and flesh, but also into the soul.</p><br/><p>When this system became clear in Zuo Mo\u2019s mind, his body suddenly shook.</p><br/><p>The three powers began circulated unconsciously. They joined together but they were also clearly divided.</p><br/><p>As they continued to circulate, shen power formed.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s body reached a state of harmony. Each power went about their own duties but they were of one mind, one existence. He felt he was stronger than he had ever been!</p><br/><p>His body was like the universe!</p><br/><p>Full of life, and immortal!</p><br/><p>A strange emotion filled his mind.</p><br/><p>It was not the strength of his power, but the harmony of his body and soul was powerful as one!</p><br/><p>Editor\u2019s notes:</p><br/><p>[1] I think this is a reference to famous work, I want to say it is a line spoken by CaoCao in \u201cRomance of the Three Kingdoms\u201d.</p><br/><p>Also, does anyone think that A Gui\u2019s purple energy grows with how strong Zuo Mo gets? He powers up, she gets worse. Clearly a connection.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Yes, you were all correct, how could that knowledge get lost?</p><br/>\n</div>"}
